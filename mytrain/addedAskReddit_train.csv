A_BIG_MEAN_DOG,,,"way back in 2006, stephen hawking decided (in his infinite wisdom), to ask a question of great importance to that all-knowing font of wisdom, yahoo answers. he wanted to know [""In a world that is in chaos politically, socially and environmentally, how can the human race sustain another 100 years?""](https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20060704195516AAnrdOD)

it was a really dumb question in that it was just his way of trying to force the answer of ""we need to go to space, earth is doomed"" without being intellectually honest enough to admit that his question is incredibly complicated and has a bunch of answers that sociologists, geographers, historians, economists, etc. have been thinking and writing about for years and years and years.

hawking didn't want answers from that crowd. he was trying to convince people that we need to go to space or die out.

A woman came in about mid 30's with a little boy with her. She was in tears and her clothes were torn a bit. She came up and asked to use the phone. When she got off without getting an answer, she asked to stay here for a bit. I told her it would be no problem. About 20 mins goes by and I wound up giving her and her kid free drinks and one of the sandwiches we have on the hot rack. 
She was in the store for about 30 mins until her ""boyfriend"" came in and found her and her kid. He was pretty calm at first but then started screaming at her and telling her she needs to come with him. Luckily before anything crazy happened, a cruiser pulls up to the front and two cops come in and interveined. He was arrested right there. I guess he had been beating her in front of her kid and she was trying to run away. I'm glad I got to keep her away from harm for at least a little bit.  Was a scary night!

Yst,,,"Just about to hit eight years of posting on the site, and what I'll say is this:  
  
I would say that the tremendous cynicism regarding the voice of the community itself would be the biggest change.  Complaints regarding ""circlejerks"" or ""brigading"" or the ""hivemind"" or whatever broader conspiracy seem to afflict every thread.  And there is a tendency for *both sides* in any contentious argument to construe the other as the predominating (but implicitly asinine) opinion which heads up this conspiracy.  
  
It seems as if, in any controversial discussion, more posters are occupied with the business of constructing a vision of the opposing opinion as a brainwashed mass of propagandist zombies than in fact occupy themselves in the business of establishing or arguing for their position itself, or even arguing directly against the opposing position.  
  
I suppose it's what you call ""drama"".  In the sense that the argument ceases to be an argument in any formal sense, and instead becomes an attempt to create a narrative and a staging and a personification for the opposing players in the argument.  The net effect is that realpolitik goes completely by the wayside, to the extent that neither side is arguing about the original subject at all, but rather merely dramatising the argument itself and attempting to shift perceptions regarding its players.

Acyts,,,"The stuff that happened when my sister was ill. She had severe anorexia. Under 4 stone. She was also a drug addict. I'm 4 years younger than her and was left to care for her most of the time. At 13 I had to calmly talk her out of killing herself. Deal with her when she was so fucked and freaking out that she would try to kill me. Make sure her heart didn't stop as the drugs and anorexia individually could have killed her, but the combination was definitely scary! On Valentine's Day I wrote her three cards and did different hand writings. I'm pretty sure she knows it was me or that it was family at least but at the time it made her happy. 

7 years later and she barely speaks to me. When she does she is mostly rude to me and very critical of the way I live my life. It's very sad for me as I am currently having a hard time and have no one to turn to.

On_Too_Much_Adderall,,,"Stripper here. 

I am a topless stage dancer and do live nude private shows as well. I'm a licensed independent contractor, with an adult entertainment permit from the Police dept, and prostitution is illegal here - which is a rule I follow - so I'm not sure if what I do qualifies as ""sex work."" However, I figured it was relevant enough, haha.

I've been doing this for a year, and there are several types of customers that I see most often.

1. Dudes that expect a free show. VERY common. They sit away from the stage, almost never tip any of the dancers, and when you talk to them they say things like ""I don't pay for pussy"" or ""I'd like to take you on a REAL date"" or ""When do you get off work?"" Uh... hello, why are you at a strip club, then?

2. Drunk-and-or-on-drugs college kids. They sometimes have money, but you can never tell. Some are trust fund babies and others can barely pay the $10 cover to get in. They're obnoxious and some are dicks, but admittedly their shenanigans are lolworthy.

3. Bachelors. They usually come on a party bus with a group of at least 10 people and all their friends chip in a show for just the one dude, and so one lucky girl makes $1000 while everybody else sits there waiting for the show to end.

4. Guys that drag in their jealous girlfriend. Of course, I'm all for doing a couples' show if the girl is in, but if I can tell she really doesn't want to be there, it's uncomfortable for me. My point is to entertain - not to create tension between a couple. I care about all my customers and want them to have a good time.

5. Wannabes. Hats with stickers, fake gold chains, and sunglasses indoors are their trademarks. They wave a wad of $1's around making sure everyone can see how gangsta they are. In reality, though, the $30 they have in $1s is all they actually have and they're gonna need to walk home because they spent all their money and can't get a cab. I don't really mind them because they're not hurting anyone. They're just a bit obnoxious.

6. Crackheads that either ask me to buy drugs, or offer me drugs. I'm cool with them, because well hey free drugs, and plus they do random hilarious shit. (Example: One rolling guy paid me $40 to wave a glowstick in his face for 5 minutes.)

7. Perverts. The ones that think you can fuck somebody in the private room, try to touch you even when you tell them it's against the rules, or say really inappropriate/strange things (Examples, actually said to me: ""You have nice labia"" and ""can I smell your butt?) They are really the only customers I can't stand, and will actively avoid. 

8. Rich guys. Usually businesspeople. They sit quietly and **don't** flaunt their money. If you can charm them, without making it obvious you're hustling, they're the ones that will drop the most cash of all. They're usually very respectful to the dancers, too, and I try to give them the best shows. (Actually I really just give more intimate shows to anyone who is respectful. How a customer behaves towards me, matters more than the money.

9. Finally, the ones I'm happiest to see. They're the dudes who come into the club with a big smile, run up to me and say hi. They almost never request dances - but are the most interesting to talk to, and are like my buddies. They know my game, I know that, so I never try to hustle them. They rarely spend large amounts of money, but will occasionally give me, like, $20, for no reason - and not ask for a dance simply because they know I'll appreciate surprise cash monies without having to do anything. I care about all my customers, but these are my favorites - because I can tell they're genuinely kind people with a good heart.

In all honesty I really enjoy about 98% of my customers. Those few that are really big dicks are the minority compared to my cool clients.

She just got up and screamed ""I'm calling the police!"" before dashing through the kitchen towards the phone. He followed her and grabbed two knives from the counter while her back was turned. I must have been around 12 at the time, but the moment I saw him grab the knives I lunged at him and latched myself onto his leg to slow him down, this alerted her to the issue of him running towards her with a pair of knives and she bolted out the front door to the neighbors. He simply stopped at the front door and after several moments I followed my mother to the neighbors. About five minutes later my little brother showed up as well.

We're going over the human body and digestion one day and teacher decides to throw Danny an easy question out to boost him up a bit. She asks him how we get liquid into our bodies.  Danny sits there with a blank look and says ""I don't know"". She prompts him again by asking how he gets liquid into his body when he's thirsty. Danny replies, ""I don't know.""

Through your skin, maybe?""

I was a youth advisor in a summer program aimed at getting first generation high school kids prepped for college, and it was my summer job while in college. She fell out right before we hit a series of rapids. I rushed over from my seat and popped her back into the raft just before hitting the lip of the rapid. After I got her back into the raft, I didn't get to my seat in time and didn't get fully secured and wound up in the water. I went through a series of seven rapids back to back, nearly drowned, saw the bright white light, had my life flash before my eyes, and gave up trying to live and embraced that I was about to die.

m0untaingoat,,,"Barista here. We had a Narcotics Anonymous convention in town once. I had someone order a 16oz cup with as much espresso as would fit.

A lady regularly asks for a cup of regular coffee with a large spoonful of butter stirred in. We do breakfast sandwiches on bagels and croissants, and a businessman with a group of his colleagues had ham/egg/cheese, but he wanted it on a chocolate croissant. I think my favorite incident, though, was a lady that wanted a latte with half nonfat and half soy, a triple shot with one regular shot, one decaf shot, and one half-caff shot, heated to a specific temperature, double-cupped, one Splenda an one Equal stirred into the shots. The works, basically. The guy behind her thought it was as ridiculous as I did, and he loudly asked for a ""mocha bullshit drink"" with one third goat's milk, one third cashew milk, and one third giraffe milk, cooled with a chip of ice from a Norwegian glacier and topped with nutmeg and gold flake. Then he said, ""wait, is your giraffe milk fair trade? Ok never mind then, I'll just have a cup of coffee."" He still comes in; I love that guy.

Godsownsin,,,"Ohhh yes. It's my time to shine

Let me set the backround.

The year is 2010. Me and my ex, along with my family take a trip to D.C. to go visit all the monuments and what not. Now, We go to the zoo and have a great time, check out all the primates, and just kinda fart around for a bit. Well, Lunchtime hits. So, we head out to the streets of D.C. to find something good to eat. 

We come across a place called California Tortilla. I've never eaten there before, but my brother tells me it is delicious, so we decide to give it a try. Boy was he right. That was one of the best damn burritos I've ever had in my entire life. 

Fast forward to around 4 p.m. 

Everyone is getting kind of tired, and ready to head back home. So, we make our way towards the metro. Well, this was a workday, so we get on the metro around 4:30 and it is slam packed. 
I feel like we live in Japan, with how crowded the train car is. 

As the train starts to take off, I feel my stomach grumble with great intensity. I begin to giggle, because I know what that grumble means. Now, I'm standing, and holding onto one of the poles alongside probably 35 other people. I'm thinking to myself ""This is going to be deadly"", but I can't hold it in any longer.

I proceed to lift my leg a bit, so the fart comes out silent. 
Ahhhhh, sweet relief. This was like a 10 second long, ass-hair burning fart. I try to compose myself, but with my brother staring at me, It is becoming harder and harder to contain my laughter. 

Almost instantly, everybody starts simultaneously sniffing, and exclaiming ""WHAT THE HELL IS THAT SMELL??"". 

VICTORY!.......but wait...

A little girl starts to cry, and then all out bawl. 

What I didn't know, is that there was a poor little girl, with her nose about ass level, directly behind me. I just sprayed this poor girl with my Lunchtime burrito. At this point, I'm just dying with laughter on the inside (I know, I am the devil).

The greatest part of this whole thing, Was that as soon as we hit our next stop, the ENTIRE train car dispersed. Not a single person stayed on that car.

RamsesThePigeon,,,"I was in fourth grade, and my class had been assigned to write one book report every month. That would have been no problem for me - voracious reader that I was - except for the fact that my teacher had a tendency to ban every author that I enjoyed. As such, I was not allowed to read any of the following:

R.L. Stine    
Bruce Coville    
Victor Appleton    
Franklin W. Dixon    
J. R. R. Tolkien    
James Blish    
Alan Dean Foster    

... and a few more that I can't remember at the moment.

This mandate left me with precious few choices, I felt... and everything that was recommended to me seemed like it would be about as interesting as watching grass die. As a form of protest, I wound up writing an incredibly long-winded essay about a book that featured absolutely everything that I found entertaining, from spaceships to magic to criminal capers and beyond. 

My class *loved* the report.

My teacher, not so much... and although I got a passing grade on it, I was also told that I'd have to report on *real* books in the future.

jaeldi,,,"There would be not as many unwanted children. If there was no pleasure, then people would only choose to do it when they wanted to make a child. No one would masturbate. 

Also advertisement would be VERY different if sex didn't sell. So would music videos and a lot of the performing arts, like dancing. Human beauty would still be pleasurable, just not sexually pleasurable.

Nudity would mean nothing. 

Touching would mean something very different, both between sexes and with the same sex. Just comforting and kind. Camaraderie. 

Sex crimes would be different. I don't imagine there would be any pedophilia or peeping toms or stalkers or creeper type offenses but there would still be rape. Rape would probably still be a power trip. Making someone else take your seed or child against their will.

There probably wouldn't be any gay people. Nor any straight people. No sexuality or sexual identity. Sometimes single people, pairs, and groups of people who have children, some choosing to raise them others choosing to help make a child then not spending time with the child. So I imagine the word marriage would mean something very different. And by association, we wouldn't care as much if a woman acted 'manly' or if a man acted 'feminine'. So our conception of gender would be altered too.

Since child breeding would become logical, I think a whole new class of egotistical men would happen. The Fabio's, Neil Degrasse Tyson's, Stephen Colbert's and Brad Pitts of the world would have jobs where they just impregnate women for a fee. These men would be pretty/handsome, strong, and smart. This would be the new prostitution, selling yourself for sex. There would be a few women doing it, but since they can only have one every nine or so months, I think there would be more male prostitutes. And more forever alone men, men just with no logical reason to mate with. They aren't smart, aren't kind, don't have any real useful skill, aren't beautiful. They wouldn't feel sexually lonely, just companion lonely so they would probably band together with other undesirables both male and female and some would still procreate out of spite towards the egotistical vanity class. This would have a very very different effect on the evolution of man as a species.

It's not like the coups you see in other countries. Secondly, yes, technically it's every two years with Congress. Also, the notion that ""nothing really changes"" is very naive. For instance, the world would be very different today if McCain won in 2008, for better or for worse.

ThingsUponMyHead,,,"It was a devastating day. Imagine a day where everything is going normal. And all of a sudden the news comes on stating that one of the WTC has been hit by a plane. They think it was an accident but just then a camera man catches the second plane slamming into the the second. Youre standing there paralyzed by shock thinking ""what the fuck just happened. This didn't just happen. No way this is happening, its a nightmare and I'll wake up soon."" But you don't. You're still standing there. You finally muscle up enough strength to turn your head to the right just a tad, to the 15 other people in the room watching and that's when it happens. The silence that was so quiet that you could hear your own heart beat is broken to the sounds of one crying out ""Oh my god."" You look back to the screen showing where once a beautiful masterpiece of humanities achievements once stood. Confused at first you start piecing it together that the tower crumbled killing all those who were unfortunately still stuck inside. And then you witness those on the other towers jumping out of the building and to their death because they know this is it. This was how they die. They don't get to grow old with their significant other and have kids, they die here. Either now or in a few minutes when tower 2 crashes down. You see them hesitate before jumping, knowing that their life was flashing before their eyes. And then, they're off. A shrieking scream inside your head as you say to yourself, ""Ho-ly shit."" And then it happens again. The steal beams give out and the tower slowly falls. Time has slowed down now. Seconds turn to minutes, minutes to hours, hours to lifetimes. All that's running through your mind is that there are still so many inside that never had the chance to say ""I love you"" one last time to their loved ones. And once its done and over work is evacuated. Your told to go home grab your kids and loved ones. And you do, you pick your kid up from preschool who has no clue what's going on, you say ""I love you"" over and over again once for every person who didn't make it out. The last thought before you go to that night is that it started out as a normal Monday morning.

hateboss,,,"**Warning: If you are looking for funny, you won't find it here. This is irony in the cruel, depressing sense**






This probably won't be seen (4 hours in) and I can't say that I will really care. Writing this out is my therapy.




I just found out about an hour ago, that my Step-Mother was diagnosed with a very rare, lethal disease. While she isn't my mother, she is the closest thing to a ""mom"", that I have ever had. Recently, at age 60, she has begun to rapidly deteriorate mentally. 




This isn't funny, but it is most certainly painful irony. She is easily the most brilliant person I know and she was just diagnosed with Pick's Disease, a very rapid and lethal cousin of Alzheimer's, which typically presents earlier in life than Alzheimer's. Patients can typically expect a lifespan of about 2-10 years after initial diagnosis.




This is a woman who has used her brain more than most of our greatest scientific minds would if they had centuries. She has battled social and cultural norms her whole life, as well as a defeating a very rare form of cancer.









She was born in raised in Belarus. While living there, she was exposed to the fallout from the Chernobyl meltdown, from which, she developed an extremely rare form of cancer. The name escapes me but that form of cancer was rare enough that we had doctors from some of the finest medical institutions in the Boston area fighting each other to work her case.






She was one of the first women allowed to leave the former USSR independently. She did so as a teacher, first teaching in Japan, under the caveat that in exchange for letting her go abroad, she had to report back to the KGB about daily activity in Japan from her perspective.




Just as careful to keep her body as sharp and maintained as her mind, she was an impressive athlete as well. She qualified for Olympic Trials for the Russian Speed Skating team, in the end falling just short of making the team. She swam 5 miles in the Atlantic ocean, every day, summer or winter, until the cancer and corresponding treatment made this everyday task impossible for her.




Ever the consummate academic, she strove and persisted in her studies, ultimately earning 3 PhDs in fields related to theology and philosophy. THREE PhDs... most people spend their whole life earning just one.




She is also a very distinguished polyglot, boasting the ability to speak 13 different languages, though most of them are related to Slavic/Russian languages, she still was fluent in Spanish, English and French as well. When she wasn't teaching, she would supplement her time by translating, whether it be corporate documents, or an episode of The Simpsons for Russian television.





She taught at many fine colleges in the Boston area: Brown, BU, BC, the list goes on. While teaching, she underwent treatment for her very rare form of cancer. Out of fear that she would be fired if the college's ever caught wind of her disease, she would go to teach class a day after receiving her chemo treatments, wearing a wig so as to keep no one the wiser. If anyone has ever undergone, or known someone who has undergone chemo, it takes a serious physical and mental toll on a person. To get up the next day and teach Theology at an Ivy League institution, is nothing short of super-human.




But in the end, she beat the cancer, the cancer she received from one of the greatest man-made disasters ever recorded, an event so large, the scale of destruction will likely never be realized.





But now, the most brilliant, intelligent and hard working person I know, will succumb to a disease that destroys the mind. I'd like to think that the fragile structure of our human shells couldn't contain her brilliance. But in the end, it just seems like cruel irony.




I learned about this an hour ago, while I am working with a client in a metal fabricator in another country, to test their equipment. I didn't know what to tell my father. I felt myself grasping and reaching for breath and words. In front of the client, I tried to keep it together. I felt like I was fine, rock solid, fending off a flurry of punches from a persistent boxer, but every now and then, a deafening blow would land. The emotion and pain would surge up, I'd fight back the tears, and continue on with our testing. Every now and then, another wave will crash down on me and I'm just trying to keep my head above the water. 




Luckily, lunch just hit and I ran out to buy a pack of cigarettes (I don't even smoke really), smoked a butt and then broke down in my car. I cried... a lot... and I am a very ugly crier.




I'm not sure what to do, what to say, but most of all I just feel lost. I don't know how to help myself or even more importantly, my father.




The world will be a much colder, darker place without your brilliance Helena, I will miss you.




Edit: I want to thank everyone for your support! It really does mean a lot to me. I'm barely keeping it together and I feel utterly lost. Helena was there for me whenever I needed a ""mom"". She never doubted me, never pushed me and never judged me for my faults. It's truly devestating to know that the most caring, intelligent and compassionate person I know will rapidly begin to lose all of those characteristics that made her amazing, not because I have to go through that loss, but because she does.




Thank you all again, it really means the world to me to see this compassion.




I'm an aspiring writer and I feel that it would be a shame if I couldn't write about her. I'm willing to devote the rest of my time with her to put down on record, what an amazing human we will be losing.

abitofananomaly,,,"I just posted this on another sub, but this fits perfectly.  Don't read this if you are eating. 

My then-boyfriend and I had just gotten back to my house from eating Thanksgiving dinner with my family. The rest of the family had other places to go, so the two of us had the place to ourselves. I was extremely full and would have been content to submit to the turkey coma, but my ex was feeling frisky. I wasn’t really in the mood, but I was feeling generous because of the holiday. I figured my best option was to blow him. It would make him happy, and it wouldn’t have to last very long. This was a mistake.

Now, he and I had the understanding that if I was giving head, I was in control. As long as I’m in charge, I can control my gag reflex and everyone is happy. There would be no thrusting or head shoving unless I gave permission. Anyway, I’m going down, doing my thing, and everything is going pretty well. He’s into it, and based on audio cues I can tell that this isn’t going to be a marathon session.

Then it happens. Without warning, he grabs me by the hair and starts shoving my head down. Before I can react, I’m gagging uncontrollably and I start to feel Thanksgiving dinner make its way back up my esophagus. A tiny wave of vomit makes it’s way into my mouth, and he immediately starts to cum (think warm puke surrounding his dick). He lets go of my head, finally, and I’m trying to get my shit together and swallow both jizz and vomit before he notices. He’s moaning about how it’s best cum ever. At about that moment, I give up my losing battle. I throw up sperm, turkey, and all the fixings everywhere. There are bodily fluids all over the floor, his clothes, and his junk. Once he comes back from bliss and realizes what happened, he SYMPATHY VOMITS ALL OVER ME.

We just kind of stared at each other in shock for a moment. I’m in tears, covered in puke and shame. When he breaks the silence, ya know what he said to me?

“That was REALLY hot. We should do it again.” ……

For the (short) remainder of our relationship, he would try to get me to puke every time I went down on him, and then he would also try to puke.  He could only throw up if I did first. So he would take me out to dinner, try to get me to eat more than I should, then he would try to get me to blow him. It only happened on one other occasion before I noped out of that relationship, but it was not nearly as much puke, and I definitely bit his dick when I realized what he was doing. It’s now a fetish of his.

kevms,,,"Teacher here. A couple points...

1)Standardized testing has its flaws, but it's here to stay. Unless you can come up with a better way to make sure that teachers and principals and schools are up to par instead of doing whatever they want, standardized testing is what we have. The two schools in which I've taught are in MUCH better shape than they were before standardized testing was implemented. This is purely anecdotal, but I bet on average, schools have gotten much better since we've had standardized testing.

2) Teaching students about money: we already do this. Can it be ""better""? Sure. But there's a bigger elephant in the room: students need to give more of a shit (and parents need to keep their kids more accountable), whether they think it's relevant to their lives or not. Seriously, guys, it doesn't matter HOW relevant you make the curriculum, students still won't give a shit. I've taught my students about taxes, rent, credit cards, salaries, etc, and you know what students say? ""I'm just gonna live with my mom."" or ""I'm just gonna be a soccer player."" Teenagers will find any excuse to NOT need to learn something. If we teach something that is crucial for engineers to know, ""I'm not gonna be an engineer when I grow up."" If we teach them how to do taxes, ""I'm gonna hire someone to do my taxes for me."" High school is GENERAL EDUCATION, meaning MOST people won't use what they learn in high school in a direct way. Hell, I don't even use 98% of the stuff I learned, but I'm doing fine. It's not nearly as much about curricula as it is about motivation.

If he wants cheap, he needs to *actually* learn to shop/budget/cook.

cndr,,,"My grandfather died when I was ten of an aneurysm, caused by falling and hitting his head, bleeding into his brain. It was really rough on our whole family. He was my mom's father, and my dad's parents were both gone by the time I was a year old. So that left my grandmother as my only surviving grandparent. She was having a really horrible time dealing with it- she stopped eating, cried a lot, didn't leave the house very much. So within a few months we made our basement into an in-law suite for her, and she moved in with us. 

I had nothing but wonderful, fun memories of my grandparents, so I expected a nonstop party. Well, living with my grandmother wasn't fun. I love having personal space and alone time, and she was constantly around. She's also... not extremely bright. We really didn't have anything in common and that led to an inability to relate to each other. I got so irritated with her constant questions and nagging and presence that I just stopped talking to her unless I had to. I stayed in my room all the time because she always occupied the first floor. My parents complained that I was antisocial. I would have loved to enjoy the space of my own goddamn house- I just felt like I couldn't. The guilt made me hate myself but I didn't know how to fix it. Long story short: I wasn't as nice as I should have been. 

She had been living with us for a few years when the gilding-incident occurred. My mom is the middle child between her two sisters, both of whom are kind of... inconsiderate, to say the least. They really don't bother with their mother. My parents were out of town one week and my mom's younger sister was supposed to take her mom to see a show or something. But when Grandmom was driving me home from school, she mentioned that my aunt had been really rude with her all day on the phone. She was so excited for the show up until then, and she sighed, ""I don't like when she treats me that way. I don't even want to go now."" And that would not fucking stand.

I went upstairs and closed and locked my bedroom door, dialed my aunt, and waited for her to pick up. Then I went to fucking war.

Basically I told her that she needed to be nicer to her mother because *what the ever-loving hell makes you want to snap at the woman who gave you life.* She got pretty pissed at me and at one point I almost regretted calling her. My aunt started to go off on me about how ""YOU are not going to talk to ME about being mean to grandmom,"" but after the shame passed I collected myself and told her to quit turning the situation around on me, quit being a bitch and just be nice to her mother for one fucking night. I had to live with her 24/7. She huffily agreed and hung up, leaving me stinging with guilt and feeling like a failure.

It wasn't two minutes later that Grandmom knocked on my door with the biggest smile on her face. ""Cndr, Aunt __ just called me! She was as nice as could be! I don't know what happened."" The relief almost made me cry laughing. I told her that was wonderful and that I had homework to do, but I would be downstairs to spend some time with her soon.

I wish I could say that was the end of me being distant with her. It wasn't, unfortunately. I was an angsty preteen then, and became an angstier teenager. It wasn't awesome, but eventually she moved to a retirement village where she lives now. She loves it there, and we seem to get along much better when we aren't in close quarters all the time.

IxJAXZxI,,,"When I was about 11 or 12 I was going through my pyromaniac stage.  One Saturday, I decided I would grab a steel can and fill it with Gasoline and head to the woods.  Now, this wasnt just your typical ol' can of spegetti-O's, this was a 1 gallon bulk sized can...filled to the brim.  I took it to the woods and decided it would be cool just to light it on fire and see what would happen.  I lit it and it caught like I expected and kept burning inside the can.  After about 15mins I got bored and went to try and put it out.  In the process, I knocked the can over spreading gasoline all over the forest floor and it erupted in a ball of flame.  I quickly ran back to my house to get water and I come running back with about 5 gallons.  By this point the fire had spread tremendously and my efforts were useless.  I decided my best bet would be to run inside and play video games.  Luckily this spot in the woods was pretty good ways away from my parents house so it didnt draw my parents attention immediately.  After about an hour or so, the entire fire department is on scene battling the 3-4acres of forest fire that is roaring.  There was a road that runs behind my house and the fire basically engulfed all of the forest separating my parents house and this road.  This road is notorious for drug dealers and meth houses.  While the firefighters are trying to battle the flames, it is discovered that the house closest to the fire is a rather large cook house and cops show up and a huge bust goes down.  Naturally, the fire was blamed on them and my parents just accepted that.

Shenanigan-ary,,,"I was a male ""on-call"" stripper for five years. I didn't work in clubs, and booked by word of mouth and online adverts. Do women get stupid and want to service you? Absolutely. They're drunk and it seems preprogrammed in their brains that every man in the world wants them. I know a few female strippers, and they're amazed with what women try to get away with because they're women. I've had women grab my little guy, tug it, dive at it with their mouth, and try to jam their dirty ""white girl wasted"" fingers up my ass. Were there blow jobs? Yes. So many blow jobs. But the thing is, you aren't there for you, you're there for the client. You bust it, the fun dies. Imagine what you feel like after rubbing one out after watching porn, then think about that, but with 10-20 women trying to touch it. 

I slept with a lot of brides, bridesmaids, mothers, etc. When I look back, it was a really good way to earn money. I would make easy $1,000 a night for a few hours. Free alcohol made it so much better, and you were either going to a very nice house, or a very nice hotel.

OhGodDammitPope,,,"I'd been watching free porn since puberty. It was always a disappointing 5 minute clip versus the 20 minute feature length production. I'd never dared pirating because it was the early 2000's and I thought that downloading porn was basically the fastest route to infecting my computer with alllllllllll sorts of horrible things. So this was it. This was finally going to be the day!!!

My credit card was *my* credit card. For the first time, my parents had nothing to do with it. My internet connection was *my* internet connection, and if Johnny Questioning Guy called my direct line to alert someone that a porn video had been purchased I could just say, ""That is correct sir! I am an adult and I chose to do so!"" and we could share a moment in understanding that life is fucking great.

I took a moment and made sure to choose just the right video. I checked all the previews, as I had so many times before, but this time instead of doing it in order to get off I was being selective. Now I wasn't begging, but rather **they** were **auditioning**! That's right, the tables had turned! Now I was the one with all the power!

After considerable deliberation, I made my decision. I purchased my pornographic video and downloaded it! Then I knew the stars had aligned just for me. I locked the door, drew the curtains, and turned the lights to a perfect dim. The ambiance was in place. I busted out the lube, not the cheap spit nor the cooking oil I tried that one time, but actual lube. This wasn't just jerking off. This was **love**.

theboy1der,,,"This comes as a particularly sensitive question today.
We got word that a family friend, an older man, confirmed bachelor, shot himself in the chest a few days ago. His sister/roommate found him the next afternoon. He didn't die immediately, but curled up in his bed and covered himself up and waited. Seems like a pretty hopeless and drawn-out way to die. 

I like what David Foster Wallace had to say on the subject. It seems pretty relevant today:

&gt;The so-called ‘psychotically depressed’ person who tries to kill herself doesn’t do so out of quote ‘hopelessness’ or any abstract conviction that life’s assets and debits do not square. And surely not because death seems suddenly appealing. The person in whom invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise. Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire’s flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It’s not desiring the fall; it’s terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling ‘Don’t!’ and ‘Hang on!’, can understand the jump. Not really. You’d have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling.


EDIT: Welp - suicide comment becomes my most popular ever. That figures. Thanks everybody!
Anyway - I want to be clear. I can absolutely not relate to any of this. I have never felt a suicidal urge. That's why I thought DFW's words were interesting (In truth, I've never read anything else by him). It's a completely foreign concept to me, and this analogy helped me think on the subject beyond the typical ""It's selfish"" or ""What about your loved-ones"", or ""permanent solution to a temporary problem"" narratives.

I had a lovely family. A man, his wife, and one beautiful baby girl. They lived a blissful middle-class life in a suburban two-story home - wealthy enough to hire a nanny, but not wealthy enough that they could stop working. 

One day, while the baby was left at home with the nanny, a fire started. The nanny was heating up a bottle of milk and forgot about it. By the time they got home, the whole house was in flames - and nanny and baby both were gone.

The ensuing weeks were trying. Their home was haunted by the spirit of their departed child. Every time they walked by the kitchen they'd see her and weep. 

The loss of their child forced husband and wife to realize how estranged they had become. Every conversation was an argument or an insult. 

And then, one day, he hit her. 

I intervened on their free will to kick him out of the house after that. She had suffered too much. She would have to create a new life now, away from this haunted home and its painful memories. 

And so she moved into a small bungalow in the country. But she was an old woman now, with nothing left to do but pass the time while she waited to join her daughter. 

Every day, she would crawl out of bed to make breakfast. But on the way she would stop. She would think of the child she'd lost, or the husband who had left her, and she would break down and cry. By the time she recovered, she would have forgotten what it was she'd ever intended to do in the first place.

goosegoosegoosegoose,,,"Back when I was just a newly-minted freshman in college, I met a guy who, at 24, was so mature and worldly in my eyes. He was a well-traveled engineer from an affluent Jewish family. He fancied himself an intellectual, and I was hypnotized by listening to him chat about looking out over the Red Sea when he traveled through Israel, and sunbathing nude in his chartered luxury sailboat in the British Virgin Islands. He spent his summers in Guadalajara with his grandparents. He waxed poetic about philosophy and wine and the human condition. His pretension was intoxicating to me, a young, impressionable girl from a blue-collar family, deeply seated in the Bible Belt. 

I desperately wanted to impress him. I shuffled through my mental Rolodex of achievements. 

Maybe I should tell him that I can fit my entire fist in my mouth? 

I may not have been to Israel and Egypt, but I've been on 'It's a Small World' at Disney. That's just as good, right? 

What about that time that I almost won the egg toss at the neighborhood 4th of July picnic, only to be foiled by the sun in my eyes?

As you can imagine, I was feeling pretty insecure. I was about as dull, white bread Americana as it gets. 

One day he was name-dropping restaurants in New York City that he considered overrated.

""Les Halles? Anthony Bourdain knows how to make a steak, but the rest of the food is uninspired, contrived French Country,"" he sneered.

I don't know if it was because I was overwhelmed with wondering what kind of restaurant name ""Lay Alls"" even was, or if my juvenile inferiority complex had finally gotten the best of me, but I involuntarily spouted off, ""I actually make a much better steak than Anthony Bourdain.""

My Jewish-American Prince zeroed in on me like a fighter ace. ""Oh really? You must be quite the chef. You should make it for me tonight.""

""Oh.. Okay.. Yeah.""

I didn't know who Anthony Bourdain was. I had never cooked a steak in my life. I had never cooked *anything* in my life. I grew up on boxed Mac and Cheese and other assorted foods that come with flavor powders. My life flashed back to the time in third grade when I told my teacher I had a pet newt, and she asked me to bring it in for show and tell. I told her it died the next day. 
Could I tell him my pet had died and get away with this, too? 

I really wanted him to think I was interesting, so I decided to take the 'fake it til you make it' route.

I planned out my meal, and headed to the store. I decided to go very minimalistic. Steak, zucchini, and a baked potato. I grabbed my produce and stood in front of the imposing, monolithic meat counter, staring in awe at the huge variety of meat cuts. I hadn't bargained on having to choose what *kind* of steak. I knew nothing about the cuts and decided the best bet would be to choose something that had ""steak"" right in the name. I grabbed a package of cube steaks and ran home to begin my culinary adventure.

My guest was going to arrive in thirty minutes. I set the oven to preheat to 350 degrees, the ""universal baking temperature"" according to the 1970s era Better Homes and Gardens cookbook that I had inherited from my mother. I wrapped the potatoes in aluminum foil and chucked them in the oven. 

As a college student, I didn't exactly have a well equipped kitchen. I chopped up the zucchini and tossed it in my single, tiny, non-stick frying pan with about an inch of vegetable oil. I was a little nervous, because almost immediately, it started to look really watery and translucent. I thought the heat might be too high, so I turned it down a bit to keep it from overcooking.

I had watched George Foreman create succulent grilled meats on his namesake grill infomercial enough times, that I felt confident that I could pull off a successful steak. I pulled out the cube steak and seasoned it liberally with salt, and because I didn't have any other spices, a little more salt, and then, for good measure, a tiny bit more salt. Didn't want it to be bland, after all. I tossed those sinewy cube steaks on the blazing George Foreman, and slammed the lid on victory just as the doorbell rang. I couldn't believe it! I had done it! 

I let my heartthrob in and poured some wine into solo cups. I pulled the potatoes out of the oven, and looked at my mushy green gel in the frypan. I guess I had overcooked it a little after all. It could be worse, because I still had my pièce de résistance, my soon-to-be-world-famous steak. I opened the George Foreman and saw two grey, lifeless blobs of meat staring back at me. Surely, it would taste better than it looked. I plated the meals and prepared to wow.

The potatoes, after spending 20 minutes in a 350 degree oven, were (unsurprisingly) rock hard and raw.

The zucchini... Wasn't zucchini. I had inadvertently grabbed a cucumber and made hot fried cucumber soup.

The cube steak.. Was beyond salty, impossibly tough, and tragically bad in every way. What can you expect from cooking an unseasoned piece of the toughest cut of meat on a George Foreman for 15 minutes?

I drowned my sorrows and my embarrassment in another bottle of wine. My date excused himself for the night because he had to be up early in the morning. We only saw each other one more time before he told me he was pursuing someone that was ""a better fit"".

I'm a great cook now.

TL;DR: Hot fried cucumber soup is my signature dish.

bee-factory,,,"I work in New York City so I see a lot of homeless people, usually the same ones for a while but then they just disappear. I don't know where they go or if they're ok. My boyfriend gives me flowers a lot (I'm spoiled!) so when they are starting to get less fresh but still nice, I like to bring them to the city with me and give a few to each of the homeless I see everyday. I feel bad that I can't do more but it seems to brighten their day a little which is nice.


There's also a middle aged woman who is usually on my train platform waiting with me, she has this ugly purse that I haaated. But after a few weeks I noticed it really had a lot of fun, vibrant colors and interesting patterns. I can picture her being soo excited picking out what she thought was this beautiful bag and then getting to wear it everyday and, idk, that thought makes me really happy!


Oh also there is this really overweight woman who always tries to rush onto the train first to get one of the very few single seats. Which I totally get cos it must be uncomfortable/embarrassing to sit next to other people who are like givin you dirty looks for all the space you take up in a two-seater (which i've seen people do). Whenever she grabs that single seat I'm like hell yeahhh! Also she wears like just a leather jacket when it's 2 degrees outside which is horrifying to me.


On the way into the city this certain lady always decides to sit next to me, probably because I'm tiny and quiet. She is so awesome, always has insanely perfect nail designs, blinged out phone, like way too many coach bags, massive sunglasses, gorgeous weave! I want to be like excuse me m'am but you are fuckin killin it haha.


Also in penn station there is this dude always playing a tin whistle for money in the hall leading to the subway. I hate that fuckin whistle. It just echoes so piercingly, it drives me crazy. If I ever become ludicrously wealthy I have vowed to give that guy several million just to never play that flute again. Omg. I still give him money but like, ugh. No more please!!!


Oh also in my train station, every morning/evening I see the same woman just kind of hanging around. She has a bunch of backpacks, I'm not sure if she is homeless or maybe mentally ill? But she has such a kind face and I worry sometimes. I always get an urge to ask if I can buy her a coffee or if she needs anything but I'm really just too shy haha. Maybe I'll ask the guy in the ticket office about her tomorrow!

* taken from [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2on5b1/how_iswas_world_war_ii_history_taught_in_germany/cmov83e)
* There have been various times throughout the years when Japanese textbook controversies have made the news, especially in Asia where feelings are still raw for many parts of the population about Japanese imperialism, partly because of racism, partly because of nationalism/political reasons, and partly because it is still a personal thing for some people and/or their immediate family, friends, etc.
* These revisionist textbook news controversies coupled with some hardliner historically revisionist politicians are some of the main reasons why Japan still has tensions with its neighbors over a war that happened almost a century ago.
* That being said, the majority of Japanese textbooks today and recent history teach the history of World War II in a fairly objective light. While one could argue whether or not the Japanese textbooks are 'apologetic' enough or 'graphic' enough to showcase the horrors of the war, there is no argument in the objective historical content.
Japanese mainstream textbooks that are approved by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) for national curriculum in the public Japanese education system covers all the fundamentals of WWII, including Japanese war crimes as well as Japanese aggression against various Asian countries, colonial holdings, and Allied nations.
* Revisionist textbooks are, as far as I could tell in my research, not used at all in the public sector (as they have not received MEXT approval) and is used in fewer than 20 schools in the private sector.
* But it has not always been this way in Japan.
* Back in the 1950s, Japan was just really beginning to come back from the destruction of the war. Meanwhile, the Cold War is blowing up. The Korean War had just happened and Western troops had fought toe to toe with the PRC and North Korea, seemingly the vanguard of a rising red tide that was threatening to swallow Asia.
Japan was feeling a lot of pressure from the US to crack down on any kind of 'red' sentiment. Japanese people themselves were slowly building up to their own 'red scare'. The government subsequently started a large scale campaign to suppress freedom of speech, freedom of press and control information and political dialogue.
I'll mainly focus on education. The Japanese government began a campaign of banning books, especially textbooks that seemed to support communist viewpoints, which included content that showed the Japanese working class as suffering or oppressed, lack of political freedom, encouraging questioning central authority, as well as any books that even remotely supported anything related to the Soviet Union or the PRC.
Consequently, this meant that any books that condemned the Japanese Empire for its actions during World War II were heavily suppressed.
* Scholars and academics were heavily targeted of course while newspapers and media outlets were co-opted into the information control scheme, for the sake of national order with the threat of violent Communist revolution and invasion feeling very real at the time.
* Funnily enough, part of this is due to the fact that the US was so adamant on building up an anti-Communist ally in Asia. The Japanese government had political free reign to crack down on labor movements, political expression, and academic learning/research, all in the name of fighting the Communist threat.
Directly after World War 2, the Japanese education system went under a number of reforms, many of which were focused on cultivating critical thinking through group discussion and teaching the method of self study (teaching students how to learn instead of rote memorization).
* But this changed very quickly as American strategic concerns overruled the progressive educational reforms of the late 1940s and we move into the 1950s.
* Education changed very quickly, with the banning of hundreds of books and almost seeming to return to war time education. Political hardliners rejoiced at the apparent return to fundamentalist education.
* Elementary schoolers curriculum required teachers to teach students to hold favorable views of the Emperor, as in pre-war years. Middle school teachers didn't need to teach World War II at all, simply that a war had occurred and post-war reconstruction, with a focus on the efforts of a patriotic, united citizenry that made rebuilding possible. Highschoolers only needed a 'recognition...of the importance of avoiding wars'.
* Now, these education standards would be unthinkable today and would cause massive controversy in modern times in Asia. So why was this even considered back in the 1950s?
Because of Cold War adversarial politics.
* With much of Asia seemingly falling to Communist forces, there was very little political value put in reconciliation. China was militant and aggressively pursuing a doctrine of violent Communist revolution in the region. Korea was war torn and half of it was controlled by an adversarial regime. South East Asia had swarms of Communist militias if not out right revolutions.
* Japanese politicians simply didn't care. More importance was put in inspiring patriotism and convincing the people of the Communist threat while extolling the superior virtues of the capitalist system. Education was more about preparing the citizens for ideological warfare than critical thinking.
* Speaking about the politicians that created this educational policy, many of these politicians were heavily conservative. Many of them had actually been purged by the American occupation but were reconciled and reintegrated because their staunch anti-Communist views made them desirable for American interests in the region.
* Unfortunately, these politicians are the origins of political historical revisionism and academic repression. For example, in 1957 under the authorization system that was first installed during the US occupation, 8 middle school textbooks were banned. The contents of the books were fairly graphic and very anti-war, detailing the many atrocities and war crimes Japan had committed in the war.
* They were labeled and politically dangerous and harboring Communist sentiments, and subsequently banned.
During this time period of heavy academic suppression, many gave up writing textbooks at all. Some historians even stopped publishing and working on research because they kept coming up against the government roadblock every time.
* But there were those who were vehemently opposed to these restrictions. Ienaga Saburo was the most well known figure for this. He brought multiple lawsuits against the Japanese government, claiming the censorship was a violation of the Constitution.
* It's also important to note that at the time (1950s), the general mood of the Japanese people was extremely anti-war, anti-establishment, and anti-military. Part of the almost ironic educational reforms of the 1950s (in some respects seemingly returning to pre-war and wartime education) was to try and reverse this public sentiment that was seen as politically conducive to Communist and revolutionary feelings.
* As we move on into the 1960s and 1970s, textbooks are no longer the focus of political action. Massive movements of anarchists, communists, socialists, anti-military, anti-conservative, anti-establishment, anti-American, etc spring up. Protests and riots become common place. Most of these political movements are focused around students, particularly high school and college students.
* Social issues force social reform and it was reflected in books and textbooks. Textbooks begin to broach the events of WWII and some even hint at the war crimes committed.
* By the 1980s, we actually see books that detail the atrocities during the war start to be sold in stores, or rather, were allowed to be published and sold in stores. A big step from the earlier decades. Textbooks began to use more direct language such as 'military aggression' and 'invasion'.
* Of course, conservative reactions were loud and intense. Cries of unpatriotic books destroying the social fabric and eroding national values, a war on the Japanese identity, demands for revisions to these books, etc. 
* Conservative groups published their own books and textbooks.
* The biggest turn around in education occurred in 1989, when Emperor Hirohito passed away. Now it was much easier and more acceptable to publish textbooks and books that were more openly critical of war time aggression and atrocities. In the early 1980s, there were finally some books that explained in more detail the suffering of civilians and victims of Japanese invasions but after the passing of the Showa Emperor, a flood gate opened.
* The Nanjing Massacre, suppression of Korean independence and identity, comfort women, slave labor, POW war crimes, etc. All these things had been excluded from textbooks for decades and for the first time, were reintroduced on a national scale. From middle school to college, students learned about the realities of what happened during World War II.
* Conservative reactions were just as loud and vehement as before. But they were in the minority. Progressive history teachers were in the majority and educated their students passionately. But this only intensified conservative reactions, which were becoming more and more isolated socially.
* They were beginning to see the liberalization of society as a war on 'Japanese-ness' and Japanese values. They saw this large change in society, not just education, as a threat to the very fabric of fundamental Japanese values and views. So reactionary education systems, schools and books were born.
* Today, historically revisionist views are decidedly in the minority, but magnified by media. Generally, education on the war in Japan is the same anywhere.

If we're talking about the next Facebook, then we're a few years off. It's going to be an augmented reality program that's similar to ""Foursquare,"" except with a lot more functionality. Basically, you'll be able to walk into a location and access the various ""Residents,"" each of whom will be represented by a streamlined profile (with a focus on pictures). Residents will be able to vote on one another (not unlike on Reddit), share comments, arrange meet-ups, extend invitations, and even look for dates. You'll be able to ""visit"" those locations from the comfort of your own home, too, almost as though real-world locations had been turned into webpages.

**TL;DR: The next Facebook is going to be called ""ResiDe.""**

If we're talking about the next smartphone, then I've kind of already touched on it: Several independent companies are developing a variety of augmented reality that will be projected on what *appears* to be an ordinary pair of glasses. Adoption will be slow, at first, but before long it will be incredibly widespread (with each of those companies - plus the big-name competitors of today - offering their own models). For instance, stores will project their prices on your heads-up display, rather than via the clunky method of physically printing out stickers. Websites, navigation systems, video games, and even some new concepts (like a reading on your health) will have integration.

Oh, and I guess the control scheme is pretty neat, too. The glasses have a way of detecting how your eyes attempt to focus on things, and they can determine if you want to bring something into view, dismiss it, or switch between things. This is accomplished by creating a ""virtual depth"" for items on the display.

If we're talking about the next microwave oven, then it's going to be a food replicator (and the nourishment it provides). You'll be able to eat anything you want and have it be exactly what you need, because each meal will be specifically formulated for you. Of course, you won't really be eating a medium-rare steak; you'll be eating a complex assemblage of proteins that look, smell, taste, and feel like one.

Sadly, this isn't going to be the panacea for the obesity problem that so many folks will claim. People will still eat far too much (and exercise far too little), and the sheer convenience of the appliance is actually going to exacerbate the issue. Some models will eventually come with a ""calorie lock"" that synchronizes with with your LifePulse (that's the health reading thing that I mentioned earlier), but precious few people will actually use it.

If we're talking about the next soda... well, that's a sticky subject. (No pun intended.) A chemical engineer is going to synthesize a substance that mimics caffeine, but that also creates a mild sense of euphoria. It will be non-addictive and entirely harmless (though some experts will claim that it can worsen migraines), but there will nonetheless be concerns that it can mess with emotional states and motivations.

A genetic engineer is going to augment a variety of berry to produce lestizeine - that's the chemical in question - as a natural product of its growth, and that berry will quickly replace the coffee bean as the most popular source of stimulants. Perhaps as a joke, this augmented berry will come to be known as the ""happy bean.""

People no longer said, ""Who is that thin girl with the blue eyes and the short hair?"" In my thirties I became just one of the moms. Then, groups of men stopped noticing me. First the ones in their twenties, then thirties, then forties, and as I bear down hard on sixty the group of men most liable to notice me are wearing WWII vet hats. I am dead serious about this. It's hard to watch your body change shape. Hands, arms, legs, all different than they were--never, never to return. That beautiful young girl has vanished from the face of the earth.


Then my babies began to vanish. My boys, who longed for me to hold them, who snuggled next to me on the couch each night, went away. I felt relief. They were out with their friends, playing in a band, away at college, married. They have wrinkles, gray hair and 401K's. When I see them, they no longer sit next to me. I can no longer rub their hair, over and over; it just wouldn't feel right. 


But next, a miracle. I had a grandson and loved him with a passion I never even felt with my own children. People had told me to expect this, but I didn't understand until I saw him....then I understood.


But now he is out in the world, at the park, with his friends, and he no longer snuggles with me, because he's ten. My joints hurt, my thumbs are quite arthritic, and I had an old lady fall this summer, shattering my arm. My mother is growing older and I know that she will grow truly old and ill and die someday. I know that for sure now. My career is stalled, but I do a very good job at what I do, and I find joy in my work and in my competence.


You know how they say you lose brain cells as you age? What a myth. I grow more and more wise, I learn new things every day, and one of my biggest fears is that I will die before I've read all of the books I want to read. But as I grow more wise, people want to hear what I say less and less. So I'm sitting back, taking it all in, letting the great world spin.",1423492591,,FALSE,1,2,AskReddit,FALSE,FALSE,443,0,Morning,0-20,0,35,"{u'tone_categories': [{u'category_id': u'emotion_tone', u'tones': [{u'tone_name': u'Anger', u'score': 0.093535, u'tone_id': u'anger'}, {u'tone_name': u'Disgust', u'score': 0.099323, u'tone_id': u'disgust'}, {u'tone_name': u'Fear', u'score': 0.568986, u'tone_id': u'fear'}, {u'tone_name': u'Joy', u'score': 0.185322, u'tone_id': u'joy'}, {u'tone_name': u'Sadness', u'score': 0.592912, u'tone_id': u'sadness'}], u'category_name': u'Emotion Tone'}, {u'category_id': u'language_tone', u'tones': [{u'tone_name': u'Analytical', u'score': 0.373872, u'tone_id': u'analytical'}, {u'tone_name': u'Confident', u'score': 0.0, u'tone_id': u'confident'}, {u'tone_name': u'Tentative', u'score': 0.000988, u'tone_id': u'tentative'}], u'category_name': u'Language Tone'}, {u'category_id': u'social_tone', u'tones': [{u'tone_name': u'Openness', u'score': 0.394158, u'tone_id': u'openness_big5'}, {u'tone_name': u'Conscientiousness', u'score': 0.005541, u'tone_id': u'conscientiousness_big5'}, {u'tone_name': u'Extraversion', u'score': 0.033655, u'tone_id': u'extraversion_big5'}, {u'tone_name': u'Agreeableness', u'score': 0.451961, u'tone_id': u'agreeableness_big5'}, {u'tone_name': u'Emotional Range', u'score': 0.019479, u'tone_id': u'emotional_range_big5'}], u'category_name': u'Social Tone'}]}",0.093535,0.099323,0.568986,0.185322,0.592912,0.373872,0,0.000988,0.394158,0.005541,0.033655,0.451961,0.019479,"{u'probability': {u'neg': 0.732138619540966, u'neutral': 0.8430971362505068, u'pos': 0.267861380459034}, u'label': u'neutral'}",0.73213862,0.26786138,0.843097136,neutral

Largely, being half white has almost stripped me of any sort of racial identity entirely, being where I'm from.

Aureliusceasar,,,"This is actually my field. there is a dynamic known as the violence mobilization cycle that is in play here. Basically, the more you try and shut down protest through violent or coercive means, The more likely you are to have that backfire on you as people see you arresting or assaulting individuals they either have a connection to or can imagine themselves having a connection to. 

Think about the early days of the Arab spring. Initially, the protests were relatively small and undertaken by fairly specific set of people – Young urbanites. however, when people throughout society witnessed the violence being used against these individuals it brought about dissatisfaction and anger in them and brought them out to the street.

Same thing here. If the police swooped in and started arresting everybody it would require a great deal of violence to accomplish. This violence would only serve to further inflame the tensions underlying this conflict. That's the logic behind letting the protesters have some time to burn themselves out.

There are of course exceptions to this. Some protests are simply too large for this to be a practical strategy. Other times, if you are willing to use a sufficient level of violence, you can sort of break past this dynamic. Thankfully, neither is the case here.

And then have a group of 3 people all but refuse to make eye contact with me, never smile, just be totally negative and downright mean?

RufusTheFirefly,,,"How do Israelis justify the settlement movement is honestly a huge question with a very long answer.  But I don't have the time right now to provide one.  So here's my super-short version (and I'm only going to deal with the West Bank because both Jerusalem and the Golan are different and like I said -- no time) ...

The international system is terribly deficient on the subject of who should 'get' what land, not just in the middle east, but everywhere.  There are few clear, agreed upon principles that define it.  How long does a people have to be living on a land before it becomes 'theirs' for instance if they never had a sovereign state there?  60 years?  600?  Or is it just whoever's there now?  Does the land the Kurds live on 'belong to them' even though they don't have a state?  What about the Eastern half of Turkey which is dominated by Kurds -- should that belong to Turkey or the Kurds?  Is the United States still land that should be returned to the Native Americans or is it American now?  For how long has that been the case?  Not how long has the US existed, but for how long has the land rightfully belonged to Americans instead of Native Americans, if it ever has?  Political philosophy really struggles with questions like those.

So back to your prompt.  The first thing we have to ask is why is it 'the land of the Palestinians'?  I know what you're thinking.  This one's obvious!  The Palestinians live there and always have.  Or at least they have for a very long time, right?  So it should be theirs!

The reality isn't that simple.  The division between what you are thinking of as Israeli land and what you are thinking of as Palestinian land is a border that only existed for 19 years, between 1948 and 1967.  Before that there was no border in the area (in fact Jordan was part of the same administrative region collectively known as Transjordan).  Actually that border between Israel and the West Bank never existed in the entire history of the land before 1948.

In 1948 a civil war was fought between the Jews that lived there and the Arabs that lived there (with a whole lot of Arabs who didn't live there joining in on the Arab side) and a ceasefire line was drawn at the end of the war.  The Arab side insisted on including in that ceasefire treaty a declaration that those borders were temporary and would *never* become permanent (the Arab side was still hoping to conquer Israel and wanted to leave the possibility open).  This ceasefire line lasted until 1967 when another war was fought.  At the end of that war a new ceasefire line was drawn.  That ceasefire line has delineated who controls what land for the last 50 years (I'm ignoring the Gaza pullout for the moment).

The middle ceasefire line -- the one that lasted from 1948-1967 is what is today known as the Green Line.  That's not in force today.  It's not an actual border.  If you walk through the streets of Jerusalem you will not see a Green line on the ground (in fact most of the population of Jerusalem, both Jewish and Arab, has little idea where that line is if you ask them).  But those are the borders some of the Palestinians *want*.  But because it's the borders they want, that does not necessarily mean it is the borders they will get, nor the ones they should get.  That is their desire.  If the Palestinians wanted New York City as a capital, you'd laugh, but they have no more control over East Jerusalem than they do over New York City.  It is an aspiration -- not such a far-fetched one -- but still merely an aspiration.  Much of the international community has made a political decision to side with the Palestinians in this claim, but to Israelis, that does not make it *just*, it merely makes it popular.

Now back to the land.  So I've explained how this border in your head came to be -- this one that was in force for 19 years ... 50 years ago.  But we haven't talked about what this border actually looks like.  Few people, even ones who deal with this issue all the time, actually know.  It is a mess.  It is illogical because it was forged during a war.  Some borders forged during war make a lot of sense -- they stop at mountain chains and rivers for instance, things that would be hard for armies to cross.  These borders however were not strong, which is why they led to another war in 1967.

The Green Line has many faults.  It includes strange splotches of non-contiguous land and it even has the Western Wall on the ARAB SIDE!  Perhaps you are starting to see why many Israelis think it doesn't make sense and why even Palestinians recognize that swaps are necessary to make it work.

Now you are probably thinking that while both Jews and Arabs lived in Israel, only Arabs lived in the West Bank, so even if the historical basis for those borders is weak, they are sensible, right?  But here's the problem -- Jews used to live in the West Bank too.  Nowhere near as many as lived in Israel proper, but they were there.

There was, for instance, a Jewish quarter in the West Bank city of Hebron (also the second holiest city to Jews).  Jews lived there for a very long time.  But in 1929 there was a massacre and the local Arabs murdered every last Jew in the Jewish Quarter of Hebron.  Then a few decades later, in '67, Israel gained control over that area and some Jews wanted to move back in to the Jewish Quarter.  To the Israelis, there was no justice in denying them the ability to return to that spot.  Massacring the Jews of Hebron certainly didn't give the local Arabs any legal right to that land.  So they allowed it.

Today the Jews living there are known as *settlers* and you refer to them as 'taking Palestinian land'.  Perhaps you can see some of the complications involved from this example.

You may also have noticed something strange in the news when they talk about settlements.  You may have noticed that some get struck down by the Israeli Supreme Court as illegal and others don't.  'But they're all illegal!' you're thinking.  'What distinction is that court making?'  The court is distinguishing between private and public land.  The court strikes down any settlements that Jews try to build on land privately owned by Palestinians.  However the public land is a different story.

~60% of the west bank is public land -- meaning uninhabited land not owned by any private individual (this sounds strange to people who have never been there but it's super obvious if you've ever driven from Jerusalem to the Dead Sea for instance, it's all empty dunes).  Who does that land belong to?  Well before 1967, it belonged to the King of Jordan as under the Jordanian system, the King of Jordan owned the public (i.e. uninhabited) land.  Before 1948 it belonged to the British crown.  Before 1917 it belonged to the Ottoman Empire and so on.  This is land that no private individual owned.  Similarly in Israel there was and is plenty of Public land.  The bottom half of both Israel and the West Bank is largely uninhabited desert region.  So if in 1948, the Jordanian King took possession of the public land from the British crown, and in 1967 the Israeli government took possession of the public land (what is now known as Area C) from the Jordanian King, who should the land belong to?

The Israelis say that much of that public land is up for grabs.  It was not privately owned so it passed from government to government.  Now it rests in the hands of the Israeli government.  The Palestinians *want* that land, but so do the Israelis.  And since the Israelis possess it and the Palestinian claim over this public desert does not seem any stronger than the Israeli claim, why shouldn't they allow citizens to live there?

Now there are many complications to this.  This is honestly just skimming the surface.  But I am out of time.  So I hope that helps somewhat.  Sorry that it's a bit all over the place.  I just typed this out very quickly.  And if you want sources you will have to google them.  I'm not going to stick around to answer questions or deal with the inevitable thousand follow-ups so maybe someone else will step in.  Honestly I'd need a semester to really answer this question.

She enjoyed her days in that sunny room listening to her favorite music from the 40's and with old movies on the tv. She was eligible for hospice the entire last 3 years and I advocated quite a few times to keep her alive when the doctors would have let her die. They didn't appreciate that she was still able to enjoy her life, even though there was less of it. When she finally died, it was because I had gotten influenza and was too sick to advocate for her when she needed it. The experience was an eye opener for me about the medical profession and incompetency. http://i.imgur.com/xsdmOoD.jpg

HornyBillyGoat,,,"I was an attendant on a red eye flight from Tokyo to LA. Those flights are almost always dead and boring because everyone's usually asleep. Well about halfway through the flight I noticed two women about mid twenties get up and go to the same lavatory together. I didn't think nothing of it at first, but after awhile I started to wonder. So like 30 minutes go by and these girls are still in the damn lavatory. So I walk up to the door knock and ask if everything is ok and I don't hear anything back. So I start getting worried. I try to open the door, but it's locked so I go and get the key. When I unlock the door I can't believe what I'm seeing before my eyes. 

The two women were 69ing. You may ask ""How in an airplane lavatory that's small as hell?"". Well just sit back and listen my friend.  One woman was sitting on the toilet like you do when you're taking a shit and the other woman upside down with her head basically in the toilet. The one woman sitting on the toilet looked up and gasped and farted or shit I don't know which probably both. The upside down girl started screaming ""Why tf did you shit you nasty bitch!?"". At this point I don't know what to fucking do. I'm at a loss for words and can't believe this shit. 

All the sudden the plane starts shaking hard because what I thought was turbulence. It wasn't turbulence it was much much worse. The woman sitting on the toilet lets go of the upside down woman during this and the woman falls knocking me out of the lavatory. I get back up and see shit all in the hair and forehead of this naked chick and I'm grossed out as hell. I look back towards the other woman and she's gone. Turns out it wasn't a woman at all! It was a damn Loch Ness monster asking me for ""Tree fiddy.""
