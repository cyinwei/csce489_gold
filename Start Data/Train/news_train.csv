"Druidshift","","","A constant complaint I hear amongst the #blacklivesmatter protesters is that there is a system of oppression in America against Black people.  That if you go into any black neighborhood, the schools are poorer, there are less consumer options, less healthy food choices, more drugs and more violence. 

On this point, I agree with the #blacklivesmatter group.  You often do find these elements in black neighborhoods.  

Where I DISAGREE with them is that they say the reason for all of the above is because White people go out of their way to keep black communities this way.  Because of racism.  Whites make sure businesses don't invest in black communities because we want to keep the systematic oppression going.

I think the real reason is, it's because businesses don't WANT to invest in black communities.  Even black owned businesses don't want to open in black neighborhoods.  Because the #blacklivesmatter ""protesters"" burn shit down and destroy everything.  And then say that they are helping ""the cause"".  When you stand in roads preventing people from commuting and businesses from functioning.  When you burst into eateries screaming bloody murder yelling how ""brunch is the white mans new Jim Crow!"".  When you burn down businesses and riot and loot in your own neighborhoods whenever a grand jury doesn't go your way......THAT'S why black neighborhoods are so often shitty.  

How many fires broke out in the Castro when gay people lost the Prop 8 vote in California?  How many glitter queens roller bladed up and down Christopher Street burning down gay owned businesses because they were ""mad as hell and not going to take the oppression anymore!""?

It has nothing to do with White people keeping blacks down.  Blacks are keeping blacks down.  And don't pretend that the #blacklivesmatter protesters and the rioters/looters are separate people.  They are not.

http://patch.com/new-hampshire/windham/nearby-news-pumpkin-festival-rioters-arrested-teacher-administrative-leave-man-threatens-blow-dunkin

The #blacklivesmatter group keeps on protesting brunches, and pumpkin festivals, and symphonies and insist that they are doing these things because WHITE people are keeping them down in order to retain a system of oppression.  And then when a business in their neighborhood closes down because they have burnt it to the ground, not once do they stop and go ""Hmm....maybe we need some self reflection?  Maybe we need to see how we are hurting our cause?""  No, they just compare themselves to MLK and talk about how white people telepathically made the black rioters burn down the businesses...you know..because of oppression.

I will agree that many black neighborhoods and schools are inferior and suffer from crime and just aren't as nice as white neighborhoods.  But when a neighborhood is shit, it's because the people LIVING in that neighborhood keep it shit.

IF the schools are bad in black communities, GET PARENT FUCKING INVOLVED IN YOUR SCHOOLS.  Stop crying about how it's impossible to improve your own schools because it's too hard as working single parents to attend PTA meetings.  That's not the white mans fault.  Find TIME to improve YOUR children's schools.  If business owners won't open shops in your neighborhoods, maybe try to SUPPORT your local businesses?  You know, instead of setting them on fire every 2 months or so.  If you want your neighborhoods to improve, if you want cops to stop being jumpy because entering black neighborhoods is like entering a warzone, then MAKE your neighborhoods better.  

Or keep on interrupting brunches, and burning BBQ places down, and standing in highways.  Because the one blazing neon sign that tells you people are still children and not adults is when they go ""The problem is everyone else!  I'm PERFECT!""  Standing in traffic and burning down businesses really will change your neighborhoods /s

I am generally liberal in my philosophy and politics.  I always have voted for Democrats.  I generally sympathize with social causes, trying to effect change.  But #occupywallstreet and #blacklivesmatter is about to turn me into a conservative pretty damn fast.  What a bunch of whiny little shits.  They cause riots, turn people off from their causes, and then complain that the problem isn't them, it's racism!  How are they any different from the Westboro Baptist Church?

"novictim","","","Obama: ""It is important for us to align ourselves with 99.9% of Muslims...""

Better look at the polling data of what Muslims say they believe, Mr. President.  As Muslim populations grow (and they grow fast) the secular state is under threat by immigrant groups and their children who reject the values of their host countries.  Here is why:

""... solid majorities in most of the countries surveyed across the Middle East and North Africa, sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia and Southeast Asia favor the establishment of sharia, including 71% of Muslims in Nigeria, 72% in Indonesia, 74% in Egypt and 89% in the Palestinian territories.""

http://www.pewforum.org/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-exec/

If entire Muslim countries favor replacing Civil law (judges/juries/civil jurisprudence) with Sharia (Religious leaders applying religious law based in Koranic interpretation) we *should* have a problem with this.  And know that Sharia requires that strangers in dispute go to religious clerics for justice, regardless of their own beliefs or lack of belief.  And this kind of justice is NOT blind as it mandates Muslims give deference to fellow Muslims.  Atheists and homosexuals, mormons?  Forget about it!

Now, you will hear Muslims in the USA say ""Oh, yes, but I favor Sharia just as it applies to my own life.  I would never apply it to others.""   Don't believe it. follow what current events tell you and what history confirms.  The Ottoman empire instituted Sharia courts at its founding.  No one could claim to be ""outside"" the arm of those courts.

You will also hear people say that Sharia is not implemented today...despite the declaration of countries like Saudi that they *are* implementing it.  The mystery resolves itself when one realizes that Sharia is based on interpretations of  inconsistent religious texts (ya, that was redundant).  So if you don't like the particular interpretation of Sharia being applied by Saudi Arabia, you can claim it is not Sharia.  But that denial is just saying that religious law is good, just not the Saudi version.  

But religious law is NOT good.  It is filled with bias against one group or another and prone to manipulation, corruption, hypocrisy.  And at its core, Sharia is a rejection of the ethical secular principles that seek to place fairness over all else.  

You can say that civil courts get this wrong sometimes, that Western Justice is imperfect, but you 'aint seen nothin' until you see the bearded cleric state just how and when you can rape your slave.   

Also, one should realize that religious laws really cannot stop at borders, right?  When you have the perfect word of Allah to work with, borders are meaningless.  Get it?

If the Majority of Britain's believed that Sharia should be the law of the land, Sharia *would be* the law of the land, agreed?  Do you accept that as true?  Well, 40% of British Muslims do poll favoring Sharia Law.  Are you disturbed yet?

"imaredditloser","","","It doesn't matter. The point of welfare is not merely to help people just enough so they don't die. 

The point is to spend the least amount of money to maintain a healthy and stable society. That means there is no static formula to make welfare work. It has to be based on the times and needs of the population. 

The simple reality is that welfare is more like a guaranteed wage, which more and more countries are likely to adopt anyway as the future leads us to more and more automation with less and less skilled workers needed. We can't just create endless jobs simply because people can't stop reproducing and we can't halt technological advance just because the new technology doesn't fit nicely into our economic model.

We can either let them die off/fend for themselves and face a huge spike in crime since humans don't usually just die off, they claw and fight to survive. OR we can use money to directly influence them in a way to keep the manageable, effectively heading off the more expensive problems of prison costs or homeless management and providing a higher stand of living for people. 

The ultimate point of welfare is not merely to help people out. It is a means to help efficiently manage what would otherwise be a large demographics of people with little to nothing to lose. People whom have no obligation to follow the laws because there is nothing you can take from them.

If we give them something, then we have something to take from them and thus the law will actually apply to them. 

That is how modern governing works and really has worked in varying ways for hundreds and even thousands of years. You have to create that balance of reasonable living conditions to have a stable society or  kill or export all the dead weight. You can't just tell people to man up and get a job and cut welfare and expect that to work.

In most cases we find welfare spending winds up costing the state less than prison and attempting to enforce the law on homeless people. 

Kansas is just too stupid to do the math most likely. The only mandate I might support for Welfare recipients is that they have to vote.. beyond that limiting welfare will probably cost more money than it saves other than merely eliminating total fraud. Having a life just because your on welfare is really not fraud. People we have to give money to in order to keep them afloat are often not good with money and really have little chance of getting good with money. Many of them really are lost causes and if we can give them 12k a year to keep them out of prison, unfortunately, that is money well spent. 

What we can't expect is for everyone to have a job all the time. That's just not realistic in a modern society that's headed toward robotic cars and 3D printers. Even cheap foreign labor will feel the hit soon and the world economy will change significantly.

One thing we will see, without a doubt, will be a guaranteed life wage for citizens of many countries because it's your citizenship that will ultimately determine your value based on the value of your country. In a capitalist system the idea that we will all gain lots of person wealthy is mostly silly. Capitalism is all about competing to eliminate your economic opponent, not competing for the sake of the customer. All capitalist models lead to mass consolidation, mega corporations and monopolies. The only way around that is complex regulation and taxes. 

The future, with little doubt, will be controlled by large corporations with highly automated production. In a couple more decades major industries are going to be hit. In 50 years the idea that you'd pay a human being to deliver packages is going to seem laughable. For that to work though you still need consumers with money and the only way that works is via something that looks a bit more like socialism... aka welfare/min life wage for all citizens or basically your people are going to overthrow you government because you can't employe them.

The conservatives war on welfare is idiotic since the corporations that bankroll them will require min wage and welfare to continue to have customers to buy their goods as they also consolidate the wealth of the world faster and faster. Other than if the nation collapses, welfare, like healthcare, and all other social program HAVE to continue to expand in order for corporations to continue to consolidate wealth.

The nice part is the corporations can lobby to have a very strong say in exactly how much they have to give back in order to ultimately keep their profits up, so .. for all your hard core private business lovers out there.
Social programs = larger demographics of people who can afford your product = higher volume of sales = more profit

Imagine the billions in lost video game and fast food sales without welfare. That along with the fact that it keeps people easier to control and less likely to break the law, welfare and medicaid are bargains really. It's prisons and military that are draining your wallets with massive profit margins that nobody even questions. Instead they go after PBS and ignore veteran affairs because somehow in their minds it's better press to attack a tiny non-profit than to save veterans lives since that later would require money. 

Evidently the root of all evil is spending money on people in need, while the path of the righteous is lined with big fat military contracts even though the social programs time and time again clearly return almost infinitely more for our investment. It's always funny to hear the message of how poor people need to toughen up from the conservative/republican self proclaimed party of Jesus himself.

I was court ordered to to jail at 9 am one sunny morning. When I arrived at the jail, they did not have my papers and told me to come back in a couple hours. I did, with each person I met getting progressively less polite as less sunshine penetrated the maze of administration between me and a bed for the weekend.

After the politest, almost regretful pat down by a man patrolling in a truck outdoors, I was corralled by several chain link fences to the sun porch of the jail facility. After being buzzed in to the initial holding cell, I sat there for three hours being shuffled to a side cell each time a new inmate or group came through the door. 

By late afternoon I got my strip search, new clothes, and blanket pillow roll and led to a solitary confinement cell while the shifts were changed.

I stayed here 64 hours. I initially asked each new authority face that walked by my cell why I was in there. At first they said I had to be cleared by medical. I had been already. By the end of two shift changes, the guards assumed I had, in their words to another inmate inquiring about my status,,""musta got herself put there fer a reason"" and refused to look into it.

So I quit asking. By day two the girls in the other cell over convinced a guard to give me a book. I will always be thankful that book found me through such a considerate kindness of a stranger. Beyond that, I carved a Christmas tree into soap, danced a lot, made ornate patterns with cheerios, played an electrical outlet box like it was a steel drum, counted a lot or arbitrary things, considered my place in the world, thought about a lot of things, and eventually was moved to general population 64 hours after my initial check in.

"TheYogi","","","I am all for the release of these mosquitoes.  Why?  Because the alternative is continued use of pesticides which are the REAL danger.  Allow me to provide an example.  There is a pesticide called Naled which is an organophosphate that is sprayed in agriculture fields for various pests and over millions of people for mosquito control.  When sprayed on agriculture fields, there is a 48 hour reentry interval where workers cannot reenter without protective gear (http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/reregistration/REDs/naled_red.pdf).  When it is sprayed over residential areas for mosquito control, there are no such protections; kids are out running around the same day.  The thing is, when sprayed in agriculture fields, they use large droplets so it contacts the bugs.  When sprayed for mosquitoes, they aerosolize it so it hangs in the air.  The problem there is, the US military figured out in a study that aerosolized Naled is 21x more toxic and causes lung and liver necrosis (http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF01685774)

"throwawayjcms","","","I, unfortunately, have experience with that city and with this type of situation. As a few people have said on here, it is a very small town.  Everyone is related; and that can be a serious issue when trying to get the local police force to help with anything. If you are calling them to help, and the person attacking you/hurting you/etc is the nephew/brother/etc of the arresting officer, YOU will go to jail. They will NOT arrest ""their own"". It is crap, but it has happened repeatedly for years. 

I know reddit seems lately to be especially sensitive to the women claiming rape issue, (and I do sympathize for people falsely accused and hate it just as much as you, because it makes it that much harder for actual victims to be believed, can ruin the lives of innocent people, and is not a charge that should be taken lightly) but I think very few of you have any idea of what is like for women, especially in a back woods town like Ellisville, MS. I do not know what happened in this particular case (nor do I presume to), but neither do any of you. I can attest to my personal experience in that town, with a case very similar. 

I will try to keep it as brief as possible. I was sexually assaulted and beaten by a man in that city. I called the police, filed a report, then...nothing. Other than photos they took of my injuries (which ""disappeared"" when I tried to follow up), they didn't refer me to a hospital, they didn't even try to collect any evidence. He wasn't arrested, nothing was followed up on. I, on the other hand, was threatened by police officers and members of the sheriff's department repeatedly. I tried to go over their head and contacted the district attorney's office. I found out that FOUR other victims had filed charges against him in recent years, with the same result. In one of the cases he continued to harass one of the women and her daughter and when she tried to press charges, she was arrested for vandalism and some other trumped up charge; he once again faced no consequences. I took it to the capital in Jackson and was told just to drop it. So...I did. I was young, I was hurt, and I was tired of having to relive what happened every time I tried to get another officer of the law to help, and having none of them help in the least. Trying to hire an attorney to help was out of the question. There are no women's centers there to help. [Read up on The New Bethany School for Girls that is not too far from this town if you really want to see how prevalent these type of problems are.] 

I was pulled over and harassed every time I drove through that city at night. They would search my car, dump my purse in the street, etc etc etc. I moved the first chance I got, and I was lucky. That is a city where nearly everyone is living at the poverty level, moving away from there is hard. Women in situations like the one I went through do not get the help they need. I got a call a few years later from a woman that was a friend of a friend. The same guy had beaten and raped her, and she was scared to go to the police. Our mutual friend called me to help talk her through it, and I wish I could have done more, but I couldn't. She never followed up with the police, and I don't know what happened to her. I do know that man has done this over and over again to young girls for decades...and there is not a damn thing I can do about it. That's the reality of being in a situation like that. It does state this was ""the second time in a few weeks span that a false rape claim was made in Jones County"". Considering how small that town is and how it is nearly impossible to see a rape claim even with a plethora of evidence taken seriously, I do find it odd that they are now being serious about false rape claims. 
 
I know what the headline says and what the article states, but do realize it may not be the full story. I do not know who the man in this article is, nor the woman. I do not know what happened in that particular situation, all I can attest to is how that town treats women who try to press rape charges. 

TL;DR: False rape charges are terrible, but this town has a long history of dismissing any rape accusations; and of finding reasons to arrest the women reporting them, false or not.

I commented below, but for anyone curious, Derek Cruice had two prior arrest records in 2009 and 2010. Both times were for possession of marijuana. One was a felony charge (over 20 grams), which was dismissed by the prosecution. The other was a misdemeanor charge (under 20 grams) to which Derek Cruice pleaded 'no contest'. There had been nothing in the 5 years since then, although the official police statement says they had been organizing this raid for some time. (Information via a [link to the county records](https://app02.clerk.org/cr_inq/) provided by /u/Afboy365)  

Whether he was dealing or just smoking himself, a judge in a court of law wouldn't have sentenced him to death, and he should not have died for such a crime. Marijuana possession is legal in some parts of our country, and will likely be legal in Florida within some years.  

Lastly, DO NOT ATTEMPT TO FIND OR MAKE CONTACT WITH DEPUTY TODD RAIBLE. His part in this is done, and if there is justice to be had, he will have his day in court. It's more than he gave Derek, but it's the way we have to do things. Violence should not beget more violence, no more than this should just be swept under the rug.

[This breakdown](http://journalistsresource.org/studies/government/criminal-justice/deaths-police-custody-united-states) shows that on a given year we see 700 deaths in custody. 60% of those are homicides with 75% of them being justified. That means roughly 113 deaths are not justified. 113 people killed due to malice or negligence. I'm willing to bet that in each of these incidents a second or third officer is also present.

"probablyeveryone","","","Because I'm feeling particularly self-righteous this evening, I wrote an email to the local prosecutor named on the docket for this case. And because posting it publicly makes me feel more important, here it is:

&gt;After reading a local news report on the arrest of DelRea Good for resisting law enforcement in Porter County, I was distressed to discover that your office has decided to file an information against her charging her with a felony. The law does not support the charges you have filed against Ms. Good and I find it deeply troubling that you have nonetheless elected to subject her to stress of baseless felony charges. 

&gt;I will first discuss why a felony charge of resisting law enforcement is legally indefensible in Ms. Good's case before briefly highlighting the grave risks to public safety this prosecution poses. 

&gt;Under Indiana Code Section 35-44.1-3-1(b)(1)(A), the offense with which you have charged Ms. Good, it is a level six felony to knowingly or intentionally use a vehicle in order to ""flee[] from a law enforcement officer after the officer has, by visible or audible means, including operation of the law enforcement officer's siren or emergency lights, identified himself or herself and ordered the person to stop."" The key element is whether the alleged offender did ""flee from a law enforcement officer."" The word ""flee"" is not defined in the Indiana Code, but the Court of Appeals of Indiana's Third District defined the term as follows in Wellman v. State, 703 N.E.2d 1061, 1063 (1998):

&gt;&gt;We conclude that ""flight"" in this context should be understood to mean a knowing attempt to escape law enforcement when the defendant is aware that a law enforcement officer has ordered him to stop or remain in place once there. We note in this regard that Black's Law Dictionary (6th Ed. 1990), defines the phrase ""flee from justice"" as follows:

&gt;&gt;Removing one's self from or secreting one's self within jurisdiction wherein offense was committed to avoid arrest; or concealing one's self therein, with intent, in either case, to avoid arrest, detention, or punishment for some criminal offense.

&gt;It is thus clear that in order to commit the offense of resisting law enforcement with which you have charged her, Ms. Good must have driven away from a law enforcement officer with the intent to escape, avoid arrest, or avoid punishment. Nothing about the facts indicates that this could possibly be the case.

&gt;Ms. Good was allegedly speeding northbound on County Road N 500 W. Officer William Marshall activated his lights near the intersection with W 700 N, at which point Ms. Good activated her hazard lights, motioned out her window, and proceeded approximately 0.8 miles to the Kohl's parking lot just south of Highway 6. This would have taken her approximately 85 seconds. At what point during that 85 second trip to a well lit parking lot, where she immediately stopped, did Ms. Good indicate that she intended to escape Mr. Marshall or avoid punishment for speeding? Because that was plainly not her intention, there is no basis upon which to charge Ms. Good with a felony. Your office did not have sufficient cause to support an information and you should acknowledge that now by dismissing the felony charge against Ms. Good.

&gt;Your continued action against Ms. Good jeopardizes the safety of residents of Porter County. As the news article highlights, a woman was attacked in Valparaiso in 1991 when she pulled over in response to a person impersonating a police officer with flashing red and blue lights. Just two years ago, someone in Porter County attempted to perpetrate a similar attack against a woman, but that woman thankfully chose not to stop. At the time, a Portage police officer warned the public to do exactly what Ms. Good did if they felt unsafe when being pulled over: ""acknowledge the officer by waving at them and then drive to a well-lit public location before stopping."" Now you are subjecting a woman who followed this advice to felony prosecution. Residents of Porter County will now have to decide whether they would rather risk being attacked by a criminal impersonating a police officer on a desolate rural road or risk felony prosecution by your office. 

&gt;I fail to see how jeopardizing the safety of Porter County residents by prosecuting Ms. Good in contravention of Indiana law comports with your office's stated mission of protecting the public and preserving the interests of justice. I thus urge you to drop the felony charge against Ms. Good, publicly apologize for the mistake, and reassure the public that they may signal to an officer and proceed a short distance to a well-lit parking lot if they feel unsafe stopping precisely where an officer activates his lights and siren.

"Lucifuture","","","As a liberal I like to throw out the fact that when you take away suicide and gang warfare gun deaths hit something like 1200 people a year, 800 less than pools.

EDIT: I have seen some figures claim as high as 80% of gun homicides are gang related [this source](http://extranosalley.com/?p=36491) pins it closer to 70%

[This source](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/05/24/suicides-account-for-most-gun-deaths/) pins suicide at about 60% of over all gun deaths.

I am not saying people who commit suicide don't count or that gang members aren't people. I am a suicide survivor myself and have lost friends and family members to suicide, so forgive me if I seemed insensitive as I am impacted by suicide greatly and am sympathetic. 

My point is that gangs will kill each other with sticks if they have to and people will find other ways to kill themselves if they are desperate enough. You can cherry pick statistics to back up any debate especially one that is charged by emotions so much rather than logic. As an advocate for responsible gun ownership I could easily throw out gun ownership rates in Switzerland vs their homicide rate but that really has a lot to do with their culture more than owning guns or not. Just like how guns are banned in Mexico but there are a ton of gun deaths because of the Cartels.

You can find statistics to back up what you already think and rationalize and bolster your opinion. I found that I wasn't originally very strongly opinionated about guns so I tried to educate myself, shot guns (which is really fun), and reformed my opinion. I might be for actual practical laws say like a gun tax that is spent on suicide prevention or gang prevention, but passing superficial laws banning assault rifles that look scary but in effect allow the same exact gun with a wooden stock seems like a waste of time and dumb since so few gun deaths are even caused by assault style rifles anyway.

Sorry to rant, felt like I should explain my position more since people responded to it.

EDIT 2: re crunching the numbers might put it closer to 2000 i dunno how I originally got 1200 but that was the original number I calculated, maybe with sources that were more generous to a pro-gun bias. There are a lot of conflicting numbers but something like 19k suicides 11k homicides minus 80% of 11k is a little more than 2000 admittedly.

"tristemono","","","I honestly couldn't even finish the article. By the time the author had suggested that putting her child on a gluten-free diet had made a difference, she had lost all credibility for me.

I have several close family members &amp; friends that suffer from ADD and ADHD. It is not a fallacy. It is a mental disorder that affects every minute of their lives. It varies from person to person, but my sister has straight Fs in school right now because she can't focus in school, can't remember where she put her homework, can't finish the homework, and forgets to turn it in. She takes extra time to finish her tests, and often doesn't read the questions thoroughly enough to pick the right answer. But when she takes her (very carefully measured) medication, it's as if her mind and her body - formerly trapped at different, frantic paces - can finally catch up to one another, synchronize like two gears, and then slow each other down to a normal, balanced level. She still struggles, but she can manage her life so much better.

While I understand that America has a very real dependence on the pharmaceutical industry which needs to be corrected, it's a logical fallacy to use anecdotal evidence to make the sweeping statement that ADHD (and its spectrum) is not a true disorder. I agree with the author's point that other countries, with their longer recess times, have lower numbers of diagnoses. But the fact that other countries still diagnose individuals with ADHD should, in and of itself, show that ADHD is a real issue! By proposing that ADHD symptoms can be fixed by joining sports or avoiding artificial colorings, the author is doing a disservice to all of the individuals that suffer from the disorder and aren't helped by an extra half-hour on the playground.

Let me be clear: I am not saying that I believe every diagnosis of ADHD is correct. I'm a huge supporter of tightening the boundaries for an ADHD diagnosis, because when your diagnosis rests on the idea of being excitable or inattentive you're basically describing every 4-year old I've ever met. And I've met several people that have convinced their doctors to give them a prescription because they're ""sure they have ADD"". All of these things are issues that need to be fixed in order to give credibility to the very real disorder that affects people's abilities to live their lives. But to call ADHD diagnoses a war on childhood and boyhood, and to imply that parents are pumping their children full of mental steroids and speed, is so gross that I can't even finish my rebuttal.

I'm pretty shocked that this author got published.

Edit: missed an apostrophe

Edit 2: Like I said in a comment: the idea that the discoverer of ADHD (Dr. Leon Eisenberg) had renounced the disorder on his deathbed is a hoax. The original interview can be found [here](http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-83865282.html) if you read German. Otherwise, I'll explain: Google Translate, as an automated process, mistranslated the man's words (who was not on his deathbed, but making coffee in his kitchen 2 years before dying). He had expressed concern that it was over-diagnosed, but never said anything to imply that he had fabricated the disorder to make money. Please stop throwing this hoax around in the comments; the guy who spread the hoax makes money off of claiming that doctors invent disorders.

But what really disgusts me is how indicative this is of the progressive/feminist groups. They bully. They scream misogyny/sexism. You have to agree with their view points or you are their enemy. You are a misogynist. There is no room for debate.

The Anita Sarkeesians of the movement are basically the modern Al Sharptons. They live and feed on manufactured controversy.

Then companies and people are scared shitless and cater and bow down to these groups because if they don't, the Sarkeesians will label you or your products as sexist and now you have millions of angry women causing a shit storm. It's blackmailing. 

These people ruin true progress because they divide, and make enemies. They don't want to have a conversation or debate. They want you to bow down and agree or be labeled a sexist pig. Problem is, not all women agree on gender issues. Not everyone agrees on what is sexist. We need debate, we need discussions.

This lady at Rolling Stones is cut from the same cloth. Get ready, with Clintons campaign will come this ""war on women"". And leading the charge will be the psycho feminists that don't want to have debate. And sadly, too many women will buy into this crap and fall in line.

Edit: wow I'm glad people are seeing this. Figured posting too late would mean not many would see it. So thank you to everyone that took the time to read this. 

To be clear, I believe both genders have many issues they face, and it requires both genders communicating with one another and understanding. Even gender issues that are negative towards women, can also have a negative impact on men. We are intertwined, and I believe we can only ever truly fix gender issues if we focus on both gender problems rather than divide and focus on only one gender. Because again, a lot of gender issues are actually connected.

I reject the idea that just because women might have had more issues historically, that male issues can wait, be ignored, or pushed to the side while we deal with female issues first. All this does is divide and it makes people less likely to care or understand. It also can have unintended consequences. For instance,  a gap between genders in higher education as a result of focusing on one gender over the other to try to get more women to reach male enrollment numbers. 

More support should have been given to women in pursuing higher education, but equal support should have been given to men at the same time. But a lot of women and feminists don't care. They only care about their genders issues, and have no empathy. Or they don't see male issues a priority because they believe men had more privilege and less gender issues. 

I'm just sick and tired of feminists and progressive groups bullying people into supporting their view points. Not all women agree on their own gender issues. The same way not all men agree on their own genders issues. We need to talk about things, and have that conversation. We need to have more empathy for both genders, and try to listen and understand the issues.

I don't expect men to listen to me if I'm shouting them down and calling them a minsogynst if they don't agree with me. I sure as hell don't expect them to care, if my attitude is that their gender issues don't matter, and that we need to focus on women's issues only (or prioritize it above male issues).

""Greetings, gentlemen. It has now been almost 240 years since the birth of the United States. If all has gone according to the plan, you will by now be recovering from a second civil war, pitting the oligarchic forces that were necessary to the rise of American dominance in the mid-20th Century against the newer, more liberal ideals that began their rise during the 1960s.

""With the collapse of the socialist Russian Empire during the 1970s, The United States was able to expand its power base and undergo a shift away from the intensely capitalistic, fear-driven attitudes of the standoff during the thirty years following the Second Great War of the 20th Century.

"CireArodum","","","I used to be a teller in a bank and I have a pretty good guess as to what was actually going on here.

First off, it's not illegal to make cash deposits of less than $10,000 or more than $10,000. When you have over $10,000 cash to deposit, you can just deposit it all at once. When you do that the bank needs to file and submit a report, with info on who is depositing and on behalf of whom. It takes all of 5 minutes to complete in most cases. The point of the law is to track when very large sums of US cash is exchanged. This, according to the government will help catch and prosecute drug dealers, money launderers, etc. Of course the vast majority of these transactions are legitimate, but that's just what happens when you cast a net.

What you *cannot* do is purposely structure your deposits in such a way as to avoid the mandatory reporting. What raises a flag is when you deposit $9,800 in the morning then $300 later that day or the next day (arbitrary numbers, any amount totaling over $10,000 cash). If it happens once a bank employee will probably not think much of it. However, if there is a pattern of it in your account then there's a reasonable chance the person is purposely doing it, in which case an unusual activity report will be filed.

So, what probably happened here is that his niece was making a large cash deposit. When this happened the teller had to do a report. This probably flustered the niece and/or the owner and they got defensive and angry (just a guess here because that almost always happens). Then the teller, deciding for themselves it was legitimate, and not wanting to deal with the headache, told them that if their cash deposits are under $10,000 they can avoid doing the report.

*That is illegal.*

A bank employee is not allowed to discuss the reporting process with a customer. If the customer asks, there is an official government notice that is to be printed and given to them. Teller probably either did not know about the notice or was too lazy to print it. But they would definitely know it's illegal to tell the customer how to structure. The teller can be personally charged for this.

Either the bank's back office noticed the structuring or the niece ended up going to another teller who actually does their job correctly. This was my favorite. Customer comes in to make 2 deposits for over $10,000 cash. Sure no problem, just need to do this report, it'll only take a moment. Then customer insists they don't need to do the report because they structured... This is a 100% guaranteed way to have an unusual activity report filed on you.

So, I'm guessing they returned this guy's money because the teller advised him to structure. So they probably went after the teller now. Teller should have just done their job correctly.

So, to be 100% clear. If you need to deposit over $10,000 cash, just go and do it as normal. The bank will probably need to fill out a report. It'll only take a few minutes, then you're done. Don't get flustered. You haven't done anything wrong. You're not being treated like a criminal. This is much more mundane than you realize.

Or of course, if you don't think you should have to report large cash transactions to the government, then write your local Senator/Representative.

I, unlike some other officers, won't charge them with occupying a driver seat while intoxicated.

I usually call their friend or family member for them or I give them a ride home myself if it's in my beat (and no I don't tow their vehicle.) But I stand by what I said. If someone makes the decision to drive drunk or under the influence of something else than I will arrest their ass. I would really rather not work a death scene of the driver or someone they hit and killed. I am not just looking out for other people, I am looking out for the offender too.

For those asking how Cannabis helps I can only answer from personal experience, Crohn's is an auto-immune condition that can manifest almost anywhere but as noted most often it kicks us in the ass, or near to it.
For me I lost about 1/3rd large intestine and a few feet of small. The daily effects (from years of crohn's, crohn's meds and surgery) are pain, nausea, vommiting, bad drops in appetitie, spasms, feeling like you have been kicked in the nuts really hard etc Pretty much go down the list and cannabis helps, I could use the 'real' medicines but for most the impact on me is far worse than pot - the nausea meds for example leave me in near stupor for near 24 hours.

"mikeappell","","","[Here's the video, for those who haven't seen.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0gxbCg5_jk)

Having watched it, I can understand why the police officer felt his life were endangered enough to fire his weapon.

Was he justified in doing so? That's up to the grand jury and eventually regular jury that will presumably hear this case. But from what I've seen and read:

1) The officer who fired had arrested Reid in the past, and presumably recognized him. And that Reid had, thirteen years ago, been sent to jail for shooting at police officers, something which the officer was presumably aware of as he knew him personally. So the officer was aware that he had a history of violence against police.

2) The officer saw a weapon in the glove compartment, and reached into the car to pull it out. That was visible from the video. So it was established that there was at least one, presumably illegal (since Reid or the driver never stopped to mention that he had a license) firearm in the car.

*Edit:* I'm told that in many states you don't need a license to have a firearm in your vehicle, and that it isn't required to tell an officer if you do [though other people have told me that in Jersey, firearms in vehicles must be kept in closed cases, and not directly accessible.] Nonetheless, the officer being aware of Reid's history of shooting at police officers combined with knowing there was at least one firearm in the vehicle makes it understandable that he was extremely tense concerning his own personal safety.

3) Reid apparently disregarded the officer's orders to keep his hands where they could be seen, and apparently continually made motions like he was reaching for something. I say this because for nearly a full minute, the only interactions between Reid and the officer were the officer repeatedly telling him to stay still, and keep his hands in sight. I have a hard time imagining the officer repeating this order 10 times if Reid had simply put his hands on the dash and stopped moving completely.

*Edit:* Several people have pointed out that the officer at various points gave conflicting instructions: get out of the car versus stay still and keep your hands visible. However, the instructions to his partner to ""get him out of the car"" were given all the way at the beginning of the altercation, and every subsequent instruction to Reid was ""don't move"" and ""show me your hands."" Logically, Reid should have followed the later orders, but logic doesn't always win when somebody has a gun thrust into your car window.

4) Reid then got out of the car, on the same side as the officer was, against orders. When Reid exited the car, he was within three feet of the officer, and close enough to rush him if he decided to. I completely understand why the officer felt threatened by Reid as he exited the car.

5) From the video, it seems like the officer tried to prevent Reid from exiting the vehicle by pushing with all his weight against the door to keep it closed. If so, that's a pretty clear indication for Reid to not leave the vehicle. However, I've had other people suggest that the officer was trying to pull the door *open*. Now, every single verbal order to Reid was to stay in the car; however, if the officer were trying to pull the door open, it's somewhat more understandable for him to exit the vehicle.

All of this, to me, adds up to a very understandable reason as to why Reid ended up shot. But I'm not on the jury, and they'll presumably have access to far more information than I do right now. My point is that, to me, this is clearly not an open-and-shut case of ""officer shoots unarmed man without cause.""

*Le Grand Edit:* I'm not arguing that this is a clear cut case. I'm not saying that the officer was clearly justified in shooting Reid. I'm trying to remind people that it's very easy to come into a situation with a preexisting bias, and due to recent events in this country as well as the various media circuses surrounding them, a **lot** of people are stringently anti-cop or pro-cop. But each situation like this needs to be taken on its own merits, and it's important to weigh the facts as they're presented.

To me, it's far too early to conclusively say that the officer was justified in shooting Reid, or even whether he over-reacted to the situation he was presented with. However, and I recognize these things are subjective, it seems very clear that the officer was sincere in his feeling threatened by Reid, and that the reasons for that stand up to scrutiny, and so I'm inclined to give the officer the benefit of the doubt.

"WhynotstartnoW","","","The Keystone XL pipeline is a made up political controversy, and virtually no one debating it knows what they are talking about.

Facts: Bush+Cheney and the respective congress approved phase one of the project, and Obama+Biden and the democratic senate approved phase two and three.

Phase one through three of the Keystone XL pipeline travel from Alberta to Port Arthur and Houston on the gulf coast of Texas.

Phase three was completed and commissioned in January of 2014. The pipeline has been pumping tar sands crude from Alberta to refineries on the gulf coast for *A WHOLE YEAR NOW!*

What the current phase, phase four, being 'debated' in congress right now will do is shorten the developed length of the *currently operational* pipeline by several hundred miles by bypassing Manitoba, Saskatchewan, North Dakota and most of South Dakota by instead passing from Alberta to Montana to Nebraska(instead of the current path which travels east through Manitoba and Saskatchewan then south through ND, SD, and Nebraska).

The pipeline currently being *debated* in congress will not increase or decrease the amount of crude being pumped through it, the same amount will be entering everyday at the injection sites and the same amount will be exiting at the refineries. The proposed bypass would simply make it slightly cheaper per barrel to push through. 

**Again: The Keystone XL pipeline is currently pumping at capacity and the proposed bypass will not change the capacity at all.**

Everyone will ignore this like they do every time this subject comes up, they will just remain in their fantasy land of massive made up political controversies without even bothering to do a google search on the subject, not a single person in this thread should not know that the pipeline is currently operational and pumping yet all the top comment threads are all people talking about how we shouldn't let them pipe through our country as if it already isn't.

Approving or not approving of this pipeline will not affect how much crude is transported by truck or train in the slightest, idk where people are even getting that argument from..

Also if you're not a member of the Teamsters, The United Association of Pipefitters, or the International Brotherhood of Electricians or are not affiliated with the AFL CIO, you're not gonna being seeing one of these positions on the pipeline.

This is probably the most frustrating political topic of the decade so far. Seriously, why did no one care when Bush and Obama approved the actual pipeline, but now everyone is up in arms about a small little section of it which will have virtually no affect on anything at all. If Obama and the Democrats actually cared about this why are they making their 'stand' at this point instead of doing it when it might have actually stopped the oil from flowing? seriously....

Edit: From the environmental standpoint: This proposed bypass will pass over the same aquifers that it is currently pumping over, but the foot print of the pipeline over those aquifers will be significantly reduced.

Like most, I was not surprised when I heard HRC threw her hat in the ring. What did surprise me was the tepid response her hat received. I may be an outlier, but my Facebook and Twitter were almost silent. So was reddit, digg, and other aggregators. Hell, even HuffPo cribbed the enthusiasm. In short, it seems that, excepting cable news, no one gives a shit. And there's a good reason for this. 

Hillary, it's not us. It's you. 

Remember 2006? How the entire country was sure you'd be the next president? How it seemed the nomination was merely a formality? And then here comes this young whippersnapper. Talking a good game. Saying what we wanted to hear. And everything changed. 

Except, it didn't. We all still want the things that Obama promised but rarely delivered. Though it's taken a severe blow, our hope is that we can pull ourselves out of the partisanship, the corporate favoritism, the us-vs-them mentality. We hope that we can restore the American Dream and the middle class. And there is nothing you can say to make us believe you feel the same. 

Hillary, you have treated the presidency as if it was your right. As if you are entitled to it and that surely the masses must elect you. After all, how could they vote otherwise? Well, it's because we are tired of the bullshit. We are tired of a system that forces us to vote for the person we dislike least. The reason you lost in 2007 is because we wanted anyone but you.  Your solution to this? Make sure that this time no one runs against you. 

My generation has been advertised to our whole lives. We can smell bullshit a mile away. And I can smell what you're selling through a TV screen. 

The plain truth is that you will probably win. While the GOP does its best to out-crazy itself, you should be able to build a winning ticket. A winning vote coalition. But the country won't be celebrating. We won't be as hopeful as we were 8 years ago. Rather, your nomination will disillusion us more. And the sad part is that things for most of us won't be bad enough to make us, as Americans, as citizens, demand and enforce real change. The road we all walk ends with Huns at the gates of Rome.

"Hodaka","","","Massachusetts here. This is weird, and needs a bit of explanation. 

First, for non US redditors, this refers to a decision made by school administration in a small town located in the state of Massachusetts. Therefore, ""School administrators in Massachusetts"" is a bit misleading. This is not a statewide decision. It's frankly not much of a decision at all.

Second, the title is again misleading here, as no one is actually being ""excluded."" As many in this thread have pointed out, this is simply an ""American themed"" dance, on par with a Fourth of July celebration.

Third, while I actually know of a few elementary schools in the state where an ""American themed"" party not be might be the best choice, Lexington High School is not one of them. These schools have a majority enrollment of young children from immigrant families where some, such as refugee families, have yet to attain full citizenship. While it's a bit delicate, there are not many dances held in these elementary schools to begin with.

Fourth: Lexington is an incredibly wealthy town. Here's some edited data from Wiki: ""In 2014, the mean home price was $814,583, and the median home price was $1,395,000. According to a 2012 estimate, the median income for a household in the town was $191,350, and the median income for a family was $218,890. By race, the median household income was highest for mixed race households, at $263,321. Hispanic households had a median income of $233,875. Asian households had a median income of $178,988. White households had a median income of $154,533. Black households had a median income of $139,398. American Indian or Alaskan Native households had a median income of $125,139.""

Fifth: [Here](http://profiles.doe.mass.edu/profiles/student.aspx?orgcode=01550505&amp;orgtypecode=6&amp;) is the enrollment data for Lexington High, the school in question. ""Asian"" students make up second largest ethic group, with roughly 31% of the school population. While it is possible this made administrators feel uncomfortable, I'm guessing the kids could really care less.

Sixth: I wouldn't worry too much about the students at Lexington High. Roughly 98% of the students graduate, and the majority go on to [private four year colleges.](http://profiles.doe.mass.edu/profiles/student.aspx?orgcode=01550505&amp;orgtypecode=6&amp;leftNavId=307&amp;) Practically no one is seeking immediate employment after graduation.

"beleca","","","I think it's pretty obvious what happened.  This girl was an art major.  She had to do her thesis, and she came up with the mattress idea, which, honestly, is perfect given how the art world works these days: its salacious, controversial, easily explained (e.g. in a newspaper article), requires no real technical proficiency, deals with a favorite pet political issue of the modern art-buying left, and lends itself well to the kind of hype that sells art.  Theres even mattress-based precedents like ""Everyone I've Ever Slept With"", which is a defining work of the YBA period, and was hyped by Saatchi and Tate until it sold for millions (but if I was a struggling, talented visual artist, I'd look at this and call it hack, cliche, all the stuff good thought-provoking art isn't supposed to be).  



The only problem was that she hadn't been raped.  She knew she couldnt just pick a random guy to accuse of rape; that'd be too easily disproved.   But the idea was too good to pass up, so she thought ""well, I did have sex with him, and he was kinda shitty to me, and no one can really prove that he didn't rape me, so if there's a little collateral damage,  who cares?  Bigger picture: I get to be an artist and rape culture makes the news.  Everyone wins.  Except maybe the guy"".


If there was any more thought put into this in the planning stages,  it wasn't much more.  And she figured that worst possible scenario, hes found to be innocent in a year or two, but by then I'll already have commissions coming in and speaking engagements and work as a professional artist.  And she wasn't making the accusation to a cop, she was making it ""in her art"", so the worst thing she could get sued for would be slander or something related to his reputation, and suing her wouldn't even be worth the cost of the lawyer.


So she wins.  There are absolutely no consequences for what she did, and even if it gets proven false without a shadow of a doubt,  there will still be hordes of feminists defending her.  When people talk about ""raising the price"" of intentional false rape claims, the refrain from feminists is ""but that will discourage real victims from reporting for fear that if they cant prove it, they'll go to jail"".  Unfortunately, thats a risk we're going to have to take.  How much is a man's reputation worth?  How about a year in jail?  Or an expulsion?  Rape is horrible and real rapists need to go to jail, but there has to be some competing risk that will make a woman think twice before ruining a man's life with a false accusation.  If a woman gets drunk and gets behind the wheel of a car and kills someone, the law holds her responsible.  If a woman gets drunk and stabs a man in a fight, the law holds her responsible.  If a woman gets drunk and gets in bed with a drunk man, the man is solely responsible for whatever happens, and sometimes for what could have happened.

"DickWhiskey","","","We discussed this recent decision in some depth at /r/law and I think that it's appropriate to explain it a little bit here. There is an important distinction in this opinion between stating *scientific fact* versus stating *religious opinion*. 

In this opinion, the judge essentially ruled that it is consumer fraud to state as a *scientific fact* that homosexuality is a mental disorder or that it can be cured (e.g., ""Scientists believe that homosexuality is a disease and our program cures it!""). But the judge finds that it would not be fraud to state that you, or your company, has the *opinion* that homosexuality is a mental disorder or can be cured (e.g., ""We believe that homosexuality is a disease and our religious program cures it!""). 

In doing so, the court is able to punish false statements concerning conversion therapy but still allows protected First Amendment speech regarding opinions. The opinion also made some other findings - one was that a conversion therapy program couldn't state that it had a success rate without some sort of data to base it on (the company claimed a high success rate but never collected any data to support it). You can read in more detail about it (including the opinion itself, at this /r/law thread [HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/law/comments/2vjh72/new_jersey_judge_rules_that_socalled_conversion/). 

EDIT: There's a bit of misunderstanding that I didn't anticipate. Some people believe that the judge is making this determination himself. To be abundantly clear, he is not. In a civil case like this, both sides present expert witnesses who testify as to their positions. The judge acts as the ""gatekeeper"" - he determines whether the opinions are scientific and reliable. There are whole treatises on how that is done properly, but to keep it short, in New Jersey the judge is required to determine if the opinions are based on techniques that are in general acceptance in the scientific community (also called the Frye standard):

&gt;In New Jersey, reliability of a scientific technique can
be proven in most cases by showing its ""general acceptance in the
particular field in which it belongs."" Frye v. United States, 293
F. 1013, 1014 (D.C. Cir. 1923); Windmere, Inc. v. Int'l Ins. Co.,
105 N.J. 373, 385, 522 n. 2 (1987); State v. Harvey, 151 N.J. 117,
169-7 0 (19 97). 

&gt;General acceptance of an area of research or
expertise can be established in one of three ways:
(1) by expert testimony as to the general
acceptance, among those in the profession, of
the premises on which the proffered expert
witness based his or her analysis; (2) **by
authoritative scientific and legal writings
indicating that the scientific community
accepts the premises underlying the proffered
testimony;** and (3) by judicial opinions that
indicate the expert's premises have gained
general acceptance.

In this case, the judge heard from several expert witnesses on both sides, who submitted reports and testimony in support of their opinions. He published a previous evidentiary opinion on this issue, which can be found [HERE](http://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/downloads/case/jonahopinion.pdf), and expressly relied upon that opinion in the one linked by OP. The judge found that some of the experts on the defense side did not meet the expert standards. In addition, he outlined a number of reasons why he concluded that the *scientific community* (not himself) does not believe that homosexuality is a mental disorder:

&gt;""The court also relies upon the **numerous studies** attached as exhibits to the Bensman Certification in support of Plaintiffs' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, which support the contention that **homosexuality is a natural variation of human sexuality**.""

...

&gt;Countless organizations have
followed the APA's lead in removing homosexuality from its listings
of mental disorders; these include the World Health Organization
(WHO), the Royal College of Psychiatrists, the APA, and the
American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. See
Certification of Lina Bensman, Exhibit 75. That scientific
conclusion also has been embraced as part of the public policy of
the State of New Jersey. See N.J.S.A. 45:1-54(a) declaring that,
in light of scientific community's finding, **""[b]eing lesbian, gay,
or bisexual is not a disease, disorder, illness, deficiency, or
shortcoming. The major professional associations of mental health
practitioners and researchers in the United States have recognized
this fact for nearly 40 years""**); see also King v. Governor of the
State of N.J., 767 F.3d 216, 238 (3d Cir. 2014) (affirming N.J.S.A.
45:1-54's prohibition against providing [conversion] counseling to minors
and noting that 'legislatures are entitled to rely on the
empirical judgments of independent professional organizations that
possess specialized knowledge and experience concerning the professional practice under review, particularly when this
community has spoken with such urgency and solidarity on the
subject""). JONAH hardly can argue that all of these organizations
-- including a federal appellate court -- were the victims of
manipulation by ""gay lobbying"" groups. Regardless, it is not up
to this court to decide that question. . . .

&gt;In contrast to Rubanick, the theory that homosexuality is a
disorder is not novel but -- like the notion that the earth is
flat and the sun revolves around it -- instead is outdated and
refuted. Homosexuality was listed as a mental disorder in the DSM
until its removal in 1973. Although the DSM has added newly
recognized disorders as a result of evolving understandings of the
medical field, this case presents the opposite situation: **the APA
removed homosexuality from the DSM upon concluding that it was not
a disorder.** JONAH has not identified any case that provides a
standard for the admission of obsolete and discredited scientific
theories. **By definition, such theories are unreliable and can
offer no assistance to the jury**, but rather present only confusion
and prejudice. . . .

&gt;The existence of a
minority of conversion therapy proponents does not and cannot
negate the fact that **the DSM and its exclusion of homosexuality
are generally accepted in the mental health field.**

So, to summarize, the judge did not find any scientific fact himself. He relied upon the DSM, statements from the APA, numerous other organizations that have followed the APA's determination, as well as laws passed in NJ, to find that it is generally accepted in the scientific community that homosexuality is not a mental disorder.

"Homeschooled-perv","","","Throwaway here for obvious reasons.
I was raised in a very Christian home as my parents wanted to shelter me from worldly things. Just to give you a little perspective on what I knew about sex - when I was 18 and in college I googled how does a woman get pregnant. Yes, at the age of 18 google taught me how a woman has a baby.


So as you can imagine I wasn't around a ton of girls, except my older sister, younger sister (Rachael), some at church, some hot babes at pokemon, etc. Rachel was especially close to me and in my mother's words ""she was your shadow"". I did everything with them, hell we even bathed together. I unfortunately remember a time when I was bathing with Rachael and I had her lay down in the bath tub and I tried to get on top of her. Thankfully, she didn't let me. Also, another time while she was on the computer I got on her chair and had her sit on my lap. I was trying to get her to sit on my erect penis (through my shorts and through her clothes so absolutely no penetration). We were probably both teenagers at the time and I absolutely cringe and am ashamed when I think of it and I can only hope she doesn't remember it. But as I said, I did not know that was wrong, I didn't even know exactly why I was doing it. I was just horny and she was a girl who was my best friend.



There was another time when Rachael and I were laying down together and we made up a ""game"" where she had to find a ball under the covers. Turns out that was just so she could get under the covers and dry hump me. After playing it for a couple of minutes I called her out on it so she stopped and left the room. I wouldn't call her a sexual pervert and I don't think anyone else should. I don't remember our ages but she probably wasn't even a teenager at that time and neither of us really knew what we were doing, we just knew it felt good and was exciting. And if you're wondering, my sister and I did NOT ever actually have sex of any kind.



There are a couple more stories similar to these and I regret them all. I am her older brother and I should not have done them, but that's what you get when you mix zero sex knowledge and isolate kids. I wouldn't call myself a pervert as I don't believe my past actions, when I was an ignorant and isolated kid, should by held against me now. As for this Duggard boy, I don't know exactly what he did and or what he knew about sex, but I can only imagine his upbringing was similar to mine. I feel sorry for him as I doubt he knew what he was doing and I can only imagine how much he regrets it. I don't regret my parents home schooling me and I am still a Christian. However,  I think they could have handled sex education better but who knows maybe I'm just a pervert. All in all I think before anyone casts this man as a sexual predator and calls for his crucifixion, I kindly ask that one consider his upbringing and try putting themselves in his shoes.",1432331377,"","1432345203",1,690,"news"

Then I'd go home, sleep a few hours, wake up, have a couple of hours to myself, go back to my night job.  

There came a point in my life where I physically couldn't do it any more.  I was probably worse off driving than the drunks on the road.  I was miserable.  I would want to cry I was so tired.  But I couldn't cry.  And though I was working a lot, I wasn't making much money, nor was I receiving very good benefits.  

People used to admire my work ethic.  They'd see me hauling ass and tell me I was one of the good ones.
I quit.  Once I quit, it was like I never worked a day in my life.  People treated me like an unemployed bum.  Nevermind that I hauled ass and worked while everybody slept then went to *another* job.  
Nevermind that I had to deal with a job that found a way to fuck me out of overtime by scheduling the week in a way where I could work 6 days straight and have the days placed on different weeks.  
Once I was unemployed, I was nothing in society's eyes.  I was a leech.  
I quit so I wasn't eligible for any benefits.  I lost my health benefits but gained my sleep, sanity and my actual health.  
So I had my savings to fall back on.  

My point after this rant is, people act like those receiving benefits are all deadbeats.  I wish I could quality for them, but sadly I couldn't.  
Most people on benefits have worked, but through some circumstances, need some help.  Many of them **still** work but aren't making enough money to make ends meet.  
Once you're in need of a hand, people act like you've never contributed to society.

You know what makes people feel human?  A little money spent on themselves.  A little bit of a treat. Even a movie ticket to just forget your situation is nice.  A workout is nice.  A swim would be wonderful.  They're not living a wonderful life.  Unemployment fucking sucks, and underemployment fucking sucks.  But sometimes you have to feel like you're not losing your mind with the absolute bare minimum.  

I need to be able to spend a bit on myself to feel like a human being again.  And not extravagance either.  When I was working my ass off at night I remember hearing about people who were getting benefits and buying new iPhone or showing pictures of their toes soaking in the sun in Cancun.  **That** pisses me right off.  If you wanna crack down on people crack down on people who abuse the system to that degree.  But the guy who just wants to see a movie to forget the 20 online job applications he just filled out?  Come on...

2 - He knows the probability of him taking a single lash is very low. That doesn't mean he is unwilling or ignorant as to the effects of a lashing, it means he is realistic. He knows he won't be lashed, so he is safe to offer himself up. In doing so, he not only improves his sense of self-worth, he also looks much more heroic in the eyes of his peers.

&gt; Dear ___________,
&gt; 
&gt; Consider the following statement by John Kerry in his farewell speech to the Senate —
&gt; 
&gt; ""The unending chase for money I believe threatens to steal our democracy itself. They know it. They know we know it. And yet, Nothing Happens!"" — John Kerry, 2-13
&gt; 
&gt; In a July 2012 Gallup poll, 87% tagged corruption in the federal government as extremely important or very important, placing this issue just barely behind job creation. According to Gallup, public faith in Congress is at a 41-year record low, 7%. (June 2014) Kerry is correct. The popular perception outside the DC beltway is that the federal government is corrupt and the US Congress is the major problem. As a voter, I’m a member of the only political body with authority over Congress. I’m demanding reform and declaring a voter’s rebellion in a manner consistent with Jefferson’s description of rights in the Declaration of Independence. As a member of Congress, you have three options.
&gt; 
&gt; 1.	You may pretend corruption does not exist.
&gt; 
&gt; 2.	You may pretend to oppose corruption while you sabotage reform.
&gt; 
&gt; 3.	You may actively participate in real reform.
&gt; 
&gt; If you’re considering option 1, you may wonder if voters really know what the 'chase for money' is. Your dismal and declining popularity documented by Gallup suggests we know, but allow a few examples, by no means a complete list. That these practices are legal does not make them right! Obviously, it is Congress who writes the laws that make corruption legal.
&gt; 
&gt; 1.	Dozens of major and very profitable corporations pay nothing in taxes. Voters know how this is done. Corporations pay millions to lobbyists for special legislation. Many companies on the list of freeloaders are household names — GE, Boeing, Exxon Mobil, Verizon, Citigroup, Dow …
&gt; 
&gt; 2.	Almost half of the retiring members of Congress from 1998 to 2004 got jobs as lobbyists earning on average fourteen times their Congressional salary. (50% of the Senate, 42% of the House)
&gt; 
&gt; 3.	The new democratic freshmen to the US House in 2012 were 'advised' by the party to schedule 4 hours per day on the phones fund raising at party headquarters (because fund raising is illegal from gov’t offices.) It is the donors with deep pockets who get the calls, but seldom do the priorities of the rich donor help the average citizen.
&gt; 
&gt; 4.	The relevant (rich) donors who command the attention of Congress are only .05% of the public (5 people in a thousand) but these aristocrats of both parties are who Congress really works for. As a member of the US Congress, you should work only for The People.
&gt; 
&gt; 1.	Not yourself.
&gt; 
&gt; 2.	Not your political party.
&gt; 
&gt; 3.	Not the richest donors to your campaign.
&gt; 
&gt; 4.	Not the lobbyist company who will hire you after your leave Congress.
&gt; 
&gt; There are several credible groups working to reform Congress. Their evaluations of the problem are remarkably in agreement though the leadership (and membership) may lean conservative or liberal. They see the corrupting effect of money — how the current rules empower special interests through lobbyists and PACs — robbing the average American of any representation on any issue where the connected have a stake. This is not democracy even if the ritual of elections is maintained.
&gt; 
&gt; The various mechanisms which funnel money to candidates and congress-persons are complex. It happens before they are elected, while they are in office and after they leave Congress. Fortunately, a solution to corruption is not complicated. All the proposals are built around either reform legislation or a Constitutional Amendment. Actually, we need both — a constitutional amendment and legislation.
&gt; 
&gt; There will be discussion about the structure and details of reform. As I see it, campaign finance reform is the cornerstone of building an honest Congress. Erect a wall of separation between our elected officials and big money. This you must do — or your replacement will do. A corporation is not 'people' and no individual should be allowed to spend hundreds of millions to 'influence' an election. That much money is a megaphone which drowns out the voices of 'We the People.' Next, a retired member of Congress has a lifelong obligation to avoid the appearance of impropriety. That almost half the retired members of Congress work as lobbyists and make millions of dollars per year smells like bribery, however legal. It must end. Pass real campaign finance reform and prohibit even the appearance of payola after retirement and you will be part of a Congress I can respect.
&gt; 
&gt; The states have the power to pass a Constitutional Amendment without Congress — and we will. You in Congress will likely embrace the change just to survive, because liberals and conservatives won’t settle for less than democracy. The leadership and organization to coordinate a voters revolution exist now! New groups will add their voices because the vast majority of Americans believe in the real democracy we once had, which Congress over time has eroded to the corrupt, dysfunctional plutocracy we have.
&gt; 
&gt; The question is where YOU individually stand. You have three options and you must choose.

&gt; Sincerely,

The regulations will help prevent unfair practices from stifling competition. It prohibits telecommunications companies from creating paid prioritization for companies that can afford it and pushing companies that can't into a 'slow lane' connection. This is beneficial to you as the consumer because it ensures that when you go to ANY (legal) website, your path to the site will not be blocked, rate limited, or impeded in any way. This also removes the restrictions enacted on a state level that has restricted competition. There are state laws that block municipal broadband because bigger telcos have the money to fill the coffers of local officials enough to vote in their favor. So the next Google Fiber site or local community can now vote for municipal broadband without worrying about a state law that prevents them from building their own.

I say this after having worked for some of the biggest ISP's in the world for over 12 years. We make money, LOTS of money. Interconnect fees are cheap in comparison to the profit generated per customer (residential or commercial). We have emails floating back and forth literally gloating how much profit we'd made. I've also been part of projects that throttle traffic, not because we didn't have the infrastructure or bandwidth to support the hub site, but because we wanted to squeeze more out of the customer. 

As someone who has a lot of experience in the industry, this is a long time coming.

"makinmywaydowntown","","","This sort of thing boils my blood. PETA were our (MEANING MY SQUAD! I DON'T SPEAK FOR THE WHOLE ARMY - Thanks Niko) biggest enemy in New Orleans after Katrina hit. I spent months in that city watching it go from absolute chaos to a ghost town and finally to life restored. It was an incredible and dynamic thing to watch, but beyond the looters, curfew breakers, and rogue Police returning in stolen Cadillacs to try to steal equipment to sell online, the group that drove me to a rage much more readily were the PETA activists. The military had a uniform marking system for clearing homes after the storm. It was a huge Spray-painted 'X' with a circle around it. You'd spray information in the four triangle shaped quadrant spaces of the X. Date/Time group in the North of the X, Unit designation to the East, Human dead in the South, Animal dead in the West. Simple. Just numbers. Somehow the PETA people broke our code, and they started following us, about a mile or two back, and when they'd see a house with an Animal dead count, they'd either enter to check it out, or just assume I suppose, and would proceed to completely vandalize the home with their own markings. Half the time they'd be spray painting OVER TOP of our markers, which ensuing units, haz-mat crews, and recovery teams NEEDED for information. They'd leave these messages in stark red paint all over whole sides of the house, 'YOU MURDERED YOUR DOG!' or 'ANIMAL KILLER!' Meanwhile, many animals themselves were roving the streets of the lower wards in make-shift packs, feeding on whatever they could find; sometimes drowned bodies. We'd make trips NorthEast about 45 minutes away to an open grocery store and buy tons of bags of animal food, and just split it open on dry street corners as we passed in our HMMWVs. The PETA people didn't even do that! They just walked around vandalizing people's already destroyed homes. THEN, when we'd CATCH THEM, they'd have the tenacity to demand food and water from us, claiming they were part of the 'clean-up' effort. I was usually hanging out the rear passenger side of the truck. We'd take the doors off. We'd intentionally clear about 8 blocks, wait, turn around and double-back to catch them. I'd confiscate their paint and took great delight in 'handing them' some water, at a high rate of speed, right at their faces. As if these families haven't lost enough... and here you are with this world view that you're hell bent on viciously forcing down other people's throats. Imagine having to make that choice for a family? The Coast Guard weren't taking animals in their baskets. Room for people only. Imagine leaving your pet on that rooftop. Many people didn't you know. The Coast Guard actually CHANGED their rule book to allow space for domestic animals in recovery efforts, because so many people chose to remain and die with their pets. Then these people, these small petty people come down there and disrupt our operation to recover that city from complete destruction, AND sap our resources of food and water while on their wild crusade... I like to think I'm as accepting and empathetic as I can possibly be, but I have no love for those type of people. Terrible story. I'm sorry for Maya's family.

Edit: Thanks kindly for Gold, fellows! Packing it in here for tonight, I'll respond to any more questions in the morning!

Edit 2: Thanks again for the comments, I try to reply to everyone in some capacity so bear with me. I've gotten a few replies that are concerned with how real this story is, so I'd like to try and address anything that seems overly fanciful. I get colorful in speech and text. All of these encounters with PETA activists numbered perhaps a dozen, and over the course of about two to three weeks. It was a strange time in the Katrina time-line where the city was a ghost town and the organized units of recovery teams and people from all corners of the country hadn't arrived en masse. When my unit moved down to the Convention Center there in New Orleans there was still gang related violence going on inside. We had to remove bodies from homicides hours before cleaning the place with power washers and setting up a cot city. The people responsible for the spray painting I talked about traveled in very small groups, two's or three's, often couples, and affected maybe a total of thirty houses over the stretch of three to four miles of the New Orleans suburb. On the macro scale it was isolated and contained, and we didn't have an issue with them after about a month of the cleanup operation. Once caught, these individuals either gave up their paint and made their way to the convention center to be ushered away from the city on buses after a few days, maybe after a stern talking to, or they relinquished their paint and just went home immediately. This was a time in that city post Katrina that was pretty lawless and, unfortunately for my 'case' I suppose... wasn't sure I was making one... goes largely undocumented. During those early weeks after the storm, groups like power companies, gas companies, other utilities and clean up efforts played a dodgy game of trying to render services while also avoid looters who would take their gear, sometimes at gun-point or threat of violence. In a largely abandoned and powerless urban center, a gasoline generator is worth diamonds, and any crew that came with one became a target after curfew. The other large part of our mission besides clearing and marking homes was protecting them. It's true that I didn't see much media there at first, and I don't know why, so I guess you'll have to take me at my word. That's a dangerous thing to do on the internet, I realize. Not really sure how else to say that I'm not blowing wind up your ass. Have a great day, all!

Edit 3: There's an amazing book about New Orleans after Katrina that I think every American, or individual interested in the event, should read. It's called Zeitoun by Dave Eggers and illustrates the chaos in that city for the initial weeks after the storm. It also points out the glaring faults of the military while we were down there. There was a lot of things mishandled there and then that I can't deny. I can only promise that my squad and I did the best that we could given the circumstances. All of the looters we picked up I am confident were caught dead to rights. All of their documentation, photo ID like Driver's licenses, were from completely different addresses, cities, or STATES, and they could never tell us anything about the house itself, the area, or why they were 'cleaning up' by only taking items of worth, and leaving things like moldy paperwork, office furniture, couches, or rotten refrigerators.",1423194379,"","1423229234",5,3520,"news"

Don't engage!  Just say, unless you can identify the person you intended to call, I am not speaking to you further.  And hang up the phone.  This is really a delay tactic, but it's very satisfying to hear them go off their script.

Your Response  ""I don't recognize that provider/lender/agency.  I dispute this debt and ask that you provide an itemized statement or verification of the debt and conduct all future communication in writing.  Don't call me at this number.""  

This one is very important.   These requirements:  dispute the debt, verify it in writing, stop calling, are all included in the Fair Debt Collections act.  If a collector violates that act, you can report them to your state attorney general and make the collector subject to sanctions, including fines and a cozy little cash compensation for your trouble (between $500 and $1500, depending on the circumstance.)

"stratospaly","","","I worked in this field for 4 years with the bottler of Walmart\Sams Choice water.  I was in transportation, so I know where the plants are, where they source the materials (bottles), and the routes they take to the Walmart DC's.  I have personally toured 3 of these plants and know the process from start to finish.  

If a bottle is labeled purified water, it is just that.  Tap water that is put through a reverse osmosis purification (100% water), then has a select blend of minerals added back in for flavor.  

If a bottle is labeled spring water, it is filtered spring water that often has a lighter blend of minerals added for flavor.  

When someone says ""its just tap water"" they have no clue that there are millions of dollars’ worth of machinery between the tap and finished bottle.  They often also complain about how bottles cost $5 each, which is crazy unless you are talking high branded water like Fiji or something.  Walmart bottled water is somewhere around $0.13 per bottle.  What you do not know is the cost to ship the bottled water from the plant to a store 5 miles from your house is roughly half that price.  

Another thing you do not know is that the company (Cott Beverage) is the 3rd or 4th largest drink maker in the world.  They ship hundreds of thousands of bottles of water at no charge to places for disaster relief, and to American Solders overseas.  

After seeing the entire process, I still like both Ozarka and Sams Choice water, and when I go camping or take a road trip the first thing I do is buy a case of water just to have it on hand.  


Edit: There are roughly 24 water plants in America that ship to Wal-Mart.  The one in CA just ships to CA.  Would you rather pay $5 per bottle to have water shipped from Texas to CA, and have them shut down the plant (laying off hundreds of workers) because of the drought?  I understand there are water shortages in this area, but one bottling plant is not the cause of it.

"OldFatGod","","","Call this a Tulsa History Lesson and Rant:

Tulsa has been a good ol' White boys club for almost 100 years and this story is nothing new for it, the timing however, of this story is going to bring Tulsa's ugly, dirty history to light. There are many types of ""Law Enforcement"" working in Tulsa County and they are all on the take. Black people are their favorite and easiest targets. Besides the Tulsa Police and the Sheriff's department, there is also private security firms with wide ranging powers. A private security force is contracted by the mayor's office directly. A few years ago, the mayor put down the local Occupy Tulsa group with this force so the local TPD union would have to worry about protecting its officers from public fallout. They came out with a force of over 150 officers in full riot gear against a group of 6 people sitting on grass after midnight and a group of 15-20 people on the sidewalk. They filled the faces of passive, absolutely non threatening people with pepper spray in order to carry them to one of over a dozen 'law enforcement' vans waiting. They must have wasted hundreds of thousands of dollars on that one night.... but they told the media that only about a dozen ""TPD officers"" carried out arrests. BULLSHIT! 

Look up Tulsa's Race Riot.... many people still think the ""Race Riots"" were about a bunch of black people rioting, but NO.... the Tulsa Race Riots were a bunch of white people burning down the most successful and most prosperous enclaves of the post-slavery era for black people. It was LITERALLY called ""Black Wall Street"" when they burned it down. Dumb ass white people hate it when black people are successful and gawd forbid make more money than them. So they put snipers in the tall buildings downtown to shoot every black person in sight, murdered thousands and buried them in mass graves that still surround the east side of downtown (They built a freeway loop over most of them to hide them... more recently, they built a baseball stadium to hide others), and they imprisoned hundreds of others on the County Fair Grounds' Armory site for weeks afterwards. 

Tulsa has remained effectively segregated to this day. ""North Tulsa"" is treated like ""East St. Louis"" by the local government... 'let's just wait till all of 'those people' are gone, THEN we'll develop it.' They treat it like the Israelis treat the Palestinians.... interestingly, the police chief actually worked for several years as a ""consultant"" with the IDF? If a house in North Tulsa is behind on any taxes, in violation of any ordinances, or even has a broken window it can be red-tagged... once it has that red-tag, it can be bulldozed by the first private developer to show up with a bulldozer. Then the developer gets the property and pays minimal taxes on it since it is without a structure. Nice, cozy relationship going on there. Oh, not to mention the rash of ""arsons"" that happen in Tulsa and especially in North Tulsa. ""Need to get rid of about 12 families of black people? No Problem!"" There were several CITY BLOCKS of homes burned up by the 'mysterious and elusive arsonists' that just happened to be all round the City Surplus yards.... within days of the burned rubble being cleared, the ENTIRE area was fenced in by 8' chain-link topped with barbed-wire with ""City of Tulsa"" signs. No one ever found the arsonists and no one ever questioned the city's acquisition of the land.

When they struck oil in Glenpool, a suburb of Tulsa, the area became known as ""Mid-Continent Capital"" because of how important the oil was for the World War I. So when  the IWW started organizing the oil field workers, the obscene profits of the grandfathers of the men who still run Tulsa were threatened. . The union members were round up by the local police, tried by a local judge, and officially kicked out of the county. While the group was being driven to edge of the county, a 'Klan style' group calling themselves ""The Knights of Liberty"" stopped the police cars and took the men from the police, hung some of them, and tarred and feathered the rest of them. Tulsa is fiercely anti-union and likes its workers poor, dumb, and borrowing.

The ""Knights of Liberty"" were made up of the white, wealthy business owners of Tulsa and their thugs to keep the black people and so-called ""loafers"" in line. They wore black robes that were in the same style as the KKK and would regularly be ""dispatched"" to beat up any employees and their families if the man smarted off at work... or would rout out bars and pull out men they labeled as ""loafers"" and would either hang them as an example to any men who 'wasn't working hard enough' or would, during the wars, they'd force them into military service and make sure they were shipped overseas. 

The ""Knights"" are no doubt the progenitors of this ""auxiliary police"" group made up of the same wealthy, white ""donors"". Nothing will happen to this guy unless the Feds come into it... and even then it will be made into a crazy circus with all the same 'figures' trying to score mileage out the tragedy.",1428940396,"","False",2,522,"news"

They think a couple more solar panels or windmills can stop us from ravaging the Earth, when in reality it's capitalism's psychotic obsession with growth at the expense of sustainability and our hunger for cheap consumer products that we don't need which is the actual root cause of environmental destruction. 

We've built an entire civilization off of consuming things in excess in the name of profit and personal ease. That's our problem. Unless you're challenging that system you're just talking out your ass. 

I reread the New Testament recently. The thing that amazes me about it is how most modern Christians live in a way that is almost totally opposite of what Christ said. I'm not talking about any of that typical reddit atheist shit about gay marriage or anything (that's a separate issue here). I mean the actual lifestyle that American christians lead. Big cars, big houses, a thousand and one different electronic devices, cheap plastic non-biodegradable everything...

Just look at megachurches. Hell, some of them have gift shops. Or the general American tendency to treat property as sacrosanct, even though one of Jesus's most famous moments was smashing up a bunch of small business owners' shit.

Now how many American Christians seriously challenge any of those things? Hell, watching Joel Osteen the impression I get is that god is supposed to be some sort of corporate CEO. 

""God wants you to succeed!""

Fuck that, no he doesn't. He thinks your success is immoral bullshit, Osteen! The bible is 90% Jewish nationalism and 10% railing against rich people. Nowhere in this thing is there anything remotely resembling a defense of American materialism

Anyway, what I'm getting at with this rant is that American capitalist culture is never going to be environmentally sound, and it doesn't even jive with the bible. Yet that doesn't stop Christians from worshiping the ground it walks on (generally, anyway. I'm not going to speak for billions of people). 

Everybody I know, Christian or not, makes claims about caring for the environment or worrying about global warming and shit, but the moment you point out that our very way of life is what's causing all that destruction people get indignant and start justifying the very people laying waste to the Earth.

"mugwump3","","","Why are Nash equilibrium's important? 
Put simply: they help us rationally approach matters of life and death, success and failure, wealth and poverty. 

In the late 40s into the 50s, there was a massive surge of young intellectuals into the fields of physics, math and engineering -- anybody with a Ph.D could get a fantastic government job.  Public enemy number one was the Soviet Union, which, the North Atlantic powers feared would outsmart, out-maneuver, and out-engineer a victory to the cold war.  This was the zeitgeist that John Nash came from, and it has been argued that his insights helped stave off nuclear catastrophe. 

Before Nash, ""classical thinking"" on competition heavily employed Lanchesters Equations -- a set of mathematical tools that accurately model how military forces clash... that is, unless they have an atomic bomb! 

Nash showed that in a game with vast, but not endless, strategies and vast, but not endless outcomes (such as war) there exists a set of strategies and outcomes which are not optimal for either player, but represent the least risk of catastrophic failure.  In other words, Player A is fighting for the best outcome (say, complete disability of their opponents ability to wage war) but if Player A runs through all the possible moves of Player B, and cannot lower their risk of failure by changing strategy, then their current strategy is best.  This set of strategies is known as a ""Nash Equilibrium.""  

In a game, you can use it test if your strategy is optimal, as well as if your opponents strategy is optimal. 

You can see this concept applied to the classic game ""The Prisoner's Dilema
 https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/microeconomics/nash-equilibrium-tutorial/nash-eq-tutorial/v/prisoners-dilemma-and-nash-equilibrium

During the cold war, Nash Equilibriums radically changed the thinking of military strategists who frequently consulted the intelligentsia.  I've heard it convincingly argued that the runaway spending by the US and the USSR during the cold war was, indeed, a Nash equilibrium.  

Today, Nash Equilibriums are used by strategists of all kinds: military, social, psychological, corporate, and especially financial.

Until now I've tried to operate under a live and let live mindset. But I just can't handle it anymore. I get it, the bible says ""if you're a dude, thou shalt not sleep with other dudes."" I get it, it's in there. You aren't just making it up.

So I am curious, will I face the same discrimination? I have a tattoo. Two in fact. It clearly states in the same book that that is forbidden. Should I expect to have my patronage refused because of religious ""freedom""? How about if I walk in the store or restaurant wearing my favorite hoodie, which is a cotton/polyester mix (two different clothes), will the store owner ask to see the tag to be sure?

But I have a question, oh righteous right wing evangelicals, not two verses down from that it says to respect a foreigner in your land, and to love them as you love yourself. Does this only apply to Canadians, or do Mexicans count too? What about those of african descent? What about middle eastern?

Will you be refusing the patronage of morticians, med students, and others who cut the bodies of the dead? How about men who shave their sideburns? Clip the sides of their beards? Eat steaks rare? Enjoy clam chowder?

All of these are in that stupid bloody book. Yet you don't give a crap about any of them except the part about dudes laying with other dudes. I'm starting to think this is less about your religion and more about the fact you, personally, find it to be a bit weird.

&gt; Prosecutors accomplished that, Kleine said, by striking an agreement that will have the deputy serve the equivalent of six months in jail for coercing the woman into performing a sex act on him after he pulled her over at Zorinsky Lake. . . . Under the agreement between prosecutors and the defense, Cooper is expected to be sentenced to the equivalent of six months in jail — with no option for house arrest, Kleine said.  He will be sentenced on misdemeanor charges of third-degree assault and attempted tampering with physical evidence. He originally was charged with first-degree sexual assault, a felony punishable by up to 25 years in prison.
