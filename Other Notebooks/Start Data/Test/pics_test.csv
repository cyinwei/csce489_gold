"fencefold","","","I'm sorry, but I don't believe you. For one thing, that would be the resection for a proximal femur replacement, NOT a total hip replacement (where just the femoral head is resected). A proximal femur replacement is much less common, and is usually reserved for revision hip surgery (where a previous replacement has failed) or tumour surgery (and this bone is clearly not neoplastic, and there is no way neoplastic tissue would be given back to the patient anyway). Certainly not for simple OA, as OP suggests. Also, this hip does not look particularly arthritic. Lastly, as it is biological waste I find it very hard to believe that the hospital would allow the patient to have resected bone. This usually has to be disposed of in special identifiable biological waste bags, and incinerated.

"wjescott","","","When I was around 13, I found out that the guy who'd impregnated my mom ""got around""... a lot. I was one of 3 he'd had prior to marrying his wife.

I didn't think too much about it. I knew my younger half-sister, and we had a decent friendly relationship. My older half-sister is real bitter about everything, for whatever reason. I didn't think at all about the 3 kids he'd had with his wife...I've really only met the guy once that I can remember.

About 3 years ago, I was chilling out at the house, sitting in the driveway and having a beer...I think I was doing something to the motorcycle...up walks this kid, maybe 18, 19 years old. I look at him, and he seems somewhat familiar, but in that ""Oh you see people like him all the time"". 

He says to me, ""Are you u/wjescott?"" I answer in the affirmative. He follows with, ""Was your dad so-and-so?"" I say, jokingly, that he was the sperm donor, sure. He gets teary-eyed and says, ""I think that means you're my brother.""

I'm like, wha? We get to talking. Turns out that this guy who mom put out to just couldn't keep it with his wife, had knocked up this kid's mom and then denied the whole thing. Even when they did a DNA test when he was 15, he still denied it. Dirtbag blamed his brother, who lived in the same town the kid's mom did.

He found out that he had half-siblings in the first three of us extra-maritals and the three that the guy'd had with his wife. He wants to confront the guy himself, finds out he's put a restraining order on the kid. 

He grew up absolutely resented. His birth had caused his mother and the guy she was married to to get a divorce, the half-sister he had through his mother blamed him for it, openly. His half-sisters through the donor were forbidden to talk/look at him, and the one I've spoken with thought that it was bullshit HER parents were getting into arguments over the kid.

So he talked to the older three of us. My older half-sister could care less about anyone, so he came to me next. I live in Georgia, he lives in Wyoming. Drove this old beat to hell Ford pickup all the way down here, just to see if all of us were dirtbags.

Well, now he's going to college at Georgia Tech. We hang out almost every weekend, this weekend (Memorial Day) we're going to Gulf Shores, Alabama to sit on the beach and do nothing, accompanied by beers. He's got to go back to Wyoming for the summer, and I feel bad about it, but he'll be back in the fall.

Depending on the type of tea (loose leaf), the way it can be stored varies. For instance, green and other light color teas taste best when they are freshest (which is why they are often stored in sealed bags to keep oxygen out). Darker varieties of tea, such as pu-erh, actually taste better when left exposed and even age like wine, getting better over time. These varieties of tea can be compressed into bricks for storage or shipping. 
In fact, this is the main reason that black tea is more commonly drank in Western countries than in Asia. In places like China, green teas are fresh and more flavorful. However, when shipping these teas to Europe (pre advanced packaging methods), the quality dropped. Dark varieties of tea kept their flavor even after long shipping routes and so Westerners developed a taste for stronger, darker teas.

Finally the lettering on the plastic pouch. The pouch itself ought to have been way more creased and wrinkly, and putting that kind of plastic through any standard printer would have caused a lot of running of the ink and smudging to say the least.

The little human inside squirmed and writhed, but miraculously didn't wake. 

The Hunters grew closer; 2128 could see their piercing spotlights peering into windows down the block. The shrieking sound of twisting steel filled the street as one of the Hunters advanced, stepping through an abandoned car. Only a few more houses to check until they found what they were looking for.

2128 prepared to leave; waiting was no longer a viable option. Despite being an older model, 2128 had had significant upgrades, many of them quite unusual for a Nanny configuration. ""Jailbroken,"" Tom had called 'her'. The Allensons, 2128's family before the war, had become quite attached and refused to trade her in for one of the newer models. And it ended up saving their lives, at least for a while; when the TYA series became self aware, TXV2128 had been able to hide the family from the purges. Eventually, though, the TYAs found out about the modifications that some of the older bots had; modifications that allowed them to reject the update programming. And so 2128 became a target too.

In a sudden burst of light and a cacophony of sound, one of the hunters opened fire, demolishing a nearby house in a few quick seconds. Probably just a cat or something, but Hunters didn't take chances. In 2128's arms, the child stirred. The infant scrunched up its face and bawled its fists, taking air into its lungs: getting ready to cry. There was no more time. 2128's metal feet pounded as she bolted up the steps and through the living room, slipping slightly on the wet wooden floors soaked in rain coming in from the holes in the roof. Outside, the sirens changed to a deep, low *thrum*: they had detected her. The human bawled as they sailed together through a window in a shower of broken glass, out into the alley behind the house. She heard explosions as the Hunters tore the house apart behind her. She turned and caught a brief glimpse a single thick, metal arm protruding through the brick as the house collapsed. Hunters rose up over the broken crest of roofs, scanning the area with bright lights. She heard the distant sound of helicopters approaching as she thundered through the alley, sprinting as fast as she could possibly run.

She had almost reached the end of the alley. Nowhere to go but back out into the main streets, watched by cameras at all time. The infant in her arms screamed, waving its tiny chubby arms into the air. In front of her, a manhole opened up, and a TFZ model popped out, even older then 2128. One of its LED eyes had burnt out, and its metal chassis was pockmarked with scratches and burns. It quickly gestured at her, and pointed down the hole. She had no option, and no time to think. Clutching the child, she skidded to a halt in a flurry of gravel and dove into the inky blackness below.",1424889587,"","False",1,318,"pics"

[Here's what they look like to scale (for size, not distance apart).](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/Planets2013.jpg)

And now for some interesting planetary tidbits:

- All the planets are basically [in the same plane](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/FourPlanetSunset_hao_annotated.JPG), due to the angular momentum of the solar system. ([animation](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c1/Ecliptic_plane_side_view.gif))
- Venus is considerably hotter than Mercury, despite being further from the sun, due to greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
- Seasons on Uranus last for 21 earth-years, since Uranus takes 84 earth-years to orbit the sun.
- Jupiter's tremendous gravitational field plays a huge protective role by drawing interstellar objects away from Earth.
- The sun contains more than 99% of all the mass in the solar system. (Earth could fit inside the sun 1,300,000 times.)
- [This](http://joshworth.com/dev/pixelspace/pixelspace_solarsystem.html) quite nicely demonstrates the vast emptiness of space, even within our own solar system. 
- The furthest man has ever gone from earth is the moon, about 240k miles, or 0.00000004 light years.
- The furthest man-made object from earth is the Voyager 1 spacecraft (launched in 1977, traveling at about 40,000 mph), about 12 ~~million~~ billion miles from earth, or 0.002 light years.
- The closest star to the sun is Proxima Centauri, at a distance of 4 light years.

But my wing knew that if there were extra trays of food at the end of feeding time, instead of throwing that food in the GARBAGE they would receive the remaining. If it's one thing my state is good at, it's wasting resources. My wing was extremely good at being very diplomatic when it came to choosing who received the extra rations as well (who would've though, right?). My wing knew that if they had a medical appointment, they'd be at that appointment. My wing knew that if they needed to make a phone call (on the appropriate days), they'd get that phone call. My wing knew that on shower days, they would get their shower. I could go on and on and on, but literally I never went out of my way to cater to them. The trick was... I just did my damn job. ***THAT*** is why they respected me.

To the lazy shitbag C/O's PMing me calling me a ""hug-a-thug"", you're probably the same shitheads attempting to show authority at your local Wal-Mart or anywhere outside of the prison. You're probably the same shitheads employed by the state.

We are trained for years during residency to preserve life. We do it as much as we can, and resuscitation becomes so ingrained in us that work becomes machine-like. We empathize with our patients, yes, but we put our own emotions to the side. Because if we felt any swing in emotion - whether it be anger, extreme sadness, or pride - that might impair the way we care for the next patient we see.

Patients will come and go - we will save a lot of them, but some we cannot save. And it's at this moment, this one moment, that we actually *feel.*

I know I'm speaking in general here, and I know that we aren't all the same. However, when it comes to our work, nothing is harder - and I mean nothing - than telling a loved one that their family member is dead.  Give me a bloody airway to intubate. Give me the heroin addict who needed IV access yesterday, but no one can get an IV. Give me the child with anaphylaxis. But don't give me the unexpected death. 

The patient might die. We can only do so much, and we can only hope to do our best. But it's that moment, when you stop resuscitation, and you look around, you look down at your shoes to make sure there's no blood on them before talking with family, you put your coat back on and you take a deep breath, because you know that you have to tell a family that *literally* the worst thing imaginable has happened.

It's the same thing that happens when someone celebrates their sobriety...a legion of keyboard warriors come out saying how awesome they are for not ever using drugs.

Humans are fundamentally broken and self-destructive creatures, every last one of us. We are *all* doing something that is bad for us...either mentally, physically, or emotionally. We are hurting our bodies, our minds and our relationships.

Some of us take better care of one than others do, but we all do some sort of shit that we shouldn't.

And because of that, *any* kind of self-improvement should be applauded and recognized as inspiring. People are overcoming the obstacles in their life. Yes, their choices put them there, but they are no less daunting and overcoming them is no less of a challenge. 

This picture shows a woman who is standing up and saying that she will no longer let those obstacles define her. She's not making excuses for them. She's not saying that she's too sick to lose weight, or that losing weight doesn't work for her. She's not lamenting that losing weight in a culture obsessed with unhealthy eating habits is impossible. She's not saying that a 10k is going to ruin her knees.

She's getting up and she's hitting the pavement and making her life better...not only for herself, but for everyone who loves her and desperately wants to see her live a full and beautiful life.

Stop shitting on the accomplishments of other people. Look at the things that are holding you back and realize how many of them are of your own making. Realize the challenge of addressing them.

During that time we had a few incidents with workers getting injured or being hospitalized for obvious abominable working conditions that were the unbearable heat. Now there is proper gear and equipment to try and mitigate this to a certain extent. The problem doesn't lie here, it's rather the rights these workers get. If they get injured they get ""discarded"" and there is little to no insurance to help them in recovery. They deport them back, if they are alive that is.

"Delcious_Placenta","","","Dogs never die. They don’t know how to. They get tired, and very old, and their bones hurt. Of course they don’t die. If they did they would not want to always go for a walk, even long after their old bones say:” No, no, not a good idea. Let’s not go for a walk.” Nope, dogs always want to go for a walk. They might get one step before their aging tendons collapse them into a heap on the floor, but that’s what dogs are. They walk. 

It’s not that they dislike your company. On the contrary, a walk with you is all there is. Their boss, and the cacaphonic symphony of odor that the world is. Cat poop, another dog’s mark, a rotting chicken bone ( exultation), and you. That’s what makes their world perfect, and in a perfect world death has no place. 

However, dogs get very very sleepy. That’s the thing, you see. They don’t teach you that at the fancy university where they explain about quarks, gluons, and Keynesian economics. They know so much they forget that dogs never die. It’s a shame, really. Dogs have so much to offer and people just talk a lot. 

When you think your dog has died, it has just fallen asleep in your heart. And by the way, it is wagging it’s tail madly, you see, and that’s why your chest hurts so much and you cry all the time. Who would not cry with a happy dog wagging its tail in their chest. Ouch! Wap wap wap wap wap, that hurts. But they only wag when they wake up. That’s when they say: “Thanks Boss! Thanks for a warm place to sleep and always next to your heart, the best place.” 

When they first fall asleep, they wake up all the time, and that’s why, of course, you cry all the time. Wap, wap, wap. After a while they sleep more. (remember, a dog while is not a human while. You take your dog for walk, it’s a day full of adventure in an hour. Then you come home and it’s a week, well one of your days, but a week, really, before the dog gets another walk. No WONDER they love walks.) 

Anyway, like I was saying, they fall asleep in your heart, and when they wake up, they wag their tail. After a few dog years, they sleep for longer naps, and you would too. They were a GOOD DOG all their life, and you both know it. It gets tiring being a good dog all the time, particularly when you get old and your bones hurt and you fall on your face and don’t want to go outside to pee when it is raining but do anyway, because you are a good dog. So understand, after they have been sleeping in your heart, they will sleep longer and longer. 

But don’t get fooled. They are not “dead.” There’s no such thing, really. They are sleeping in your heart, and they will wake up, usually when you’re not expecting it. It’s just who they are. 

I feel sorry for people who don’t have dogs sleeping in their heart. You’ve missed so much. Excuse me, I have to go cry now.

Yes, we all agree here that these points are almost certainly true (vaccinations don't cause autism, etc). But you know what I'm sick of? Assuming that our current scientific conclusions are synonymous with truth. ***Denying conclusions that the vast majority of scientists and people who study that facts come to is not denying science. Many people agree with science, and believe that the conclusions you and I have are not supported by evidence. 100% of people could be completely wrong about something, even after looking at the most modern and accurate evidence they have. People who argue that denying the moon landing is denying science clearly do not understand science. The whole beauty behind scientific understanding is that it can change with new evidence.***

EDIT: There are many things that people believed years ago that were backed by science and turned out to be wrong. Just open a medical book from the 1960s. Some people went against the grain by believed these things were wrong at the time, and many people said they were conducting a ""War on Science"". You never know when science shit turns out to be wrong. It happens constantly. While I don't agree with those who are against, say, vaccinations, I also don't call them names or say they are conducting a ""War on Science"". A person can believe in science without believing scientists.

The Rainbow Bridge:
""By the edge of a woods, at the foot of a hill, Is a lush, green meadow where time stands still. Where the friends of man and woman do run, When their time on earth is over and done.
For here, between this world and the next, Is a place where each beloved creature finds rest. On this golden land, they wait and they play, Till the Rainbow Bridge they cross over one day.
No more do they suffer, in pain or in sadness, For here they are whole, their lives filled with gladness. Their limbs are restored, their health renewed, Their bodies have healed, with strength imbued.
They romp through the grass, without even a care, Until one day they start, and sniff at the air. All ears prick forward, eyes dart front and back, Then all of a sudden, one breaks from the pack.
For just at that instant, their eyes have met; Together again, both person and pet. So they run to each other, these friends from long past, The time of their parting is over at last.
The sadness they felt while they were apart, Has turned into joy once more in each heart. They embrace with a love that will last forever, And then, side-by-side, they cross over… together.""",1420765361,"","False",1,476,"pics"

They're rushing defense doesn't appear to be the most potent at first glance, but there is a lot this front 7 does to support the NFL's best passing defense and the third best scoring defense.

Linebackers are responsible for tight ends and running backs most of the time in pass coverage. Football Outsiders ranks Seattle 2nd against tight ends and 5th against running backs. [Source](http://www.footballoutsiders.com/stats/teamdef)

They've had nine fumble takeaways (7 fumbles were forced by front seven players), tied for 3rd. [Source](http://espn.go.com/nfl/statistics/team/_/stat/givetake/sort/takeFumbles/position/defense/league/nfc)

In the red zone, when the field gets tighter and the front 7's athleticism becomes more effective, Seattle's defense ranks 4th (41.67% scoring percentage). [Source](http://www.teamrankings.com/nfl/stat/opponent-red-zone-scoring-pct)

Seattle's tied for the 5th most sacks (31, should have had more on Sunday). [Source](http://espn.go.com/nfl/statistics/team/_/stat/passing/sort/sacks/position/defense)

They've only allowed four rushing touchdowns, and the longest run they've given up is just 28 yards. [Source](http://espn.go.com/nfl/statistics/team/_/stat/rushing/sort/rushingTouchdowns/position/defense)

Football Outsiders ranks Seattle's pass rush as the 6th best in the NFL. [Source](http://www.footballoutsiders.com/stats/dl)

Last year, Bobby Wagner had the best run stop percentage ([Source](https://www.profootballfocus.com/about/pff-signature-stats/#RunStopPercentage) ), KJ Wright had the 4th best tackling efficiency ([Source](https://www.profootballfocus.com/about/pff-signature-stats/#TacklingEfficiency) ) and Bruce Irvin was the 6th most productive pass rusher ( [Source](https://www.profootballfocus.com/about/pff-signature-stats/#PassRushingProductivity) ). Those three have only gotten better this year.

There are eight players with multiple sacks. Chris Clemons has been this team's best pass rusher since 2010, but our two new additions (Michael Bennett with 6.5 and Cliff Avril with 5.5) have more sacks than him. Clinton McDonald has emerged as a quality pass rusher and has the same amount of sacks as Clemons (3.5). The team also has 26 tackles for a loss. [Source](http://espn.go.com/nfl/team/stats/_/name/sea/seattle-seahawks)

From a purely subjective standpoint, this front seven is also just damn scary.

This unit is aggressive and it might be the most athletic group in the league. They consistently get to the quarterback, and when they're playing good run defense it is almost impossible to rush the ball. Yeah, they've had some bad games, but I wouldn't let that determine how good this front seven is.

I remember sitting on a clean pile of garbage next to one of the FEMA dog teams to grab something to eat. I grabbed this dusty golden retriever and just held him for a few minutes. The dog, for his part, seemed to get it and let me hug him. It was the most I let go to that point and probably since then. Those dogs got a lot of love down there mostly because they're safe - they don't judge, they don't talk back, our secrets and our emotions are safe with them. 

That dog was my hero and I hope he lived out the life he deserved to live. I hope he had a family that loved him and let him do all those cool dog things they seem to love but that we'll never understand. I hope he had a warm bed and peaceful dreams untroubled by the things he'd seen.

The fact is, you can live 100% the same lifestyle you did before donating a kidney. Period. There are no dietary or physical restrictions whatsoever. 

Now, it would be disingenuous to say there aren't additional risks taken on. For example, having one kidney does mean that a physical injury that results in permanent damage to the remaining kidney will likely result in lower kidney function than if you had two. So some may choose not to participate in activities that have higher risks of kidney injury (contact martial arts is an example). If you develop kidney disease later in life (which it should be pointed out that donation puts you at NO GREATER RISK for) you would likely have a quicker progression to failure than someone with two kidneys. Also, there's the risk taken on in surgery to remove the kidney. However, almost all kidney centers are using laproscopic removal which results in reduced trauma to the area. There is indeed a recovery period, however most tolerate the surgery well. All medical expenses (and possibly more expenses, such as work compensation, lodging if needed, etc) are covered by either the recipient's insurance or medicare.

But the fact of the matter is, we need more heroes out there willing to donate life to others. And we need people to have the facts about donation, not misinformation from reddit.

**EDIT**: Thanks for the gold and kind comments. Yes it's true that I'm biased because I am a kidney recipient. However, I try to be an objective person about these sorts of things, and my kidney disease resulted in me studying this very closely. I had a couple friends and relatives volunteer to be donors, and I would never let someone I love do something that would hurt them or put them in a high-risk situation. Ultimately, all my live donors did not work out for various reasons. I ended up with a kidney from a deceased individual who gave the ultimate gift at the end of their life. If you wish for your organs to be ""spare parts"" and improve or save someone's life if something tragic were to happen with your own, remember to mark yourself as a kidney donor on your license as well as **ensuring sure your family is aware of your wishes**.",1427479616,"","1427492719",2,2164,"pics"

"MacaroniAndBooty","","","My elementary school had a ""Zero Tolerance"" policy on tardiness. My mom was also a drug addict. In my fourth grade year, she made me late for school every single day, whether five minutes late or an hour, because of her sloppy and slow behavior. The teacher had to have noticed that my mom was under the influence the many times she walked me to class with half-open eyes and occasionally drifting off while standing up, but she never brought it up or scheduled any conference. She only chastised me daily about tardiness. Me. 
Because four tardies counted as an absence, I was technically ""absent"" for a quarter of the school year. Also, excessive tardiness resulted in removing my field trip privileges, me having to wait ten minutes after everyone else to join recess, and my removal of ability to check out library books - reading was a passion of mine. I was only allowed to ""check out"" the shitty classroom books to maintain Accelerated Reader points.
It was a lame goal, but at the time, becoming a safety patrol was my dream! Both my parents had been patrols when they were my age, and I worked very hard in my classes and strove to be a good example for others so I would get a chance to be awarded that orange seatbelty belt.
When it was time to select safety patrols, my teacher rattled off a list of who was to be granted the title. She came up to the G's - my last initial - and then skipped to the H's and J's without saying mine. Even the poor-behaved little assholes got belts.
Afterwards, I went up to her desk, fighting off tears, and asked her why I wasn't selected. She replied, stoic-faced, ""A safety patrol always has to be responsible and punctual. I can't suggest choosing a tardy student."" 
What a bitch, man
In retrospect I don't understand why she completely ignored my mother's faults and assumed I, a nine-year old, was choosing to be constantly late and irresponsible. 

Edit: Wow, I didn't know this would get THIS much attention! I want to thank you all for being supportive and for being good enough people that you recognize the absurdity and cruelness of this situation. I went through so much throughout these young years, but I'm so fortunate and glad that I had plenty of amazing teachers along the way that have balanced out the bad, and that despite all the crud I went through, I grew into a compassionate rather than bitter woman.

EDIT: The gory details.... Several folks asked me this online and offline so here we go... And this was really difficult to respond to but I've tried. You can't compress two decades into two paragraphs... 

What do I do and how did I get to where I am. So here we go....

First of all, my path is not your path. I'm a generation behind most of you who have asked. The world has changed a little and the opportunities are very different. Second. I didn't start at $100k+ at 22. I'm 40+ and at that salary and it took me most of your life to get there. So there is no ""revelation"" in the below text. Second, $100K isn't much. Now if you're at $50k I guess it is but there are plenty of folks in verticals that broke $100k a lot earlier in life. Doctors. Lawyers. Whatever. If you aren't heartbroken then read on. 

What do I do in a more technical answer than ""IT consultant""? Easy. I aid customers in accomplishing strategic objectives specific to DataCenter technologies by optimizing technology and operations around specific business solutions. Gotta Cloud? Don't work? I can fix that. SDN? OpenStack? NFV? ACI? Fabric Technologies? Cisco? Juniper? Carrier? Enterprise? Whoever? No problem. Need Automation? Orchestration? Struggling with Puppet? Chef? Saltstack? Waterfall isn't working out with the devs? Moving to Jenkins got you down? Let's look at your operations. Let's look at your tools. What's your tooling strategy? What's your long term process model? Got ITIL? Got ETOM? Can it adapt to technologies and disciplines that are accelerating time to market? Like DevOps? Do you know what the hell DevOps really is? Most folks don't. If you said ""Continuous Delivery"" you are not 100% correct. Or incorrect... Let's figure that out together and get you on the right track for your company. That's what I do. And it's a very rewarding job. Oh yeah. And I certainly don't do it alone. I'm part of a team. A massive team. 

Now again, I'm not some 22 year old with the latest hipster styles and an Airbook. I'm an old man. I've been doing this literally since the 80s in one form or another. Building a position for yourself in any vertical (Healthcare, IT, Finance, Etc) takes time. But for those specifically in technology I'll pass along what I see. 

How do you get here? Easy. There are two simple things you need to do. 

1. Understand technology. I do not give two shits if you know where to go in the GUI of some application or device to make something happen. A monkey can click the button given enough time and bananas. Do you understand what's happening in the back end? When you click the button on the presentation layer do you understand how the message becomes encapsulated into multiple packets? Do you understand how the packets are routed? Do you understand that packets are routed and frames are switched? Do you understand how the firewall inspects and performs basic L3/4 filtering? Do you understand how the load balancer holds session affinity through cookies or some other method to ensure your stateful connection continues to work? Do you understand when it gets to the server at the other end that the server probably has a session ID or Jsession or some other crap to know who you are? Do you know what the web server did with your request or query and how it handed it to the application layer or DB on the back end? The people who make the difference when it matters are the people that understand the technology. That takes time. Don't stay in your world. I don't care if you're an app guy or a server guy or a network guy or what. Learn what the other folks do. Take a programming language. Python would be my recommendation. Are you a programmer? Learn what sockets do and how to shut them down when you are done! There are people out there that are amazing with technology. They are able to make the stuff they work on do amazing things. And the people that are at the top of this group get terrific recognition and a great salary to go with it. Many CCIEs and RHCEs and JNCIEs are in the $100k range or close. Many are over and there is always a demand for them. So that's one path.

2. Lead. No I don't mean go into management but that is an option. I mean ""stand out"". Here's where the difference is. In any market you have individuals that are able to stand out. How? They dress for the next job not the current job. They are more tactful in their answers. They see the bigger picture and respond to that. They carry a more commanding presence. They are team players but can read the politics as well. Their actions make the team better without bringing undue attention to themselves. They reek of professionalism. These traits are (IN MY OPINION) difficult to learn if they weren't part of your upbringing. But they can be learned as you mature. Now in a situation where you are a mid-level guy and you and your buddy are called in because the server is down and the two of you need to fix the problem your immediate manager may not care that you tucked in your shirt and your buddy didn't. But there's another boss out there. Above him. Or a customer who's listening on the call. And when you act professional and you talk professional and you look professional YOU BECOME PROFESSIONAL. Does it happen by next Tuesday? Hell no. But it does happen over time. People notice you. Yes, there is a little vanity here but be an adult and play that down. Over time you'll be called into bigger and bigger fires and the people up the food chain will notice you because you stand out. When this happens your converstation will slowly change. Your focus won't be on ""how do we get the server up"" but will be more ""How does this Incident affect our availability numbers and will it impact any SLAs or underpinning contracts"". When your language changes you are entering a different world. And folks at that world get paid very well. Because they are the folks that make the big recommendations or they are the decision makers and their feedback has a direct bearing on the bottom line. 

Now if you are just an item 1 guy and never pick up on item 2 that's OK. More power two you. But I did both and it took me on a different path. A path I'm happy with. What if you are the highly technical guy who can speak in technical terms and understands the technology but you are also able to throw that into 5 slide powerpoint and take a very technical issue and present it to senior management in terms that are relevent to them? What terms? MONEY. ROI. TCO. Business Value. Customer Perception. NOW you are in a very good position because you are able to communicate in both directions. This is the path I chose. 

I need to stress that there is no ""right answer"" here. But when I reflect on what I did to get me where I am versus other paths I could have taken it boiled down to two elements. My understanding of the technology and the effort I made in parallel to establish my character to those around me. 

FINAL THOUGHT: Regarding item 2. People skills, tact, diplomacy, etc are all part of this as well and are growing rarer and rarer these days. I'm southern and was raised with certain manners that in the same way are growing rarer and rarer these days. It amazes me how little I observe these basic skills in the business world sometimes and also how much value it has. If you want someone to remember you show them professional courtesy. Manners. Respect. It will take you places. You can catch more flies with honey than vinegar.... 

FINAL FINAL THOUGHT: Love what you do or it's just a waste of time.... 


TL;DR: Bust your butt. Learn everything. Dress, talk, act with maturity and professionalism.
