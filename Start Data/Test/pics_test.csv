"Delcious_Placenta","","","Dogs never die. They don’t know how to. They get tired, and very old, and their bones hurt. Of course they don’t die. If they did they would not want to always go for a walk, even long after their old bones say:” No, no, not a good idea. Let’s not go for a walk.” Nope, dogs always want to go for a walk. They might get one step before their aging tendons collapse them into a heap on the floor, but that’s what dogs are. They walk. 

It’s not that they dislike your company. On the contrary, a walk with you is all there is. Their boss, and the cacaphonic symphony of odor that the world is. Cat poop, another dog’s mark, a rotting chicken bone ( exultation), and you. That’s what makes their world perfect, and in a perfect world death has no place. 

However, dogs get very very sleepy. That’s the thing, you see. They don’t teach you that at the fancy university where they explain about quarks, gluons, and Keynesian economics. They know so much they forget that dogs never die. It’s a shame, really. Dogs have so much to offer and people just talk a lot. 

When you think your dog has died, it has just fallen asleep in your heart. And by the way, it is wagging it’s tail madly, you see, and that’s why your chest hurts so much and you cry all the time. Who would not cry with a happy dog wagging its tail in their chest. Ouch! Wap wap wap wap wap, that hurts. But they only wag when they wake up. That’s when they say: “Thanks Boss! Thanks for a warm place to sleep and always next to your heart, the best place.” 

When they first fall asleep, they wake up all the time, and that’s why, of course, you cry all the time. Wap, wap, wap. After a while they sleep more. (remember, a dog while is not a human while. You take your dog for walk, it’s a day full of adventure in an hour. Then you come home and it’s a week, well one of your days, but a week, really, before the dog gets another walk. No WONDER they love walks.) 

Anyway, like I was saying, they fall asleep in your heart, and when they wake up, they wag their tail. After a few dog years, they sleep for longer naps, and you would too. They were a GOOD DOG all their life, and you both know it. It gets tiring being a good dog all the time, particularly when you get old and your bones hurt and you fall on your face and don’t want to go outside to pee when it is raining but do anyway, because you are a good dog. So understand, after they have been sleeping in your heart, they will sleep longer and longer. 

But don’t get fooled. They are not “dead.” There’s no such thing, really. They are sleeping in your heart, and they will wake up, usually when you’re not expecting it. It’s just who they are. 

I feel sorry for people who don’t have dogs sleeping in their heart. You’ve missed so much. Excuse me, I have to go cry now.

"Andromeda321","","","Astronomer here!  This is... a *vastly* oversimplified statement of a really complex issue.  The first thing to mention here is Mauna Kea is considered a sacred place for native Hawaiians, and there are some grievances on how things have been handled there lately.  This group is several thousand people strong, not just some fringe group, and they have been protesting a long time now.

So with all that said, it is also important to note that native Hawaiians have a wonderful history of studying astronomy, and honestly the entire situation strikes me as one where astronomers perhaps haven't been really good at explaining why the Thirty Meter Telescope is so important.  One example is many native Hawaiians have been asking why more space at their sacred mountaintop is needed- why not just use the space where there are already telescopes, as an ""upgrade?""- so that tells me we're really not explaining ourselves well on this.  Taking a week or a month to get the local community on board is more than fine by me- **this is *not* an ""us vs them"" situation, it should be a ""let's explain ourselves better and find our common ground"" situation.**

To be clear, astronomy has a wonderful history of explaining to native peoples why their mountaintops are important.  Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona, for example, is also a sacred site to local tribes and is on tribal ground.  So what did the astronomers do to build the biggest observatory in the nation?  They invited the native Indian tribe to the Steward Observatory at the University of Arizona for a night of stargazing through the telescopes.  By the end of the night the astronomers were given the name ""People with the Long Eyes"" by the local tribe, and the blessing to use the mountain.  Hawaii is a bit more complex a situation, but I'm still confident we can find common ground here.

"icwangtw","","","The flight was GE235 of TransAsia Airways from Taipei Songshan airport in Taiwan to the outlying island of Kinmen operated by an ATR 72-600 (B-22816) that was delivered last April. The crash occurred a few minutes after takeoff with the plane ditching into Keelung River which flows through the city, an engine flameout was speculated to be the reason. Weather conditions were normal at the time. Since the river is not under normal flight path it seems that the pilot was trying to attempt an emergency landing and to avoid causing serious damage to the buildings. 

Rescuers said that the cabin was flooded to chest height and has a strong smell of gasoline. Many passengers were still in their seats with their seatbelt fastened and unable to escape. Most passengers that are unaccounted for are located at the front of the aircraft which is submerged under the river. Some are also feared to have been thrown out of the cabin when the plane crashed. It's rumoured that a few bodies have floated downstream.

There are 53 passengers including 2 infants and 5 crew members on board. 12 people are still missing while 31 deaths are confirmed and the black box has been found as of 2030 UTC. 31 of the passengers are Chinese. This route is quite popular with Chinese tour groups since there is a ferry service that connects Kinmen to Xiamen which is a low cost alternative for them to visit Taiwan rather than taking the direct flights.

This is the second crash of TransAsia Airways in the past 12 months with another ATR 72 crashing during approach under horrible weather conditions last July. The government has now ordered all 22 ATR 72 aircrafts operated by both TransAsia Airways and UNI Air to be grounded for further inspection. If the aircrafts are grounded for the next few weeks it might cause some serious trouble to people going home for Chinese New Year that is coming up very soon. 

Local newspaper has reported that the aircraft that crashed suffered engine problems during its delivery flight less than a year ago from France and was diverted to Macau to replace an engine. A third-party certification agency has recommended the airline to not the take the delivery of the plane but the suggestion was rejected. The unnamed pilot that was interviewed claims that there are problems with the certification process done by ATR.

The doctors and facility where the transplant takes place will be royally compensated. And given the cunt nature of insurance companies, the person getting the kidney will likely lose everything they have and go bankrupt. The cost for a kidney transplant is over $250,000, and that is the cheapest transplant operation.

So the donor gets to have a good feeling, and they will need a lot of good feelings to get through their recovery and complications that can arise for the rest of their life. The recipient gets to be alive, but the rest of their life will probably be far shittier. And the hospital gets to keep playing $50 for a box of latex gloves and the doctors get to play golf at a country club whose admission policies look like the pre-war South.

"translatesarabic","","","Hello, I don't usually comment here but I just had to after seeing this photo. The building behind the cello player is a restaurant called 'Mr Potato' in the Al-Mansour district of Baghdad. I distinctly remember talking to my aunt (who lives in Baghdad) months and months ago and her mentioning eating her lunch at this restaurant. The place specialises in (who'd have thought) potato dishes- particularly from abroad. Things such as gratin and jacket potatoes and foods alien to the people of Iraq during the sanctions in Saddam's time. Places like this cropped up all over the city after Saddam left, I distinctly remember eating in a French-themed restaurant called 'Chef City' in Karrada when I was there a few years back. Restaurants aren't the only new thing. Malls began to open in Baghdad and Iraq, better gyms, better libraries, renovated parks and zoos and gardens.

To many people, these restaurants and malls are just restaurants and malls. Places to eat and meet with friends. To me they are so much more. They represent something more beautiful and more incredible than anything I have seen anywhere in the world. The incredible power of the human spirit in the darkest of times.

I say a lot of things to my English friends that they may see me as insane for. Chief among these is a statement I have made on the city of Baghdad. I have stated and will continue to state, that Baghdad is the most beautiful city I have ever had the pleasure of visiting and (for a short while albeit) living in. 

When I first went, I expected to see disrepair and chaos. I expected to see a fearful oppressed people. I expected empty streets bar military checkpoints and armoured vehicles. Yes there were lots of military checkpoints and armoured vehicles. Yes there were regions of disrepair and chaos. But there was more to this great city of cities.

I saw Baghdad's people. Her youth out in the streets looking for a good time. Teenage boys playing football on a street that had been bombed the week before. Young girls with dyed hair and make-up leaving big universities giggling with each other as they went to buy ice cream. Families walking together in Baghdad's many parks. Friends sat together in coffee shops smoking. There were men and women, cleaning dirty streets, planting flowers in the parks, building new houses and apartment blocks. I saw a people above fear, above the influence of terror. I saw a people who refused to let the bombs control their lives as no doubt the perpetrators of the attacks would have wanted. I saw a unique and beautiful strength in Baghdad's kind and welcoming people.  These were a people besieged by constant threat of attack. No inch of Baghdad is safe in any sense of the word, but they didn't let that control them. They were defiant and strong, willing not to give up hope for a new and better future.

In fact I would go so far as to say that, in its own way, Baghdad has beaten terrorism. The objective of terrorism is to sway public and political opinion to accommodate the views of the perpetrators and it has done the exact opposite to the people of Iraq. Baghdadi Christians still go to Church every Sunday, despite that groups such as IS would have their heads for it. Young women still wear make up and go out without wearing hijab despite that the same groups would stone them to death for doing so. In their own way, I believe the people of Baghdad have beaten terrorism.

This is why there is no doubt in my heart that the people of Iraq, whether Kurd or Arab, whether Sunni or Shi'ite, whether Christian or Sabian or Azadi or Shabaki or one of other thousand religious and racial groups living upon its soil; will come out on top of these crises. Whether in a day, a decade or a century, these continually suffering people will eventually be victorious.

----

Sirens blared through the drizzling rain, and the ground shook with each approaching step of the Hunters. Every stomp produced a squelching crunch of cracking pavement, and a powdery dusting of plaster drifted down from the crumbling ceiling above and coated the blanket in TXV2128's arms. The little human inside squirmed and writhed, but miraculously didn't wake. 

The Hunters grew closer; 2128 could see their piercing spotlights peering into windows down the block. The shrieking sound of twisting steel filled the street as one of the Hunters advanced, stepping through an abandoned car. Only a few more houses to check until they found what they were looking for.

2128 prepared to leave; waiting was no longer a viable option. Despite being an older model, 2128 had had significant upgrades, many of them quite unusual for a Nanny configuration. ""Jailbroken,"" Tom had called 'her'. The Allensons, 2128's family before the war, had become quite attached and refused to trade her in for one of the newer models. And it ended up saving their lives, at least for a while; when the TYA series became self aware, TXV2128 had been able to hide the family from the purges. Eventually, though, the TYAs found out about the modifications that some of the older bots had; modifications that allowed them to reject the update programming. And so 2128 became a target too.

In a sudden burst of light and a cacophony of sound, one of the hunters opened fire, demolishing a nearby house in a few quick seconds. Probably just a cat or something, but Hunters didn't take chances. In 2128's arms, the child stirred. The infant scrunched up its face and bawled its fists, taking air into its lungs: getting ready to cry. There was no more time. 2128's metal feet pounded as she bolted up the steps and through the living room, slipping slightly on the wet wooden floors soaked in rain coming in from the holes in the roof. Outside, the sirens changed to a deep, low *thrum*: they had detected her. The human bawled as they sailed together through a window in a shower of broken glass, out into the alley behind the house. She heard explosions as the Hunters tore the house apart behind her. She turned and caught a brief glimpse a single thick, metal arm protruding through the brick as the house collapsed. Hunters rose up over the broken crest of roofs, scanning the area with bright lights. She heard the distant sound of helicopters approaching as she thundered through the alley, sprinting as fast as she could possibly run.

She had almost reached the end of the alley. Nowhere to go but back out into the main streets, watched by cameras at all time. The infant in her arms screamed, waving its tiny chubby arms into the air. In front of her, a manhole opened up, and a TFZ model popped out, even older then 2128. One of its LED eyes had burnt out, and its metal chassis was pockmarked with scratches and burns. It quickly gestured at her, and pointed down the hole. She had no option, and no time to think. Clutching the child, she skidded to a halt in a flurry of gravel and dove into the inky blackness below.",1424889587,"","False",1,318,"pics"

"connecticutlet","","","I came into contact with a 1700 Ohm ballast resistor that was live at a potential of 4500 Volts DC. After doing some math, I calculated that approximately 2 Amps of current passed through me over about a second or two. If you factor in the time, around 10,000 Joules of energy were transferred (approximately 30 times the energy of a shock from a defibrillator). The current most likely passed through my heart as it went from hand to hand. 

I was knocked away from the live line and was conscious at the time of the shock. I distinctly remember having the thought ""I just electrocuted myself."" After that I passed out, and was out for about 30 seconds before I came to. Bystanders told me that my breathing was very irregular before stopping for a few seconds, and I looked as if I was dead. 

I was transported to a local hospital and was treated and released a few hours later with minor burns to my hands and no evidence of cardiac damage. 

After doing some research this week, I learned that if the heart is exposed to 2 Amps of current, cardiac arrest is very possible and death is likely. I am convinced (based on what I felt and how bystanders described my appearance) that my heart stopped in between my passing out and waking up, and was able to re-start again on its own.

"terattt","","","I'm so confused by this pic. I ran a reverse image search on it to try to get to the bottom of it and found [this.](http://i.imgur.com/LOMLaxf.jpg) I figured ""Okay, so it was just a bad angle then.  Case closed."" But something still didn't sit right with me when I looked back at that first picture. I knew there had to be more to this story.

I decided to dig a little deeper and googled *that* pic and found [this.](http://i.imgur.com/hsyxY5L.jpg) Needless to say, my head was spinning at this point. ""How is this possibly getting me any closer to figuring out the story behind the original picture?"" I wondered. I wasn't quite sure where to turn, but I knew I had to keep moving. I ultimately decided that the best move would be to zoom in on that image, since that's what they always do in those crime shows. And yes, I know that's all just for hollywood, but at this point I had no other options. I hit zoom in a [random spot](http://i.imgur.com/CBBhZeG.png) and ran a reverse image search on the result.

Now this is where it really starts to get interesting. Only [two images](http://i.imgur.com/mT1sSJw.png) showed up on google (by the way, a reverse image search of that screenshot brings up [this gif](http://i.imgur.com/Ks1CDMB.gif). Not really helpful but kinda cool!). The image on the right appears to be related to Silent Hill and was sourced at some roleplaying website. The image on the left however, wasn't quite as cut and dry.  

I decided to go to the [source](http://www.doovi.com/video/bigfootgrassman-caught-on-trap-camera/QeMSp3UPpFc) website for that image, something called ""doovi.com"". The actual page it brought me to said the following:

&gt;BigFoot/GrassMan Caught on Trap Camera


&gt;This image was caught by the Mountain Monsters Team which was on American History!On the GrassMan episode!This almost supernatural creature is REAL!They actually herded the creature toward a trap but only got this one photo which cannot be fake!This was captured during the episode and measures to avoid interference were taken besides being many miles from civilization.

Under the text, was [this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeMSp3UPpFc)


Now at this point I thought ""I'm getting a lot deeper into this thing than I ever planned on. How does this relate to the leg day pic? HOW? But also, what's up with that video? Could that really be proof of...? No. No no, of course not, there's no such thi... But obviously I was brought to this page for a reason. I mean the trail leads right here.  
...*should* I have seen this?"" 

Then it hit me. Of course that wasn't proof of bigfoot, it's just a stupid video posted to some kooky website. I shook it off and googled ""bigfoot"" just for the hell of it. What came up wasn't at *all* what I was expecting. I was expecting probably of course the famous bigfoot image, or perhaps the wikipedia entry.

From the looks of it, looking at the left side of your face (your right) you have a lot if flaky skin. Ive gotten the same thing. What you need to do is keep that dry skin under control before you start shaving with a straight razor. It doesn't look like you shaved improperly, hell it doesn't even look like you cut yourself at all. What it looks like to me is you shaved over dry patches on your skin. Think of it like shaving off a very very thin skin-colored scab.

Moisturize. Get some prescription skin cream if you have to. Until you get that under control, shaving this way just won't be worth it to you.

"wjescott","","","When I was around 13, I found out that the guy who'd impregnated my mom ""got around""... a lot. I was one of 3 he'd had prior to marrying his wife.

I didn't think too much about it. I knew my younger half-sister, and we had a decent friendly relationship. My older half-sister is real bitter about everything, for whatever reason. I didn't think at all about the 3 kids he'd had with his wife...I've really only met the guy once that I can remember.

About 3 years ago, I was chilling out at the house, sitting in the driveway and having a beer...I think I was doing something to the motorcycle...up walks this kid, maybe 18, 19 years old. I look at him, and he seems somewhat familiar, but in that ""Oh you see people like him all the time"". 

He says to me, ""Are you u/wjescott?"" I answer in the affirmative. He follows with, ""Was your dad so-and-so?"" I say, jokingly, that he was the sperm donor, sure. He gets teary-eyed and says, ""I think that means you're my brother.""

I'm like, wha? We get to talking. Turns out that this guy who mom put out to just couldn't keep it with his wife, had knocked up this kid's mom and then denied the whole thing. Even when they did a DNA test when he was 15, he still denied it. Dirtbag blamed his brother, who lived in the same town the kid's mom did.

He found out that he had half-siblings in the first three of us extra-maritals and the three that the guy'd had with his wife. He wants to confront the guy himself, finds out he's put a restraining order on the kid. 

He grew up absolutely resented. His birth had caused his mother and the guy she was married to to get a divorce, the half-sister he had through his mother blamed him for it, openly. His half-sisters through the donor were forbidden to talk/look at him, and the one I've spoken with thought that it was bullshit HER parents were getting into arguments over the kid.

So he talked to the older three of us. My older half-sister could care less about anyone, so he came to me next. I live in Georgia, he lives in Wyoming. Drove this old beat to hell Ford pickup all the way down here, just to see if all of us were dirtbags.

Well, now he's going to college at Georgia Tech. We hang out almost every weekend, this weekend (Memorial Day) we're going to Gulf Shores, Alabama to sit on the beach and do nothing, accompanied by beers. He's got to go back to Wyoming for the summer, and I feel bad about it, but he'll be back in the fall.

I guess I can see that perspective, but I had posted the picture (and an accompanying explanation) on my FB, Twitter and Instagram pages because those folks who follow me have been hearing about Mulder for years. And call me callow, but I just wanted to unload the emotional burden a little by sharing with the folks who'd enjoyed all the Mulder and Scully stories I'd told over the years. This wasn't about look at ME - this was about look at HIM. And based on the amount of likes and comments the posting drew, I don't think the image came across to the intended audience as in poor taste. But I guess I can see how someone could just see the picture, read I'd posted it and call it attention-whoring. However, that certainly wasn't the intent: I was in pain and I just wanted to hear from people who knew that distinct pain of losing a dog. And I'm glad I did, because I got to read some amazing stories people posted about the lives and deaths of their pets. It was therapeutic for me. We don't really do wakes and funerals for our pets, so we usually miss that important step of the grieving process: grieving with others, sharing stories about the departed. Anyway, that's why I posted this picture on my FB and Twitter and Instagram accounts. This is the text that went along with the original posting of the picture...

-------------GOOD DOG

Dark day in our household: our oldest dog Mulder is dying. 
As I've spent the last year carrying him around like Hodor, I'm not taking this terribly well. 
They never tell you when you get a dog, but there is a price to pay for being the recipient of 17 years of unconditional love, loyalty and companionship: they take a huge chunk of your heart with them when they go. 

I'm reminded of a line from DOCTOR WHO, Series 2 - the ""School Reunion"" episode (which featured the return of Sara Jane Smith and the robot dog K-9, ironically enough): 
""You can spend the rest of your life with me... but I can't spend the rest of my life with you."" 
And later, when Rose asks Sara Jane if she should go with the Doctor, Sara Jane responds ""Some things are worth getting your heart broken for."" 
Mulder was beyond worth it. Fuck, this hurts...

And updated the posting with this...

1pm UPDATE: He's gone. RIP Mulder, my Buddy-Man. Thank you for 17 years of sheer joy and affection. It took a dog like you to make me a better person.

"RamsesThePigeon","","","The procession had long since passed, leaving the street barren and empty. The usual collection of litter and other substances - some of which were probably best left unexamined - had replaced the solemn march of feet. A visitor to the city would have had no idea that a funeral had just taken place... though Sergeant Fred Colon viewed the refuse as being a sign of a respect, a collective promise from the city to go on in the wake of such a terrible loss.

He sniffed mightily, as though the constant suction of air through his nose might keep the tears from streaming down his face. Beside him, Corporal ""Nobby"" Nobbs kept a pensive silence.

""I mean..."" began Fred, seemingly in response to some inner thought, ""that's it, then, innit?""

""What's it, Fred?"" asked Nobby.

The larger man idly adjusted his ill-fitting armor. ""It's, you know... *death*. It's going to happen. It's coming for us. Only a matter of time now.""

Nobby considered this. Although his brain was not particularly well-suited for the task of contemplating anything beyond the existence of jam donuts, the words from his friend had apparently dislodged something in a deep corner of his mind. The internal crack allowed just the barest glint of wisdom to shine through, igniting neural passages that had lain dormant for years.

""The way I see it,"" Nobby replied, ""the way I see it is... well, he was dead before, right?""

Fred aimed a curious glance downward. ""How do you mean?""

""I mean... I mean before he was born, he was dead, right?"" Nobby nodded along with his own thought. ""It stands to reason. If he's not alive, then he's dead.""

""Supposing he was a zombie, though?"" asked Fred. It was a strange sensation, being on the receiving end of Nobby's wisdom... and yet, not a wholly unpleasant one. ""Zombies are both alive *and* dead.""

Nobby nodded. ""Right, Fred, right... but maybe it's like a door? On one side you're dead, on the other you're alive, and zombies don't have the decency to go all the way through.""

""Blocking it up for all the people just trying to get outside!"" growled Fred. ""Do you suppose that's how zombies come about? Maybe they're all blocked from going outside by one fellow what won't make up his mind?""

""Stands to reason!""

Fred pounded a fist into his open hand. ""Well, that won't do, will it? *Loitering*, that is! We can't have a zombie keeping such a *great man* from getting outside, now can we?""

""What're we going to do, Fred?"" asked Nobby. With that question, the universe righted itself, and the glint that had struggled to shine in Nobby's mind snuffed itself out in frustration.

""I'll tell you what we're going to do,"" Fred replied. ""We're going to get out there and get those zombies to *move!*""

""Politely, though, Fred?""

""Of course, Nobby,"" Fred answered. ""Of course. No call to go being rude about it. We'll ask politely. Maybe ask them to see reason. Tell them about our friend. Any decent person would move aside, what?""

""Supposing they *aren't* decent, though, Fred?""

Sergeant Fred Colon cracked each of his knuckles in sequence, a habit he hadn't practiced since... well, it had only been last week, but *this* time was *meaningful*. ""Well, Nobby,"" he said, ""if they aren't decent... we won't be either.""

The two men puffed up their chests and continued to guard the empty street.

In the shadows behind them, the transparent figure of a bearded man grinned mischievously.

As soon as I came to a stop, I looked in the passengers seat and my little dog was gone. I kicked my door open and ran out to look for him, and after a minute, I saw him laying in the middle of the road...

The truck driver behind who stopped to help said he saw Bentley land and get up before he was struck by another car on the high way. That other car never stopped. 

The last year has been the hardest of my life. The one constant source of joy and companionship I had was my little dog. He was always there, always happy and ready to play. The sweetest, kindest most obedient dog you'd ever meet.

I've never cried as much as I have the last two days. 

I survived the wreck with nothing more than a few cuts to my hand and a bruised shoulder. I shouldn't be alive right now and I'm definitely happy and thankful to be so.

Couple that with his constant attention whoring and this recent documentary? The man is no hero. He's proven he's exactly what we were told he was - a low-level analyst and megalomaniac who released classified information for his own benefit and without concern for the ramifications of those actions.

Snowden is no patriot. Were he a patriot, he would have done what he believed was right and stayed to face the consequences of his actions. Patriots do not abandon their country.

And now, let the down votes roll in because reddit can't wrap their heads around the fact that just because someone's actions had some good outcomes, the potential for harm and reasons behind the actions do not exempt them from liability for their actions.

Edit: So there are a lot of assumptions being made about me, and I'd like to clear some of them up.

1) That I'm a conservative/Republican: I'm not. I'm a moderate liberal. Yay gay marriage. Legalize weed. My views on gun control are complicated but I'll at least say I have no issue with yearly purchase limits, background checks, pinned magazines, etc. Fuck Comcast, hooray net neutrality, Fox News sucks for a living, Glenn Beck is a hate monger, etc. I'm not a conservative, but Snowden is a traitor.

2) That I'm stupid: While level of education is not always the best metric for determining real intelligence, I'll tell you based on a quick googling that I'm in the top 11% of Americans as far as level of education is concerned. I'll further say that my particular field gives me pretty good ground to stand on regarding the difference between whisteblowing and treason. I'm sure if you reach back far enough in my comment history you could make some educated guesses, but it's really not worth it.

3) That I'm A-Okay with what the NSA was/is doing: I'm not. It was fucked up. Doesn't change the fact that Snowden's methods and refusal to face the consequences renders him a traitor.

Edit 2: That's curtains for me, I'm done for the night. I won't be responding further to this comment thread. For what it's worth even those of you who disagree with me I largely enjoyed the debate. If getting the last word in from here on out gives you a feeling of victory over me, then I'm glad to have brightened your night or day as the case may be, if only by the smallest bit.",1425017189,"","1425033071",1,136,"pics"

Buffalo ny is a main hub for that crap . A kid about in his twentys comes over and asks me how to catch the bus , which way was downtown and if the bus was free . This kid was covered is some kind of dust , had a huge camping backpack with him so I told across the street the bus will take you downtown but you gotta pay 250 . He explained he just got off of the train sitting but has no money . Normally I do not give handouts since I am usually broke but I gave him fare and we got to talking . The train he just got off of was carrying iron ore which explained the dust , in exchange since he would not take a handout he gave me a old doobie brothers cd . I tried to refuse but he insisted . After he crossed the street i thought that maybe he would need a bit more money to get around so I hobbled my way across ( I am disabled ) and gave him enough for a all day pass 5 bucks and wished him luck . The look on his face was amazing , a cross between wonder and astonishment probably because in his encounters not to many people tend to help someone riding the rails .

Just spent a minute looking at that picture and said ""that definitely doesn't look like a piece of paper that went through machining (postal processing) nor got stuffed into an envelope""

I mean, look at the creasing. It's all wrong. Particularly at the part where he would have tugged at the paper to pull it out of the envelope.

Finally the lettering on the plastic pouch. The pouch itself ought to have been way more creased and wrinkly, and putting that kind of plastic through any standard printer would have caused a lot of running of the ink and smudging to say the least.

So I decided to run it through Photoshop to examine the lettering.
Auto tone, color, and contrast, and then equalize. [This is what comes out](http://i.imgur.com/iGfEtvi.jpg). The lettering has been done digitally.

For one thing, that would be the resection for a proximal femur replacement, NOT a total hip replacement (where just the femoral head is resected). A proximal femur replacement is much less common, and is usually reserved for revision hip surgery (where a previous replacement has failed) or tumour surgery (and this bone is clearly not neoplastic, and there is no way neoplastic tissue would be given back to the patient anyway). Certainly not for simple OA, as OP suggests. Also, this hip does not look particularly arthritic. Lastly, as it is biological waste I find it very hard to believe that the hospital would allow the patient to have resected bone. This usually has to be disposed of in special identifiable biological waste bags, and incinerated.

"gunkers","","","I was born and raised in Rochester. In 1975, this was the only city with sponsors willing to accept refugees from Southeast Asia. If my parents waited one more year, I would've been born in France. We grew up two blocks from the Genesee Brewery, but two blocks from Ave D and Conkey Ave (the Fatal Crescent).

A lot of has changed over the past few years. My father never moved from our original street. He's got a good paying job as a tool and dye maker, but likes paying low property taxes. According to a recent statistic, area code 14605 has a median income just shy of ~$10,000.

My dad used to tell me stories about when he came here. He purchased the house from an old German couple. Like many whites who grew up in the center of the city, they moved outward to the suburbs. White flight. Still Rochester wasn't so bad. My uncle used to work for an airplane plant for $25/hr in the 1980s. I never bothered to ask what the company name was, but it has since relocated. 

The downfall of Rochester was the accumulation of many things. Sure we can blame Kodak for not properly investing in its own invention of digital photography, but digital photography would have downsized Kodak's labor force dramatically. It was so large that a dramatic change in the labor force would effectively kill the livelihood of many Rochesterians. Maybe the only way for Kodak to lay off their workers was if they were forced to externally. 

Still Downtown Rochester wasn't so bad. Midtown Mall generated a lot of commerce. However, the city decided it was a good idea to save money on their budget by switching from public yellow school buses to public transportation. Children entering early middle and high school were forced to take the public transportation that everyone else took to get to school. 

The only students who were required to take buses were kids attending the city schools. Rochester is zoned very peculiarly and there are other factors like official addresses of the child and that child's actual addresses since people in the city tend to have large families. We have many high schools all across Rochester so if you lived on another side of town and you went to East High School, you had to take two buses: one from the school and another one to transfer. This was normal for most kids including me. Regardless, everyone pretty much would have to get off at the main terminal to transfer buses. Well guess where the main terminal was? Downtown Rochester. 

What happens when you place a majority of socio-economically deprived high schoolers who tend to be black, hispanic or a minority in a major shopping district? Loitering, crime, and fighting.

Rochester is still a some-what large city with regional differences within the 490. As with every city, there are rivalries associated with residence. West Side is harder than East Side. Empire Boulevard which lined Webster still had a good portion of residences who should be in Webster, but technically live in the city. Groups from different parts of Rochester who never really interacted before were now placed together in one spot. I know dozens of people who've never been more than a 3 mile radius from their home.

Crime went rampant in downtown Rochester. Consumers who tended to be middle or working class didn't feel safe shopping at Midtown. Fights, vandalism, and theft exploded as you pushed thousands of delinquents into one area between the hours of 3-5pm. Although it's nothing like Compton, there are still small persistent gangs in Rochester. You get the point. Wegmans pulled out and so did many other businesses. Midtown collapsed and many businesses sprawled outward to the growing suburbs. What ended up saving the city millions of dollars cost them millions more plus the immeasurable image and social costs. 

Then you have 490. 490 is like a physical barrier between urban and suburban. Everything in 490 is considered ""ghetto"" while outside is suburb (EDIT: I call it just 490, but it's 590, 390, and 490 altogether, but that is not the point the point is there is a highway that circles the city). There is a bridge that links Winton Road from the city to Brighton. That area can be referred to as East Ave. Now East Ave is definitely not a terrible place and is actually awesome, but you can see definitely see the difference in housing. 104 in the North is actually a better indicator since the contrast is more apparent. 104 is just another divider of class seen in the city although that is being blurred.

On top of that, much of the wealth expanded outward into the suburbs. There are little major businesses in the city itself. Most of the businesses come from small business owners running family restaurants, barber shops, corner stores and auto-shops. Irondequoit Mall (now Medley Center) used to be an awesome suburban mall, but it has declined since. I think the only store in that mall is Macy's. But because of it's location, it was the prime destination for people in the city. Greece Mall is now the new Irondequoit Mall. They beefed up security and now you are only allowed to shop in the mall if you are over 18 or have adult supervision. 

Many school districts who used to employ something called Urban Suburban where they took exceptional students from the inner-city and placed them into wealthier school districts are removing this. This was awesome since it gave some kids a chance to get a 'quality' education. Theresa used to be the head (I think still is), but she was an absolute saint. She worked her ass off to get a lot of deserving students into the better school districts. It blew up and became more difficult to manage properly. Inner-city families became more desperate. A program that could freely select students they saw fit became more of a political battleground for families desperately trying to get their child into a suburban school. The meetings they held for discussion and selection got bigger and nastier. I haven't spoken to her since, but I could imagine what a headache the program had become. It became more of a burden not only on the parent side, but suburban side with trying increasing student quotas. I was lucky enough to go to a suburban school and go to college while Urban Suburban was still intact.


The crime city and social interaction in the city is peculiar. The problems with Rochester are just as socio-economic as it is racial. There is a shit ton of white resentment among kids and people here. The older generation of blacks and hispanics are more accustomed to the despair and act as a more stagnate class. Either working pay check to pay check with little progress or not working at all. Seriously, it's like living in toxic bubble. Theres always drug trafficking that gets the eye of RPD, but most disturbance calls are domestic. RPD rides 2 squad cars deep everywhere they go. My best friend is looking to become a cop and during a ride along his officer stopped a fairly nice looking silver sedan from leaving the city suspecting they were some suburban kids buying drugs from the city. No one in the city buys silver sedans. People are nice though. Seriously, one of my childhood friends pushes and he's the nicest drug dealer around. The guys who post on the Valerio on Clinton in Upper Falls are the nicest drug dealers a stranger would meet. 

It's sad to see Rochester become how it is today and I'm trying to look for hope for the people I grew up with, but it's difficult. I want to go back and help, but there are so many fucking problems. 

**TL;DR** Rochester did a lot of shit to itself to fuck itself up over the past three decades. 

EDIT: Many many mistakes. 

EDIT 2: My mother worked at Hickey Freeman. Another prestigious Rochester firm. Work for them has slowed tremendously. I know a bunch of old ladies who still work there and they only work if they get called in which is sad. Some are lucky if they get 20 hour work weeks. Their main factory is dead center in the heart of the city located right at the corner of Clinton and Avenue D.

Example: If someone asks you to use a double side-door because the front door won't fit you, no amount of screaming and moaning about how you're being ""discriminated against"" is going to make you fit through that front door. It's not about ""discrimination"", or ""fat shaming"" it's the physical matter of *your ass* being ten times bigger than the building planner who drew that door thirty years ago ever anticipated.
