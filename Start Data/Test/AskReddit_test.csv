"squeakygreenmom","","","Oh god. Bags of frozen veggies and a couple packs of ramen can make a family meal. I used to buy these awful frozen chicken discs wrapped in bacon - they were terrible - filled with gristle and just nasty. Eating those with rice and frozen corn was a real treat. 

I ate kraft dinner (mac and cheese) every day for about 2-3 years because that was all I could cook while my mom worked. (I could have made spaghetti-os, but I hated those), That for dinner, and one of those cheap 99 cent pack donuts from the grocery store for breakfast. Lunch was Bologna sandwich and an apple.  Finally, when I was about 10 or 11, I started teaching myself how to cook  from my mom's old cook books so my meals got a lot better. All carbs, and cheap fats - scalloped potatoes, rice and cheap meats. 

My local bus service used to have paper transfers. So you'd pay your fare, get the paper transfer that was good for an hour, and then you'd use it for the next bus. But if you were only going to the station, you'd get a paper transfer anyway, then hang around the station for an extra 5 minutes to see if anyone needed it. Conversely, you'd wait around for people getting off the bus, to see if you could score someones transfer. This only worked if you weren't switching buses, but I got quite a few free rides this way (and gave many a transfer away) 

Going without meds, living in constant pain because you can't afford a prescription. I remember laying in my bed at night, and my mom would be sobbing in her bed from pain, because she couldn't afford the meds that would treat her rheumatoid arthritis or anything but generic tylenol for her pain. I guess that's not reallly buying anything, but while we're down memory lane..

Saving your birthday money from your grandma and aunts and uncles so you can pay for a babysitting course that lets you babysit at 12. Getting a babysitting job at 12, and babysitting every day from 3 until 7 or 8, to earn some money. Giving that money to your dad so he can pay his phone bill and put gas in his car. Getting a real job at 14, working at a fast food joint so you got to eat dirt cheap. Still giving your dad money, but this time knowing it is going to the casino or the bar (but still doing it anyway).

I was a youth advisor in a summer program aimed at getting first generation high school kids prepped for college, and it was my summer job while in college. She fell out right before we hit a series of rapids. I rushed over from my seat and popped her back into the raft just before hitting the lip of the rapid. After I got her back into the raft, I didn't get to my seat in time and didn't get fully secured and wound up in the water. I went through a series of seven rapids back to back, nearly drowned, saw the bright white light, had my life flash before my eyes, and gave up trying to live and embraced that I was about to die.

I made the mistake of watching a YouTube video of the procedure the day before hand, I really was not looking forward to it.

"XelNaga","","","***Finally*** I have a good story for one of these threads!  It's a shame that I'm so late to the thread that this will almost certainly be buried.  Sorry in advance for the length.

I was hired to do phone support at home, by a large Fortune 100 company.  For the job, they mailed us [Thin Clients](http://i.imgur.com/BgKS2L0.png) which were basically small, gimped, desktop computers that were completely locked down (couldn't even change the desktop background) so we couldn't fuck with them, and we were only able to log into their VPN to do our work.

Our training was split into two blocks.  Three weeks of software support training, after which we'd take calls about the software issues of the product(s) we were supporting.  When they determined we had the software side of things handled, we'd do the 2nd part of our training for hardware support, after which we'd take calls for both hardware and software issues.

First three weeks of initial training went relatively smoothly, other than a few Thin Clients needing to be replaced.  Mine included.  The time between when the Thin Client died on me, to when I had a replacement shipped and in my hands, took only two days; which I was compensated for.

Our three weeks of training end, we all pass qualifications, and we're given the green light to start two weeks of 'nesting'. This basically amounts to taking live calls, but with our hands being held by supervisors and other more experienced support personnel.

After we finished nesting, we went into 'production' to take live calls on our own.  After a week of that, we were told we'd be going back into training for the hardware portion.  The day before I was to report back to training, my Thin Client dies *again*.  

I contact our outsourced support line of dudes in India, and they tell me in broken English that they're shipping out a new one again.  Two days go by, and I've got nothing in the mail.  ""Okay, maybe it's just a bit late.""  I call the support line again just be sure.  They tell me that the order was never placed, and they're placing it again.  Two more days go by.  Still nothing.  Call again, and they say it's still on the way. I keep calling every day, and they tell me the same thing.

Eventually a whole week goes by where I can't sign into work, and I get a call from my supervisor, asking why I haven't logged in for so long.  I explain the situation to him, and he promises to rectify it.  Calls me back 20 minutes later, saying he got a new Thin Client sent out to me, and it'll be here tomorrow.  Great!

I get the Thin Client the next day, I sign in, and go into training.  However, I've missed an entire week of a two-week course.  I can't take the assessments or pass any of the qualifications to begin taking calls again.  Trainer tells me I'll just have to take the hardware training over again.  However, she says there are no new hardware classes scheduled for the near future.

The problem is, once this class ended, everyone who was scheduled for it would be put into the hardware queue.  This means that I'd be taking calls that I had zero training for.  So I was frantically emailing my supervisor about what I should do at this point, since I can't do the training, and I can't take the calls.

I got no response.

For two whole weeks, I didn't get a single response from my supervisor, or **anyone else**.  No email, no phone call asking what was wrong, nothing.  Just me clocking in at Noon, sending an email, refreshing the page every 30 minutes or so while dicking around on the computer, clocking out/in for Lunch, and repeating until clocking out finally at 9pm.

After two weeks of this, and still receiving my full paycheck, I realized they had forgotten about me.  I had somehow fallen through the cracks of the system.  Which is truly surprising for a phone support job, because they usually have someone monitoring *everything*, just because they can.

At this point, I stopped sending emails, only checked my inbox once a day when I clocked in, and just took care to never be late from lunch, and always clock out on time.

This happened in January of this year.  ***For the past 5 months*** I have been getting paid $10/hour to do literally **nothing** but manage my daily time punches, and play video games.  I recall a greentext story that's eerily similar to my situation, but the guy was working in a physical office building instead of at home. 

I've been toying with the idea of getting a 2nd job to pull in double the pay, but it has to be another at-home job, or I wouldn't be able to manage the time punches for the one I have now.  Can't even write a script to go through the motions, since it all has to be done on their shitty locked-down Thin Client.  

Also, another drawback is I can't put in for vacation time to go travelling.  I figure any vacation requests or days missed might draw attention to me, and someone might notice I haven't taken any calls for 5 months.

However, I can live with that to have infinite free-time, and enough money to pay my bills with a bit left over.

"LabKitty","","","**Godzilla.** The monsters stop chowing down at the nuclear waste site to go chasing after a train carrying a couple of Minuteman missiles.

The Minuteman warhead has a yield in the megaton range. That part the movie got right (well, sort of. IIRC, the movie specifically mentions the Minuteman III, which carries a W78. This warhead has a reduced yield (~300 kilotons) compared to those carried by earlier versions of the Minuteman having yields in the megaton range. Still, the W78 is no slouch). However, the screenwriters are confusing ""large yield"" with ""contains oodles of radioactive stuff."" This is wrong. The W78 is a true thermonuclear -- that is, a multiple-stage Teller-Ulam device. It's basically a barrel of lithium deuteride with an atom bomb bolted to one end. The atom bomb provides the spark, but most of the yield comes from fusion of the deuteride. While you wouldn't want to roll around in it, lithium deuteride isn't radioactive. Even an atom bomb isn't all that radioactive before it goes off; the fissile contents are a few kilograms of plutonium (a hollow sphere about the size of an orange). Plutonium is a prodigious spontaneous alpha emitter, but unless you eat it (or, yes, detonate it), it won't hurt you. Alpha particles don't pass through *paper*, so they certainly won't make it past the metal bomb casing. 

TL;DR: There is nothing on the train that would attract the monsters.

Edit: As thehumungus, DrXaos, cave_hat and AsDevilsRun point out, the W78 derives a substantial portion of its yield from fission. However, there's *still* nothing in a W78 that a Kuzdu would sniff out.",1424287482,"","1424384667",1,2620,"AskReddit"

"A40","","","In the 70s, at the private high school I attended, lgbt issues and even our existence were unspoken, never taught and invisible. The same applied to public schools (Canada). Being different was survivable if no clear label was applied to the flavour of ""different.""

I was lucky: Dad was a cop and knew about such things, and we lived in a large city (Montreal) where underground cultures thrived, good and bad. But outside of those core neighbourhoods, there seemingly *was* no lgbt presence - if you didn't look with knowing eyes. I existed. I knew of a boy a few streets over who was gay. People knew about me. I knew of adult clubs I could enter during daylight hours to talk to the staff and entertainers. So there were ""out"" people, too.

This was before the internet, before there were even news or magazine articles to find and read - and I read every damn book in the libraries. Semi-pornographic little booklets were available in dirty book shops, if I was lucky enough to find any (they imported maybe a half-dozen from American publishers, and they were often seized at the border). But I had a few. 

There were raids (one at a club I went to some afternoons), arrests, names in the paper alongside mentions of ""lewd conduct,"" shaming men and ruining their lives. Never women. The papers pretended lesbians didn't exist. My Dad started showing me those small articles when I was still very young as a warning. 

There were beatings and killings, too, gay bashers, mostly of prostitutes, but sometimes just men walking, or same-sex couples in the open or even at home, men and women. The 60s and 70s were bad times that way. Pride was just starting in Canada, just the minority.

I also know that that invisibility contributed to the AIDS epidemic, a disease we never knew existed until it had spread. So many gay men kept themselves apart from the community, just dropping in for nights in the clubs and sex and then leaving, anonymous. They had lives outside that they protected, or no lives and just fear.

I had friends who got sick in '82 and '83 - and never knew what killed them. Never had a name except 'pneumonia,' or 'skin cancer.'

When AIDS was named it blew the community apart, everyone choosing a camp - isolating themselves, or organizing politically, or setting up care cooperatives, or self-educating about safer sex, or whatever. 

The clubs all changed, or closed from lack of business, or became 'tea houses' compared to what they'd been before. But it also led to thousands and thousands of people coming out.

"laboner","","","I was an aviation supply marine in Afghanistan back in 2008. Not the most glamorous job in the Marine Corps, but necessary. I was like the hank hill of the Corps, providing my helicopter with helicopter parts and helicopter accessories. Anyway, the tents we were living in we're a good 2 miles walk from the hangar, and after about 2 months in country working 12+ hour shifts on started to look forward to a stress release. I didn't have a laptop, or iPod, or anything with any kind of XXX laden electronics to serve my touchy feely needs, but I had a buddy of mine that got a flashy new iPod touch mailed in from the states LOADED down with porn. I knew where he kept it. So I literally ran, on about a daily basis, in 110+ degree heat damn near 2 miles in flack and Kevlar with my rifle slung over shoulder back to the tents so I could get there before he did, snatch his porn device, and beat my dick before he got back. It was shameless, and I still regret nothing. Also, one should note that the only real privacy afforded to us at the time was inside of a port-a-shitter. That's right, beat my dick to a stolen iPod in a tiny shack full of human excrement in 110 degree heat after sprinting 2 miles in a flack jacket and Kevlar helmet.

"WileyWiggins","","","My grandfather or Pa, as I called him, gave me an absolute gem.

He was actually my step mother's dad and we already called my other grandfather Papa, so we called him 'Pa Ulbl' - Ulbl being his surname.

He was an incredible artist and would paint awesome things for us or on our bedroom walls. I remember he painted me a massive Star Wars piece on one of my walls when Episode 1 came out. I was only about about 6 at the time and remember being scared of Darth Maul. From this we used to joke around that Darth Maul would come and get me if I did anything wrong. Sort of like a police officer watching my every move, to ensure I behaved.

This carried on as a joke until he died 2 years ago, when I had done something wrong he said he'd call the police and get Maul to take me away. When he did die he had just finished an incredible painting of Darth Maul as a police officer. It was amazing! My parents couldn't make sense of it and weren't sure if it was him that had painted it, so they flipped it over because he used to always write Pa Ulbl Art and the title of the painting.

"i_shall_be_released","","","To most Americans, *socialism* means welfare state/redistribution or Stalinist totalitarianism. Most of the responses in this thread are referring to the welfare state/redistribution. The welfare state/redistribution ≠ socialism (neither does Stalinist totalitarianism). 

If you ever take Political Science 101, these will be the actual definitions you'll learn:

&gt;**Socialism**: worker ownership and control over production, industry, and workplaces on a democratic, egalitarian basis.

&gt;**Communism**: worker ownership and control over production, industry, and workplaces on a democratic, egalitarian basis ***and*** a stateless, classless, moneyless, society based on the principle ""each a according to their abilities, each according to their needs"".

To rephrase OP's question, ***What do Americans think about owning and controlling their own workplaces with fellow workers where everyone has an equal say in their livelihoods without bosses, managers, or hierarchy?***

Socialism already exists on a small scale. These workplaces are called *worker cooperatives*. There is an organization called the [United States Federation of Worker Cooperatives](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Federation_of_Worker_Cooperatives) which has several dozen members and there are *way more* throughout Europe.  The largest worker cooperative is the Spanish [Mondragon Corporation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mondragon_Corporation) which has over ***70,000 workers***.

Think about it for a minute: Would you rather work someplace where you have a say in the decisions you're affected by, where you have autonomy, and where you cooperate with others? Or work someplace where you just shut up and take orders from those above you and if you don't, you get fired? And if you want to rise up the corporate hierarchy, *you become the guy* who tells people to shut up and take orders?

"lokigodofchaos","","","A Christopher Nolan film. On the surface it looks like a period piece set in the 60's -70's. A man in prison (Joesph Gordon Levitt) struggling with depression. In his cell, contemplating suicide, he begins recounting his troubled childhood to his cellmate, Micheal Cane.

In the first act we go quickly through his younger life. A child on a farm with 4 siblings, a strict father and a distant mother. The family moves to the city, where he gets bullied for being a hick. He finds solace reading old military books. Using tactics from his book, he and a group of misfit friends defeat the bullies.

Cut to prison where he is still considering suicide, staring at a homemade noose. Michael Cane urges him to continue.

He then relates dropping out of school, and traveling with some hippies led by Ellen Page, whom he is in love with. She flirts but keeps him at a distance. He has a knack for painting. This act focuses on his pursuit of Page, trying to get close to her through his art.It all comes crashing down when it is  revealed she is a lesbian, which he discovers when he walks in on her with another woman. Dejected, and angry with himself he leaves the group.

He tries to get into a prestigious art college to avoid the draft but is rejected. He bites the bullet and enlist. Standard military ""War is Hell"" montage interspersed with him in prison crying. Cane is not consoling, but tells him some wise Michael Cane words about life being a struggle and it is our choice to live or die.

He gets out and on a chance encounter meets back up with Page. She is now part of a political activist group. Having nowhere to go he joins them. With his strict fathers upbringing, love of history, charisma and military service he becomes the face of the group. They plan to hold a huge rally. At the rally he gets arrested. At trial, Page back stabs him in a plea deal to get her charges dropped, and he gets 5 years.

Back to Cane and Levitt. We find out hes been in jail almost a year. Cane, who we thought all along was talking him down, is actually urging him to hang himself. A back and forth of dialog ensues, culminating in Cane attacking Levitt and putting the nose around his neck. Levitt, now wanting to live,fights him off. Just then the guards appear to break up the fight. They also announce he is getting early release.

Cut to Levitt being released from prison. Making his way down a long hallway. He passes by Cane's cell, where he has a defeated look on his face. The camra lingers on the cell and Cane says to someone offscreen. ""I've failed. I tried to stop you but I've failed. Father help us all."" Camera pans to reveal Ellen Page, in the shadows smirking in the corner of the jail cell.

As Levitt exits the prison a sepia tone takes over the screen. We see we are not in 1970's America, but 1920's Berlin. As Levitt walks down the street a free man, we see brief shots from his past, redone in a style appropriate for the 20's. All scenes with Ellen Pages have her replaced with Cillian Murphy. He enters a beer hall and is greeted by cheers from his former protesters, now wearing swastika armbands.
You realize you just spent 2 and a half hours rooting for Hitler.

He explains that it's not work experience - I'd be coming on as either features editor or fashion editor as all the other magazine staff had left. It would be a 5 day a week job. He then spent an hour going over all of the problems with my outfit, then asked me about my relationship status before bursting into tears about his last failed relationship. 20 minutes later, he's telling me how awful the industry is, and if I want to succeed I'd have to be prepared to sleep my way to the top, and that people would take advantage of me. 

He then tells me the job would be totally unpaid. But I'd be registered as employed so I'd lose my job centre weekly allowance - so I'd have to get a part time job somewhere else to survive.

"gotmytightpantson","","","I couldnt wear flip flops to school. My mom thought they were trashy and only trashy girls wore them. Literally that's all the girls wore. So I would end up wearing a nice outfit with stupid tennis shoes. I later just brought flip flops in my backpack.

Also no anklets. My dad just didn't like them and thought, again, ""trashy girls"" wore them. Jokes on him I made one at church camp and told him it was a virtue anklet and he seemed so conflicted, but he let me wear it.

No nail polish until I was 12. No black nail polish ever. No makeup until 14. No trendy bangs. No drawing on your hands. No Mountain Dew, Tea, or Coffee. No sleepovers at a certain age, like 14? 15 maybe. No tank tops.

Boys had to be +/- 1 year age difference. Could not drive trucks. 

""Anything that happens in the family, stays in the family"" was the motto.

EDIT: Apparently the last line is a bit out of left field, let me clarify.
All of these rules may not seem that ""weird"" or are maybe a tad strict, but reasonable. To me it was the severity of punishment, and how big of a deal these rules were. I was constantly afraid of doing something wrong. I wasn't comfortable in my own house because discipline usually consisted of verbal abuse (hours long lectures) and either gettin smacked or spanked of the fear from the implication it could happen. My father is bi-polar and other messed shit I don't know exactly, but he flies off the handle. So if I wanted to cover up my bad acne at 13 with a bit of foundation, I could get in big trouble for ""trying to be sneaky, and disrespecting him"". I would be afraid that maybe my purple nail polish looked black in some light. But I was still a young girl, and I would take the occasional risk (maybe sneak an eyeliner at school) to have fun like the other girls. It wasn't harmful. What was harmful was instilling my self-worth in my modesty (whether or not you could see my shoulders) and my ""sexual purity"" (My mom didn't sign my waiver to take the sex ed assembly (which was abstinence-only) and I had to get her to do it without her thinking I had ulterior motives). At 12. I just didn't want to be that one girl who couldn't go. 

Same goes for the religious aspect of telling a kid a presumed higher power frowns on Mountain Dew and tea. It's ridiculous.

So ""What happens in the family, stays in the family"" was supposed to tie in to the controlling nature of my parents, especially my father. There was a bubble of our family. He made us scared to ask to go out with friends because if we had the wrong answer, or didn't have every single detail, we were ""being sneaky"". His rules kept the family under his control. Of course there weren't any really for my brothers besides, ""don't date trashy girls"" and the like.
Once again perpetuating this idea that there is the class of women beneath others. All of it is damaging to young girls and boys.

EDIT 2: Because I still am getting a lot of ""I don't see anything wrong with these rules except for maybe this one"" I want to explain more clearly. I did say that I find them weird for punishment aspect (Spanking may not be abuse but other things I have not mentioned I know are, I will not be invalidated). Also weird for how serious these rules were held and also the religious influences. 

AS WELL AS the problematic logic people are putting behind not allowing their young girls to wear makeup and nail polish. Most people are agreeing with that. And maybe it's not something easily accepted or understood on Reddit, but I would assume that most don't want to sexualize their tweens/young teens, and want them looking their age. This contributes to the problem you think you are trying to solve. It's one thing to not want your kid to act too mature, but I promise you if you instill into her that she would become some sort of  ""trashy"", ""slutty"", or in general just a lesser person for wanting to put colors on her eyes and lips or nails, you are establishing a part of her self worth in terms of her looks and, vaguely, her ""sexual purity"". She will feel this is a core part of her importance. Something she needs to hide, to protect. People's perceptions of her is something she can't control and it becomes more important than her thoughts or actions. The most important thing about them becomes whether or not people see her a sex object. Its damaging to young girls they do not need that. If you dont want her wearing makeup and nail polish, for another reason, let her know that. I see very little harm in makeup and nail polish. No one would tell an 8 year old to cover her shoulders, it would imply that her shoulders need to be hidden because of some sexual variable. For a 12 year old who wants to put sparkly green shit on her eyes what is the logic behind saying no? That it just looks bad? Yeah they also wanna wear hot pink shirts and bedazzled jeans.

  On August 3rd 2013 my father passed away from cancer on his pelvic bone. He was the head of our household, my mother couldn't afford our rent anymore. I was 18 and was only focused on starting college and having my part-time mall job for my little expenses.
  
The loss brought a lot of issues between us. It hit us hard, but I knew it was difficult for her because she didn't have many people to talk to. She was separating from him months before, even though they lived together, just for my little brother.
  
The cancer showed up around March and was quickly destroying his body. So, even though they were divorcing, most of their friends sided with my dad even though there wasn't much bad blood. It's people just assumed ""Wow, she's separating while he has this cancer.""
 
 No one asked about how my mom was doing. Before he finally died he had his intestine rearranged and defecated into a bag coming from his belly. My mom was there working over night so during the day she could help feed him and clean his bag and disinfect his abdominal area. I can say she actually was there for him. That's what 28 years of being together would do.
 
 Anyways, as I mentioned: we had issues. And they progressed to get worse. My mom kicked me out. I had no where to go. It was December 30th 2013 and I only owned a jansport backpack with a few shirts, underwear, and shoes. Only had the pants and socks I had on me. I cried a lot.
At the time my girlfriend and her family went away for a week and she let me stay at her house. During this time I spent my New Years in her house alone. Soon they returned and I had no where to go. My girlfriend couldn't drop me off in the street, her heart wouldn't let her do it. She snuck me in her house, her mom heard me snoring and opened the door. The next day we spoke and she said I could stay 2 days then I'd have to figure out where to go.
 
 I stayed 3 months. The house was in repossession and they moved out during March 2014. I slept in this empty home with only a couch no water nor electricity for a month until the sheriff put a lock on the door. I was torn.

  My long distance brother sent me money. I bought a cheap car. I didn't think it through and I bought a honda de sol. It's a 2 seater car. It was tiny. I'm a 220lb 18 year old. It was tough but she kept me dry many a night. The car broke down and I cried more I parked it in some neighborhood that had guest spots and slept in it everyday. I'm sure people noticed.
After lots of crying and self mutilation, I started counting my blessings. I had a beautiful devoted girlfriend who would help feed me when I would go a few days without eating. She didn't let me go even though I thought I was a loser. She was a blessing, not many people our age would stick with someone through all that.
After a few odd jobs that were difficult to keep because I had no where to bathe or sleep or get ready, I found a stable job in April. I would bring shampoo to public community pools and bath and change in their bathrooms. I constantly cleaned my clothes at a coin laundry. Learned to cut my own hair. Kept my hygiene as tidy as possible.

  Finally after working through the hot summer, I had saved enough from this warehouse job to save for first, last, and deposit. My girlfriend and I moved in September of 2014. It felt great sleeping on a mattress. I only slept on a mattress in 2014 about 20 times after my girlfriends family moved from their home.
You have no idea how much I value things now. Nothing sucks more than not being able to have the privilege of going to your own kitchen and making yourself a goddamn sandwich or pouring a glass of water.
I use to cry because I would sit in this hot 2 seater small car during a south florida summer watching people drive home with groceries or pizza and seeing lights turn off and on. It made me cry so much, but fuck (even now I'm teary eyed) I am glad I lived through it. Made me grow so fucking much.

My girlfriend had also recently left me for my best friend. So, to say that things were not going great for me would be accurate.

I had been subsisting on Stoffers Macaroni and Beef microwave dinners for a while, and was feeling pretty down about eating out of a black pastic tray every night. So I had seen on the back of the box a recommendation to serve it on a plate for a 'better dining experience'. I decided to go all out. I clean and set my dining table (which had been my 'junk drawer' until this point), put on a table cloth, put the lights down low. I heated up my dinner, got out a plate, and even poured my Dr Pepper into a glass instead of drinking from a can.

I set everything out, sat down, put a napikin on my lap like I was in a resturant, and then just completely broke down. Like, sad, gross crying. At that moment, I felt more alone and so removed from everything in life that made me happy, and I couldn't see the light at the end of the tunnel.

The crying continued for probably ten or fifteen minutes, until, completely exhausted, I picked up the plate and scraped the food into the trash.

"Spazzmagnet","","","I met this girl at my work...

We immediately hit it off.  We would often meet after closing for drinks and sometimes just to talk.  It was always friendly and I never tried to make it anything more than that.  One night she confessed that she had wanted to have sex with me since the first day we met.  So I'm thinking ""Great! Why not? What could possibly go wrong?""  So we had sex...

After that night things got, weird...

First it was just at work, where she took every opportunity to follow me around the premises whenever she could.  Literally - like a puppy, and always talking about having sex again.  I started feeling a little bad for her at this point and told her that I wasn't really interested in a serious relationship.  We had had a great time and we should just leave it at that.

She then proceeded to ask everyone at work for my cellphone number, which some asshole eventually gave her.  Then the calls started.  Sometimes 20 or more calls a day!  Bear in mind that this was all after working hours.  At this point I just used my land line from home and never turned my cell on after closing time.

I eventually spoke with HR at work about her following me all over the place and calling non-stop, and as a result she was put on probation.  Two days later she just stopped coming to work.  I asked my manager what had happened and he only replied ""She doesn't work here anymore.""

""Great! problem solved, right?""

WRONG.

I found out from someone in the accounting department that she had been fired for breaking into the manager's office and stealing employee files.  In particular MY employee files.  ""Oh my god, thanks for telling me nobody!""  Now she knew where I lived.

That same night I came home to a wide-open front door.  I immediately got back into my car and left and called to police.  After I saw a few police cruisers pull into the parking lot I pulled in myself.  I told one of the officers that it was my place and I had called about a break-in.  He told me to wait in the cruiser and someone would be by to take a statement in a few minutes.  

""What the hell? Am I on trial here? I didn't break in my own place after all.""

A few minutes later I hear an ambulance... 

She had broken into my apartment, got into the tub and slit her wrists.  Luckily she did it wrong and the ambulance got there quickly enough that she survived.  After that it was impossible to shower in that place and I had to move.  Shortly afterward I quit that job.

I'm in Buffalo. In the greater region there are going to be about 200 of us. Winter seems like a far time off, but it's going to come sooner rather than later. My first step is to head over to the Robert Moses Niagara Power Plant. I can't be sure of having enough qualified people to run it, but I can preserve as much as possible by shutting down the majority of the pumps for later use. They also have plenty of machine tools on premises, so it's not a bad base.

Radio broadcasts will be the next step. Most stations have enough automated systems that as long as they have power they can broadcast a message. We need to take inventory of surviving skills. Doctors, mechanics, plumbers, electricians are going to be the most important keys to survival. Can we save the power plant is the big question. The region is still blue collar enough that it's an even shot.

Aside from a few scavenging parties, the rest of us have a great deal of study work to get done in the first month. How much of an issue is disposing of the dead? What sort of problems will we expect with gas lines? There's a bunch of work to get done.

I have no doubt the human race will survive. Hell, 70,000 years ago we were down to less then 5,000 breeding pairs and we did just fine. The issue is how long will it take for us to become a functioning society again?

You guys can meet up and stuff. I have work to do.

**Edit:** Huh. This answer became popular. At the bar last night, it also became a popular discussion. Just to address a few of the more popular responses, the first question was ""why the hell would you stay in Buffalo?"". Fair enough, but the answer is Niagara Falls. I don't disagree that solar power and generators could keep people moving for a while, but once they're gone *you can't make them again*! After forty years there's no ability to even make the tools to make the tools that could produce them. You're pushing your descendants back into the dark ages. If there's *any* chance (even a slim one. I can't promise my plan will work) of rebuilding civilization, it's going to require saving some of the bigger sustainable hydro plants and preserving as much infrastructure as possible. 

Yes, we'll still have all the knowledge of the previous civilization, but how much of that can we utilize if we're working every day in the fields just to grow enough to survive? How many more deaths will result because we can't run a refrigerator? How many more people will die at the hands of those who would rather just use a pointy stick to steal from their neighbors? 

So Buffalo winters might get cold, but we're talking about the winter of civilization and that's going to be much colder, and last much longer. If we can keep the lights on, that winter will be far shorter. Our soil is rich, our summers are perfect, and with our hydro plant we can be a beacon for others out there.

"Angeldown","","","Most people do not have one or two super close friends, who are always with them throughout their entire life, and always know what they're thinking, or what they need.

It's a very strange thing.  Most fictional characters have that best friend, whom they grew up with, who is like a ""brother"" but closer.  Or that perfect group of friends who always hang out and are always welcome at each other's homes, and are always there for each other, and have been for years.

Some people in real life do have that sort of friendship with someone, and that's amazing, and beautiful, but also rare.  Yet it appears in media so much, that I think a lot of people believe it's common.  They think that because they don't have super close friends that would follow them through hell, they're somehow different or messed up, but that's simply not true.

You will lose contact with most of your middle school friends.  You will lose contact with most of your high school friends.  You will probably even lose contact with most of your college friends.  That is normal.  Having even just one friend keep contact with you for a long time past that, and continue visiting with you, is a wonderful and precious thing.

Don't feel like you are somehow different or alone just because you don't have a super close-knit group of friends constantly reading your mind.  You are normal, it's okay, and believe it or not, most people probably feel the same way you do.

I've seen people kill themselves over this misconception, thinking that they were some sort of social outcast, when really they were normal, even almost popular.  But they felt that no one was close to them, they didn't have that bond with anyone, and therefore something was ""wrong with them"" or people ""didn't like them.""  It was very sad, how such a misconception could lead someone to such extremes.",1425354552,"","False",2,882,"AskReddit"

"csmoot","","","It's not bad(compared to how my grandparents or even how my mother and father had it). To be fair, it depends on how well-spoken or ""white"" you are along with how intimidating you are. I'm a big guy, so I'm off the charts as far as intimidation goes. Until I open my mouth. I like to think that I speak very well and very clearly, plus I tend to raise the pitch of my voice and smile more around white people.

I have a white name- on paper, you can't tell I'm black until you see my demographics information. It helps when it comes to job stuff. ""Black"" names tend to get looked over quickly.

It's easier for me to get into college, but with that being said, it's so much harder for me to get the respect from my peers for getting into college. Affirmative action is a thing, but I still worked my fucking *ass* off to get where I am.

I've been denied service in stores, denied entrance to friend's houses, been assaulted for my skin color by white men, I'm constantly considered inferior to my peers, every day is a gauntlet of proving my worth, that I'm not like the ""other"" black people.

In my experience, as long as you're out of the south(Carolinas to Nevada) or the midwest, overt racism is a very, very rare thing. The real problem is internalized racism. White people tend to have some very ~~fucked~~ messed up(better?) thought patterns when it comes to blacks and other minorities. It's hard to get mad about it though, because it's a subconscious thing. Most of them aren't like this on purpose; they grew up with these patters. It's hard to break. Like faith in a person who was raised in a church.

"SirAwesomely","","","I did this, basically.  Told my parents I was going for a hike in the woods for a few days, instead took a flight to europe and joined the French Foreign Legion. They figured I was dead for a few weeks but eventually they figured out what I had actually done.

It's been almost 2 years, and I'd still rather not see them ever again, but one of these days I'm gonna have to go back and see all my younger brothers who still live there.  

As for why...it's a long story...I didn't have the greatest childhood.  Basically I decided I had nothing better to do and life was boring as hell, so I might as well do something stupid or crazy.  So I just left and never looked back.  Whether or not I'm better off now than I was before is debatable, but at least I can say I've done something with my short little life.

**EDIT** Because everyone keeps thinking I just up and left for no reason, here's a bit of background info on my life.

Parents were/are religious fanatics and complete narcissists with their own special brand of Christianity.  They home schooled me my entire life until I was 17, at which point they kicked me out due to religious disagreements.  

I managed to survive for around half a year by myself.  Unfortunately I was kinda lacking in the life skills department.  Basically until I left at 17, I never had any friends, never left the house without my parents, and had no diploma or any other record of me doing school. 

I also found myself kinda...lost without someone yelling at me all the time telling me what to do.  So I figured I would join the military.  Just do as I'm told, not have to worry about bills or food or anything.  Perfect.  Unfortunately my national army told me to wait 2 years and I have no patience at all so the next logical step was obviously to join the FFL.

So I didn't last long by myself, ended up coming crawling back to them and staying with them until I turned 18.  But I wasn't idle.  I saved up money,  stole all my documents from the lockbox where they kept them, and bought a plane ticket.

One time though, probably around 3AM, while the rest of my family was asleep (I couldn't fall asleep that night, probably playing gameboy or something), I heard a knock at the door. At first I thought I must have imagined it, or I should just wait for my mom to get it. But the knocks repeated. I walked to the door in my standard sleepwear, a pair of boxers and an oversized tee, and through the window next to the door I saw a man in his 20s looking vaguely distressed. I can't remember exactly what he said any more, but something along the lines of he lived a few doors down and needed help. He showed me his driver's license in the window as a sign of faith, as if I might know his name. He wanted to come inside and use my phone. I told him I didn't think I should. He asked if my mom was home, but when I said she was asleep, he didn't ask me to get her. In the end, I just told him repeatedly no and tried to go back to sleep.

He left the rope and Tylenol there.

"throwawayokay90","","","You know that stereotype of the bitter, child hating, child free person? That was me...that's still me, no maternal feelings, frustrated by small children, grossed out by pregnancy, I was and am the text book stereotype. From the age of 18 on, when people my age started having kids I just didn't get it. I couldn't relate at all and I hated being in the presence of my friend's kids or listening to oxytocin-high ramblings about their kids. If I could have, I would have gotten my tubes tied.

Flash forward to when I was 25. I was dating the man of my dreams for a few years. He had said he wanted kids in theory later down the road, but his band was his number one passion in life which would come first. He was okay with my view because it wasn't an issue to him at the time. Then I find out I'm pregnant. I wasn't super sad or stressed about it. Because it wasn't even up for discussion. I was having an abortion and my boyfriend was ""supportive"" because like I said, band. So we get to the clinic and I am unemotional, he seems a tad bit bothered but not really. Then BAM they make us look at the sonogram. I looked at the 6 week old fetus and felt nothing, I could have Googled the damn picture and felt the same. But he, he lost it. All the way home he began to beg me to reconsider, to which I first resisted. Time went by and began to question the possibility of the whole ""It's different when they are your own!"" type of thing.

So I confided in two friends of mine. These two friends were in similar situations, stuck with an unwanted pregnancy (they were guys and the girl didn't want to abort). They both insisted that I would fall in love with the baby and they promise it's the most fulfilling thing in the world. So I decided to keep it. Through out the pregnancy my feelings never changed. I'd dream that the whole pregnancy was a dream and be happy and wake up with the baby bump and just cry. I was miserable the entire time. And miserable after the baby was born. This ""bonding and love"" never happened. The baby was a girl and I'd just stare at her, and feel nothing other than stress and resentment. I would take any opportunity to get away from her. The only time I would talk about her is to complain about how stressed I am. I would constantly ponder how my day could have went if I didn't have her, going back to grad school, going get noon drinks with friends, making funny videos and putting them online. Living and loving my life. But now, now I was a mom and I was very close to suicide. I'd even sit there just staring at a knife, holding it up to my wrist. As for the baby herself, she wasn't a particular bad baby, I guess. But I didn't enjoy interaction with her. I'd feed her and rock her to sleep but immediately run out the room to get away from her and try to reclaim as much of myself back as I could between cries.

Funny thing is, part of my boyfriend's way to manipulate me into keeping the baby was him getting a better job so we could live more comfortably. But the better job he got required more hours so he didn't even bother parenting much because he was working all the time even though I was working too. So I got stuck with all the responsibility and he'd pop up and play with her maybe 30 minutes a day. This made me begin to resent him too. He was the one wanting this baby I'd gladly work 50-60 hours a week if that didn't mean being stuck with an infant all day! I began having an online affair with a man I met online that felt the same way about kids that I did due to my bitter resentment towards my BF. I could be open with this man about how much I didn't love my daughter and how much I hated this lifestyle where I couldn't with anyone else. After about a year or so I got up and left. I moved out of state to go live with this man.

Now my daughter is 4. I live a nice CF lifestyle with my current s/o which we are about to get married, I have a better job and a cute little cat that I adore. Though there is no formal amount given I send money to my ex and the kid for child support. I have to keep reminding him that I am not interested in how she is doing, don't care to see any pictures or what she is up to. I made her for him and him alone. His parents are super great grandparents and his mom got the girl she never had (my boyfriend just has brothers) sure it's not your traditional family setting but from what I hear everyone is happy, except my ex doesn't really like being single and living with his parents, but he only works part time teaching guitar lessons in the evening so the kid has all the support she needs but oh well, shouldn't have forced an adamantly child free person into keeping a child she didn't want.

Society will spit in my face for ""abandoning my family"" and not loving my child, and I know it is selfish, but the selfishness I feel is exactly why I shouldn't be a mother. I wouldn't be a good one and I wouldn't be happy. Now I am. And from what I hear the rest of ""my family"" is too. I regret not having the abortion and bringing someone into this world that I didn't want or care for but I can't change the past and I did what was right for me and I don't regret that.

Hate me if you wish.

EDIT: Wow, this got a lot more comment then I was expecting, even gold! I mean, most them are negative, which is no surprise to me. For the 10% commending me for my honesty I thank you. I guess I'll try to answer some of these reoccurring questions. I was on Paragaurd + pull out method, because hormonal birth control makes my anxiety, depression and insomnia worse. I tried to find doctors to tie my tubes but none would do it. My ex and I had a fantastic relationship before the baby. And no, I am not unhappy. I did what was best for myself, so therefor I am not unhappy. The only thing I regret is not having the abortion. It is very hard for a parent or a person that wants to be a parent to understand my frame of thinking. The way I see it is plenty of kids grow up with single parents, her grandparents are young, (early 50's) she has all the love and support she needs and is pretty happy according to my ex.  I might be the most disgusting type of person in the world to you which is fine. But I accept who I am and no amount of insults is going to impact me. Keep trying though. 

EDIT 2:

Now I am getting questions about my childhood. It was fairly normal, no neglect or abuse. I was a wanted child, my parents did get divorced and my dad moved out of state but I still talk to him a few times a year and visit him maybe once every two years or so. I just don't like kids. No real reason, I just don't, at all. I don't get googley over babies, I find them ugly and annoying. Toddlers are the fucking worst.  Older kids (8+) can be tolerable because you can have a real conversation with them but that's it. I'm well aware that I could have made better choices but I can't help but roll my eyes far into the back of my head when people are suggesting that there is something wrong with me for SOLEY not wanting/liking kids and not enjoying motherhood. 

Will I contact her when I am older? Idk, I probably won't. If she wants to come meet me as an adult, I'll sit her down and explain to her that it's not her it's me. Some people just aren't meant to be parents and we were both better off without me there. 

My only question for all the haters that stop by to tell me I am a ""cunt"", ""they hate me"" ""I am going to hell"" or that I am ""worse than a rapist or a murder"" that one kind of made me laugh, is, do you hate me for leaving? Do you hate me for confiding in my current s/o online, the only person on this planet that I could openly talk to about how unhappy I was? Or is it just the ""omg what kind of person could not want to love a child"" thing? Just curious. But yeah, insult away. ",1424487318,"","1424549904",1,1805,"AskReddit"

* taken from [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2on5b1/how_iswas_world_war_ii_history_taught_in_germany/cmov83e)
* There have been various times throughout the years when Japanese textbook controversies have made the news, especially in Asia where feelings are still raw for many parts of the population about Japanese imperialism, partly because of racism, partly because of nationalism/political reasons, and partly because it is still a personal thing for some people and/or their immediate family, friends, etc.
* These revisionist textbook news controversies coupled with some hardliner historically revisionist politicians are some of the main reasons why Japan still has tensions with its neighbors over a war that happened almost a century ago.
* That being said, the majority of Japanese textbooks today and recent history teach the history of World War II in a fairly objective light. While one could argue whether or not the Japanese textbooks are 'apologetic' enough or 'graphic' enough to showcase the horrors of the war, there is no argument in the objective historical content.
Japanese mainstream textbooks that are approved by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) for national curriculum in the public Japanese education system covers all the fundamentals of WWII, including Japanese war crimes as well as Japanese aggression against various Asian countries, colonial holdings, and Allied nations.
* Revisionist textbooks are, as far as I could tell in my research, not used at all in the public sector (as they have not received MEXT approval) and is used in fewer than 20 schools in the private sector.
* But it has not always been this way in Japan.
* Back in the 1950s, Japan was just really beginning to come back from the destruction of the war. Meanwhile, the Cold War is blowing up. The Korean War had just happened and Western troops had fought toe to toe with the PRC and North Korea, seemingly the vanguard of a rising red tide that was threatening to swallow Asia.
Japan was feeling a lot of pressure from the US to crack down on any kind of 'red' sentiment. Japanese people themselves were slowly building up to their own 'red scare'. The government subsequently started a large scale campaign to suppress freedom of speech, freedom of press and control information and political dialogue.
I'll mainly focus on education. The Japanese government began a campaign of banning books, especially textbooks that seemed to support communist viewpoints, which included content that showed the Japanese working class as suffering or oppressed, lack of political freedom, encouraging questioning central authority, as well as any books that even remotely supported anything related to the Soviet Union or the PRC.
Consequently, this meant that any books that condemned the Japanese Empire for its actions during World War II were heavily suppressed.
* Scholars and academics were heavily targeted of course while newspapers and media outlets were co-opted into the information control scheme, for the sake of national order with the threat of violent Communist revolution and invasion feeling very real at the time.
* Funnily enough, part of this is due to the fact that the US was so adamant on building up an anti-Communist ally in Asia. The Japanese government had political free reign to crack down on labor movements, political expression, and academic learning/research, all in the name of fighting the Communist threat.
Directly after World War 2, the Japanese education system went under a number of reforms, many of which were focused on cultivating critical thinking through group discussion and teaching the method of self study (teaching students how to learn instead of rote memorization).
* But this changed very quickly as American strategic concerns overruled the progressive educational reforms of the late 1940s and we move into the 1950s.
* Education changed very quickly, with the banning of hundreds of books and almost seeming to return to war time education. Political hardliners rejoiced at the apparent return to fundamentalist education.
* Elementary schoolers curriculum required teachers to teach students to hold favorable views of the Emperor, as in pre-war years. Middle school teachers didn't need to teach World War II at all, simply that a war had occurred and post-war reconstruction, with a focus on the efforts of a patriotic, united citizenry that made rebuilding possible. Highschoolers only needed a 'recognition...of the importance of avoiding wars'.
* Now, these education standards would be unthinkable today and would cause massive controversy in modern times in Asia. So why was this even considered back in the 1950s?
Because of Cold War adversarial politics.
* With much of Asia seemingly falling to Communist forces, there was very little political value put in reconciliation. China was militant and aggressively pursuing a doctrine of violent Communist revolution in the region. Korea was war torn and half of it was controlled by an adversarial regime. South East Asia had swarms of Communist militias if not out right revolutions.
* Japanese politicians simply didn't care. More importance was put in inspiring patriotism and convincing the people of the Communist threat while extolling the superior virtues of the capitalist system. Education was more about preparing the citizens for ideological warfare than critical thinking.
* Speaking about the politicians that created this educational policy, many of these politicians were heavily conservative. Many of them had actually been purged by the American occupation but were reconciled and reintegrated because their staunch anti-Communist views made them desirable for American interests in the region.
* Unfortunately, these politicians are the origins of political historical revisionism and academic repression. For example, in 1957 under the authorization system that was first installed during the US occupation, 8 middle school textbooks were banned. The contents of the books were fairly graphic and very anti-war, detailing the many atrocities and war crimes Japan had committed in the war.
* They were labeled and politically dangerous and harboring Communist sentiments, and subsequently banned.
During this time period of heavy academic suppression, many gave up writing textbooks at all. Some historians even stopped publishing and working on research because they kept coming up against the government roadblock every time.
* But there were those who were vehemently opposed to these restrictions. Ienaga Saburo was the most well known figure for this. He brought multiple lawsuits against the Japanese government, claiming the censorship was a violation of the Constitution.
* It's also important to note that at the time (1950s), the general mood of the Japanese people was extremely anti-war, anti-establishment, and anti-military. Part of the almost ironic educational reforms of the 1950s (in some respects seemingly returning to pre-war and wartime education) was to try and reverse this public sentiment that was seen as politically conducive to Communist and revolutionary feelings.
* As we move on into the 1960s and 1970s, textbooks are no longer the focus of political action. Massive movements of anarchists, communists, socialists, anti-military, anti-conservative, anti-establishment, anti-American, etc spring up. Protests and riots become common place. Most of these political movements are focused around students, particularly high school and college students.
* Social issues force social reform and it was reflected in books and textbooks. Textbooks begin to broach the events of WWII and some even hint at the war crimes committed.
* By the 1980s, we actually see books that detail the atrocities during the war start to be sold in stores, or rather, were allowed to be published and sold in stores. A big step from the earlier decades. Textbooks began to use more direct language such as 'military aggression' and 'invasion'.
* Of course, conservative reactions were loud and intense. Cries of unpatriotic books destroying the social fabric and eroding national values, a war on the Japanese identity, demands for revisions to these books, etc. 
* Conservative groups published their own books and textbooks.
* The biggest turn around in education occurred in 1989, when Emperor Hirohito passed away. Now it was much easier and more acceptable to publish textbooks and books that were more openly critical of war time aggression and atrocities. In the early 1980s, there were finally some books that explained in more detail the suffering of civilians and victims of Japanese invasions but after the passing of the Showa Emperor, a flood gate opened.
* The Nanjing Massacre, suppression of Korean independence and identity, comfort women, slave labor, POW war crimes, etc. All these things had been excluded from textbooks for decades and for the first time, were reintroduced on a national scale. From middle school to college, students learned about the realities of what happened during World War II.
* Conservative reactions were just as loud and vehement as before. But they were in the minority. Progressive history teachers were in the majority and educated their students passionately. But this only intensified conservative reactions, which were becoming more and more isolated socially.
* They were beginning to see the liberalization of society as a war on 'Japanese-ness' and Japanese values. They saw this large change in society, not just education, as a threat to the very fabric of fundamental Japanese values and views. So reactionary education systems, schools and books were born.
* Today, historically revisionist views are decidedly in the minority, but magnified by media. Generally, education on the war in Japan is the same anywhere.
* **tl;dr:** give yourself five minutes and read this it explains a lot",1428012203,"","1428013802",1,1131,"AskReddit"

"DJ_Gregsta","","","XSurvey sites.

Dont expect to be a millionaire but using about an hour a day you can build up a steady stream of money in the form of vouchers or paypal payments for filling out surveys. They range from video games, films, music all the way through to what sort of bathroom cleaner you use. Some good sites I use:

www.globaltestmarket.com -- pays out about £30 a month for me at the moment

www.mysurvey.com -- pays out about £10 a monthish

www.swagbucks.com -- varies between £5 and £15 a month depending on what surveys are going.

www.valuedopinions.co.uk -- very hit or miss. sometimes can get £15 a month, othertimes it takes me 2 or 3 to build up.

There are loads more but its a good way to earn some money on the side and ANYONE can sign up to do it. I've been doing these for about 7 months now so I know they're legit.

*****

Edit - Okay so people are pretty interested in this but rightfully a bit sketchy. Okay, so heres the jist of it. You need to have a few sites on the go at once to rake it any kind of decent income and some surveys are super picky. They'll be basic questions you're asked when you sign up (age, sex etc.) and then the sites email you the best fit surveys to match your demographic. Like video games? Might be lucky enough to get one. Like cats? Might get a cat survey etc.

You wont qualify for everything and some surveys have a nasty habit of kicking you out midway through if too many people have done that survey. The payment amounts PER SURVEY range from 50p up to around £2 and take anywhere between 10 and 40 minutes. I once had a survey for £15 which took me 3 hours to fill out all about shopping habits and different brands etc.

If you're interested in advertising, market research, trends, products and future innovations I'd definately recommend it. There's some cool concepts for brands (for example I had one on red bull whre i had to rate different red bull products) and some ask you to input a whole paragraph of what you think about stuff. Its quite cool and interesting but definately not for everyone...

"iownakeytar","","","/u/rg44_at_the_office got a lot of good points in here, but I just wanted to reiterate a few things. You should definitely use the defrost function when thawing frozen food. Using regular HIGH power (the default setting) will result in part of your food still being frozen (usually the thickest inner portion) and parts being fully cooked (thinnest, outer portions.) With a frozen chicken breast, you end up with a half-thawed, stone cold in the middle piece of meat. By the time you finish cooking it, those thin outer bits will have the texture of rubber. Honestly, I rarely defrost in the microwave -- it's just as simple to run the items under cool water.

Secondly, just a microwave pro tip: if there's something you're trying to heat up that tends to still be cold in the middle while hot around the edges, try this. Reduce the power to medium (50%) and heat for twice as long. On this setting (like defrost) the microwave alternates between emitting waves and not.

_______________________________________

I was sitting on my toilet a couple weeks ago like any normal day, ready to take my daily shit. I had my shittin' slippers on, the heater was warming up the room, and I was ready for that shit.

I released my anal muscles, expecting the sweet release of fecal matter as I smiled in expectant bliss -- but the release never came. I frowned and pushed a little bit. Maybe it was a hard nugget? Did I not actually have to go? 
By this point I was shivering a little, as deprivation of shit bliss will do to a person.

My fear mounting, I pushed even harder, my face turning red with the strain of giving birth to my brown, smelly baby which I wanted so badly to fall into the still waters of the toilet.

It never fell. Instead, a tiny mockery of the pleasure for which I worked, a nugget not even the size of a mellon baller's head, plopped into the toilet, gently wetting my anus with the backsplash of water.

No more.

My fear evaporated, quickly turning to rage at the audacity of my rectum, the insolent fool who aimed to withhold my glory, my moment of truth.

My knuckles grasping the rim of the toilet, I let out an inhuman groan, forcing that piece of shit out of my body and into my porcelain throne, daring the little fucker to try something.

He did.

There was no sound. No courageous battle cry, no chance to protect myself as that shit tore my fucking anus from the inside, causing only crippling pain -- and blood.

I bellowed like the wounded animal I had become, pushing yet harder in this battle of will and mind. I would not let an insolent piece of digested food best me!

I could not.

The battle's end was abrupt. The pristine clearness of the water was no more, stained by the blood, sweat, tears, and shit of my labor. My anus bled freely, as if it were weeping in the joy of its freedom. I wept, as well. I wept for my rebellious child, who sought to defy me in its foolish youth. I wept for my anus, who battled to its last, taking 
this wound as a red badge of honor, a symbol of its undying faith to me.

And lastly, I cried for my cat, who had been watching the whole thing.

I have a girlfriend and she's really super hot. I also have a luxurious beard. I firmly believe that men should have long hair and beards, because it is a sign of honor. Chivalry is only practiced by a select few nowadays, and I am one of the upstanding few who still puts a woman before himself. Other men are only concerned with sex, but I put a woman's emotions before my own.

*Top Answer*    
To learn real magic, you either need to attend a school dedicated to the arcane arts or drink a magic potion that will unlock your abilities. Since most magical campuses are located on the moon, the potion would probably be a better choice for you. Purchase a bottle of something called ""Ipecac"" from your local drug store, then drink it approximately five minutes before you next confront Katey. If you truly are a real witch, you'll be able to cast an impressive spell at her, and she'll never bother you again.

"ImIntoIt","","","A few months ago I was walking to Chipotle when a man walking in the other direction stopped me on the sidewalk before I could cross the street (not to avoid him, but to get to my dank ass burrito with dank ass vinaigrette dressing).  He gave me an elevator pitch sob story, ""I've been applying for jobs today in Chapel Hill and spent all of my money to get here and back to Durham.""  There are a lot of homeless people in Chapel Hill so I was ready to brush him off until he asked if I could give him money for food.  Whenever someone asks me for money I don't give them money, I take them in the gas station and get them a snack and a few bottles of water, and every once in a while a lottery ticket.  I was graduating in a week and had nothing else to do on that beautiful sunny day so I said what the hell and asked if he wanted to come eat with me.

Watching that man in Chipotle made my day.  He said he had never had Mexican before and didn't know what to order so I started asking questions to get a feel for what he'd like. He didn't know what barbacoa or carne asada were and looked hesitant when they started putting guacamole on his burrito, but he trusted me.  We each got a burrito and sat down at a booth before I decided we should get some patron margaritas and make it a real fiesta.  When I got back he had retrieved some plastic ware and napkins and set the table.

Now I wasn't sure what I was going to talk about with this man... I grew up in a middle class suburban family and haven't experienced really any hardship in my life.  I ended up just asking him to tell me about himself and he talked about how he used to be a star football player in high school and college and thought he was going to get by in life on pure athleticism.  He started failing classes and then a knee injury derailed his football career so he turned to gangbanging and got tied up with drugs, alcohol, and women.  His life took a turn when his first son died.  He woke up but it was all too late and he hadn't been there for his family, didn't have a job and had amassed a pretty impressive criminal record.  That's when he turned to God and now he volunteers at a rescue mission or some kind of church for the homeless in Durham.

You could tell he was a genuinely changed man and sincere in everything he did.  He didn't like talking about himself and directed the rest of the questions at me.  He wanted to know what I was studying, what my sisters are studying, how my parents are doing, what my plans are after school.  His eyes lit up with enthusiasm every time I answered.  He was just happy to hear things were going so well for me, a complete stranger.  Now that I think about it he asked a lot of questions about my parents and how they felt...  He was probably envisioning what his son would have been up to at my age.  He also spoke a lot about God and how he's looking after us and will keep us happy and safe, and kept on repeating ""You're going to be successful, you know that? Because you're smart and you're a good person.""  As corny as it sounds that meant a lot because as business majors a lot of my peers and I were always just looking into the job pipeline and measuring success by how quickly you make it to manager, get hired out, or go to business school.  His measure of success was the positive impact you left on others, which I think is a much more meaningful metric.

Anyway, when it came time to part ways I noticed he had only finished half of his burrito.  I thought he must be hungry if he's scraping by so then I started to regret taking him to a Mexican restaurant because if he didn't grow up with it he may not like it.  That's when his situation really hit me.  He started wrapping up the rest of his burrito to go **and asked for my half eaten portion as well**.  The man wasn't one bit wasteful and was incredibly appreciative.  He was going to take home my soggy scraps and combine them with his to make his dinner for the night.  At that point I decided any money in my wallet would go much farther in his, so I reached in and counted $80.  When I slid it across the table he looked down in disbelief and refused to take it.  He just kept saying ""Nah man.... nah....""  I persisted and finally he gave in and as soon as that money was wrapped tightly in his hand I saw the emotion.  He started getting tears in his eyes and his lip started quivering while I tried my best to keep a straight face. Trying to act cool I just reached out my hand for a shake but he knocked it away and said ""That's not gonna do.""

That man had me stand up with him in the middle of Chipotle and gave me the biggest bear hug I've ever received while thanking me non stop.  On the way out the door just kept saying how happy is for me and my family that I'm graduating and he knows I'm going to be successful in life because integrity goes a long way.

I told one of my roommates when I got home because it was really heartwarming and he likes that kind of shit, but I never told anyone else.  I hope that guy's doing alright.  I think his name was Julian but unfortunately I can't remember.  I hope he got back to Durham safe, I hope he got a warm dinner, I hope he got a job, I hope he always finds help when he needs it, I hope he finds time to help those who need it, and I hope I run into him again. And I hope we're both leading a happy, successful lives when I do.

Oh yeah, and even with the $80 in his pocket he still took our leftover burritos to go.

"rugtoad","","","This is actually a good question that can illustrate something: When you are poor, the ""system"" is set up to keep you that way. 

For example, how much do you pay to cash your paycheck? 

If you aren't and have never been poor, you probably said ""Pay?"", because you don't. Your check probably goes via direct deposit right into your checking account.

But what if you have bad credit history such that you can't *get* a checking account? 

Well, now you have to go to a check-cashing service and pay money to get it. This means that, out of your already low check, you get to a few dollars down. If you are lucky, you can find a grocery store that will give you fee back in certificates to the store, but even then they might charge you a small fee on top of that.

How about this: How much is your car insurance? Did you know that if you bad credit it's higher? So, now that you are poor, you get to pay *more* money for your insurance.

And you'll find that the only landlord that will rent to you (at a place not in the absolute worst part of town) will ask you to double your deposit, since you've had financial trouble in the past.

It gets worse. Your bad credit combined with your shaky job history and ~~baron wasteland~~ ~~Baron von Wasteland~~ ~~barren waistland~~ bear in waste land of a savings means your options for transportation are severely limited. If you need a car, you will have to go to one of *those* lots. You ever drive a car into the ground? I mean, put 200k miles on it and drive it until it just doesn't want to go anymore? Then you take your jalopy into the local, reputable Honda dealer and they give you 20 bucks and a Snickers bar for it.

What do you think they do with it?

They certainly don't sell it at their lot, that's for damned sure. They aren't going to park your ridiculous hoopdie next to their brand new Accords and Civics, just being in the same vicinity of it drops their value.

No, they usually have a deal with (or ownership in) one of *those* lots. *Those* lots are in bad parts of town. The office looks like a tool shed. They offer financing at rates that would make a loan shark uneasy. Their cars usually have a lot of miles and are ""guaranteed"" only to make it off the lot. Some of them will even rig up the cars with tracking devices so their repo men can find you easier. 

That lot will sell this hunk-a-junk to the kind of person who, more than anyone else, needs it to start every day and get them to work.

When your car breaks down, what do you do? You probably take it to the shop to get it fixed. What if you had no money, and no credit cards?

And what if you were a week into a job in which you were as replaceable as a number 2 pencil? 

Well, hope you don't have any kids. At least then you might be able to call a friend or family member to help you out. If you have kids, now you have to find someone to help you drive them to your child care provider (which you can barely afford as it is anyhow) and take you to work, then pick you and your kids up. If you don't have kids, you can probably at least take a cab today.

And then you can fall into another trap: You can get a short-term loan! At 300% APR! 

People who have credit don't get these loans because they are predatory and shitty. They take advantage of people who have no other options. Ordinary people may know a little about them, but usually just say ""What kind of stupid person gets themselves into that?"" without realizing that it's not a stupid option so much as a last resort for many people in poverty.

When you are poor...you pay for *everything*...many things that other people don't have to pay for or just don't have to worry about. This is one of the fatal flaws of the bootstrap-mentality in which fixing poverty is simply a matter of will. 

When you're that far down, the deck is stacked entirely against you. The world is rigged to keep poor people poor.


**EDIT: So this kinda blew up after I went to bed last night...to address some of the common responses, please read first before being the 835th person to correct me on ""baron"" vs ""barren"":**

* First, *not* trying to say that people are in poverty through no fault of their own. I'm also not trying to say that there is a cabal of evil people actively rigging the system and stacking the deck. The deck is stacked, but it is a product of culture, not a conspiracy against the poor.
* On that note...my point is that *getting out of poverty is difficult*. When someone who doesn't really swim well jumps into the deep end, it's what we call a ""bad decision"". Still, the lifeguard doesn't stand on the edge of the pool and lecture them about prudent swim-related decisions. That doesn't help the situation. And even if you are a bystander and *cannot* actually help them, you'd have to be raised in a barn by wolves to not feel some sort of distress for them. You'd also have to be an idiot to look at them and say ""Look, it's easy: Just swim to the side of the pool and climb out! You are in control of your situation!"". True or not, it's insensitive and shows a complete lack of understanding to the situation at hand.
* A lot of people have a lot of ""great"" ideas for poor people...such as:
 1. *Why not cash their check at the issuing bank?* Great idea, if the town they live and work in has a branch, and that branch is not on the other side of town. This is looking at the problem in a vacuum, ignoring the several other problems around it that make the situation worse. The person has 10 minutes to cash their check before they have to drop off their kids and get to work. There is a check-cashing outlet that they can hit with a rock if they throw it hard enough. They *pay* for convenience you and I take for granted.
 1. *Take your car to a scrap yard! They will give you money for it.* Again, the problem does not exist in a vacuum. They have 3 hours to get a new car before their shift starts or the babysitter puts their children out on the lawn. 
 1. *Why not use a credit union?* Credit unions are great, but they check your history with bank accounts as well. They also have fewer branches and are not as easily accessible. The credit union I belong to has four branches, precisely none of them are in anything I'd call a ""low income"" area. 
 1. *This is why poor people shouldn't have kids.* You're an ass, and a dumb one at that. Kids aren't always planned, and even when they are...poverty isn't. 
 1. *What about welfare, food stamps, homelessness advocacy?* These programs operate on shoestring budgets and are the first things politicians gun for at the budget meeting. Further, they aren't designed to get you out of poverty. They address very few of the problems of living in poverty. These programs are designed to keep children from starving or freezing to death in the street, and that's about it. 
 1. *Nobody is born into poverty. These are issues with financial decision making.* First off, plenty of people are born into poverty. Educate yourself on the concept of Generational Poverty, but realize that doing so will probably make you depressed. It's an incredibly difficult problem and it's one that may never be truly solved...it's barely even addressed by Capitalism. Second, again...I know that no one gets dropped in the ocean by Baron von Wasteland. They make a string of decisions that lands them there. But they are drowning and you are the asshole who is standing on the pier telling them how they could have avoided it instead of recognizing that they are in a difficult situation and probably can't get out of it without help. You are the jerk who is telling them to just swim to shore if they don't want to drown. What you are saying isn't false...it's just incredibly out of touch.",1421186383,"","1421262766",14,5835,"AskReddit"
