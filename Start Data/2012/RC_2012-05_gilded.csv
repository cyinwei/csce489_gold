True,Lynfect,,,"Well, it is exactly what it sounds like. It's a shoebox, or at least once was, and whenever I masturbate I cum into it. I've had it for two or three years now I think, so it has a fair amount of cum. It smells atrocious, and I tried to burn it once. When I lit it on fire, it was too damp due to the cum that it simply sizzled and didn't manage to actually lite up. Turns out burning cum smells awful, so I had to spray it with a deodorant body spray just to get the old smell of burnt cum away. It also has some drenched papers stuck to it. That's pretty much it.

Because people were asking, [my greatest shame.](http://imgur.com/a/UD5Lo#ZLkrA)

EDIT 2: A lot of people are asking me, why? Well, I'm apparently a rather disturbed individual. But, it just kind of happened, bought new shoes and needed someplace to cum, used the box. It just escalated from there, kept using it each time, telling myself I would throw it out soon. Never did, two or three years later, I still have it. It was planned or anything, it just happened.

EDIT 3: Fuck, this really exploded. ~20,000+ views of my cum box. Did not expect this.

Edit 4: I often get PMed about updates or current status of the box, generally a few a week. So I might as well update this post, if anyone even gets linked here anymore. Current status, I have created life. Mold has begun to grow in the box and has taken over a fair amount. Smells a bit worse, mainly due to a damper apartment so it does not dry as fast, hence the reason why the mold has begun. [New picture.](http://imgur.com/Gs5ur) 

I will never be rid of my need for it. I hate and love the box, just as I hate and love myself.

True,trashitagain,,,"I'm eventually going to kill myself. I don't know when, but I'm pretty sure that's where life is taking me. I've never kissed a girl and I'm approaching 30, I have panic attacks in social situations, therapy seems to only make me feel worse, and I've decided that living so that others don't have to deal with my death isn't worth it anymore.

I'm basically just waiting out my parents so they don't have to attend my funeral.


**July 17 2012 Edit**: Because I'm still getting PMs asking how things turned out I'll just update it here. Nothing happened with any of the offers, I guess those were karma-whoring attempts, because I did PM them and they never responded. I did meet a girl who PMed me on a stop over from a road trip and get my first kiss, but that was it. I'm very glad I got to do that, and it was amazing enough that it convinced me to really make an effort. I've been trying very hard in the online dating arena, but I'm not getting anywhere. When I do get dates I don't know how to initiate anything physical, and its causing women to think I'm not interested, or I'm a wimp, or whatever. Anyway its not working. My overall plan hasn't really changed, really the only thing different is now is that I'm trying and failing. Hard.

Honestly I can't imagine living like this for as long as its going to take for my parents to pass, its just too fucking painful. I can't effectively articulate just how lonely I am.

**August 27 2012 Edit**: Wow, I'm still getting PMs about this post. I guess I should update again. I feel much, *much* better about myself and my prospects. I wont get into it more than that, and I'll leave everything else here because perhaps seeing just how low I got and that things worked out will help someone else feeling the same way. The only advice I can give is this: Try. You will fail, but you cannot succeed if you don't try.

**October 11 2012 Edit**: Things turned right back to shit and stayed there. I feel like a complete moron for thinking things could work out.

**October 16 2012 Edit**: Life has its ups and downs, and sometimes what seems like a down turns out to be an up. I've met someone wonderful, I thought I'd lost her, I felt bad for a while, but in the end it turned into something good. I can't wait to see where it goes. I will continue updating this post as I continue my journey, and I hope anyone who relates to the way I felt when this started can take comfort in knowing that if you make the effort, you can find what you've been missing. Its hard, but its worth it.

**December 31 2012 Edit**: Everything is great. Its as simple as that :)

**January 25 2013 Edit:** And then she dumped me. This is a pain that I couldn't have felt without the love that preceded it, so I'm trying to keep it in context, but its hard not to wallow in misery at this point. Back into the dating pool I guess.

**January 27 2013 Edit:** I really hate being lonely.

**MAX CHARACTER LIMIT FORCED ME TO CUT SOME POSTS HERE**

**June 2 2014 edit** Life goes on as it always does. I passed the date I picked years ago on which I was going to kill myself. I don't come back here as often as I used to purely because I really don't like the memories it brings me, but I guess if someone in my old shoes reads it now every bit of perspective can help, so its time for an update. All things pass. I'm still not recovered emotionally from what my ex pulled, but its more of a distant sadness than something that rules my life these days. Two years ago I'd never kissed a girl, I was sure I'd die a virgin, and I had panic attacks whenever I tried to socialize. Now I've lost track of how many times I've done the things I never thought I would. I actually had a co-worker I've known for about two years say to me that I'd had sex with more girls in the time he's known me than he has in his entire life. It blew my mind. I guess all that I have to say right now is don't let life pass you by because its comfortable, because you never know where life might take you if you just try.

**June 25 2014 edit** Dreams last night like I couldn't believe. I think I've figured out more of why I never have been able to get her out of my head... I'm still just too attracted to her. I knew from very early on that I couldn't trust that girl and she really did go out of her way to fuck up my life, but the thing that I've never quite been able to get past is the fact that when I think about her I get *sick* with desire. I get this weak feeling in my stomach at the though that I'll never hold her again, and couple that with the fact that in my life she's really the only one who I let in all the way and you've got a recipe for dreams that'll ruin your whole day more than a year after your last goodbye. Kind of a whiny update, I know, but I haven't had a day where I was so bothered by the whole thing in a long time, and updating here when I feel like this has been my ritual.

**August 2 2014 edit** I find myself thinking of this post less and less because the majority of the issues I've written about here just aren't controlling my life anymore. I wish I had some deep sage wisdom to write at the moment, but I just felt like I ought to update since I saw this mentioned elsewhere on reddit a few moments ago. My life is going better than I would've expected two years ago; I've now graduated with my CS degree and work full time, I've had a great deal of success in the dating realm over the last 8 months or so, and I'm in a better place emotionally. My advice for anyone who resembles the old me remains the same: Try, fail, and try again. Its a hell of a lot better than a bullet through the head.

**August 11 2014 edit**
So apparently I have cancer. I'm pretty sure that I'm going to be fine, but it really makes me think about how glad I am that I started really living life.

**August 13 2014 edit**
I should probably update again with a little more info. As far as the cancer goes, I have surgery planned, its early, I'm pretty sure I'm fine. I'll have scars, and that's all. If not, well, the prospect of something more severe has a curious impact on me. Telling my family fucking horrifies me. I know that you need to live life for yourself, but the others in my life are the ones who would feel my death, and I'm not so selfish a person that I can put them through that casually. I'm getting some massive doses of perspective lately.

**October 16 2014 edit**
I have a nasty new scar, and a lot of headaches, but I'm fine. Life goes on as it always does. I honestly don't think I can bring myself to read the rest of this post right now... the last few years have not been great for me, to say the least, and I cringe just thinking about it sometimes. All I can think to say now is that I am so glad that I never pulled that trigger.

Also, apparently there is a max character limit now. I've cut some of the post and saved the whole thing locally... this leaves me with a problem. Should I upload all of this somewhere else? Not sure what's best. If anyone has an idea feel free to pm me.

**January 29 2015 edit**
I've been getting a wave of PMs today and it made me feel like I'm overdue for an update. These days I'm a reasonably successful software engineer, I live with my girlfriend in a *very* nice place and have more friends than I did at any other point in my life. When I go to work people are happy to see me, and things are drastically better. 

One thing I've come to learn about depression, at least my depression, is that the shitty little voice in the back of my head can come back at any time, for any reason. The other day I was updating my linked in and saw the face of my cheating ex as a suggested contact. I've successfully avoided seeing a picture of her for more than a year now. She was as beautiful as ever, and I wanted so badly for an instant to tell her that again. I also unfortunately saw that her last name had changed, so I guess she got married. I hate admitting to myself that I still miss her, and I hate myself for giving someone who was so horrible to me that power. But you know what? I'm fine. I was sad for a day, and then I told my girlfriend the secrets I'd kept (she had no idea about what I talk about in this post), she hugged me and said she loved me, and I moved on. Life will never be perfect, but its sure as fuck better than its ever been before.

Please continue to PM me if you relate to my original post or would like someone to talk to, my advice may be simple but I've seen it work at least once. 

**February 2 2015 Edit** [trashitagain.com](http://www.trashitagain.com)  now has the entire post in raw text.

**April 8 2015 Edit** I should probably get on updating the website, but its hard to find time these days. I honestly don't know what to say about all of this anymore. I'm not what I would consider emotionally healthy, I still have dreams every once in a while about my ex, and I still can't listen to the songs that remind me of her, but I have a good job and good life and things are better than I thought they would ever be when I first made this post. My girlfriend(a phrase I thought I'd never be able to use) drops hints constantly about getting married. I'm deflecting her for now because the idea terrifies me a little bit, but its a problem I'm happy to have. I suppose the reason I still keep this up is to try and help anyone who is in the same situation I was, so I'll just re-iterate that I'm here to talk to if you find yourself where I found myself all those years ago.

True,Piotr555,,,"So I'm about 16, right, and I always go down to this bank to take money out. I only had a savings account so I didn't have an ATM card at the time. There was always this cute chick working there. She'd always smile and greet me, and I'd always try to go to her line. As she was a bank teller, I only saw her sitting down. This is important later. One day, I just work up all the confidence I can and I ask her out as I'm taking out some money. 

She said yes! So we set up a time around the weekend for me to come over and pick her up. She gives me her number, I get her address, and I skip home (not literally, but you know) as happy as can be. So it's the weekend, and I drive up to her house in my little beat up honda.

I knock on her door and her dad answers. A split second of ""oh shit"" comes over me, but he just gives me this heartwarming smile and invites me into this house. I instantly feel at ease and we go sit down in the living room. Her dad is all happy like ""i'm so glad you're taking my daughter out"" and ""i really really appreciate it"" and all this crazyness. So i'm starting to think to myself ""uh oh what have i gotten myself into"" 

So her dad reaches into his pocket and pulls out a set of car keys. He says ""I want you to take my car."" I said ""No thats okay I have my car"" 

He's all like ""no no no"" practically forcing the keys into my hand. Still keeping his big smile on his face. No sooner does he give me the keys than do I hear from up the stairs ""BZZZZZZZZZZ"" 


No shit, she's in a wheelchair! A split second of shallow human being comes over me, but I think about it and say to myself "" I can do this! She's awesome and has a great personality, fuck it!"" 

We go outside, and I realize why her dad wanted me to take his truck. It was all rigged up with the belts and harnesses and the door that came all the way out for the wheelchair. So I took his truck, and we head to the movies. Best part? The handicap spot!

So we're in the theater, and no sooner does the movie start, than she starts putting her hands on my junk! She's a freak! That's totally cool with me! We start making out almost during the whole movie.

My parents are out of town that weekend, so I ask her if she wants to come back to my place. She says Yes so we get back in her dads truck and we're on the way to my house. 

We arrive at my house, I have stairs, so I have to carry her inside. Thankfully my room is on the first floor. So i get her inside, throw her on the bed, and we start going at it. 

I've got her in missionarry position, it's pitch black in my house and i'm pounding the fuck out of her, when all of a sudden i  hear a ""POP""

Sure as shit, her leg fucking comes off. She's got a fake fucking leg! How did I miss that shit? 

""KEEP GOING"" she screams as I pull her leg and throw that shit across the room.

So I'm fucking her and fucking her and sure as shit, I hear another POP!

So I pull her leg just like I'm pulling yours. ",0,1335851774,,0,True,1,c4inewa,t3_t0ynr,t1_c4inewa,t3_t0ynr,,1428831831,4251,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,4251
True,cunt_rocket,,,"I used to be a Police/Fire/911 Dispatcher, but had to quit because it nearly made me suicidal. I actually had thoughts, but had to drive 40 miles to go to a center/hospital where no one knew me for help. I have nightmares about a few calls I took where the caller killed themselves, shot someone else, or passed away on the phone with me.  To this day, a few years after resigning, I still can't listen to a phone ring, or sirens go off without having a mild panic attack.  I am fairly sure it's a form of PTSD, with flashbacks, nightmares, panic attacks, and an inability to function sometimes, but I'm embarrassed and scared to tell my fiance, or go to a doctor for it.  I know there are soldiers out there with real PTSD that deserve help far more than me...  I am very good at hiding it though.  I also sometimes wait until my fiance goes to sleep, and I will then go sit and pretty much cry for several hours. It's hell.

TL:DR - I exhibit a lot of the symptoms of PTSD, but I'm scared to get help for it because I don't think I deserve to be diagnosed with something like this, as in my mind, I was never in any real danger.

**EDIT: 1 year later:** For those of you who still message me about this...  No, I did not seek help for my problem.  Soon after I made this post, my fiancé left me, citing the fact that I ""made her miserable"".  That was a huge blow, because it meant that I was effectively homeless, since I wasn't able to afford rent in our shared home.  I was then forced to quit my job, move several thousand miles away, and live in a cot in my grandmother's house.  I found that I was massively depressed, homeless, jobless, overweight, and *severely* suicidal.  My ex-girfriend refused to help, and I was utterly, sincerely, totally, alone.  But, I fought...  I couldn't afford treatment, so I went ahead and began exercising my body, and exorcising my demons.  I fought, long and hard, to eat right, to not have the urge to end my own life, and to be someone.  I ended up losing nearly 120 pounds, getting into the best shape of my life, and kicking my depression in the ass.  Today, one year later, I'm normal weight, I have a gorgeous new girlfriend, and I recognize that I needed help.  So, future reader, let this be a lesson to you... the things you try to hide, the things that can and will destroy you if they get out, will destroy you eventually.  Face your demons, fight, fight, fight.

**EDIT 2: 9/19/13!**  Yes, I still check this account!  Thank you to whomever gifted me reddit gold!  I appreciate it sincerely.  Second, and most important of all, the reason I check this account is because it is still generating amazing comments to my inbox.  I really do love all of them, and I'm happy to have helped.  I'm fighting to get to a better place in my career, and I'm living a very healthy and happy life now.  I'm working harder and more focused than I've ever been, and I'm currently down 130 pounds.  I ran my first 5k a few months back, and my nightmares and panic attacks have gone away totally.  Again, never take the easy way out, folks, because there just isn't one.  I'll leave you with my favorite quote:

""...Do not by any means destroy yourself, for if you live you may yet have good fortune. But, all the dead are dead alike."" -CS Lewis

Thank you all.


**EDIT 3: 6/12/14**

We're engaged!

For those of you asking how I am, or giving me encouragement via the PMs, a sincere ""thank you"".  There are days where I log into this account, see an orangered and use the wishes inside as my secret fuel to get through a tough day.  I'm down 150 pounds total now, and I jog, bike, hike, and find whatever activity I can to keep myself occupied. I've got a wonderful job in a field that I love, doing all kinds of interesting research, and I'm now the guy in the office that brings in the donuts on Fridays.  It's a funny turn-aournd.  Sometimes, my old life seems like it was a bizarre and hazy bad dream (to use the washed-up phrase), but I can't ever forget that it was real, because there are so many lessons that my time in that dark place taught me, and so many lessons I feel like I want to share with others.

Finally, there are some things that I never shared with you folks about my story, such as when I mentioned initially that I was living with my grandmother... as tough as that was, 2 months after I moved in, she was diagnosed with terminal cancer, and I helped with her care until the very end. I know I had my problems, but when a dying person that loves you with all of their heart tells you that no matter what, they're proud of you, you can't help but smile and carry on through anything. She passed away a year ago today, hence this post; it's kind of a thank you to her too.  

My fiancee tells me that I should write a book about this whole thing, so that's what I've started to do.  Might as well put that English degree to use, right?  I hope someday you'll all get the chance to read it, because so many of you helped to inspire it.  Again, thank you all, from the bottom of this heart of mine.

True,TheHuntedOrphan,,,"A good friend of mine had and still has this. It hit him suddenly when we were on vacation and slowly got worse until he had to drop out of high school his senior year. Shit was rough. For the first few years he didn't do anything (didn't leave his room). Eventually we got him to come outside with us, drive places (he had to sit in the back and just play his game boy as we drove so he didn't look outside), and even go to restaurants. We built up going to the mall a few times but that didn't last long.

The best thing was to put him in situations where he could be social (he was a very social guy before) with people he knew. So we would do the game boy thing and take him to small gatherings at different places. About three years after we got him to move in with us when we were in college (about 30 minutes from where he was living before). This was great for him. 

Five years + after the fact he is living on his own, with a girlfriend, getting back in shape and working a good job. 

Don't worry man. It takes a lot longer than a year and a half to get things together. It is also really hard for people to understand or even believe the feelings you are describing. If I wasn't there when it all started and hadn't seen the look of fear in my friends flushed face I wouldn't have really understood either. Just do what you gotta do. Push yourself a little bit everyday but not too hard. 

Also, don't stop bettering yourself. I'm not sure where you are in life but even if it means staying in your room, do things so that when you get better (which you will) you can be ready to start again. Get your GED if you didn't graduate high school. Read lots. Try to stay in shape, as in don't eat and eat and eat. Try to work on something, yard work, online education, anything that makes you feel productive. And remember to push yourself to go out into the world in little ways.

True,mrbill,,,"First, I don't need an intervention - I just need to vent.

Almost three years ago (June 16th), my wife suddenly passed away at home, at the age of 34.  I was the one who found her, and she'd been gone for at least an hour if not more when I did.  

We'd been together for eleven years.  It wasn't perfect - what marriage is? - but things had been worse, and were in the process of finally getting better.  Being best friends can help you get through the worst of times.  I felt guilty that one of my thoughts was ""at least now we won't fight over stupid crap that doesn't really matter"".

For at least six months, I was on autopilot.  I went to work, did what I had to do to get paid, and just. didn't. care.  Ate a lot of fast food because I didn't want to expend the energy to go to the grocery store.  I bought my cats food from Amazon because they'd deliver it to my front door.  

Depression is a horrible thing; only now can I look back and realize just how bad it was.
  
It's not every day, but there are times when I think about joining my wife, but then that would just mean an end result of other people having to deal with the aftermath of *my* problems.

There are days when I get home from work and unlock the front door and walk into a quiet house, where I would give up everything I own to have someone there to give me a hug and sincerely ask how my day went and honestly care about my answer.

Something so simple as human touch, compassion, and companionship is worth more than anything else in the world.  If you've got it, if you have someone that loves you - don't give that up.  Don't waste it.  Don't be petty or throw it away because of other little things that don't really matter in the grand scheme of life.

Some of us wonder if we'll ever get to experience it again.

True,shimpossible,,,"Would people STOP telling sexual assault survivors to just ""tell someone"" or ""report it to the police""? 

There are many, many reasons why someone might decide not to report it - others might not believe her (as did actually happen in this case), if it happened years ago there is no way for the police to scientifically ""prove"" that it happened, the social stigma and victim-blaming that is still attached to victims of sexual assault (what were you wearing/why were you walking in a dangerous part of town/etc.).

Basically, it is NOT the survivor's ""duty"" to report it to the police because ""he might be doing it to somebody else."" Yes, if the rapist were arrested and convicted, it would be a good thing. But to put the responsibility on the survivor is unhelpful and unfair.

True,drew_,T1,T1 2004 Omnipod,"Really late to the party, but I wanted to tell you that both me, my father and a friend have had the same problem with the mobile-meter. It seems to be related to me not having washed my hands good enough before measuring. 

My father returned a total of three testers to the manufacturer, and was in contact with some pr/tech woman that was really interested in learning about our problems.

I was picking up my prescriptins at the pharmacy last week, and I got a new model of the Accu-Chek Mobile. There are a few changes on the new model 

* The multiclix sticker is now a FastClix (you don't need to ""load and trigger"" it, it's instant poke) Same needles as MultiClix

* There is a USB connection for importing / reading statistics and test on the computer

* It's a little thinner, more streamlined

* Better display


I have just used it for 2-3 days, so I'm not sure if the problem with accuracy is fixed, but seeing they released this so close up to the release of the original meter, something must have changed. My father tested with his old and new meter measuring 5(old) and 6.7(new) mmol

My answer: First off, I want to apologize for not getting these responses to you sooner.  I want you all to know that I listen when redditors sound off on CISPA and other issues involving the Internet, which is why I’m on here. Understanding the [intense feelings](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sv6vx/ama_request_rep_darrell_issa_get_your_ass_back_in/) that folks here in the reddit Community have, I appreciate the chance to respond and share my perspective.

CISPA was not a secret.  And when you compare its development to the normal legislative process, it can’t accurately be described as “rushed though.”  But it all started by establishing clear policy goals and broad legislative principles.  On June 24, 2011, the Speaker of the House John Boehner and House Majority Leader Cantor [created](http://www.speaker.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=248724) a Cybersecurity Task Force to make recommendations and coordinate among the nine House committees with significant jurisdiction on cybersecurity issues. In particular they focused on four areas:

1.	Critical Infrastructure and Incentives
2.	Information Sharing and Public-Private Partnerships
3.	Updating Existing Cybersecurity Laws
4.	Legal Authorities

This taskforce, made up of nine members of Congress and their staffs, met with numerous experts, associations, industry groups, privacy groups and federal agencies, in addition to their counterparts in the Senate and the White House.  On October 5, 2011 the House Cybersecurity Task Force released its [recommendations](http://thornberry.house.gov/UploadedFiles/CSTF_Final_Recommendations.pdf) to the public.  The recommendations reinforced concerns that Internet-based companies and critical infrastructure networks are either being hacked or are extremely vulnerable to hacking by entities both domestic and abroad.  They also advocated for solutions that did not encumber the private sector with new regulations.

These are the principles that guided CISPA and other cybersecurity bills drafted in the House.  CISPA was then publicly introduced on [November 30, 2011](http://intelligence.house.gov/press-release/rogers-ruppersberger-introduce-cybersecurity-bill-protect-american-businesses-). While it was originally marked up on [December 1, 2011](http://intelligence.house.gov/full-committee-business-meeting-december-1-2011), it was not reported from the Intelligence Committee until April 17th, and was [amended](http://intelligence.house.gov/press-release/chairman-rogers-and-ranking-member-ruppersberger-announce-important-amendments-cyber) in an attempt to address some of the concerns privacy groups and you have raised.  

But from the start, CISPA has been a voluntary solution that finally allows cooperation among vulnerable hacking targets no one should want compromised- from your personal Facebook data to your family’s medical history - whether by criminals or government bureaucrats.  

I thought long and hard before deciding that the benefits of CISPA outweigh the potential costs.  And since I’ve been listening to the privacy concerns still being raised on here and across the Internet.  They were not fully addressed in the legislation and need to be dealt with before anything becomes law.  You read it here first: I will assist my colleagues in the Senate to improve CISPA now, and in the likely event of bill changes, I will work in the House to do the same before a final vote.

Though the [White House](http://keepthewebopen.com/acta) and [Congress](http://keepthewebopen.com/sopa) rush policymaking far too often, I don’t think it’s fair or accurate to say that happened here.  Rather, I think we all should be asking why wasn’t the broader Internet community aware of or engaged with CISPA even before the legislative process began?

We faced the same problem with SOPA and PIPA, and continue to face it with ACTA and TPP.  And it’s what we’re working to solve with Madison and [KeepTheWebOPEN.com](http://www.keepthewebopen.com/).  I believe all Americans - individuals, advocacy groups, everyone - should be able to help develop and improve their laws and, ultimately, their government.  That’s why I posted my [draft cybersecurity](http://keepthewebopen.com/fisma) legislation before it was even introduced, marked up or voted on. If CISPA had been my bill, I would’ve done the same thing.  At the very least, it’s very likely that we would’ve been able to catch and solve the issues from the get-go, and many of the late-breaking improvements would’ve been generated by users months ago.  We did a good beta test of this workflow with the [OPEN Act](http://keepthewebopen.com/open) - powered by equally beta technology - and proved it works.  So I’m pushing my colleagues hard to do what works, with Madison or other tools.  But while CISPA didn’t happen this way, there was a public vetting and consultation process behind it and other cybersecurity bills, and those all started by publicly establishing broad goals.  

After seeing how close we came to having SOPA and PIPA rammed through - not to mention the serious work it took to stop both of those bad bills - I think we are all on heightened alert to legislation that may appear to threaten Internet and personal freedom.  Healthy, democratic skepticism is central to America and the Internet.  And it’s clear our government needs to do a better job of listening to the Internet community.  But it is just as clear that digital citizens needs to be more proactive and engaged during the entire legislative life cycle.  Tools from reddit to Madison, YouTube to Thomas.gov have already made it possible.  I challenge you to use them, and to push your government to use them too.  An ounce of open gov prevention is worth far more than a pound of attempted last-minute cures.  It will without question deliver better bills and better government.

True,M3nt0R,,,"Fuck, I'll try.

You take your pill.  Sometimes it'll dissolve quickly in your mouth, other times you have to chew it up or swallow it whole, like a flintstones vitamin.  Ecstasy pills are rarely pure MDMA so often times the composition alters the behavior and properties of the pill.

Anyway, you take it and wait.  Usually you're with friends, I've never done it at a club but I have done it in basements with music and friends.  You know when it starts hitting you.

You feel this warmth start emanating from within.  Almost like a mild little fever, but it's a good warmth.  Like being by the fireplace on a cold and snowy winter night.

This is the foundation for your whole experience.  This warmth will be manipulated in every direction.  You may begin sweating, or getting these hiccups as the ecstasy fully dissolves and is absorbed in your stomache.  It may release batches of hiccups that after you hiccup, you feel increasingly euphoric.  It may not, it depends on the person and the pill.

Anyway, that warmth converts to energy.  You become much more talkative.  You may be tired of sitting down and you may start pacing.  I used to move around a lot.  you get hotter and start sweating.  I used to take off all of my clothes except my underwear and slide along the walls.  I was comfortable with my friends and they didn't mind.  It was entirely non-sexual and it wouldnt' be a good role if M3nt0R didn't take off his clothes at some point.

That's actually how we gauged the rolls, but that's another story.  If I didn't remove my clothes throughout the night, the mood would be less party and more 'bumming out' and you could tell the pill sucked.

Anyway, the energy starts activating.  That heat translates to physical and mental energy. You are able to talk talk talk and FEEL.  You **FEEL** so much better.

Everything you touch, the surfaces of any object are magnified entirely.  A smooth wall isn't just smooth, it's...almost like 'love' through touch.  A fuzzy soft surface feels like you're being hugged by love.  By a Jesus-type of person with nothing but love and compassion, carressing you.

Every surface and every texture has something to offer, and you spend time just rubbing things on your face and skin because the feeling is so surreal.  

It's not just physical feelings, either.  You become entirely empathetic and compassionate.  If your'e in public and see an old former high school classmate that you talked to maybe 5 times in your life, you *will* approach him feeling so empathetic.  You'll try to catch up, and genuinely take an interest in this person and their life.

You appreciate humanity.  You look at everything through the eyes of an innocent loving child.  You mean no harm, and you get upset when people are angry or yelling.  When you see someone pissed off, it sinks your little heart.  When you see people smile, it makes you look and smile.

You look like a creep, though, because you're staring with huge pupils and this huge shit-eating-grin with clenching jaws and sweat dripping all over your body, but you don't care.  You just want to love and be loved.

You probably tell all of your friends at least once, ""Man, if everyone in the UN took ecstasy one day, we'd have world peace.""  Everyone I know who did ecstasy has thought that at some point.  And it's clear why.  You cannot be mad at people.  You can have a bad roll, and be sad or upset.

The comedown sucks, though.  All of the feel-good warmth that's blinding and overtakes you begins to back off.  You feel yourself landing back to normality, and the realization of that is killer.  You feel so sad that the wonderful time will be over, back to 'normal' life.  Back to a lack of empathy, back to judgements, back to the cold-real world.  Realizing that not everything is love and joy anymore.

Even though before it wasn't either, it was in *your* mind, which makes it as real to you as 'the real world' anyway. 

EDIT: Music.  You cannot stp dancing to it.  You will dance ways you never thought possible.  You will move faster than you ever though possible.  You will slide and turn and squirm and twirl and spin and do the robot and everything in between.  The music will carry you, you won't even think about dancing, you are just translating the audio sound into a physical expression.",0,1336774197,,0,False,1,c4mz66z,t3_tgs72,t1_c4mz66z,t1_c4mvkjm,,1428906587,3,False,videos,t5_2qh1e,3

True,Legitimate_Scientist,,,"Don't get me wrong, I appreciate that violence exists, and I find it abhorrent, but wide prevalence of guns does nothing to solve this, it merely escalates situations. 

If you take an incident like a rape, or a home intruder, though these are horrible situations no-one should have to be in, without guns almost everyone makes it out alive. When both sides have guns, however, someone will probably die, and whether this is the criminal or the civilian this is never right.

You say that in a society without guns the strong can overpower the weak. Yes, this is the case. It is neither right nor good, but with a half-decent police force it's something that can be managed. It is also preferable to the alternative.

In a society with guns, the people with guns overpower the people without guns, and the balance of power is much more in gun owners' favour than it ever was with strong people. Moreover, due to the immense power that a gun gives, there is a lot less the police can do in any given situation.

All in all, without guns, there would be no high-school shooting, no cop killing, and no citizens shooting people in 'self-defence' a la Trayvon Martin.

Of course, I realise that the massive gun circulation means that even removing them from civilian hands would be nigh impossible, so it's kind of a moot point. Still it's interesting to try and understand why the USA has proportionally the highest prison population in the world, and the second-highest homicide rate of any developed country (second to Russia, and guns are one of their many problems).",0,1338288846,,0,False,1,c4tlr1f,t3_u8l5f,t1_c4tlr1f,t1_c4tgqzi,,1429021847,1,False,worldnews,t5_2qh13,1
True,subtextual,130lbs,,"What I would guess has happened to your compassion is that your [locus of control](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_of_control) has shifted from external to internal (FTR I'm a psychologist, so I apologize if this sounds ""therapy-ish""!). 

Many overweight people have an external locus of control, meaning that they believe, on a fundamental level, that they have little power to change their weight (e.g., it's due to environment, genetics, etc). In fact, in any area of your life where you have not made changes, you probably have an external locus of control that leaves you feeling defeated when you think about even trying to do anything in that area.  

When you begin to make changes in your life in any area where you have been stuck, your locus of control shifts to internal. In other words, you start thinking that **you** (not your environment, not your parents, not your genetics, etc) are in complete control of your weight. For a lot of people, that shift from external to internal can be pretty severe -- where you once felt like your own weight was maybe 10% in your own hands, you know start thinking it's 100% in your own hands, and you start to believe that about others' weight, too. In fact, a lot of people who experience this shift actually become some of the most vocal proponents of the ""fat people are entirely responsible for their own weight and just need to develop some willpower"" movement -- they ""lose their compassion"" for their former selves and for other overweight people. For example, sometimes the person yelling the loudest that overweight people are 'lazy' and 'disgusting' and 'lack willpower' is someone who was once obese themselves. There have been some *very* recent threads on loseit where you can see a ton of examples of that mindset. 

Of course, it's psychologically better for you to have an internal locus of control than an external one when you need to make changes. An internal locus of control helps you take action, and helps you avoid depression or feelings of helplessness. The optimism that comes with an internal locus of control also helps you better weather small bumps in the road, rather than giving up after the first setback. 

**But** it's important to remember that an external locus of control is probably better correlated with reality. For example, studies show that people who are less optimistic are actually better at evaluating their performance than people who have the unrealistic optimism that comes with psychological health! More specific to this topic is that statistics show that sustained (&gt; 2 years) weight loss is almost impossible and that 90% or so of people will fail at it for primarily environmental reasons. This is because we have created an obseigenic society that is incredibly detrimental to weight loss or weight maintenance, and the projection is that soon 70% of people will be overweight (in the US at least). Our bodies' desires for high-calorie food and limited energy expenditure is not a good match for an environment that constantly, relentlessly promotes a sedentary lifestyle that involves easy access to as much high-calorie food as we will pay for. 

So there is a good reason why a lot of people who are overweight have that external locus of control. More importantly, some external locus of control can be very helpful: When you know *how* your environment is working against you to thwart weight loss and weight maintenance, you can make changes in your *environment*, rather than trying to ""power through"" with sheer willpower. Certainly relying on willpower alone can be sustained for short- to medium-length bursts, but it sets the person up for failure when their willpower becomes exhausted, or when the person tries to return to a more ""normal"" lifestyle without having changed anything about the constant obseigenic environmental cues that they are exposed to (this is what makes maintaining weight loss so hard). Relying on that internal willpower *also* uses up a lot of cognitive resources (e.g., it's hard to even think about anything else sometimes), and it brings on a whole host of psychological issues such as: 

* Constant checking to make sure the willpower is still in place (sometimes even becoming obsessive in thinking or behavior about eating), 
* Guilt whenever willpower diminishes (or even when the person just doesn't feel like they are denying themselves *enough*), 
* Self-loathing (current and past self, sometimes even extending to loathing others who are not using their willpower for the same purpose), and 
* A deep anxiety that the changes being made will be unsustainable long-term. (Do any of those sound familiar?)

The best of all possible worlds would be to find a better balance between external and internal locus of control. E.g., from an internal perspective, you have to acknowledge that you have to do a lot of things that involve a lot of willpower to lose weight -- which also involves acknowledging the sacrifices that comes with, setting limits as to how much you actually can sacrifice (e.g., not your mental health!), and also being able to have compassion for people who can't make those sacrifices right now because they might need their willpower for something else in their lives. From an external perspective, you have to make changes in your environment -- including things like: 

* Finding external support (this forum, a therapist to talk these issues over with, people who will reinforce your willpower and the sacrifices you are making),
* Limiting your exposure to 'triggers' for eating in your environment (whether that's only going to the grocery store when full, or limiting going to restaurants, or avoiding social activities that center around eating, or skipping through the ads on TV, or not driving along a route that takes you by fast food restaurants on your way home, etc),
* Setting up positive reinforcement systems in your environment that reward you for behaviors that are healthy-weight-focused, making weight-gain-focused behaviors rather inconvenient (e.g., you can have ice cream, but only if you walk to the store to get it and put $20 into a fund to promote safe recreation spaces in your neighborhood for example),
* Putting plans in place for when your willpower fails or you are just distracted (e.g., no cookies in the house if you crave them), 
* Putting plans in place for how to get back on track if you slip, etc, etc. (Someone posted a recent *Atlantic* article about behavior modification for weight loss: http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/06/the-perfected-self/8970/)  

Modifying your environment like that will be crucial once you reach the maintenance stage, but it will also help you redevelop your compassion for anyone who struggles in our current obseigenic environment. If we all do it, slowly it should help us all begin to change society in a way that promotes weight loss and weight maintenance, rather than just trying to shame people for their failure to overcome the incredibly real, incredibly powerful evolutionary and environmental pressures towards weight gain.
