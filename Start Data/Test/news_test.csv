Something almost IDENTICAL to this incident happened to me right before the end of last year. It's been more of a hardship than I can express through words. 

In my case, it was $17,000. There were illegal items found during their search as well, but aren't charging me with anything, as that would make this a criminal matter, and place the burden of proof on themselves. They decided it would be a better option to pretend to be 'cutting some slack' for me, and keep things in civil court. Apparently they had admitted to my lawyer that I was unlawfully searched, so the charges  would be dropped. 
It's still ongoing, recently I had a ""pretrial hearing"" which turned out to be yet another extension, drawing things out a little further.
It's seriously frustrating that they KNOW their case is weak, and still are playing hardball. My lawyer advised that I make them some sort of settlement offer, which I did ($2k) ... They declined. They made a counter-offer of 50% of the seized currency, which is RIDICULOUS.

I'm looking to now put forth motions for not only a trial by jury, but a jury of 12. Also, I'd like to request a change in venue, as the same people who seized the property, are the same ones who are overseeing the prosecution on this case, as well as the ones who stand to gain from a win on their end.  

The current laws that are in place are NOT SERVING US. Before this, I knew nothing about things of this nature ever even happening. It's sickening. The place that this has put me in makes me feel helpless, like I'm sitting at the front row of my own funeral. SO ANGRY!!!!!

Anyway, I'm sure just like anyone else that this has happened to, I'm hoping for the best and am striving to educate myself in this area, so that I can be as equipped as possible to fight this extreme battle.

When I was in middle school, I was bullied every single day. One of the few things I looked forward to during this time was surviving school and getting home to watch reruns of In Search Of... This show opened me to two very big things: myth and skepticism. It was entertaining and provided comfort that I very much needed, and it helped my brain to start critically thinking about the world, how facts are presented, and how to research them on your own to search for the truth. In the next few years, Mr. Nimoy started to host Ancient Mysteries (a modern take on In Search Of...) and was just as much fun to watch. There's no way I can express how much he helped shape my mind and approach to life, nor can I thank him for being a bright spot in a dark time. While his role as Spock is iconic, his contributions through these shows are what made Mr. Nimoy a hero to me.

"Nothingsensible","","","In everyone's hurry to jerk each other off about how moderate Muslims are the vast majority and how these attacks don't represent the ""real,"" Islam, they miss the point that **moderate Islam is more extreme than the extremists of other religions.**  [This](http://islamqa.info/en/22809) is moderate Islam.

Go on /r/exmuslim, talk to people who live in Pakistan and are listening to their neighbors fire guns in the air celebrating the attacks.

If you go on /r/Islam right now, you will see hundreds of people talking about how 1) Muslims are the real victims here, 2) free speech is fine but insults to the prophet aren't acceptable, and even a few claiming 3) the Jews are really behind this.

Moderate Islam is not analogous to moderate Christianity.  It's barely analogous to extremist Christianity, given that many ""moderate"" positions like death for apostasy are actually enforced throughout the Muslim world. **Moderate Islam is a dire threat to civilization.**  Reddit is full of people falling all over themselves to display how tolerant they are, without realizing that the ideology they think they're tolerating has nothing to do with the reality of Islam, just the whitewashed version the West hears from hand-picked ""scholars.""

"goalposts","","","I'm going to have a quick go at explaining why I think this 'exhibit/contest' is really fucked up. Please remember that in no way am I saying that the shooters were justified, or something fucked up like that. **Of course they are not**.

The first problem is that this kind of event is designed only to inflame and offend people. It is a demonstration of free speech, sure, but it is does nothing to actually further the cause. There is no threat of a new law criminalizing drawings of Muhammad. It is not designed to create any change in government policy, aside from perhaps anti-immigration, which is only tangentially related to Islamic issues, in the case of the USA.

The next issue: while the people at events like these believe that Muslim people should adopt 'U.S. values', the event accomplishes exactly the opposite. Because the contest foremost exists to inflame, it actively pursues the goal of alienating (and potentially radicalising) Muslim people. It is an attempt to expand, not reduce, the divide between the two groups. Imagine how you would feel if you were walking down the street (in your hometown or abroad) to see some people setting your country's flag on fire. You go home that night, and the media tells you you're not trying hard enough to fit in with the flag-burners.

Burning flags is a very good parallel, I think. Even when it's legal to burn the flag, it's fair enough to say that nobody is burning the flag to keep themselves warm. People burn flags to communicate things to the people represented by that flag. In the USA, this is in fact the Supreme Court interpretation of the act. Honestly, setting aside the rhetoric, what is being communicated in these drawings?

It's also important to point out that 'U.S. values' at their core are just as much about freedom of speech as they are about simple kindness. If you have reverence for the work of the Framers, the amendments, and so on, you should also be able to recognize that the spirit of these laws is to improve the lives of the citizenry. The contest does nothing to accomplish that. In fact, it gets pretty fucking hard to pursue happiness (your inalienable right), when your neighbors are hosting competitions whose purpose is to make you unhappy.

Finally: for fuck's sake, the contest prize was $10,000. Can you imagine how far that money could go toward ameliorating divisions between people in the USA? Baltimore is **rioting** because of these kinds of divisions. Why not attempt to foster peace?

From [this](http://www.childtrends.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/53_appendix1.pdf) source, we can estimate that there are approximately 26 million children in each of the following age groups: 0-5, 6-11, 12-17. As this is an estimation only, I will use the same figure despite the source's slightly differing figures. Modified grouped numbers for the data cited along with estimated usage prevalence percentages can be found below.

Okay, there are several things that are worth discussing at this point. The first is that, going by this (very crudely estimated) percentage, it is clear that the percentage of kids on meds is still pretty low. Seeing that close to five hundred thousand 13-17 year olds take antipsychotics can seem shocking, but that's less than 2% of that age group. And there clearly aren't very many toddlers on antipsychotics or ADHD medications, although I think that it's important to note that there *are* many cases where the use of these medications is fully justified in that age group.

I'm not really going to argue about the necessity of these cases. I think that there is absolutely no valid argument against the treatment percentages of all four classes in the oldest age class. I also think that the middle class's percentages seem reasonable. So let's look at the youngest kids.

For ADHD medication, the treatment numbers seem low enough to only contain fringe cases for 0-5yr old kids. The 0-1yr olds are almost certainly extreme fringe cases, and we don't know if the medication was being prescribed on-label or not. I don't think anyone can really complain about this.

I don't know how reasonable the antidepressant prescription numbers are. The grouped percentage is reasonable, but the individual numbers are a bit dubious. There may be a specialized use in pediatric populations. Or maybe it's being used off-label. I don't have the time to research this right now, so draw your own conclusions about these figures, but don't jump to accept CCHRINT's scare tactics.

The antipsychotic use figures are very, very low.

Here we get to anti-anxiety meds. Wow! 227k scripts for infants? 2.8% of 0-5 year olds on anti-anxiety meds? Seems crazy, right? This is the reason why I decided to sit down and waste a good two hours on researching and writing up this post, because it seemed too crazy too be true, and I just couldn't believe it.

When you think of anti-anxiety meds, you probably think of benzodiazepines. They may primarily be anti-anxiety meds, but another major use is to treat seizures. After a bit of research, I found [this article](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16080423), which is very relevant. Here are two important paragraphs from the full text:

&gt;BDZs are frequently used in controlling various types of seizures in children due to their strong efficacy. It is postulated, based on the
EEG readings, that BDZs suppress the spreading of firing discharges and generalized abnormalities and have limited effect on focal changes (39). Amongst the most commonly used BDZs for this indication are diazepam, clonazepam, clorazepate and lorazepam. Diazepam is frequently employed in treatment of status epilepticus, prevention of febrile seizures, and tonic-clonic seizures (40,41). Nonetheless, other agents may be equally effective. In one study (42), intranasal midazolam was compared to intravenous diazepam in the treatment of childhood seizure disorders. It was concluded that both agents were equally effective.

&gt;Clonazepam has also been used in the treatment of complex partial seizures, absence seizures, myoclonic seizures, infantile spasms
and atonic seizures. However, children may be especially sensitive to clonazepam and may display irritability, hostility and aggressiveness, in addition to drowsiness, ataxia and hypotonia (39).

Aha! That's a *very* good explanation for the usage prevalence in younger pediatric patients. It's also an excellent example of how taking CCHRINT's claims at face value is a bad idea.

There is also another possible explanation for the usage prevalence. Infantile Hemangiomas are an extremely common issue in infants. Beta-blockers such as Propranolol are extremely effective at treating Infantile Hemangiomas, and as a result, the use of beta-blockers in infants has increased greatly. These beta-blockers are also frequently used as anti-anxiety medications.

I don't know how the source's data is grouped, but I can pretty much guarantee that all benzodiazepine use in children is lumped together, and I wouldn't be surprised if beta-blockers are also included, but non-anxiety uses of benzodiazepines alone are enough to explain the figures.

"Appletard","","","God damn it. They're missing the whole point here. I have a 7 year-old with Autism, not saying that makes me an expert in the matter but it needs to be pointed out that some of these kids like to be overstimulated. This little boy asking for a ""squeeze"" may not necessarily be asking based on emotional needs, but the need for physical stimulation. Some kids are just the opposite. The school district fails because it expects these kids to be treated exactly the same as neurotypical  students, but they have different needs, hence ""special"" needs. They are also not being considerate of the other children, having him suspended like this is an interruption to their routines, which anyone with any experience in dealing with things like Autism would understand how important routine is for these children. School boards need more representation from people who have a better understanding of what ""special needs"" really means.

"nojob4acowboy","","","It's sad to say but the FlDOC has been a dismal nightmare for much longer than Scott's watch. Florida has been running the prison system like a business for years, the spending goes through a convoluted and highly corrupt process where former prison officials start businesses that sell or provide goods or services to the system, they make millions above and below the table from ridiculous and shoddy equipment or services, money is shoveled away on useless equipment.  Wardens are incentivized to eliminate positions and overtime and mandate shift supervisors always run at critical staffing levels (if anyone calls in, your holding OT) some facilities run below what is allowed by doc policy and state statute, shift rosters and security rosters have ""ghosted"" officers that aren't actually there. Staff generally don't have basic equipment like radios, gate keys, chemical agents or handcuffs, what can they really do to defend themselves? The article states 38,000 for a LT, that's tripe, try 34 and NO PAID OVERTIME, none, even if you do work overtime it is stored as regular comp time and you are capped at 240 hours, once you max out, you work for free. Regular Comp is even a joke because you are comped hour for hour, it should be 1 1/2 compensation since we weren't salaried, we were hourly paid and career service not select exempt service, which are salaried staff. I could shut down reddits servers with all the fucked up shit the administrations and leadership do to fuck over really good people and have even been responsible for the deaths of some staff because of their ineptitude and corruptions.

""A search subsequently found about **1¼ pounds of marijuana and a lab for manufacturing cannabis oil on the kitchen table and counters**, drug paraphernalia and other related items, police said. Authorities said the items were **within easy reach of the child.**""

So this is a little more involved than what we were hearing last week. Having a cannabis oil extraction setup in your kitchen is much different than just having some bud around and a small vial of oil. The solvents used are very flammable, and they just had them in their kitchen, not in a laboratory setting. 

I'm all for the legalization of marijuana. I live in WA and I voted to help make that happen here. But people need to be responsible with this stuff. Don't just leave 1.25 pounds of it lying around, and turn your kitchen into a fucking laboratory to make cannabis oil. ESPECIALLY don't do this if marijuana is illegal in your state. I mean, how fucking retarded do you have to be to do that? At least lock that shit up in your basement where little Jonny won't fuck with it, or decide to use it himself.

Edit: This woman's actions were illegal even in WA, because you're not allowed to make your own cannabis oil at home. You also are limited to possessing 1 ounce, or 28 grams, of marijuana at a time. This woman had 1.25 pounds of it, which is 20 times the legal amount in WA. Colorado also limits possession to 1 ounce. The quantity she had would be a Class 5 Felony in CO, with the possibility of a $1,000-$100,000 fine and/or 1-3 years in prison.

"whynotwastemoretime","","","I'm vehemently pro-choice. But I'd like to mention some text messages this woman sent to a friend:

**“These pills taste like ….” (expletive deleted) and that “if these don’t work after tasting so nasty, I’m going to be mad.”** [source](http://www.wndu.com/home/headlines/Text-messages-to-be-used-in-Granger-womans-child-neglect-trial-289848011.html). EDIT: THIS TEXT WAS SENT 3 DAYS BEFORE SHE WENT TO THE HOSPITAL.

Also, from another article ([source](http://www.wsbt.com/news/local/first-day-of-testimony-in-trial-over-granger-newborns-death/30919216)):

**On June 10, Patel text messaged her friend about ordering abortion pills from an “international pharmacy,” and when the friend asked Patel three more times to see a doctor, she replied, “I’d rather not even go to a doc. I just want to get this over with,” Herring said.**

**Then on July 13, Patel text messaged her friend, “Just lost the baby. I’m gonna clean up the bathroom and then go to Moe’s.”** Note: Moe's is the name of the restaurant her parents own. Also, THIS TEXT WAS SENT THE DAY BEFORE SHE WENT TO THE HOSPITAL.

**That’s where investigators have said they ultimately found the baby, in a dumpster, wrapped in plastic bags.**

Her friend also repeatedly urged her to go to a doctor starting in April, but she refused. I think this adds a layer to the conversation and wanted to mention it because these these text message were not mentioned in this article or many of the other articles I've read within the past few days. Only our local media seems to have actually shared the content of these text messages. I suspect they are a major reason why the jury chose to convict. 

 I'd also like to add that quite a few articles I've read about this seem to indicate that she came from a family with little means and she was working alone to support her parents/grandparents (setting up a sympathetic/desperate story).  Her parents own a successful restaurant in town and that's where she chose to dump the fetus.

Edited to add more info.

**Edited again** My intent with posting this was to provide a fuller picture of a complex case. I think these texts are a very important piece and can show a likely reason that the jury decided the way they did. I also feel that many of the articles I've seen are purposely leaving the content of these texts out because they make her a less sympathetic figure. I agree with many people that there is a real risk of feticide laws being misused, the laws were applied ""creatively"" in this particular case (ie charging her with feticide, and the neglect/feticide double charge) and I question the length of her sentence as a result of these charges.

"[deleted]","","","If you really want to lay blame on someone and something for letting this happen lets go after the regulatory agencies specifically the FAA. Why? Because they create a culture where anyone with any mental health problem WILL not be allowed to fly. You may ask whats the big deal about that? The thing is when you're a professional pilot you train for years and spend tons of money. You basically dedicate your life to the profession. Some people live with mental health problems for the early part of their lives only to have them really surface as they get older. The problem is that when it's discovered in this profession you may be heavily committed in it and unable to just stop.

For example if pete age 40 is a 737 captain at major airline X he's probably making 200k a year. He has a house 2 cars a nice family. But Pete is sad, what can pete do? Well if you were in non-aviation you would go to the doctor and get checked out and get the help you need. Not in aviation... If pete went to the doctor and was diagnosed with depression he wouldn't be allowed to fly anymore. Now his 200k a year income is gone. The faa would deny his medical for years. So now what? Well Pete would have to get a job in something else while also fighting the faa to get his medical back. At age 40 with only aviation it would be near impossible to get a job making 200k again. So he would at best get a 50k entry level position since other than aviation he has no other marketable skills. It would most likely end up causing much more stress since now his house, cars, and marriage would all be in danger. I've been told those anti-depressants don't really cure you and in most cases make things worse. So now pete is on those making pills, making 75% less money, worried about his carreer, family life, professional life and mental health. If anything Pete is probably worse off now than he was before because the depression is probably still there but now he has the weight of the world on him with all those other factors lingering in his mind.

So with all that said what do you think pete would end up doing? Getting ""help"" or just ""dealing with it"" and maybe having a few drinks at the hotel bar to help him sleep better at night? I'm sure pete would love to see a professional to help him cope with his depression or whatever but the FAA creates an environment where that is not possible. This also explains the rampant alcoholism that pilots face.

First, the author is a therapist and social psychologist, not a psychiatrist. The part of her article which discusses the prescription of Adderall by a family doctor for a particular child does not address the suitability of a family doc to diagnose ADHD nor or the accuracy of that diagnosis for that child. 

Later in the article the author poses the following question ""If ADHD were truly a genetically based biological disease, wouldn’t the percentage of children diagnosed with it be more or less equal across geographical areas?"" Okay, I’ll bite.

Lastly, I’d like to comment on her choice of title. Any of the following titles could refer to a systemic failure of our health and education systems to accurately diagnose their respective illness but that's certainly not what's implied.

I have been a Police Officer for over 14 yrs it is not uncommon for people to injure themselves by banging themselves against the cage of a car or the wall of a cell, which this new article suggests. Is it the case here? Maybe, maybe not. WAIT until the autopsy report is released and reading all of the facts before making up your mind. 

Remember the Autopsy report in the Michael Brown Case proved that the narrative of ""Hands up dont shoot"" never actually happened. But it was still very widely used both before and after the report. 

A few issues that need to be considered in this case. If this report is correct and Gray did indeed injury himself in the van then a few questions arise. How come Mr. Gray wasnt restrained properly? and at what point did the Officers discover Mr. Gray was actually hurt and summoned First Aid? Questions like this change the situation from a Criminal abuse case to a negligent case or even a Civil Case. 

This new report isnt without its holes. The other prisoner couldnt see Mr Gray, Does Mr. Gray have any visible injuries on his head or chin? Did this other prisoner experience a ""Rough Ride""?  These questions and more arent answered yet.

One of the most dangerous things we can do as a society is act like subconscious feelings of animus and suspicion against certain races  and religions do not exist and that our behavior is not at all influenced by them. Of course most of us would like to think of ourselves as better than that, as people who are not bigoted and not narrow-minded. But the fact is, it exists, this subconsciousness exists.

Yes, this man says it was motivated by an ongoing parking dispute. But one should wonder, would things have been differently if the victims were not Muslim and were not of Arab descent? Would he have been more willing to talk out the dispute rather than resort to violence and death? Perhaps not.

But we as a society would do ourselves a disservice to not constantly question ourselves and to not evaluate how racial and religious stereotypes affect our everyday interactions. It's easy to dismiss and ignore, but it's important to be constantly aware that it exists, and to be constantly vigilant in not letting it get in the way of our conversations, our friendships, and especially our arguments.

Louisiana actually has much lower tuition then many ""liberal"" states like Massachusetts and Connecticut, yet I don't hear anyone blasting the governors of those states. 

The tax break in question is 10 years of no property taxes if you make a capital investment. The thinking is that will make business's want to relocate and invest in the state, which will help the overall economy. They will earn income in the state, which is taxed, hire people, who get taxed, and so forth, so you can't just look at the forgone property taxes, you have to look at the overall economic impact. Would Exxon have invested as much if they didn't get the tax break? Hard to tell and this article doesn't explain.

If you justify killing innocent people in order to get most of the guilty ones, then you're no better than a murderer.  

But there are other reasons to object that has to do with the core of how a democracy works.  We have a democracy because we do not arbitrarily trust people with the power to rule over us.  If we did have that trust we would not bother with a democracy, we would be happy with a dictatorship.  

We have a democracy because we do not trust people with indefinite power.  People we have entrusted with power to rule over us have to work to justify remaining in power or we remove them from power by voting or other means built into the system.

So if someone is serving a life sentence, there is always a chance someone improperly sentenced can be freed.  But you can't bring an innocent person back from the dead.

Edit 4:37 pm: Waco PD just stated they're closing the entire Central Texas Marketplace. For everyone not in the area, it's kind of like a very large, outdoor mall. It's a really big area to lock down.

Edit 5:17: Local news said that the FBI is on the scene. Press conference should be incoming any minute now. They interviewed some crazy woman whose son got shot, she wanted to clarify that they were part of a motorcycle **club** but the police are stressing that these are motorcycle **gangs**.

Edit 5:24: The Waco Convention Center is I guess where they're holding some of the injured and arrested until they get a better handle on the situation. Insane to see Officer Swanton on TV.

**Edit 5:26, press conference**: 8 bikers dead at Twin Peaks, one died at hospital. Expecting to recover over 100 weapons. Tactical unit was on scene before the incident because they knew something would happen. Sgt. Swanton confirms that management of Twin Peaks refused to work with police to prevent the incident. All injured are part of the motorcycle gangs, I believe he said 18 injured transported to the hospital. Confirmed that other bikers are expected to head toward Waco. There is no other crime scenes, just areas with preventative police presence. Sgt. Swanton is obviously furious that Twin Peaks allowed this to happen, he's reiterating it multiple times.

Edit 5:47: Sgt. Swanton is clarifying again that this is a criminal biker **gang** and that anyone who says members of these gangs aren't criminals is an outright liar. Very strong opinions from the Waco PD about the management of Twin Peaks and people associated with these gangs.

Edit 5:59: Seeing multiple people say the Walmart on Franklin is shut down. That's a good distance away, so I have no idea why.

Edit 6:21: Local news is confirming that a large number of bikers are expected to come in from out of town. Police from different counties are still in the area and monitoring I-35 by helicopter, they seem prepared to settle any new confrontations. 

Edit 7:01: Missed most of the latest press conference because my husband stole the TV...but they did say that there are at least 5 gangs involved. Something like 150-200 people involved in this shooting.

Yeah I think that change will happen by itself when the police stop acting like the enemy. Yes yes, only a small percentage of cops are brutal dickheads, but if someone baked you 50 chocolate chip cookies and told you that one of the cookies had little bits of shit instead of chips, you're not gonna eat any of them are you, even though the chances of getting the shit-cookie is 2%.

EDIT: Ok I'm getting a lot of angry people in my inbox, pointing out that this basic analogy can be applied to validate racism/bigotry what have you, and I see how it's worded and you're not wrong, it's a big blanket statement. So I think I should expand on my opinion. First of all, I wouldn't say I advocate ""police hatred"", more like ""police caution"". Someone brought up an ad that used a similar analogy comparing poisoned M&amp;M's to men, and that also seemed like it was saying ""Hey, there's a few sick bastards out there who wanna rape you, so be smart and exercise caution ladies,"" not ""AVOID ALL MEN THEY'RE GONNA RAPE YOU LIKE A 10%-POISONED HANDFUL OF M&amp;M's WOULD"".

Secondly, no, I do not think that the shit-cookie analogy should apply to any grouping of people, probably even shouldn't be applied to most groups of people. Some people are shitty, that's a side effect of humanity, not due to their race or gender or religion. However, I think there are certain exceptions, such as the police force, other organizations of powerful people whose actions can have a huge impact on us normal peoples' lives. When you take a position of power like that, you are taking on a solemn responsibility to not be a doucherocket, to hold yourself above the moral standards of your average joe. Sure, mistakes will be made, everyone's human, but we should be able to detect them more easily and hold officers more accountable; furthermore, these said errors should not be grievous moral missteps that end with a body and a 2 month paid leave.

"MyNameIsStevenE","","","I don't think some people understand how traffic stops work, officer safety is taught, and probable cause is defined. I'll go through each of these for everyone to make it easy for everyone; I'll also go over how it pertains to this video. Age is a moot point.

**Traffic Stops:**

During any traffic stop an officer must have a probable cause to perform the stop. Once this probable cause is defined and can be articulated by the officer the person stopped is for all intensive purposes ""being detained"" by the police pending an investigation. ""Being detained"" means an officer can hold a suspect for up to 72 hours (depending on the state it can be 48 hours) WITHOUT charges even being filed by the state. If you have ever been pulled over and issued a ticket you were probably asked to read/sign the ticket. An officer giving a ticket is effectively filing charges and releasing you out of their custody (ending the investigation) and giving you a date to see a judge (kind of like a bond set at $0). 

*In the video*, the officer stopped the car for a light that is out which validates the stop as lawful.

**Officer Safety:**

When it comes to officer safety, policies are generally pretty clear and standard. If two people then two or more officers. It wouldn't be unheard of for one officer to attempt to separate the occupants outside the vehicle. If the officer detects another crime is being committed they will have to continue their investigation in a safe manner. Safety is paramount; an officer would not know the contents of a car or a person so it would be in safety's best interests to search the occupants for weapons and continuing the investigation by checking for drugs.

*In the video* the officer has said he is continuing his investigation and needs the occupants out of the car presumably to search the occupants (weapons for the officer's safety and drugs for the investigation). When they are not compliant with the lawful order the officer moves up a rung on the ladder of force by attempting to pull the occupant out of the vehicle. The occupant continues to be non-compliant so the officer climbs the next rung and deploys OC spray this continues until the TASER is deployed and at which point you can even see the occupant kick out the door at the officer as he tries to pull him out. Now lets talk about how he wants to call his mother and have her present and how it pertains to officer safety. How safe would it be for an officer to allow ANOTHER person (whom the officer has never seen) to show up on a scene with an unknown motive/demeanor/direction compounded by obviously non-compliant occupants with unknown contents on their persons and vehicle? No police officer would allow this unless they have a deathwish or a stupid amount of confidence in a person they've never met. Add to the fact the officer knows he can detain this person for 72 hours without charges being filed.


**Probable Cause:**

Probable cause basically means through the officers training and experience the officer can articulate that a crime was or may have been committed. An officer with more training and more experience can articulate based on more circumstances what probable cause means and if an officer can't articulate why they stopped someone it would be considered unlawful.

* Did the officer have probable cause for the traffic stop? **Yes** we already talked about it. There was a clear violation with a light.

* Did the officer have probable cause to remove the occupants? **Yes** for officer safety an officer can remove occupants for any stop.

* Did the officer have probable cause to search the car? **Yes** The officer believes he can smell marijuana coming from the car. Based on the officers training and experience (probably from dealing with marijuana and its users directly in the field) the officer can articulate that he can search the car for marijuana and any other unsafe contents.

As for the officer ""turning off the camera"" it may have been a bad move, but I believe at this point the officers have decided they are arresting the occupants regardless of drugs. The officer was more than likely returning the phone to the suspects to be booked with them at jail instead of being left in the car on the side of the road to be impounded and inventoried at a later day. The officer was not turning off the phone to hide anything, because he knew everything he did was lawful. More than likely he was returning the phone so they can get their phone back when they get out of jail as opposed to going through hoops and hurdles to get it later. As to her video getting ""deleted"" wouldn't it be convenient that it's in the recently deleted file instead of actually being deleted? Cops aren't stupid, if a police officer wanted to delete a video, where said video doesn't affect the officers at all, and put their career on the line don't you think they would know how to REALLY delete the video?",1428683222,"","False",1,2,"news"

"fucking_hate_peta","","","I worked in wild animal rehab for three years.  For those of you who don't know, the ultimate goal of rehabbing wild animals is to get them to the point of being able to be released back into their natural environment.  The point is NOT to make friends with the animals, because if they become human-friendly they'll almost certainly be killed, or become dangerous to humans.  If an animal does become too human-friendly it can't be released and the only thing you can do is euthanize it or make it into a demonstration animal.  We went to great lengths to make sure this didn't happen unless the animal was already non-releasable (e.g., a bird with a missing wing).

PETA members were a pain to us in two different ways.  First, the less extreme members would volunteer but had no actual interest in doing any real work.  They were there to demonstrate that their 'special relationship with the Great Mother Gaia' would allow them to charm any animal into their arms, as if life was somehow a fucking Disney movie.  Of course, the animals were wild and therefore having none of it, and the stupid PETA cunts would invariably wait until they weren't being monitored, sneak into a cage, corner a damned animal (which at this point was scared shitless), and then they'd get attacked.  This happened EVERY SINGLE TIME.  They honestly believed that their special snowflake status would work some weird voodoo on the animal, who would then become their best friend.  Instead, they'd get bit/scratched/torn up and need treatment which we could ill afford, and this after doing their best to avoid anything that smacked of actual labor.

Best part?  Almost every time these dumb motherfuckers would go ballistic and blame US - yes, US - for the animal being hostile.  They'd say that we ""brainwashed"" or ""tortured"" the animal, and they knew that because - ta da! - the animal would never have attacked them otherwise.  We'd done something horrible to the animal, which is why it couldn't tell some random nasty human apart from a sacred PETA butt-boy.  As much as we loved volunteer labor, we eventually added a question to our interview process that asked folks if they were part of PETA, and if they answered affirmatively we'd say we already had enough volunteers but we would be sure to get back to them when we had an opening.

The second kind of PETA member would try to sneak onto the property and open cages to scare the animals out.  We're talking about badly injured animals, or orphans, who'd be dead in a few days, if that.  Fortunately we had a couple of ""attack lamas"" and some very territorial dogs, and they'd always raise a ruckus when these assholes came around.  I gotta say, it was fucking hilarious to see some PETA dipshit running full bore, screaming, with two pissed-off lamas on his heels.  Note:  the lamas were generally mild-mannered, but for some reason they'd go nuts if anyone who wasn't on staff, or with staff, tried to open a cage.

Aside from seeing a PETA freak chased by lamas, my best moment was seeing a passle of PETA (three, iirc) trying to deal with a great horned owl in the hospital section of the center.  The great horned owl is a large bird, and this guy was a monster for his species.  They opened his cage, he objected to them trying to towel and grab him, and he flew out (not far, his wing was injured).  They thought that they could talk him into calming down (PETA magic), but the owl had already decided they were assholes and any time they'd get near he'd spread his wings (very impressive for this guy) and shriek.

I walk into the hospital to find the owl loose and three PETA types babbling at him, they tell me they ""don't need help"".  Sure you don't, which is why the owl is loose, flying around on an injured wing, and screeching - which is something they only do when they're really distressed.  So, I hold out my arm, wait until the owl is focused on me, and say ""here"".  The owl takes off and lands on my arm, careful not to tear it to shreds with his massive claws as I'm not wearing a glove.  Great horned owls are bloody smart birds.  PETA pricks are speechless, then become almost savagely angry - the jealousy is obvious, as a worthless meat-eating 'prole' has somehow managed to outdo them in the space of a few seconds.  I'm senior on staff, so I order them out of the hospital, telling them I'm going to cover the rest of their shift.  They object, I tell them to get the hell out or face the consequences with the center owner, and they finally leave.

What they didn't know is that when I was young I worked on farms and was a bona fide animal charmer.  Only kids are real animal charmers - it wears off once you hit puberty - but I still had some of the mojo.  Because of this, the animals at the center were much calmer and far more cooperative with me than anyone else.  When the owl came in he took an instant liking to me, so I'd let him out of his cage will I did hospital rounds, sitting on my arm or shoulder.  He was always very careful not to turn my body into hamburger with his claws and grateful to get out of the cage to stretch his wings for a bit, so it worked out very well all around.  When the owl saw me he instantly took up his usual place because we'd done this before and he most likely saw me as a protector against the crazed PETA predators who were trying to eat him.

The three I kicked out were tossed from the volunteer program.  They went and complained to the owner of the center, who told them to get lost and never come back.  That was the final straw in terms of us deciding to reject any volunteer who was affiliated with PETA (i.e., they chased an injured animal around the hospital rather than get help as they were trained to do, lengthening his recovery time and putting him in danger of sustaining even worse injuries).

Destruction of documents by one officer of the government should not be taken to mean that said destruction is government policy. It is normally undertaken to thwart the work of other arms of government, and should be treated as a systemic threat to America.

Spoliation and perjury have made a mockery of our Police forces. It is fortunate that they heap so much honor and glory on themselves; I can no longer honor cops that I don't know personally, because as a group, spoliation and perjury and a thriving prison industry are all that they represent. Draconian laws have undermined all our communities, so they can't really claim to even be doing what they are supposedly *for*. I used to defer to the word of the Police; now I assume in all cases that charges of 'resisting arrest' and 'assault on an officer' are lies meant to thwart off attempts to hold them to account. This is a dishonorable state of affairs. It saddens me that they have pissed on their own brand like this, because I am a strong advocate of law and order. Still am, hence this rant.

If the system truly cannot: a.) resist locking up innocent persons, and  b.) succeed in locking up criminals acting under color of authority, then we will be seeing the whole notion of 'American Justice' come under wholesale attack. And rightfully so. The 13th amendment gives the US the authority to keep slaves. At present, it looks like that is all the system is for.

It gives me some bemusement to notice that wholesale surveillance is proving to be more of a problem for our authorities than it is for average folks. I'm not sure that the shoe wont be on the other foot eventually, but at this moment of our history, cameras everywhere really are bringing a pressure to make the country better.

The trouble is, it is DAs that drive the problems; DAs that work the system to, say, have a murderer cop exhonorated by bringing erroneous charges (I don't believe that was an accident, and why should I?). No DA has been meaningfully held to account for their role in undermining justice in our country, and so we are unlikely to see anything improve. It is THEY who tolerate 'testilying'.  It is they who engage in spoliation of evidence where it really matters. It is they who collude with police to enshrine violence as a normal policing tactic.

This kind of stuff is meant as a distraction.  Pay attention to what your government is doing, not to what a few sad alcoholics in the poor part of town are doing.

"j_la","","","This thread seems pretty hostile to anyone defending the group, but I just wanted to raise a point that I think is worth considering. This was a support group for people who have faced racism (a fact admitted by one of the white students). This shouldn't be an event open to reporters and it should be reserved for people who have had that experience. You wouldn't let a pro-booze person into an AA meeting or a neo-nazi into a meeting of holocaust survivors (note: not saying these kids are pushers or nazis!). Sometimes, people need to vent and it is easiest to vent when you feel like your audience understands and won't take offense.

But for some reason, these two students thought this meeting was about organizing (despite admitting it was a support group). One even says:

&gt;“Right now it’s almost like they’re suggesting they can make racialization go away (and that) if everyone who has been racialized just talks… it will magically go away,” Hewitt added.

Doesn't this strike anyone else as condescending? ""Hey, I know you have experienced racism and all, but talking about it is a waste of time"". Maybe this meeting was about coping, not about action. Nobody expects racism to ""magically"" disappear, but I can imagine that having a white kid tell you that you shouldn't talk about your experiences would be pretty infuriating. Can you imagine if he had gone into the meeting and said that?

Edit: Thanks for the gold

Edit 2: people have taken issue with my AA and holocaust examples. Let me stress: I'm not saying that the white students were necessarily hostile. I was using an extreme example to illustrate why a group might be closed off. This wasn't meant as an analogy or equivalence. The point was merely that support groups generally don't admit people who do not hold comparable experiences or who might be hostile to the ideas expressed there.

Why does the court of public opinion only work one way? It seems to be more than ok to refer to the accused as a rapist. You see it on facebook, and twitter, and tumblr, even in articles written about the story. No one bats an eye calling this guy a rapist despite no evidence, you'll let him be branded for life. But when people go the other way and form a different opinion then the insults come out. We're horrible horrible people. Both sides have the same information. Neither side was there and will never be able to know for sure what really happened (a fact that defenders of the accuser bring up whenever defenders of the accused mention the facebook logs). He can be labeled a rapist for his entire life and you wouldnt care even though he's more then able to defend his case. I'm not even telling you your opinion on the case is wrong, but why are you entitled to yours while mine makes me a horrible person despite both involve labeling a human being we've never met.

- Police asked Geer's wife if he had a weapon. She replied that he owned some firearms, that were legally owned and securely stored. She said that he had not been drinking.

- Five officers arrive at the scene, including Barnes (negotiator) and Torres (shooter)

- During the standoff, Geer kept his hands raised and complied with all requests from Barnes, including retrieving his holstered handgun from inside the house and setting it aside in plain view, refraining from using his phone, checking pockets, etc.

- Barnes attempted to coax Geer out onto the porch, but Geer wanted to remain inside as he feared being shot. He specifically pointed out Torres, who repeatedly raised his gun from the ""ready"" position (aiming at legs) to aim at Geer's chest.

- Geer asked Barnes for permission to scratch his nose. Barnes consented, then Torres fired, fatally wounding Geer.

- While police waited for backup to clear the scene, Geer bled to death without receiving medical attention.

-----

- After the encounter, Torres claimed that Geer dropped his hands suddenly to his waist. Two civilian witnesses and all four of the other officers contradicted this statement when speaking to investigators.

- Torres has not been charged or disciplined, and has stated ""I don't feel sorry for shooting the guy at all.""

If the administration wants to run things in a way that requires more money, and the people (to whom that university belongs and for whom that university exists) think it's too expensive already, then the job of the administration is *not* to convince the people why tuition should be raised. Instead, it's the administration's job to change how the fuck it's run so that it becomes more affordable.

School boards say, ""We need to punish this student who forgot they had a pocket knife in their backpack and accidentally brought it to school because otherwise we would be violating policy."" No! You fucking break your policy, because hopefully it was invented in order to better serve the children and help ensure safety and security so they could get an education.

Essentially, back in 2006 the then 19 year old female victim was in a car retrieving a photo from a male high school friend. Two men got in the car with them, driving them to a secluded place where she was raped by seven men and her male friend was raped by three.

She was initially sentenced to 90 lashes for being out in public without a male relative while with a strange male which the Saudi's call indecency. Because she and her lawyer spoke to the press about the case, on appeal her sentence was increased to 200 lashes and six months in prison. For speaking to the press, her lawyer was banned from further defending her, had his law license confiscated and he faces a disciplinary hearing later this month. 

While the appeals court also doubled the sentence for the seven rapists, this takes victim blaming to a new level. Note that her high school male friend (also very much a victim) is being punished as well. The article says he got the same sentence she did, but doesn't clarify if that is 90 lashes or 200 lashes with six months in prison.

Instead of wasting billions bombing the stone age people of Afghanistan, we should have spent the last decade bringing lots and lots of 'Murica Freedom™ to Saudi Arabia. After all, most of the 9/11 hijackers were Saudi. Osama bin Laden was Saudi. The Saudi people fund global terrorism like Americans eat hamburgers and think of all that OIL!

Edit: a word

**Also tl/dr - Her already barbaric punishment was more than doubled because she and her lawyer dared speak to the press. Her lawyer is suffering serious professional consequences. Takes victim blaming to a whole new level.**

"HBombthrow","","","Some context for those who don't read articles:

The courts have ruled that the Office of Administration is not subject to the FOIA.  The other offices of the White House have long been exempt from the FOIA.  Keep in mind these are White House offices, not the executive branch; that is, the offices that directly advise the president.  These records are exempt from the FOIA because they have a huge volume of sensitive information and because the office of the presidency needs some room to operate privately when determining choices of action.  The Office of Administration has more or less been voluntarily answering FOIA requests until this order.  (Edit:  I'll add, the Office of Administration is a very un-sexy department, it handles the ""office-y"" things about the White House, like facilities maintenance, HR, printing color power points, etc.)

The records don't disappear -- the White House is subject to the Presidential Records Act.  Under this rule the records are released after a few years.  Keep in mind, too, that outside of the national security and law enforcement context, where things are secret anyway, there's not much the president can officially do without his actions being subject to scrutiny.  For example, we might not have real-time access to Obama's deliberations when formulating a memo on immigration policies, but if that memo leaves the White House to go to the Department of Homeland Security, it's now a Homeland document subject to their FOIA requirements, and he can't take any official action based on that memo without going through very public steps.  In other words, this really covers the internal documents of Obama and his close team.  (""Close"" is relative, there's still hundreds and hundreds of people working in the White House organization.)

Why would the White House not want to open these records? Think about a public company.  Say you're Pepsi.  The board and officers answer to investors, and there is a great deal of disclosure that has to be made to investors and the SEC.  You give periodic updates, host calls, issue annual and quarterly reports, file 10ks, and have all sorts of requirements on preserving certain documents and making them available.  But imagine if beyond all that, any investor could sit in on any meeting.  The CEO and the CFO couldn't send an email without the investors being able to see it the next day.  How do you think that would affect the leadership's ability to do it's job?  What if the investor didn't really understand how the job worked, and was constantly misinterpreting the situation?

Think about Benghazi, and in particular how much mileage certain circles have gotten out of the most meaningless emails about talking points.  More than ever before, there is a professional army of nitpickers poring over every action of the president for the purpose of political gain.  These are people who do not have the country's interests at heart.  Do you think it would help or hurt the presidency if his office couldn't discuss farm subsidies internally without Daily Caller telling you that Obama hates farmers based on the tone of an email between two aides?

Also, keep in mind that with ESI there are orders of magnitude more documents than in prior generations.  Email means that what used to be 1 document might now easily be 200 (think of a memo that goes through several drafts circulated to 10 people -- each comment, each draft, in each person's account is now a document).  It's one thing to store and release with the presidential files, another to continually review millions of documents for the thousands of requests the Office receives.

Now, this isn't a statement on the president's stance on whistleblowers generally.  But this move is not nearly as big a deal as people here are claiming.

"VoightKampffTest","","","Something on this scale wasn't a spur of the moment thing; the protestors have to have been socking away supplies and planning defenses for weeks if not months. The main limiting factor for the besieged is usually water, if policies haven't changed since I tactically GTFO of that blighted industry the SOP is to cut off water and electricity to the overrun buildings. 

Cafeteria meals have been deliberately tweaked to primarily consist of things that don't keep long without refrigeration, so not much beyond corn bread and canteen goods are going to be edible after a few days. 

If these were dormitories, the water situation is going to fuck them over significantly faster than food. Maybe a dozen toilets and sinks without drain plugs per every dormitory unit of one hundred people. Cellblocks are more sustainable, with one toliet holding about 1.5 gallons of water per two man cell. No clue about the tents. After about three days, the dehydration is going to be degrading the cognitive abilities and physical performance of the protestors involved. 

It was hot and sunny today and will be tomorrow, so they'll probably be quite thirsty by Monday. If the organizers were really looking ahead, the weather forecast predicts rain on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday so collecting rainwater may allow the besieged to extend the time they can hold out. 

These inmates aren't getting their meds as well. Wouldn't be surprised if we see a few deaths from diabetes, heart attacks, etc. Many old men in the system, and a lot of HIV/AIDs cases with compromised immune systems. 

The lack of electricity also isolates the inmates; they can't use radios or watch TV to keep abreast of the public reaction to their uprising and see what kind of forces are being marshaled against them. The batteries of the smuggled cell phones they are using to coordinate efforts between units and contacts on the outside will steadily drain. Limits their weaponry as well; a Dixie cup full of syrup, sugar, and water boiled for twenty minutes in a microwave is a nightmarish thing to have thrown in someone's face and poured down armor. Same for using extension cords to electrify puddles of urine and the like. 

The fact that they have no hostages is very surprising. You're looking at one unarmed officer at a desk, probably a middle aged woman, to one hundred inmates. Or two in each cellblock of a few dozen with 1-2 patrolling between units outside. It would be an absolute trivial manner to dogpile them and take them hostage, which makes me very curious about how things played out. The lack of hostages makes the strategy of just waiting out the rioter's supplies more viable. 

Any firearms the inmates have somehow gotten ahold of are going to have no reloads. Only armed guards are typically in towers or fields outside the wire, carrying a mix of Mini-14s, revolvers, lever action 30-30s, and pump action shotguns. From the sound of it the riot never made it anywhere they could obtain firearms and armor. Majority of weapons (if any) will be padlocks from personal lockers stuffed in socks, blades from broken disposable razors melted into toothbrushes, improvised brass knuckles, clubs, etc. 

They'll try to create barricades everywhere and rearrange the interiors to slow down a storming of the buildings with drapped bedsheets, mattresses, furniture, etc. 

The responding agencies will talk tough to the public about how ""we don't negotiate"" but behind the scenes anything short of full amnesty and letting them leave the prison is on the table. Best case scenario, they negotiate an improvement in medical treatment and a few other categories and the ringleaders get hammered. 

I have no familiarity with illegal immigrant prisons, but I'd assume they will be less prone to escalate to violence due to the relatively minor sentences involved and the cross-section of society they encompass. More likely to have the kind of useful knowledge and skills that a typical inmate population would not, though.

-After all this he spilled secrets about a plan to pass bogus nuclear weapons blue prints to the Iranians in hopes it would occupy their time for many years and lead to no where. The would be operation called for a CIA turned asset (A Russian scientist) to provide nuclear weapons blueprints to the Iranians. The US predicted these blueprints would hinder the Iranians for years.

&gt;Porter asserts that a defendant who does something intentionally could not have also been reckless, and thus should not be convicted of anything at all. But this distinction between recklessness and intent “really doesn’t make any sense at all,” University of Illinois law professor Marareth Etienne told ThinkProgress. At least under the national criminal law standard known as the Model Penal Code that all first-year law students are taught in Criminal Law 101, a higher state of mind such as intent “always proves a lower level,” in this case, recklessness.

&gt;Recklessness “just means that you were aware of a risk and you didn’t take the proper precaution. So clearly if you shoot at somebody and you shot in a crowd you’re aware of a risk that they’re gonna die,” Etienne said.

&gt;“This is incredible!” University of Illinois Director of Trial Advocacy J. Steven Beckett said. “It appears to me that a lesser included offense was ignored because the proof of the greater offense was obvious. This put prosecutorial decision-making under scrutiny beyond anything imaginable.” In other words, the prosecutors were punished for not having charged Servin with a more severe crime. Even more remarkable, Porter came to this decision in what is known as a “directed verdict” before he even heard the defense’s arguments.

&gt;“When a motion for directed verdict is made by the defense, the evidence must be considered in the light most favorable to the prosecution,” Beckett points out. “What the judge did here appears to be just the opposite!”

and of course this is a great point:

&gt;Etienne points out several adverse consequences that would result if Porter’s understanding of the law prevailed. **A defendant charged with involuntary manslaughter could get on the stand and make the very argument Porter now makes: I am not guilty of a crime of recklessness because I did this on purpose. “And by the way my trial has started so double jeopardy. You can’t go back and charge me with an intentional killing.”**",1429640619,"","False",1,746,"news"
