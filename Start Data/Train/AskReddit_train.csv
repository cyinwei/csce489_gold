"PM_me_guinea_pigs","","","So I apologize if someone has already shared a similar view, but:

I was suicidal for a while just over a year ago.  I hate that stupid fucking cardboard sign that says ""Suicide doesn't end the chances of things getting worse, it ends the chances of things getting better.""  Go fuck yourself.  Suicide absolutely ends the chances of things getting worse.  When I was suicidal, it was because every single day was literally the worst day of my life.  Each day was worse than the day before it, spiraling completely out of control downward, and most often it wasn't even my fault.  Every day was just shittier than the last.  I didn't want anything to get better, I just wanted it to stop getting worse.  People always look at suicides and they're like ""oh that's so selfish to do to his family.""  Oh yes, how selfish that they decided to stop living in the worst hell you've never even imagined.  I'm not condoning suicide for a second.  Obviously I'm still here and things have gotten mostly better.  But it bugs me when people say ""it'll get better"" or ""it's cowardly.""  The only reason I'm still here, literally the only reason, is because I didn't have the courage to do it.  So it's definitely not cowardly.  And as I said earlier, when you're suicidal you don't give two shits about it ""getting better.""  You just want it to stop getting worse.

Having (hopefully) shed some insight into what at least some of them were thinking, what's my opinion?  I think it's a shame.  So much wasted potential.  I think it's also a shame because sometimes it is a temporary problem that will get better.  I think it's a shame because if they're like me, they reached out to all their ""friends"" and were met with awkward silences and shrugged off because their friends didn't know how to deal with it and decided they'd let someone else handle it rather than even try to be helpful.

"The_Town_of_Canada","","","**TL:DR: I was accidentally gay for an hour.**

I'd taken my gf, and her two gay friends to a bar / dance club. 

They were dancing, while I was at the bar, having a drink.

A guy sits down next to me, and asks what I'm drinking. I tell him it's some hipster small batch thing, and he orders two, and slides one over to me, thanking me for the recommendation.

*""Great, next round's on me""* I think. We get into a good conversation about work and the city.

I finish my drink, hit the washroom, and when I get back, there's another beer there for me.

I thank him again, and we continue having a great conversation.

As I finish my beer, and am about to order another, he grabs my hand and asks me to dance.

Now, I could have said any number of things. Things like *""I'm straight""* or *""I'm not gay""* or *""I'm here with my GF""*.

What do I blurt out? ""Oh, no...I uh...don't dance.""

Then like a scene out of a fucking rom-com, he says he's a dancer, and he'd be happy to show me a few moves.

Now, as I'm being lead onto the dance floor, my GF is nowhere to be found (Was on the patio). My first thought is *""This guy seems really nice....fuck....I don't want to lead him on, but he's really nice.""*

At this point, my gf comes in with her friends, laughs, and asks me ""What's going on?""

""I'll explain later."" I said, as I danced with a good looking Asian man.

""Was that your friend?"" He asked.

""No...that was my girlfriend.""

""OK. Then what exactly *are* you doing?""

""I don't know anymore, but you're really nice!""

He laughs it off, says I'm a good guy, and leaves my gf to bring my drunk ass home.

One day back when I was in high school, I started to get a horrible headache. It felt like it was in the center of my head, and it just got worse and worse. No pain medicine seemed to help. I had to be taken home from school because the pain was causing me to lose my balance and fall over. At home I was occasionally able to sleep to escape some of it, but mostly I was just apoplectic. I thrashed around in bed and screamed into my pillow for some sense of relief. It felt like punishment from God. And then the next day it was gone.

The second pain was stomach related. I had been out with a friend having drinks at a club, but didn't have too much to drink. Walking back to the car, my stomach started to bother me. I thought I might puke, but the sensation wasn't quite right for that. The pain increased, more and more, and eventually it felt like I was being stabbed below the sternum by a rusty, twisting knife. I doubled over in pain, feeling like I was going to have to go home in an ambulance. And then it subsided, and I was fine.

"karmapol1ce","","","i think the best tip doesn't seem NSFW, but actually might be the most important thing i've learned with regards to women. It is simply this: be an amazing kisser. if you're not a good kisser, learn how to be a good kisser. you'd be shocked how few men know how to do it. women need to be kissed, and by someone who knows how. and yes, i'm talking finding your scarlett o'hara and kissing them so good that they kind of go faint in your arms type kissing.

kiss her with your lips, your body, your arms, your hands, your hips, your whole body. envision in your brain that you are telepathically telling her how much you want her with everything you're doing. like she might even be able to hear you thinking, ""oh my fucking god, i want to kiss every square inch of you, but for now, i'm just going to kiss you for as long as possible.""

be passionate, playful. think of what feels good to you, and then do it to her. lose yourself in it. be unexpected. lip nibbles, locking, feinting, teasing, changing it up, hands through her hair, cradle her in your arms and make her feel small and safe. feel what her lips and tongue is doing. dance.

kiss her like there's nothing else you'd rather do. that it's not just a detour on the road into her pants. if you truly let yourself go in the moment, you'll be surprised how quickly things escalate.

*ETA: lastly, don't shove your tongue down her throat. bisous.*

*ETAii: wow! gold? thank you, you lovely kissable stranger!* 

**because a couple of you are asking ""how?!"" besides the above… (posted from a comment inside)**

a lot of it is in your intention. a lot of people rush over kisses. as if it's something to fast forward through. take the time to enjoy it. to let the tension build. to close your eyes and feel yourself face to face with a girl and know that she wants you to. all the things in the above paragraph give you a start.

&gt; a few other tips: 
* Kiss confidently or don't kiss at all. 
* It's all in the lips first. Not the tongue. 
* try not to slobber TOO much. If you do, it's okay to laugh and wipe it off. Take care of her :) 
* Hands holding her face or neck or fingers through her hair.
* Feel what she's giving you. Compliment it with what you do. Move in concert with her. 
* You've never been dating to long to make out with someone. grab your SO and make out with her like you've NEVER had sex with her. And you REALLY want to.
* practice makes perfect. kiss a lot!

"EnderBoy","","","I'd been inking for about five years when this guy swaggered into the shop. I say swaggered because I could tell he'd had a bit to drink that night. Enough to make him feel cocky but not enough to be completely out of it, which automatically would have gotten him kicked out of my chair. I'm not going to deal with people so drunk they aren't in control and no one needs 10 am buyers remorse. Not for something like a tattoo.

So he comes in and I can tell he's new. So I direct him to my book of options but he doesn't even look at it. Just sits in my chair and says ""I want you to draw a troll. He should be fishing using one of those plumbs to balance the line.""
""So you want a net?""
""What?""
""A net. A trolling net for fishing?""
""Ha! Is that where it comes from? Fuck no, man. I want a troll. Big green under the bridge troll! And make sure he's got a plumb. That's really important. I want it on my arm.""

I roll my eyes but start sketching a few things out. I'm halfway through outlining something and I say ""so what type of fish is this troll catching?""
""Fish? Fuck no, man. He's catching an alpaca!""
""An alpaca?""
""Fuck yeah.""
""In the water.""
""Now you've got it!""
""With his fishing pole?""
""Don't forget the plumb!""
""How could I?""

So I sketch it out and the guy's like going bonkers over it. He loves it. And I start it up and go for an hour and get a third of the way through before we stop. 

""What are you doing?"" He asks
""Stopping man. Large tattoos have to go in pieces. It'll be better for you.""
The guy slaps down $2,000 in cash and says ""keep going.""
I stare at it.
I stare at him.
I keep going.
""And don't forget the plumb!"" He says.

So three hours later and this guy hasn't so much as whimpered on the chair but I'm finally done. The weirdest tattoo I'd ever done but my god was it a masterpiece. The troll was an ugly pale green. The alpaca a fluffy off-white, fur glistening in the water. And the plumb. Well, who could forget a thing like that.

And he thanks me and walks out the door and I stop him on the street because I can't let it go. I can't. 
""Hey, dude. What's up with the tattoo?""
And he looks at me with these instantly sober eyes and says ""so I never forget.""
""Forget what?"" I ask.
""That 'alpaca plumb troll' is an anagram of 'Paul Blart Mall Cop'.""



ETA: People have been asking for a picture of the tattoo. And so I cracked my knuckles and started my Google-fu. After a few unsuccessful keyword attempts, I typed in ""alpaca troll fishing tattoo"" and this awesome picture from /u/paulfknwalsh came up in an image search!

She has one cat, Moby, who is the shyest. But I was hanging out at her house all day on the couch, and he managed to come out of hiding and socialize a bit.

When she's alone, she usually watches movies on the couch with a blanket, but that day while we watched a movie, I sat on her couch with the blanket and she sat on the loveseat.
While we were watching, Moby jumped up on the couch and snuggled in on my blanketed legs, and dozed off. Awww. He stayed there for about an hour. Anyway, the movie ended and we were chatting, and Moby stayed chilled out on my legs.

I said something funny, and my sister laughed. Moby heard her laugh and looked in her direction, saw her sitting on the loveseat, and did a CLASSIC double take. You could just see his cat thought balloon say, ""WAIT!!! IF SHE'S OVER THERE...WHOSE LEGS AM I SITTING ON?!?!!""
He jumped up super fast and stared directly into my face with this horrified, confused cat expression. ""WHO ARE YOU?!?!?!"" Then he ran off and hid under the dryer, all traumatized by his accidental snuggling with the wrong twin. It took a long time before he stopped running off when he heard me.

Arthur is a man my dad regularly hires these days to do things around the house. My parents own a decent amount of land and my dad, while very capable and amicable to doing yard work, is incredibly busy owning his own business. Arthur was recently incarcerated and is trying to get his life on track. My dad pays him by the hour, something many people may think is foolish. I've never seen anyone work faster than Arthur. He practically runs while weed eating. We were having lunch the other day while he was working, and invited him to join. He declined because he didn't want to make a mess in the house cause he was dirty. He called the other day to see if he could come to church with us because he didn't have a way to get to his church. Regardless of what you think of religion, this clearly paints the picture of a man committed to changing.

 I saw Arthur walking up to the house recently (he doesn't have a car or much way to get around). He had to borrow some money from my dad, something he says he doesn't like to do. He was at the house bright and early the next morning, telling my dad he was there to work off his debt. Recently my fiancé was visiting and her jeep was in the driveway while Arthur was washing my dad's truck. He asked if she wanted her jeep washed for $25. I told him I appreciated it but it was okay (we're both trying to save up some money). We walked out later and her jeep was SPARKLING. I told Arthur politely that we didn't want him to do the jeep. ""I know. But y'all are young and getting married soon. I'm sure it's tough. I just wanted to do y'all a favor"" said Arthur. This man, who has very little, just wanted to help us out. It was very touching. We bought Arthur a bike recently and I don't think I've ever seen anyone so appreciative of anything. He lit up. ""It's got a little basket for my phone so I can listen to music."" We could still heard Arthur singing to his music over a block away. I know he isn't homeless, but he is an ex-con which I'd imagine people are even more hesitant to hire. I know that he may be an exception, but I still wanted to tell this story. Arthur is a humbling man and I wanted everyone to know about him. 

TL;DR: Arthur isn't homeless, but he did just get out of prison. Still one of the hardest workers and nicest people I've ever met. 

Edit: thanks for all the replies and thanks for the gold. Many people have asked what Arthur was incarcerated for. All I know is it was drug related, I believe distributing/trafficking. ",1422822180,"","1422840873",1,3854,"AskReddit"

We think she's growing out of it, and the wife wants another one. I say no, but eventually she wears me down, and we have another.  

Turns out she wasn't outgrowing her issues, and the second one has the same problems. Wife wants a third, I put my foot down and say hell no.

"Ouyeahs","","","A day before his 15th birthday, the son of a wealthy family was asked by his father, `Well my son, what would you like for your birthday?' 

The son hesitated a moment and his father's thoughts leapt ahead to a new computer and similar things. However, his son had had a new computer only recently and could have a new one any time he wished. 

Finally, the son said, `Father, I have everything a boy could wish for, but there is one thing I would really like. I would love to have a pink ping pong ball.' 

The father was rather astonished at this wish, but said, `If it is a pink ping pong ball that you want, a pink ping pong ball you shall have.' 

And so, the next day, the son was given as his bithday present a pink ping pong ball. 

The boy took the ball to his room and the next morning the pink ping pong ball was gone. The father was mildly surprised but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong ball, however, was never seen again. 

The next year, a day before his 16th birthday, the father asked his son what he would like for his birthday. 

'Father,' replied the son, `I have everything a boy could possibly wish for, but there is one thing I would really, really like. I would love to have a tenpack of pink ping pong balls.' 

The father was more surprised than the year before, but kept his curiosity at bay, for he knew that his son had a right for privacy. he said therefore, `If it is a tenpack of pink ping pong balls that you want, a tenpack of pink ping pong balls you shall have.' 

And so, the next day, the son was given as his birthday present a tenpack of pink ping pong balls. 

The boy took the tenpack of balls to his room and the next morning, not a single ball remained, merely the empty husk of the tenpack. The father wondered where ten pink ping pong balls might disappear to, but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong balls, however, were never seen again. 

The next year, a day before his 17th birthday, the son was asked by his father what he would like for his birthday. 

'Father,' said the son to this, `I have everything a boy could wish for, but one thing would make my happiness complete. I would dearly want a carton of pink ping pong balls.' 

The father was beyond surprise, but decided to make sure he had not misheard. `A carton of pink ping pong balls?' 

'A carton of pink ping pong balls,' the boy confirmed. 

'I can't understand your fascination with pink ping pong balls,' said the father, `but if it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you want, it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you shall have.' 

And so, the next day, the boy was given as his birthday present a carton of pink ping pong balls. 

The boy was delighted and took the carton to his room. The next day, miraculously (as if by magic, even) the pink ping pong balls had all disappeared. 

'Dear son,' said the father, `I must ask now, what do you do with all those pink ping pong balls?' 

The son, however, was reluctant to tell him. `Please humour me, dear father.' 

The carton of pink ping pong balls, however, was never seen again. 

The next year, it was clear that the son would get a car, but the father felt that, perhaps, his son also had some other wish apart from the obvious. So, one day before the son's 18th birthday, the father asked him whether he had a special wish for his birthday. 

'Dearest father,' the son started, `I have everything a young man could possibly want, but there is one craving in me. I would, more than anything, want a warehouse full of pink ping pong balls.' 

One of these years, his father thought, I should get to the bottom of this. However, he decided to humour his son's wish. At least he had been wise enough to buy shares in a pink ping pong ball factory. 

The next day, the son was given the address of a warehouse where all his new pink ping pong balls were stored. The son was delighted and decided to spend the next night in the warehouse rather than at home. 

The following morning, the son stepped out of the warehouse, but it seemed to be empty otherwise. The father had a closer look and indeed, apart from empty cardboard boxes, nothing was left inside the warehouse. No pink ping pong balls were left. 

The following year, one day before the son's 19th birthday, the father braced himself for another warehouse of pink ping pong balls. He asked his son what his deepest desire was and he had not been entirely wrong. 

'Father, you have made me very happy these last years and this year I ask of you a shipload of pink ping pong balls if at all possible.' 

It was possible, if only because the father had by now bought each and every factory of pink ping pong balls in the country. 

The next day, the father took his son to the harbour and showed him a huge tanker and told his son that there were millions, billions, trillions of pink ping pong balls in there. 

'Father,' the son said, `You've made me very happy yet again.' 

That night, the son spent on board the tanker. 

The next morning, not a single of the pink ping pong balls could be found, but the son was happy. 

A few days before his 20th birthday, however, the son had a terrible road accident and was taken to the hospital. 

His father visited the young man in hospital. `My dear son! Can I bring you anything to make you feel better?' 

Weakly, the son sat up in bed. `Father, dearest father, grant me this wish; just one tenpack of pink ping pong balls.' 

The father held his son's hand tightly. `Whatever you wish my son, but I have to give you one condition. Even if it may be embarrassing, I must know what you did with all those pink ping pong balls.' 

'Very well, father, but please indulge me first. I will tell you whatever you wish to know after you have given me the ten pink ping pong balls.' 

The father thought that was fair enough and the next day brought his son the ten asked for pink ping pong balls. The son smiled weakly but seemed too weak to talk. 

'Son, I leave these pink ping pong balls with you and shall come back tomorrow to ask of you what you have done with all those pink ping pong balls.' 

The son nodded weakly. 

The next day, less than surprisingly, no pink ping pong balls could be found in the son's hospital room. 

'Now, my dearest son, apple of my eye, treasure of my life, please tell me what you did with all those pink ping pong balls,' the father requested. 

The son nodded and the father gripped his hand tighter. 

`I-' the son started and sat up a bit, swallowing with a dry mouth. 

`I- I-' 

Then he died

I don't like my daughter. She's a bad person. She's mean, vindictive, and she has no empathy for others. She ran away from home repeatedly at age12-13. She had a baby at 14. I love the baby. He's a cool dude. She's not an awful mom, but she's definitely a teenager. She always wants to go out with friends and I sometimes wish she'd go and stay gone. Just like, get arrested and put in jail. They'd help her finish school or get a GED (she refused to attend even 1 day of high school and made my life miserable when I tried to make her go). Plus, the kid would have me as a primary influence in his life and I made so many mistakes raising her (I was young too) but I now feel ready to raise a kid and I have a great relationship with the grandbaby. I could be a strong father figure in his life. He needs me. He's got no one else to help him like I do.

Would I ever try to make any bad stuff happen to my daughter? Of course not. Would I try to help her if she got into legal trouble? Oh yes. Would I ever undermine her in regards to her baby? No way, never, even when she is dead wrong (she gives him a bottle when he's falling asleep, but I read that you shouldn't do that. I told her once, and she didnt listen, so I dropped it).

When she gets mad at me, I try to text her and tell her why she's acting inappropriately, and her reply will usually be something like ""as soon as I got enuf $ u an mah stupid mom r nvr guna c mi or mahh son again lol n u can 4get my num cuz we ain call u r nothin eva ahahahahahaha bye""

That's her. That's the kind of person she is because I was a lousy dad to her. I did the best I could, but I was weak a lot of the time. I know that know. Heck, I knew it even back when she was young. 

I love her. With all of my heart. I'd give my own life for her. I've worked tirelessly to provide for her, her mother and now her baby. But I don't like her. People tell me that she'll be easier to get along with when she's in her 20s. I just wish she'd go away til then so I didn't have this daily reminder of what a failure I was as a father.

I'd never reveal any of this to her. I remain supportive and helpful. She was driving a car with no license and no insurance against my wishes so I imposed on her that we get her license and she did it with her mom and failed twice. She only took it seriously when I took her to do it. See, that's I do. I push her to be better. Her mom doesn't. Her mom just hopes that she'll accomplish things and do well. I MAKE her accomplish things. 

But it's exhausting and I can't do it forever. Sometimes I get weak being the only one trying.

Like I said, I love her. With all of my heart, I do. I just don't like her. She's from a different planet than I am. And I look forward to only seeing her on holidays and stuff.

"Omniada","","","So, a man wakes up in a dingy slum with no memory of how he got there. He wanders around aimlessly before he finds even one person who will talk to him. Some ratty beggar on the street turns out to be nice enough to explain where he is.

""You're in the afterlife!"" he tells the man, ""But you must have been a real shithead when you were alive, because this is the fourth ring, and only the worst people come here.""

All of a sudden, a siren goes off, one of those air-raid things. The man is terrified but the beggar gets up calmly and leads him to a big, dilapidated warehouse where thousands of other similarly unkempt souls are gathering. When the man asks why they're all here, the beggar points to a line of folding tables against the wall. Each table has some moldy bread, cups of dingy water, and some bowls of broth so thin they could have just run out of cups. Only then does the man realize how hungry he is. A guard in heavy body armor blows a whistle and all the people arrange themselves into three lines.

The beggar is helpful enough to explain them for the man. ""That one's the bread line, that's the broth line, and that's the water line. All the food here is free, but if you want to get out of this maggot hole, you've got to work, because the gate guards into the third ring ask five hundred dollars to get through. I've heard the food is better there.""

So the man gets his food. It's abominable, and right then and there, he vows to make five hundred dollars and get into the third ring. Unfortunately for him, very few people need work in the afterlife, especially when all of them are saving up to emigrate. Even still, after ten years of hard work, eating the moldy bread and indistinguishable soup and water, he finally saves up enough money. The guards let him through and he finds himself in the third ring. It's nothing too fancy, if anything, it's a bit below average for a real city, but to his eyes it is paradise. All the guards look much friendlier, and the houses and buildings, while not spacious or lavish, are at least up to code. And to his surprise, he runs right into a familiar former beggar as he crosses the street.

""What are the odds?"" they both ask and they get to conversing. The beggar, it turns out, only managed to make it in himself a few months back. Their conversation is interrupted, however, by what sounds like a school bell. When the man seems confused, the beggar leads him to what looks like a giant gymnasium. Here, people are gathering once again, and the man begins to understand. On a line of folding tables against one wall are stacks of hot dogs, big bowls of salad, and solo cups full of fresh lemonade. A cop shouts for everyone's attention and directs them all to stand in three lines. The beggar smiles at the man's wonder and points to each line in turn. ""That's the hot dog line, that's the salad line, and that's the lemonade line."" The man gets in each line in turn and gets himself his lunch.

While he's eating, basking in joy at not being stuck with old bread and water, the beggar encourages him, ""The best part is, halfway through the year, they switch from hot dogs, salad, and lemonade to chicken, chili, and hot chocolate. You can never get tired of it!""

Sadly, this proved not to be true. After only a few days, the man did again get tired of the same meal every day. But he knew firsthand that he could change his lot, so one day he went up to the wall of the second circle. This time the guards were asking for ten thousand dollars. Well, the man didn't like it, but he figured he had his whole afterlife ahead of him now that he was out of the fourth circle, and he could certainly take some time to save up. After ten years of hard work, it wasn't too difficult for him to keep up the work ethic, and only twenty years later, he went back to the guards of the second ring with the money in hand. He went through the gate and found himself in a glittering, clean city full of glass and steel.

And wouldn't you know it, but there, standing across the street was the same beggar, only now he was wearing a well-fitted suit. The man greeted the beggar as an old friend and they started talking again. Once again, their conversation was interrupted, only this time it was by beautiful church bells. ""Come,"" the beggar told him, ""I'll take you to the evening meal."" So the man followed and they entered a glamorous ballroom filled with beautiful attendees. Even the cops here looked good, dressed in suits and sunglasses like bodyguards. And sure enough, piled onto platters on huge mahogany tables against the far wall were plates of steak, bowls of the most delicious seafood soups, and glasses of champagne. One of the bodyguards cleared his throat loudly and politely requested that the attendees line up. Three lines were formed and the beggar pointed each line out in turn. ""That's the steak line, that's the soup line, and that's the champagne line,"" and then he added, ""and apparently here, they change the meals FOUR times a year!""

The man rejoiced, ate, and was happy, and for once felt that nothing was lacking. Four changes a year was enough  for him. But one day, out of curiosity, he went up to the bodyguards that guarded the gate into the first and final ring of the afterlife and found they were asking for a million dollars to pass. Well the man was a bit disturbed by this, after all, the second ring seemed perfect to him. ""What is it,"" he thought, ""that could possibly be more wonderful than what I have here?"" That question haunted him for weeks until he came to a conclusion. He was used to working hard and he had all of eternity to save up, so he wanted, just once to see what he could possibly be missing in the first ring.

Fifty years later, he returned to the guards with a million dollars. When he stepped into the first ring he fell to his knees. The architecture was glorious and inhuman, and the bodyguard had turned into shining angels. To his surprise, someone helped him up off the street and when he looked, he realized he recognized who it was--it was the beggar he met in the fourth ring, adorned in a golden robe and glowing, and when he looked down at himself he realized he looked much the same.

The beggar laughed jovially. ""I got here only three years ago myself, but somehow I knew you would be right here behind me. I've come back to this gate every day waiting for you to make it in!"" Suddenly, the air was filled with the sound of angelic choirs and the beggar led the man off to a gigantic palace made of crystal and cloud. The room was filled with radiant citizens of the first circle and angels prepared everything. Sure enough, there was a line of massive altars against one wall, spilling over with glistening golden dragon meat, a pudding refined from clouds and dew and silk, and an ice cold tub of ambrosia and nectar ladled out individually into blindingly beautiful crystalline chalices. An angel fluttered from the ceiling and bowed silently to the assembled mass, who bowed respectfully back and then broke themselves into their lines on their own.

Smiling at the tradition, the beggar pointed to the first line. ""That's the line for the dragon meat,"" he said before turning to the next line, ""and that's the line for angeldust stew,"" then he paused, confused.

""What is it?"" the man asked his old friend.

The beggar replied, ""There appears to be no punchline.""",1432505338,"","False",1,543,"AskReddit"

We went to the ren fest together in costume - she went as a gypsy, I went in kilt, woad and sword - and spent the day drinking a looooot of wine. We came back to my place and kept drinking, and that's where she said she wanted to do some roleplaying. Whatever, I thought, we all have our thing, and I've never done it before.

I care about what death will do to the two of us here in this known existence.  I care about what it will do to the survivor of our pair.  I care about the known here.  We have three possibilities, my wife and I.  I die first, she dies first, we die together.

I love my wife.  I don't want her to be alone like her grandma is now.  It's painful to see.  She's not living, she's just going on after half of her died.

Sadly, that's not my biggest fear.  She's got some medical stuff going on that pretty much started with ""the big C"" at 14.  A lot of medical stuff, actually.  Not fatal now... we hope.  She just woke up with a petechial hemorrhage, and as of late she's been notably cognitively off, including driving on the wrong side of the road last week... please don't scare me with ""what ifs"" or Dr. Reddit diagnostics; we are seeing her amazing doctor, and we already know she has pseudotumor cerebri, that's probably/hopefully the culprit and not cancer or anything big again.  My wife probably won't outlive me.  I will likely be choosing the urn out of the two of us.  

I hope you don't understand how I feel.  Life is amazing, almost surreal, but I'm extra aware that it has an expiration date.  We aren't rich in money or health, but everywhere else we're just beyond a value that can fit within the context of this expression.

I'm afraid of *her* dying, and it's entirely for selfish reasons.  I'm afraid of life without her.  We've been in each other's lives since we were 5, best friends since before Highschool, firsts and only for everything (not religious, we just knew what we had from the start, and it only got progressively better ever since) and have been been together as a couple for over half our lives.  I'm not me without her.  I'm not *anyone* without her.  I couldn't stomach losing her, but I also don't want her to be alone.  

We don't have a typical life or marriage in any way, we have the kind of thing books and movies are written about.  There will be no replacement.  There is no other her in this life for me.  There never has been.

I'm hoping for a freak accident to kill us both at once.  I actually actively hope for that.  We both do.  In reality, it'll probably be her dying, and then me just ending it.  If we have kids as planned that'll be a whole different situation to figure out, though.  Holy crap I'm not even skimming that concept right now 

I don't want to die before her, but I don't want her to die before me.  I don't want to leave her on her own, but I don't see a future without her that I could accept.

Years ago, was hanging with friends, stopped for gas. Came up 10-cents short for the gas we had pumped (this was in the old days, when you could pump first, then pay). Luckily, a lady on the other side of the pump was kind enough to give us 10 cents.

We go about our evening, partying, having fun. Four hours later we're at a grocery store - middle of the night. At the checkout, we overhear some drama. The lady ahead of us wrote a check for her groceries, but misheard the amount, and her check was 10-cents short. 

What a coincidence, right? Hours earlier we were 10 cents short, now this lady is 10 cents short. We tell the cashier, ""Hey, we'll take care of her 10 cents."" 

And here's where it gets weird. The lady turns around to thank us, and *it was the same lady from the gas station*. The same one who had given us 10 cents four hours earlier.

In high school I was known for ""bottling"". A lot of people know how you can fill a water bottle about a third full of water, flip it in the air, and have it land back on its bottom. Well I took this to the extreme, I would try and flip my bottles up into the most extreme places (on top of light posts, beams in the gym, on the highest window ledges, etc). Better yet I would also color the water in the bottle orange. Soon everyone in my high school knew about this, and they started to recognize the orange water bottles everywhere. 

Before long a few other kids joined in using different colors and we would have competitions to see who could get their bottles where. It was almost like claiming territory in a sense. 

I got a few bottles in some extreme places, and rumor has it they are still there (I graduated 4 years ago). I might have pictures on my computer of a few but I still have to dig. Will update if I find them!

So Fred Phelps was a prolific Civil Rights attorney before he started the Westboro Baptist Church and took a bunch of heat for his work (his kids talk about how neighbors used to shoot out their car windows). So, what if one day Fred realizes that he's never going to get his community to come together and support his work. Instead, he decides that the best way to unite people is through hatred of him. So, he starts doing some of the most despicable things he can think of. He publicly abuses a nice woman in court and gets disbarred. He starts being a general dick, and everyone hates him. Then, he starts protesting in favor of things that he opposes. He starts protesting against the most estranged minorities: homosexuals, Muslims, and immigrants. He also gets political and protests mostly Democrats (note: he ran for Senate in a Democratic primary and won about 30% of the vote, and supported Al Gore before going publicly crazy). He also comes out as a supporter of Saddam Hussein. In the end, Fred Phelps takes the exactly wrong position on everything. What if, instead of being a ridiculously crazy person, he decided that he can have the greatest positive impact on civil rights and liberal causes by rallying people against him (in support of liberal causes)? He could never tip his hand because the game would be over. And he would have to occasionally do things that would make everyone mad so he is still a universally hated person.

"lowlyanonymity","","","Really hope this doesn't get buried because it's my favorite story to tell:

It's my senior spring of college. Classes are done, I'm set for graduation, and I have only a few weeks left of college before I am thrust out into the real world.  Needless to say, I was 'going hard', trying to soak up as much college as I could before I walk across the stage.

My friends and I are hosting a large party in a house that some of them live in.  The 'theme' is one you should be familiar with: Drinks Around the World.  If you haven't heard of it before, essentially, you set up various 'countries' around the house, each serving a different drink.  For example, Mexico might serve margaritas, America is normally budlight or some shit, etc.  Since Americans don't really know traditional drinks from that many countries, a lot of these wind up being bullshit.  For example, I was running the Columbia station, and we were just serving some drink we concocted in a 5-gallon jug using coffee, Kahlua, rum, and ground-up caffeine pills (yum).  We also had lines of caffeine powder lined up like lines of coke, to create a 'genuine' (read: border-line offensive/stereotypical) ambiance.  (sure, fake coke is lame, but do you really expect me to give out hundreds of dollars of coke at a party?)

So this station is all set up in the attic of the house, which has 4 floors and a basement in total (huge urban house, built 100 years ago).  I'm having a good time, eating caffeine pills like candy because why not, drinking, etc...  When someone offers me a research drug (one of those ones that's just a string of numbers and letters like  2ce or 25i).  Given the party-hard attitude I had adopted for my last quarter of college, I don't ask questions and rail it.  

A little later, we're all out of our coffee-drink (go figure) and everyone clears out of the attic to find drinks elsewhere.  I'm pretty fucked up, hanging out alone with a girl who I was vaguely seeing at the time.  She has some opiates, so we do those (I know this is dangerous to mix with other unknown substances...) and start casually making out.  Someone comes up the stairs, sees us, and freaks out a bit, saying ""Oh my god, sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt"".  

The girl and I thought this was hilarious, how uncomfortable that person had been with the sight of us kissing.  ""So"", our logic goes, ""If that's what someone does when we're making out...""

We take all of our clothes off and stand naked at the top of the stairs.  The initial plan is to hold hands and stare, straight-faced, at everyone who walks up until they leave.  This proved difficult to keep a straight face during, so instead we just stood there yelling/chanting/exclaiming 'THE BODY IS ART' at everyone.  Understand, I was at a level of inebriation that inhibited all my ability to feel shame, but at the same time was very ""up"".  

Folks had mixed reactions to this display. Some laughed, some fled, others sat and chatted for a second about our motivations here (all questions were answered with us repeating: ""the body is art"").  We were just about to call it quits, when one girl comes halfway up the stairs, hears/sees us, as says ""Oh my god, I love this.  You guys are so sex positive this is amazing.  Can I join?""  Perfect.  

""Yes, of course you can join.  Your body is art!""  I was trying really hard not to let on that we had zero social/political motivations, as this girl clearly thought we were making a statement.  She gets naked, and now there are three.  Chanting, yelling, being 'art'. 

The next two came quickly, two Indian guys who came up just as the second girl was taking her underwear off.  ""Uhhhh... what's going on?""

""Your body is art"" x 5

""okay"" *sits for 30 seconds, then slowly start getting naked*

It snowballed from there. Half an hour later, we had 25 people in the attic, 100% naked, yelling this totally arbitrary phrase, ""the body is art"".  Surprisingly, it was pretty evenly split between dudes and girls, and more surprisingly, no one tried to get creepy or sexual.  It was just a great, naked party in an attic.

Until, that is, a group of my friends decided that I was 'ruining the party' and 'degrading the house's reputation' such that no one would come to parties here anymore.  That's probably a fair point, but I was too fucked up and drunk off naked power to care.  We pushed on, drowning out their protests with our  chant.  Other hosts came to my aid, defending the fact that this was probably one of the funniest things to happen in this house for a while.  Then things got heated, and almost physical.  Luckily, my friends who were anti-nudity were also afraid to touch the naked mass of party-goers, so we were able to block them from coming up into the attic by clumping up near the stairs.

Eventually the naysayers retreated, but the mood was ruined.  Some people wanted to aggressively push the Body As Art display onto the rest of the party via a naked congo line, but that felt like too much.  Even on the substances I was on, I knew that a non-consensual naked congoline crossed all kinds of new boundries that I wasn't ready to deal with.  I told my all-natural congregation ""You are all beautiful.  All your bodies are art.  I am putting my clothes on and going home, but, as a host of this party, I encourage you all to do as you please with your body"".  The display dissipated shortly after, but the legend lives on.  I'd say all in all, somewhere around 200 people saw me naked that night.  That's not the most in this thread, but I like to think I made a strong impression.

I'm out of school now, but someone recently told me that the current residents of that house heard about the fiasco, and now call the attic the ""body is art room"".  This warms my heart.

TLDR: Did drugs, wanted to get a reaction out of people, wound up accidentally creating a performance art piece.

"whiteddit","","","I love telling this story, so I hope that this thread blows up. This wasn't OK Cupid - it was Tinder.

I've been texting a girl I matched with on Tinder. She's blonde and pretty cute. She's also studying dramatic writing, which I think is cool because I spend a lot of my free time writing. I'm still on the fence about meeting her, though.

On Friday night, she asks where I live. I tell her my neighborhood. She tells me that she lives in Brooklyn and that she's busy Friday night but will be in the city on Saturday night. Late Saturday night (around 1) she texts me and says that she's at a nearby bar.

The neighborhood I live in definitely has some fun bars, don't get me wrong, but it is one of the sketchier areas in the city. If you're taking the trouble to come to Manhattan from another borough, this isn't a neighborhood you go drinking in. I thought it was odd, but hey, a girl wants to see me.

I take a ten minute walk and get to the bar. The bouncer looks at my ID (an old one that still lists my age as ""Under 21,"" but most bouncers check my birth date and see that I'm legal) but doesn't let me in, which surprised me because I've been to this bar multiple times. Hindsight, serious blessing in disguise.

I walk out of the bar and text the girl something along the lines of ""Hey, bouncer won't let me in, not sure why. Have fun with your friend, we'll try another time."" I was indifferent about the whole thing - I was pretty tired and my roommates still had some friends in the apartment. She texts me and tells me to wait outside for a minute, so I do. The girl who comes out to greet me isn’t the girl whose pictures I’ve been looking at.

This girl is overweight and about six inches shorter than the girl in the picture. I’m already extremely uncomfortable. I try to tell her, “Hey, it’s nice to meet you in person, but don’t ditch your friend – we can go out another time.” She tells me “that’s okay” and just starts walking with me, completely abandoning whoever she was with.

We take about five steps away from the bar and she admits that she looked me up on facebook. Now I know that this is commonplace, but it’s not something that even occurred to me to do – it was just a casual meetup with someone from Tinder. I didn’t notice it, but she and I had two mutual friends. One was a girl I hadn’t really spoken to since freshman year (I’ve since graduated from college) and the other was a friend from middle school. She told me that she had asked them all about me, but believe it or not, they couldn’t tell her much. I’m getting a bit frightened. I don’t want to be completely rude, so I decide that I’ll at least try to talk to her for a little while. We end up on a bench outside a “park” near my apartment building. I sit down next to her and she immediately puts her head on my shoulder.

I don’t know what to do here, so I kind of lift my shoulder until she’s sitting upright again. She picks her head up, so I figure that she got the message. But then she turns around, lifts her legs over the arm of the bench and puts her head on my lap. I try to slide away from her, but she just keeps moving with me. I shift a little more and she turns and starts looking at me. I start to say “Hey…,” hoping that she’ll finally back off. Instead she starts nuzzling her head into my crotch.

It’s around 1:30 now. I tell her that “it’s kinda late, and your friend is still back at the bar, right?” She agrees to leave. I start to walk away, but she walks considerably more slowly than I do (presumably because I’m about a foot taller than her). Three blocks to go.

She then tries to hold my right hand. I gently shake it off and take my phone out of my pocket. I text my roommates and visiting friend: “She’s trying to hold my hand. Text me every twenty seconds so I can pretend to text you back.” None of them do. I assume they’re all laughing and trying to fuck me over.

It’s becoming clear to her that I won’t be putting my phone away, so she leaves my right side and walks to my left side. She couldn’t hold my right hand, so she thought she could hold my left. Luckily I saw this coming and buried my hand into my pocket. She ended up grabbing at air while I appeared to be frantically attempting to scratch my ankle through my pants leg. Two blocks to go.

She tells me that she’s working on her senior thesis, a sitcom pilot. I ask her what it’s about. She describes it as “a lot like Everybody Loves Raymond.” I’m thinking “okay, certainly not my favorite show but definitely still funny.” So I ask her to describe it.

“Well, it’s about a girl who drops out of school and moves to Hawaii to run a schnitzel cart.” I couldn’t even come up with a response. I can see the bar now. One block to go.

She asks me what my birthday was. I mumble that it’s September 19th. She stops walking, looks me right in the eye and says:

“September 19th is my lucky day.”

I can barely squeak out a terrified “why?” before she answers: 

“Because good things happen to me on September 19th.”

I whisper “Such as?” and she responds cheerily with:

“Well, I’ve never had a bad September 19th.” I wonder how on earth anyone could consider that grounds for their own lucky day. Doesn’t matter; the bar is across the street. The red hand on the crossing light is mocking me. Thirty seconds and it’s all over.

I peek down at her and find that she’s staring at me again. I look up once more and exhale in relief as I see the white guy on the sign ushering me forward. We walk across the street. I muster up my best “It was nice meeting you.” She goes in for a hug and I give her some sort of innovative half handshake/half pat on the back. I start to walk away when she says “Wait!” I turn around and she says “So, Tuesday, right?”

I jog back to my apartment and tiptoe past my sleeping friends.
Without taking off my coat or my shoes I sit down at my laptop and log into facebook. I find her and block her, then unfriended our mutual friends. I then blocked her on tinder and told myself that if she ever texted me again I would block her phone number.

A week goes by and things quiet down. I've told the story to my friends and we've all gotten a good laugh out of it. My roommate is going to his friend's housewarming party, so my other roommate and I decide to tag along. Lo and behold, guess who's at the party.

I see her before she sees me. She's sitting on a couch in the living room. I duck into the kitchen and fix myself a drink, out of her view. I mingle for a few minutes and try to figure out how I can avoid her (I have no choice but to walk right past her). No such luck.

She grabs me by the arm as I walk by, and asks ""Hey, can we talk?"" I can't exactly decline, so she leads me into a corner and starts talking to me.

""So I noticed you haven't texted me all week.""

""Sorry, I've been really busy at work lately.""

""Oh, okay. Do you want to meet up tomorrow? Or maybe go somewhere later?""

""I don't know...""

""Did I come on too strong?"" she asks.

""Yes. That's exactly it. It was just too much too fast, and I'm sorry. Maybe we can be friends.""

""Okay, I see how it is. I'm sorry I annoyed you so much.""

She looks like she's about to start crying, so I try to calm her down. The last thing I need is her making a scene. ""It's really okay, I'm not *mad* or anything.""

Tears start streaming down her face. People have stopped talking and I can tell that everyone is staring at me. She's practically screaming at this point. *""Well, if you're not mad, can I ask you for something?!""* 

I can feel my cheeks reddening. I ask her calmly and quietly - ""What do you need?"" 

""I need about tree fiddy.""

Only then did I realize that this girl was about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era. That damned Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again. ""Dammit Monster, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!"" I yelled as she swam away into the distance.

I swear to God that this is a true story. Except for the tree fiddy, all of this actually happened. I just figured that this detailed, infamous personal anecdote was also my best chance to trick people.

TL;DR - I got catfished on Tinder and publicly shamed at a party.

"NOT_A_REAL_COP","","","So this one time a few years back I was doing roadside random breath testing on the side of a major road in my city. It was 3 am on a saturday, which is normally a great quota filler for us.

So I pull someone over, and its this incredibly hot chick. Great body, great face, etc. Course, some dude is in the passenger seat with her - I guess her bf? When we pulled her over, he starts freaking out. My partner and I tell him to step out of the car, because we think he's tweaking hard. He does, but then he punches my partner and makes a run for it. Someone tackles him to the ground, but he's a slippery fucker and gets out of it before running into the bushes. Aight, whatever.

I turn back this girl - let's call her Anne for the sake of nomenclature - and give her the breathalyser. She blows over, but we're flirting and hitting it off so I let her off with a warning - bad, I know, but hey, my libido was doing my thinking for me. She tells me to swing by hers when my shift ends. You know, with that look.

My shift ends a few hours later and I head to her house. I see that the door has been busted open, and the place is trashed. I draw my gun and head in, and she's been knocked out bleeding everywhere. She tells me it was her boyfriend, who was in the car with her, and lapses out of consciousness as I call the ambos.

When she next regains consciousness she's having horrible memory loss. ""What happened?"" she slurs.
""Annie,"" I say, ""are you okay, are you okay, Annie,

"Lapras_Rider","","","It was taking care of my dog who underwent renal failure as a complication of diabetes. He was diagnosed with diabetes around the summer of 2013 and since then, he was being given insulin shots each morning and evening. The same year, he went completely blind. Luckily, a family member had saved up some money so our dog can get his vision back. After the surgery, different eyedrops were given to him morning and night so this was added to my routine. Throughout this time, he had Pancreatitis a few times as well as bladder infections. When this happens, giving antibiotics are added to my routine. Then, the summer of last year, he became sick again and renal failure started setting in. I changed his diet and the preparation is a bitch! Each time I prepare my dogs' food (including his) takes about 10 minutes. Anyway, around November was the time when he started being fatigued all the time. I changed his diet once more and he started receiving IV fluids twice a day. Once again, this was added to my daily routine. During the times he was sick, he would be resting for a long time; every time, he pulls off and gets better. This last one though, he showed signs of getting better but he never fully recovered. Early this year, we realized that his body was finally giving up. The day I was dreading came up suddenly but we knew we had to do it. After keeping my dog alive (and arguably prolonging his life) for some time, we had to make him get a fully-deserved rest. I won't go into details on that one since I don't want to cry but let me just say that my family and I grieved in our own ways.

Anyway, what I love the most was doing all those tasks for my dog. I found myself having to go home early at times to feed my dogs as well as to play with them but when (one of) my dog got sick, I made it a point to stick to a schedule. Giving his meds at different times as well as the preparation of the food can be annoying as heck as it takes away a ton of my time. However, after I finish each time, I feel relieved knowing my dog's needs were met. Instead of getting pissed off for all those times I was ""wasting,"" I learned instead to become efficient so I wasn't wasting as much time. I never got any rewards for doing everything I did except the nose bumps I receive from him, the greetings I get with a wagging tail whenever I get home, the playful barks he does when we play, and at night, the warmth of his body on my feet when I sleep. Now that he is resting, I will never be able to see him again, hear his barks, feel his warmth, nor enjoy his company. I lost my sidekick and I am sad. Now that he's gone, my routine went back to normal. I am no longer being bothered by the time consumption of preparing his food or giving his meds. In a sense, my routine is easier now. However, this comfort is something I never asked for. I don't care if I had to be bothered for a long time as long my dog is with me.

He proceeds to drag in this box containing an unassembled vacuum, dumps it out and then stares at it for a solid 10 minutes. Picks up a piece or two and then puts them back down. 
I get bored and go grab a soda. I walk back in with it and his face lights up ""Aw shit man THANKS. I'm so fuckin thirsty, dawg"" while holding out his hand. I reluctantly give it to him and go to the kitchen for another.

I come back and find this dude racked the fuck out on my sofa. Head back, mouth open, soda in hand, full-on sleep apnea demo in progress. I guess he somehow managed to get himself into REM 3 in the time it took me to walk to the fridge and back because I could *not* wake him. I screamed, shouted, shook and stomped to no avail. 

So, I dig through his stuff and find the card of the guy who dropped him off and call him, explaining the situation. After expressing zero surprise about the predicament, he shows up ten minutes later. He walks in, stands over him for a minute, screams ""DANTE YOU SLEEPY FUCK"" and bitch slaps the shit out of this guy. Dante calmly sits up, cracks open the soda and takes a swig while declaring that the instructions for assembling the vacuum are ""straight up bullshit, bro"" as he's being shuffled out the door.

"asilvermtzion","","","A little off topic but, a long time ago, I helped construct a ""textural/sensory garden"" for profoundly disabled kids. Most were blind, many were also deaf, all had mobility and cognitive impairments... The place was a hospice for kids that couldn't survive at all without constant medical attention, and wouldn't survive long even with it.

It was hard to tell if they understood that they were specifically being introduced to new experiences, that the intention was to bring them a little happiness or satisfaction, but they embraced the experiences and it appeared to do them some good emotionally. At the very least, it brought some comfort to their families who were also in need of support and care... To see their child, grandchild or sibling engage with the world and perhaps enjoy and explore it in some small capacity.

The kids all seemed to love rougher textures, the items with more nuance and complexity to them, like tree barks, ferns and gravels. I guess there's more to explore with these textures, they're just intrinsically more interesting. But they all responded to most natural stimulus that we perhaps take for granted, like rain falling on their faces, warm sunlight, a breeze ruffling their hair. Cool, dry sand also seemed to be popular. I find that cathartic also, I think that's just human nature to find burying your hands or feet in cool sand relaxing somehow. And most of them, when a therapy dog was brought in, would happily brush, hold, or just touch, the dog's fur indefinitely.

"Flying_Burrito_Bro","","","[Terror Management Theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terror_management_theory)

Everything that humanity has ever accomplished beyond basic survival has been motivated by a fundamental and irreducible fear of non-existence. Our conception of self and self-esteem generally is simply a buffer against the anxiety that comes with recognizing that we will cease to be. Culture is just a massive shared delusion to mitigate our fear of the unknown and ultimately of death. Thus we want to imagine certain works of art as timeless or to place value in family lines and offspring, to project ourselves beyond death. We take comfort in our value systems and the structures that arise from them, whether that's through conceptions of biological kinship, national/ political identity, religious faith, etc. This includes belief in the inherent value of ensuring the future of humanity through scientific progress. Indeed much of modern western life is devoted to the avoidance of death, the various euphemisms and stock phrases in mourning, the entire funeral home industry that serves to remove death from the ordinary course of life, from the home and onto the embalming table or into the crematorium. We build up the artifice to avoid the brutal reality. 

       There are no turtles at the bottom-- it's nothingness all the way down. 

TL;DR: Everything that we've ever done and will ever do is motivated by nothing more than our existential terror in confronting death. 

EDIT1: I really appreciate the gold-- To counter the bleakness, I need to clarify that this isn't necessarily my worldview, and it's certainly not my favorite pet theory. It offers an answer to a fundamental ""why"" so that we can focus on the far, far more important and far, far more interesting questions regarding meaning-making, value creation, cultural development... lived existence itself. This theory doesn't have to be a conversation stopper. In fact, it should be a springboard into fine tuned discussions about the things that make us human without getting bogged down in the navel gazing big picture questions.

Also, many have pointed out that this theory owes a great debt to the philosopher [Ernest Becker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Becker) and his Pulitzer winning work [The Denial of Death] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Denial_of_Death)


Finally, if you're deeply troubled by this theory and its potential implications, I've been offering this quote as a sort of affirmation of the human spirit:

""If I were dropped out of a plane into the ocean and told the nearest land was a thousand miles away, I'd still swim. And I'd despise the one who gave up.""
Abraham Maslow 

Leave your little mark on the world even if you're staring down the barrel. That's what it means to be human. 

EDIT2: Yes, this is basically a soft science approach to 100 years of existential continental philosophy, especially Kierkegaard bleeding into Heidegger and Wittgenstein, then post-modernism, Camus especially. Also, words of wisdom from the Mountain Goats-- [Just stay alive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ7pEL92qho)

EDIT3: I've truly appreciated the great discussions that this post has sparked, much to the detriment of my work tonight. Several folks with far more knowledge about this theory than me are posting in the thread below. Check it out.

"gohelp","","","Current heroin addict here. My parents broke up when I was a year old leaving me to live with my grandmother. This lead to me having almost no self esteem and in a state of what I would call total depression. 
When I hit 12 I began to also hit puberty I became the taller, overweight, pimple faced, screech voiced kid of my school. Now of course this left me with no self and with no self esteem I didn't have the balls to stand up to the energy vultures that are bullies. I was bullied so badly in school that during my 5 grade year I missed literally every Tuesday just to avoid a bully. The reason I called them every vultures was because they sucked every drop of life I had within me, I became depressed and just decided to stop doing anything outside of school which is still the only thing that gets me out of the house. 

Moving into highschool I began to use marijuana everyday LITERALLY and still do from the last day of my 8th grade yr I have smoked every day. I became a dealer and soon met other people in the drug scene of my town. I soon found opiates through a friend who had some Oxycotin. One weekend we met up and smoked around 75mgs each. For the first time in my life I felt like everything was okay and oh the warmth, the brightness that covered me. I.WAS.HOOKED. This was where opiates started to take over my life. 

Eventually after i began itching for something stronger I found a supply for heroin and began to smoke and sometimes snort when I was too high to walk around the corner to the store to get a lighter. My grandmother found two ounces and around a gram of H in my room she questioned me about it and told my mom. My mom became a little but more involved in my life but not for the better. She threatens me with cops and tells me of how one day I'm going to overdose. Like I don't know that, I'm not stupid I know the dangers I just don't care matter of fact I plan on dying very early.
PRESENT DAY: Tomorrow I have school I'll wake up at 5 shoot up and smoke a bowl or two and head to school at 7:30. At 8 when I arrive at school I'll head to a restroom and shoot up in the school stall go to my first class and go to sleep even though it's my only class. 

I have no friends my contacts on my phone are just filled with people I sell to and family. I have tried so hard at life but I just can't seem to it in anywhere and I will be homeless this summer as my grandmother doesn't want me in her house anymore even though she loves me with all her soul and that's pretty much where I'll be in a few weeks when I graduate.

I hoe If anyone of you out there are have just started using heroin or feel down about yourself please I'm pleading with you stop using and know that my cosmic energy loves you with all my might I love you no matter size, personal problems, color, appearance etc. I hope you have the strength to go on FOR ME.

EDIT 2: Something something Great Scott of Scoot my First Gold! And its for the division of all the states....Im on a list somewhere now.
""I'll go over the entire national landscape

New England would all join up together with Boston because they all wish they lived there anyway. NH, VT, ME, RI, and MA would all join together willingly. The smaller New England states know they can't take on anyone else by themselves so, as with sports, allying their collective powers is the only way to be a contender.

NYC would secede from the Albany based government and definitely take over at least parts of Connecticut, parts of New Jersey immediately over the Hudson, and New York state suburbs to form its own protectorate. Easter/Northeastern connecticut would likely become a battleground between NYC and the New England state. I could see some fights and clashing occurring, but the two sides are both too pragmatic to allow such differences to interfere with the running of their respective regions and break out into full on war.

Upstate NY would probably just join Canada or remain barren. Parts might break off to join the New England State, but frankly there's not a lot to be desired in upstate NY except Buffalo, a few indian res casinos, and crippling poverty.

New Jersey would lose a few Hudson river municipalities to NY, but for the most part would remain intact, but split into North and South Jersey. There would be a civil war between the two as they both hate each other. People in Central Jersey would be upset about it and try to form their own coalition but fail. Much like in the civil war, the North is much bigger and better funded in this case and would probably win.

Pennsylvania would break up into an east and west contingent. Philly would dominate one area (it would pick up pieces of NJ like Camden and Cherry Hill), while Pittsburgh would dominate the Western portion. Harrisburg isn't big enough to stand against both powers so it would have to choose a side. There is enough dead area between the two that there wouldn't be any major conflicts though. Pieces of West Virginia would also join the Western Pennsylvania contingent

Ohio would be roughly the same, although I can envision a lot of infighting between the various major cities. Ohio knows that its collective power is contingent on remaining together (if election season taught them anything), but the Cleveland v. Cincinnati v. Columbus v. Akron v. Dayton v. Toledo rivalry would dominate the political landscape. None is dominant so it would definitely be ripe for a long lasting political battle.

An appalachian state would likely form composed of most of Kentucky (with the exception of some western portions), Southern Indiana, parts of southern Ohio, parts of southeastern Illinois, eastern Virginia, and most of West Virginia. These states know they can't survive on their own and so teaming up and utilizing the joint agricultural and mining resources of the region would be critical. Large borders and low population density would make it somewhat difficult to defend the Western portion of the region but West Virginia is a coal mining stalwart and very mountainous (as well as well armed).

Delaware would be partitioned between South Jersey, Philly, and Maryland; unless some kind of massive corporate army rose up to defend the state as a tax haven (unlikely). Perhaps the most interesting question is whether maryland would stand alone with Baltimore as its epicenter of join up with DC. Seeing as how most people in Maryland think Baltimore is kind of shit, the latter would probably occur. After all they even share an airport a lot of the time, and most people in DC live in Maryland. A Chesapeake state composed of DC proper, Maryland, parts of delaware, and the immediate Arlington/Fairfax/Alexandria DC suburbs would form. This would be a super powerful state containing the entire US national security apparatus, which would give it license to expand pretty far into Virginia all the way out until Richmond.

Richmond would then form another distinct Virginian state without much national identity. Richmond is kind of an ambiguous area, so eventually it would be dominated (small size, large neighbor) or merge with another state.

North Carolina would form a distinct state, as I've found North Carolina residents consider themselves very distinct from Virginia and South Carolina. An interesting thought would pertain to how North Carolina and Tennessee interacted, as I could easily see a distinct Eastern Tennessee/North Carolina state, but I could also see three powers forming between the two states, namely one Memphis state, one Nashville-Knoxville-Ashville state, and one Charlotte-Raleigh state. That could get diced up any way you like. Note that no matter how you dice it, the Northern portions of Alabama and Mississippi (as well as Eastern Arkansas) are getting absorbed into those powers.

Georgia, South Carolina, and Northern Florida would form one large Southeastern state. The three regions are roughly analogous and share many of the same values, traditions, cuisines, etc. It would be a very large power in the Southeast and probably have a dominant sway over the region by geography and size.

The remainders of Alabama and Mississippi would combine together and join a Southern Louisiana/New Orleans state. They would have killer food, large fishing exports/market share.

Texas could go one of two ways: 1) stay united and begin to dominate the region as a superpower. It would absorb Oklahoma, the remainder of Arkansas which hasn't already been diced up between Memphis, Missouri, and New Orleans; most of New Mexico, parts of Southern Colorado and Kansas, and even pieces of Mexico. This would be a truly massive and well armed state. Lots of army and air force bases, well trained populace, etc. 2) break up into city states. Houston, San Antonio, El Paso, and Dallas-Forth Worth would all break off on their own. San Antonio would dominate Southern and South-Central Texas. Dallas would take Northern Texas, Oklahoma, and parts of Arkansas. Houston would carve out its corner of Southeastern Texas. El Paso would take the barren wasteland of western Texas and large swaths of New Mexico. There would be a lot of fighting between Houston and its neighbors by geography. It is simply pressed up against Dallas, San Antonio, and New Orleans, all of which are pretty big powers.

Missouri would split down the middle between Kasnas City and St Louis. Each would absorb pieces of their surrounding states, include Arkansas going between both of them, Central Illinois going to St Louis, and Kansas City fighting with Dallas over Kansas.

Michigan would split between the peninsula and mainland, with the mainland absorbing some of Indiana until it came to bump up against Chicago's influence. 

Chicago would carve out Northern illinois, Northern Indiana, and parts of Iowa.

Central Indiana would form up around Indianapolis, be a farming power, and not really have much to do with its neighbors (it isn't a warring state for sure).

Milwaukee would definitely form its own state and control Wisconsin while warring against Chicago. The states are both very close and that would be a source of tension/rivalry for sure.

Minneapolis-Des Moines-Omaha would form a state. Omaha and Des Moines are too small to survive on their own, and maybe Des Moines goes to Chicago but Minneapolis is a large enough city to protect those regions from the big bad city. It is unlikely that Des Moines would prefer Chicago over Minneapolis for that reason. Nebraska, likewise, is too small to stand alone but also very far from other powers so would likely have time to have a say in its future rather than getting taken over. This would be a massive but very underrated power. It would control Nebraska, Iowa, Minnesota, parts of Western Wisconsin, and North and South Dakota. There would be massive agricultural stores from Nebraska and Iowa as well as significant oil from the Dakotas and other mining resources from Minnesota. All paired with Minnesota's industrial capacity (center of industrial giant 3M and others). This region would also be home to the largest portion of American nuclear weapons of any of the regions I have identified, giving them security from threat of any other state. This would basically be the great Northern state and probably the strongest in the entire picture. But given the sensibilities of the region, they would probably not actively invade their neighbors (Chicago is a whole mess of problems anyway).

Colorado would join up with most of Wyoming to form a mountainous state. Colorado would lose some landmass to an expanding Texas (if it remained a single Texan state. Otherwise this state again has great natural geographic protection and significant military power (USAF centered in Colorado, NORAD, and nuclear weapons). Food (mostly grain) might become an issue, though there are significant livestock reserves in the region.

Utah would remain is own state due to its very unique cultural elements and Mormon tradition. They are also an industrious people and would probably be able to preserve themselves from attack and prosper.

Northwestern Wyoming (Yellowstone/Teton area), Idaho, and Montana would all form up into one state. Again, a relatively innocuous pairing of geographically and culturally similar states. With Montana, this state would once again benefit from having nukes but likely be too benign to use them aggressively. Idaho potatoes would abound, Montana has large cattle and livestock numbers, so this would be another agricultural giant.

I made the terrible mistake of calling out some of the moderators for not enforcing their own rules, and abusing their power to ask for monetary help for themselves and their family members.  The sub is frequently visited by scam artists who take advantage of the generosity of Redditors, but you aren't allowed to question anyone or the head moderator will delete your comments and ban you, lol. 

Last month there was a guy pretending to be a ""homeless"" vet asking for $30,000. The head moderator personally vouched for the guy and encouraged folks to donate towards the goal. Turns out the guy was not disabled, lying about his name, his medical condition, etc. Did the head moderator publicly admit he was wrong and warn others not to get scammed? Nope. He just deleted the post and pretended it never happened.

INT. THE WAR ROOM - NIGHT

*We see a group of high-ranking military members seated around a large table. They are joined by world leaders from several different countries, including the PRESIDENT of the United States.*

**PRESIDENT:** Gentlemen... Madam Prime Minister... thank you all for being here this evening. As you all know, we are on the brink of global annihilation. The simple truth of the matter is that we cannot survive another World War.

*A slender man in a grey uniform stands up. This is the COMMANDANT. He speaks with a smooth, almost sinister accent.*

**COMMANDANT:** Mister President. We are all in agreement that a World War would be catastrophic. That is not why we are here. We are here to discuss solutions.    

*Another man, this one in a white overcoat, stands up. This is the PROFESSOR.*

**PROFESSOR:** Indeed. I am here with the Commandant to propose what we hope shall be an agreeable outcome. We have developed...    
**PRESIDENT:** (*Interrupting*) Oh, whatever. Nerd.    
**COMMANDANT:** You would do well to hear our suggestions, Mister President.    
**PRESIDENT:** And what would you suggest, Joe?

*The COMMANDANT looks uncomfortable. A few of the assembled members chuckle.*

**COMMANDANT:** I have asked you not to call me that.    
**PRESIDENT:** Yeah, but ""Johanson"" just reminds me of that actress girl.    
**COMMANDANT:** If the American government is unprepared to take these proceedings seriously, my country will have no option but to withdraw from these talks!    
**PRESIDENT:** Yeah, you guys know all about ""pulling out.""

*Another chuckle is heard from around the table, although nobody is entirely sure what the PRESIDENT is actually referencing. A third individual stands up. She is a stocky woman with a no-nonsense expression on her face. This is the PRIME MINISTER.*

**PRIME MINISTER:** Boys. Settle down *right now*.    
**COMMANDANT:** He started it!    
**PRESIDENT:** Did not! It was only a joke.    
**PRIME MINISTER:** I don't care who started it! I'm ending it!

*A collective gasp is heard from the room.*

**PRIME MINISTER:** Not like *that*. Calm down.    
**COMMANDANT:** I will not calm down! It just so happens that my country has developed a devastating weapon, and we are prepared to use it if provoked!

*The PROFESSOR steps forward and whispers something in the COMMANDANT's ear.*

**PRESIDENT:** (*Muttering*) I bet it's your stupid face.    
**COMMANDANT:** *That does it!*

*The COMMANDANT launches himself at the PRESIDENT, pinning him to the table.*

**COMMANDANT:** Prepare for a demonstration!    
**PRESIDENT:** No, no! Wait! Please!

*The COMMANDANT grabs the PRESIDENT by his wrists, then forces the PRESIDENT to smack himself in the face.*

**COMMANDANT:** Stop hitting yourself! *Stop hitting yourself!*
