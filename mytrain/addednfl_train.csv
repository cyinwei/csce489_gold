&gt; ""I would like to thank my family, friends, the Browns organization, my teammates, and Browns fans everywhere, for your patience, understanding, and support during my stay at Caron. The doctors and staff have been amazing and what I’ve learned in the last couple of months has been tremendous. I owe private apologies to a lot of people that I disappointed but a very public one to the Browns organization and the fans that I let down. I take full responsibility for my actions and it’s my intention to work very hard to regain everyone’s trust and respect. I understand that will take time and will only happen through what I do and not what I say. I also understand there’s a lot of curiosity about this but anyone who has a friend or family-member that’s been through things like this knows it’s an ongoing process. I’m going to continue to ask folks to try to respect my privacy as I determine to what degree I am comfortable talking about a subject which I consider very personal. Most of you have been considerate about that and I thank you for it. I look forward to seeing my teammates next week and focusing on football and my desire to be the best possible player, teammate, and man that I can be.""

TheFencingCoach,buccaneers,Buccaneers,"**T/E Stunt Play:**

1 and 2 - J.J. Watt's mission is to absorb two blockers on the outside (Martin and Free) to open the B gap for Brooks Reed to break inside. By the time Martin disengages from Watt, just a second too late, he realizes that Reed has a clear path to Romo. 

3 - Note that the Demarco Murray lined up behind LG has his eyes locked down field. It seems he misses an ample opportunity to engage Reed with at least a chip block to impede his pass rush. Instead, Murray is unaware of the threat to Romo as his eyes are locked down field (perhaps looking for an open passing lane). 

Additional thoughts: Martin realizes that Reed is going to break inside just a moment too soon, thinking that both Watt and Reed are going to bull rush from the outside. 

Excellent play goes to Brooks Reed here for masking his rush, Watt for absorbing two blockers with ease. 

Extra laps go to Demarco Murray for lack of awareness, and perhaps Martin for reacting to Reed just a moment too late.

the_termenater,falcons,Falcons,"Lets do some math:

The NFL rules state that a ball must be inflated to a pressure between 12.5 PSI and 13.5 PSI for a game.

Now lets assume that the patriots were inflating their balls to the bare minimum of 12.5 PSI because they knew that would make them easier to catch during the game. This was most likely done inside the locker room, because of the rain during the game. Now, with 50+ NFL players in the locker room, it is not unlikely that the temperature could rise to 90 degrees or higher inside the room. From various sources, the volume of an NFL football is ~4.24L. Now for the math:

The ideal gas law is a pretty basic concept:

Pv=nRT, where P is pressure in atm, v is volume in liters, n is mols of gas, R is the gas constant of .082 atm*L/mol*K, and T is temperature in Kelvin.

12.5 PSI converts to about .851 atm=P

V=4.24L

n=?

R=0.082

T=90f=305K

First we solve for n, the number of mols of gas which will not change with the temperature:


.851 x 4.24=n x .082 x 305


We find that n=.1441 mols

Now, the temperature of the game was in the mid 40s (assume 45F)

If we alter the equation for the change in temperature, this time solving for pressure we get:

P x 4.24=.1441 x .082 x 280

Solve for P, and you will get a pressure of .781 atm, which is equilvalent to 11.475 PSI. That is over 1 PSI less than the NFL requires, which can cause the ball to feel deflated. Some balls may have lost air over the course of the game as well.

However, a slight disclaimer: Although the ball may have had less pressure due to the temperature, the mols of gas would remain the same as would the weight of the ball. If the referees found the weight of the ball to be insufficient then it was likely not caused by a temperature difference.

EDIT: Another point that I see being made is that there are much colder games played all of the time and that this never happens then. However, the moderately cold temperature and rainy conditions of this game are the perfect conditions for this to become an issue: in extremely cold weather the leather of the ball can harden up and feel harder than normal, making it harder to notice any deflation. Also, the rainy conditions of this game probably helped in softening the leather, adding to the pliability of the ball which would also make the deflation more noticeable. Interesting stuff!

guga31bb,seahawks,Seahawks,"Did anyone actually read the article? There are a lot of interesting points brought up but all the comments in here are just lame jokes about the game. It's a shame because everyone always complains about how bad the discussion here is leading up to the game but when someone actually posts great analysis, it's a comment graveyard.

Anyway, parts I found interesting:

On how GB's tight ends were not very good at run blocking and why Gronk makes a big difference:

&gt;*Quarless totally whiffs on his block; not committing fully to cutting Avril but instead sheepishly kneeling as if discovering a rogue quarter on the turf. This allows Avril to block the cutback lane.* [...] *Quarless is standing straight up and has no leverage while Bennett puts his shoulder into Quarless’ numbers and drives through his gap. Lacy stutter-steps as if he wants to cut back but plows ahead knowing he needs two yards and Bennett is going to be diving at his heels. After this point in the game Richard Rodgers got the majority of snaps at tight end. He fared better than Andrew Quarless but overall the run-blocking by the tight ends of the Packers was less than stellar in this game. The Seahawks will now face probably the best run-blocking tight end in the game right now in Rob Gronkowski.*

On Gronk as a receiving threat:

&gt;*This sequence of plays gives us some small insight into how the Seahawks are willing to match up with tight ends aligned to the outside of the formation. Although I doubt the Seahawks would leave Gronk in single coverage with no help over the top, expect the Patriots to use Gronkowski’s alignment to create favorable match-ups for not only him but for the other receivers. For instance, if New England was to use the same formation as the Packers used it would be much more risky for the Seahawks to shade their safeties so far to the strong side. This could potentially create openings for the receivers on the other side of the formation.*

Wrapping up:

&gt;*In the end, however, this game is going to come down to the individual match-ups. The Seahawks are one of the most talented and well-coached teams in football. They force a team to play their absolute best in order to beat them. What we saw in the NFC Championship was that despite a well-aimed attack the Packers were unable to consistently win one-on-one battles all over the field and, in the grimmest end, it cost them.*",1422646320,,False,0,17,nfl,True,False,422,0,Afternoon,0-20,0,0,"{u'probability': {u'neg': 0.6434657779920435, u'neutral': 0.18644186606081706, u'pos': 0.3565342220079565}, u'label': u'neg'}",0.643465777992,0.356534222008,0.186441866061,neg,"{u'tone_categories': [{u'category_id': u'emotion_tone', u'tones': [{u'tone_name': u'Anger', u'score': 0.199862, u'tone_id': u'anger'}, {u'tone_name': u'Disgust', u'score': 0.169405, u'tone_id': u'disgust'}, {u'tone_name': u'Fear', u'score': 0.426393, u'tone_id': u'fear'}, {u'tone_name': u'Joy', u'score': 0.129808, u'tone_id': u'joy'}, {u'tone_name': u'Sadness', u'score': 0.498644, u'tone_id': u'sadness'}], u'category_name': u'Emotion Tone'}, {u'category_id': u'language_tone', u'tones': [{u'tone_name': u'Analytical', u'score': 0.846305, u'tone_id': u'analytical'}, {u'tone_name': u'Confident', u'score': 0.0, u'tone_id': u'confident'}, {u'tone_name': u'Tentative', u'score': 0.282391, u'tone_id': u'tentative'}], u'category_name': u'Language Tone'}, {u'category_id': u'social_tone', u'tones': [{u'tone_name': u'Openness', u'score': 0.63335, u'tone_id': u'openness_big5'}, {u'tone_name': u'Conscientiousness', u'score': 0.219845, u'tone_id': u'conscientiousness_big5'}, {u'tone_name': u'Extraversion', u'score': 0.280981, u'tone_id': u'extraversion_big5'}, {u'tone_name': u'Agreeableness', u'score': 0.034748, u'tone_id': u'agreeableness_big5'}, {u'tone_name': u'Emotional Range', u'score': 0.773836, u'tone_id': u'emotional_range_big5'}], u'category_name': u'Social Tone'}]}",0.199862,0.169405,0.426393,0.129808,0.498644,0.846305,0.0,0.282391,0.63335,0.219845,0.280981,0.034748,0.773836

rdogg1026,jets,Jets,"1) - **Jameis Winston - Tampa Bay Buccaneers (2-14)**

COLLEGE: Florida State

Class: Soph

HT: 6-4

WT: 235

POS: QB

Analysis: The Bucs don't currently have a franchise quarterback on their roster, and while both of the top two QB prospects in this year's class carry with them significant risks (along with considerable talent and upside), it could be tough for them to pass on both. If you factor in only on-field performance, Winston should be the No. 1 choice. He beats opponents from the pocket with very good accuracy, arm strength and anticipation, and his on-field intangibles and leadership are positives as well. The concerns with Winston obviously have to do with his off-field behavior, and any team that drafts him is going to have to trust him enough from a character and psychological standpoint to make him the face of its franchise. That's a big risk, but NFL teams know that they can't win consistently without good quarterback play. And the Bucs could decide that Marcus Mariota's need to transition from Oregon's up-tempo spread offense to the NFL represents an even greater risk -- albeit in a very different way. 


2) - **Leonard Williams - Tennessee Titans (2-14)**

COLLEGE: USC

Class: Jr

HT: 6-5

WT: 290

POS: DE


Analysis: Williams is the complete package -- he can two-gap as a run-stuffer, but he can also penetrate and make plays against both the pass and the run. He'd make Jurrell Casey even better by drawing more double-teams and allowing Casey to do what he does best: use quickness to establish positioning, and disrupt. Having two studs in Williams and Casey on the defensive front would provide a boost for a team that ranked 31st in the league in rushing yards per game allowed last season. The Titans have a huge need at QB and would have to consider Marcus Mariota here, but he's a risk despite his big-time upside because of his lack of experience at consistently throwing with anticipation and accuracy from the pocket at Oregon. 


3) - **Randy Gregory - Jacksonville Jaguars (3-13)**

COLLEGE: Nebraska

Class: Jr

HT: 6-6

WT: 245

POS: DE


Analysis: The Jags' biggest need is at right tackle, and they are looking for competition along their entire offensive line, but there isn't an offensive tackle in this class worth drafting at No. 3 overall. Gregory is a good fit, however. They need a young pass-rusher (Chris Clemons is 33), and Gregory is one of the most explosive edge rushers in this class. He needs to continue to add bulk and strength to his lean frame, but he has the length, violent hands and closing burst to get home off the edge. 


4) - **Amari Cooper - Oakland Raiders (3-13)**

COLLEGE: Alabama

Class: Jr

HT: 6-1

WT: 205

POS: WR


Analysis: The Raiders have to provide second-year QB Derek Carr with more weapons. (James Jones is the top receiver on Oakland's roster right now.) Cooper, West Virginia's Kevin White and Louisville's Devante Parker are the best WR prospects in this class and the only ones who legitimately belong in the top-20 discussion, and Cooper is our favorite of the bunch. He was absolutely dominant in 2014 despite facing top defensive competition in the SEC and dealing with inconsistent play from Bama QB Blake Sims. He has excellent savvy as a route runner, good acceleration vertically and he does a terrific job of pulling down 50-50 balls. 


5) - **Shane Ray - Washington Redskins (4-12)**

COLLEGE: Missouri

Class: Jr

HT: 6-2

WT: 240

POS: DE


Analysis: The Redskins need a pass-rusher -- often-injured ROLB Brian Orakpo is a free agent and not expected to return -- and Ray is a terror off the edge. He is relentless at pressuring the quarterback, combining outstanding first-step quickness, effective hands and impressive redirect skills. He also continues to get stronger versus the run and has bulked up into the 250-pound range. He was incredibly productive at Mizzou, finishing fifth in the FBS with 13 sacks last season. This is another spot where Mariota could come under consideration, but I've got Washington addressing its defense here. 


6) - **Marcus Mariota - New York Jets (4-12)**

COLLEGE: Oregon

Class: Jr

HT: 6-4

WT: 211

POS: QB


Analysis: Mariota could slide even further than this on draft day, but I think this pick makes sense for the Jets given their need at QB and the presence of Chan Gailey at offensive coordinator. Gailey can adapt his scheme to any QB and has a history with spread-formation offenses, so he's capable of providing Mariota with a smooth transition to the NFL from his up-tempo spread system at Oregon. Mariota has rare athleticism for the QB position (including prototypical size) and outstanding intangibles, but his one area of concern -- consistently being able to win from the pocket -- is the most important trait you need to succeed at the NFL level. So how a team caters its approach to him and develops him as an accurate passer from the pocket will be critical. 


7) - **Danny Shelton - Chicago Bears (5-11)**

COLLEGE: Washington

Class: Sr

HT: 6-5

WT: 332

POS: DT

Analysis: It's unclear what scheme new head coach John Fox and new defensive coordinator Vic Fangio plan to run in Chicago -- my guess is they'll use something of a hybrid front -- but if they plan to play any 3-4, they'll need some capable bodies. Lamarr Houston and Will Sutton are best at penetrating and disrupting, and their strongest point-of-attack D-lineman, Stephen Paea, is a free agent. Shelton would provide a versatile, big body along the interior, as he commands double-teams against the run and can push the pocket as a pass-rusher. Arik Armstead is another option here, and the Bears also need help at safety and linebacker. But what will they do at the QB position? 

8) - **Arik Armstead - Atlanta Falcons (6-10)**

COLLEGE: Oregon

Class: Jr

HT: 6-7

WT: 285

POS: DE

Analysis: The Falcons need to improve on defense, especially with their pass rush. D-linemen Kroy Biermann and Osi Umenyiora are both free agents. Armstead was a 5-technique defensive end at Oregon and could play a similar role in the NFL, but he's also explosive enough to be a great fit as a left defensive end in new Atlanta head coach Dan Quinn's scheme -- similar to the role that Michael Bennett played for Quinn with the Seahawks. I've really liked what I've seen from Armstead's tape; he's an excellent run defender who has a lot of upside as a pass-rusher because of his violent hands and ability to convert speed to power.


9) - **Brandon Scherff - New York Giants (6-10)**

COLLEGE: Iowa

Class: Sr

HT: 6-4

WT: 320

POS: OT

Analysis: I think this pick would depend upon whether the Giants retain Jason Pierre-Paul in free agency. If they don't, then pass-rusher becomes a top need and a guy like Florida DE Dante Fowler Jr. might be under consideration. But if JPP stays, I think the smart play here is to continue to solidify the offensive line. Left tackle Will Beatty played better in OC Ben McAdoo's system and 2014 second-rounder Weston Richburg should take over for JD Walton at center, leaving Scherff to start at either guard spot or possibly beat out Justin Pugh for the right tackle job. He is perfectly wired to be a New York Giants offensive lineman. He's durable, tough, strong and nasty. The Giants also have needs at linebacker, safety and possibly D-tackle if Mike Patterson leaves in free agency. 


10) - **Kevin White - St. Louis Rams (6-10)**

COLLEGE: West Virginia

Class: Sr

HT: 6-2

WT: 211

POS: WR

Analysis: The Rams' biggest need is at QB, but there's no way for them to address that position in this scenario. (Remember, we don't project trades in these mock drafts, and there's a big drop-off in this year's QB class after Winston and Mariota.) The next-biggest need is O-line, but the only prospect worth drafting this high is Stanford's Andrus Peat, and he's a pure left tackle who doesn't fit the Rams' physical approach all that well. So, wide receiver makes the most sense here, and White is a complete player with good size and outstanding ball skills. He'd immediately upgrade a group that features several question marks and no No. 1 receiver. 


11) - **Devante Parker - Minnesota Vikings (7-9)**

COLLEGE: Louisville

Class: Sr

HT: 6-2

WT: 207

POS: WR

Analysis: The Vikings need help on the offensive line, but Parker would make a lot of sense here. They need to surround second-year QB Teddy Bridgewater with more weapons, and Parker was Bridgewater's top target at Louisville. Parker would become Minnesota's tallest receiver at 6-foot-2 1/2, and he displays very good body control and competitiveness when the ball is in the air to go along with his size.

Rotanikleb,falcons,Falcons,"This is it. This is the year that Tom Brady jettisons most of his demons in one shot. He will vanquish the Ravens in front of his home crowd in what will be considered a ""gritty showing"" where he overcomes some mistakes in a relatively low-scoring affair. 

Afterwards, he will have another rematch with his equal &amp; opposite Peyton Manning. The game will be an electrifying display of offensive prowess for both team, accenting Tom's big play capabilities. The Patriots win 45 - 38. Quite possibly the highest rated/most watched AFC Championship game of all time.

But then, the true test begins. The Patriots encounter the Seattle Seahawks in the Super Bowl. The final act of revenge. I originally thought the Giants would need to be here for Brady to truly exercise his demons, but the Giants are not worthy of that title, despite besting Tom twice in the Super Bowl. No -- there is only one team worthy of this type of revenge. The self-anointed best defense of all time. The game narrative is similar to the Ravens game. It's tough. It's a slobber knocker. The Patriots are down by the score of 20 to 24 with 2 minutes left. Tom hits a slant to Edelmen: 11 yards. Tom hits a seam to Gronk: 22 yards. Tom gets a quick out to LaFell: 7 yards. Tom hits another crossing pattern to LaFell: 19 yards. 

We're close now, gentlemen. Can you feel that? Tom lines up under center and the ball is snapped. Seattle brings pressure, but Tom is cool. He steps up through the collapsing pocket and drills Gronk in the center of the endzone for the touchdown with 22 seconds left. Tom finishes the game with 280 yards passing, 2 touchdowns, and zero interceptions as the Patriots win the game.

As the confetti falls, the Seahawks sulk in their misery as they dream of what could of been if they repeated as Super Bowl champs. They laze about, soaking in the atmosphere, remembering this feeling of deep hurt so they can come back harder...hungrier. 

Tom Brady has been here before. When the game ends, he is not yet overcome by the extreme elation. He wades through the sea of media to seek out his conquered foes for post game handshakes. Tom Brady is the consummate professional. He shakes Russel Wilson's hand and tells him he is the future of the NFL. He acknowledges Marshawn Lynch's superb ability as an athlete. 

But finally, he arrives at Richard Sherman. He extends his hand, grips Richard's firmly and shakes it. Tom looks Richard in the eye. ""You mad, bro?""

Tom releases his grip and walks away.

Mister_Jay_Peg,broncos,Broncos,"I AM NOT HERE TO TRASH TALK A TEAM TODAY. I AM HERE TO TALK ***MASSIVE*** AMOUNTS OF SHIT AT TWO INDIVIDUALS WHO THANKFULLY NO LONGER HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF CALLING THEMSELVES DENVER BRONCOS. THIS IS PART TWO: **FUCK YOU JACK DEL RIO, YOU DESERVE TO COACH THE FUCKING RAIDERS**.

JACK DEL-FUCKING-RIO. GOD DAMNED DEFENSIVE MASTERMIND. HOLY SHIT, WE WERE SO HAPPY TO GET YOU WHEN DENNIS ALLEN LEFT. WE WERE FUCKING STOKED. WE FINALLY HAD A COACH THAT CONSISTENTLY HAD GOOD DEFENSES IN HIS PREVIOUS STOP, AND YOU WERE GOING TO TURN OUR SHIT AROUND.

HOLY FUCKING BALLS WERE WE WRONG. WE WERE FUCKING ***WWWWRRRROOOOOOOOOOONNNNNNGGGGGG-AAAAHHHHH***.

IN YOUR FIRST SEASON YOU HAD VON MILLER IN HIS ""FUCK YOU, I AM AMAZING"" SEASON. YOU HAD A STILL AWESOME CHAMP BAILEY. YOU HAD ELVIS DUMERVIL. YOU HAD A ROOKIE CHRIS HARRIS. YOU HAD WESLEY WOODYARD BEFORE HE SHIT THE BED GOING TO TENNESSEE.

AND DURING THE SEASON, YOUR BOYS AREN'T BAD. THEY AREN'T GREAT, BUT HEY, FIRST SEASON IN A NEW SYSTEM, RIGHT? AND THEN IN THE PLAYOFFS AGAINST BALTIMORE, YOU DECIDE THAT ""HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT? THIS TEAM THAT WE SHIT-STOMPED IN THIE OWN HOUSE 4 WEEKS AGO? I'M GOING TO CALL A GAME-PLAN SO FUCKING DEVOID OF CREATIVITY THAT THEY PUT UP 31 POINTS IN REGULATION. OH, AND THAT LATE TOUCHDOWN OVER RAHIM MOORE? YOU ARE PARTLY TO BLAME, BECAUSE YOU HAD HIM START OFF THE FUCKING PLAY ONLY 15 YARDS OFF THE FUCKING BALL.  
YOUR DEEP ""DON'T LET ANYONE GET FUCKING PAST YOU"" SAFETY WAS CLOSER TO THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE THAN THE FUCKING BACK JUDGE. FUCK YOU IN YOUR FUCKING MOUTH WITH A MANDINGO COCK FOR 2012.

NOW, 2013? HOLY SHIT, NO ONE IN THEIR RIGHT MIND WOULD BLAME YOU FOR 2013, RIGHT? I MEAN, OUR STARS WERE EITHER INJURED OR SUSPENDED FOR MOST OF THE SEASON. WE HAD MILLER FOR 6 GAMES, WE HAD A CHAMP BAILEY FOR LIKE, 4. WE LOST CHRIS HARRIS IN THE PLAYOFFS. SO WE GAVE YOUR ""YOU KNOW WHAT, MR. ICE-CREAM-MAN? VANILLA IS TOO STRONG OF A FLAVOR OF ICE-CREAM"" DEFENSE A FUCKING PASS. WHEN WE SHOULD HAVE REALIZED THAT WHEN YOU HAVE AN INJURED DEFENSE, INSTEAD OF FALLING INTO PREVENT SOFT ZONES YOU SHOULD BE ATTACKING SO THE OPPONENT DOESN'T EXPLOIT YOUR WEAKNESSES. SO WE'LL ONLY GIVE YOU A HANDJOB FROM A DISEASED MIDGET FOR THAT.

BUT 2014? OH FUCKING HELL, 2014. YOU PROMISED US A TOP 5 DEFENSE, AND WHILE YOU DELIVERED, IT WAS ONE OF THE SHITTIEST TOP 5 DEFENSES I HAVE EVEN FUCKING HAD THE DISPLEASURE OF SEEING. SERIOUSLY, VON AND WARE START OUT OF THE GATE HOTTER THAN VD ON A FILIPINO WHORE. A COMBINED 18 SACKS THROUGH WEEK 7??? AWESOME! CHRIS HARRIS TAKING THE NEXT STEP TO STARDOM? SWEET! POT ROAST GONNA ROAST? YOU FUCKING BET!  
AND THEN YOU GO SO GOD DAMNED BLAND AFTER THE LOSS TO NEW ENGLAND, THAN MOTHER FUCKING BEN ""BUELLER, BUELLER"" STEIN ASKS YOU TO LEAVE HIS PARTY FOR BEING MORE DEPRESSING THAN WATCHING A PUPPY GET GASSED BY A DYING CANCER PATIENT IN A NAZI DEATH CAMP.  
SERIOUSLY, YOU RUSH 4 AND STARTED PLAYING A SOFT ZONE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY ONCE OUR MIDDLE LINEBACKERS STARTED GETTING INJURED, AND BLITZING WAS SO OFFENSIVE TO YOU, I ASSUME THAT YOU WERE THE PARENT OF THAT CANCER PATIENT IN THE DEATH CAMP, AND YOU HATE EVERYTHING EVEN REMOTELY GERMAN-SOUNDING. WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU? VON ENDED THE SEASON WITH 4 SACKS IN HIS LAST 7 GAMES. WARE DRIED UP FASTER THAN YOUR WIFE'S VAGINA WHEN YOU STARTED SEXY-DANCING. 

NOW FOR THE COLTS GAME? TALIB IS BEST WHEN PLAYING MAN AGAINST BIGGER RECEIVERS, SO LET'S PUT HIM ON T.Y. HILTON! CHRIS HARRIS IS A BEAST IN THE SLOT AND AGAINST #1'S, SO LET'S MATCH HIM UP WITH DONTE MONCREIF AND HAKEEM FUCKING NICKS! ANDREW LUCK HAS ISSUES WITH PRESSURE, SO LET'S RUN A 3 AND 4 MAN RUSH, WITH NO STUNTS, SO THAT TWO OF THE BEST PASS-RUSHERS IN THE LEAGUE CAN GET DOUBLE-TEAMED ON EVERY PLAY! OUR BEST COVER LINEBACKER IS INJURED? LET'S MAKE HIM COVER A ZONE THAT HAS TWO TIGHT ENDS AND A RUNNING BACK CROSSING! TJ WARD HAS ISSUES COVERING THE SEAM? FUCK IT! HE'S COVERING THE MOTHERFUCKING SEAM! GO TEAM!

AND DO NOT FUCKING LIE TO US. WHEN MARK DAVIS TOOK A SOUTHWEST FLASH-FARE FLIGHT TO DENVER TO INTERVIEW YOU, YOU WET YOURSELF WITH EXCITEMENT ABOUT GOING HOME TO COACH THEM, DIDN'T YOU? YOU HAVE A FUCKING DEAL TO SABOTAGE OUR SEASON WITH THAT FUCKING MONGOLOID, DIDN'T YOU? SO FOR THE SECOND HALF OF THE 2014 SEASON, I SAY FUCK YOU IN THE ASS WITH TABASCO SAUCE AFTER YOU SHATTER A MASON JAR WITH YOUR RECTUM, YOU MICRO-DICKED PEDOPHILE.

GGerrik,patriots,Patriots,"So I have some experience coaching WRs, and here's what I was coached to coach.  

Your top post brings up 3 key things. 

Attacking the opposite shoulder, sinking the hips, rounding the routes. 

Here are some other key things for route running. 

**Firing out** - The receiver wants every route to look the same off the start, usually its the first 3 steps you talk about. The receiver needs to drive forward straight into the DB (usually towards the opposite shoulder, but that can change). The first 3 steps need to be as fast as you would running a fade or a slant (the longest or shortest routes ""typically'). 

**Stutter stepping** - Sort of the antitheses of Firing out, stutter stepping is something that the greatest receivers have mastered. Texas Tech (Wes Welker) also teaches this to all their WRs who use it on every route. Stutter stepping is awkward to explain but it's essentially a quick series of short choppy steps off the ball which then when planting your outside foot to your direction you take off. It's used to get the DB on the wrong foot and was used often by Moss before blowing by DBs on his fades. This can also be used before any break but typically isn't at the NFL level. 

**Nose over Toes,** it's exactly how it sounds, but a crisp route the WR keeps the center of gravity balanced by keeping his Noes over his Toes. This can also be taught during the shoulders forward/down, or simply help with shoulders forward/down. If a receiver doesn't keep his nose over his toes, he can extend a leg too far forward on a plant for cutting and simply slip or be knocked off balance a DB/LB while breaking on his route. 

**Shoulder forward/down** means keeping the body over the toes, it helps with balance on cuts and forward momentum to prevent defenders knocking them off their route. It's most important to keep the shoulders forward when sinking the hips in the breaking of a route. Failure to do this is often called ""getting high"" and it's a tale tell sign of sloppy route running and a key the DBs can pick up on that you're about to make a break on your route and for them to peddle down and get ready to change direction with you. 

**Planting with the outside foot**, you would hope at the NFL this is done correctly, but... well it can lead to problems. To get a nice clean cut, the receiver needs to plant with the foot opposite of the direction he's breaking. By the time that foot hit's the ground a second time you typically want the receiver to be at full speed again (possible if they're using outside foot, keeping nose over toes, shoulders down, and sunk the hips). It allows the receiver to explode out of the breaks and create separation. 

**Hand Play - swimming/ripping** Releasing is a different topic, but outside of keeping balance while running their routes, the Receiver should typically be using a ripping motion while crossing the face of the defensive back on certain breaks, or using a straight arm at the top of their breaks to maintain separation. It's important for the receiver to keep their hands pumping in front of them so that they can quickly get them up to keep a DB off their numbers, and to rip themselves clean for the breaks in their routes. 

**Depth** - A WR needs to run their route to the proper depth, not just to correct yard marker, but also where they're breaking, what their aiming points are, are they over/under backers / DBs, inside/outside release. A receiver can run the wrong route simply by breaking at 8 yards instead of 10, or breaking at 12 and running it flat instead of coming back to 10. Often you want your receiver to be headed back to the ball, so typically it's broken higher than the route is run across the field. This is obviously different for Corners/Post/Slants. Additionally depth means giving the DB a landing strip, typically 2-3 yards of boundry between where your running your route and where the sideline is. A fade can be ruined simply by having a DB squeeze the receiver too close to the boundary, the QB has no space to drop a ball in. Obviously this space can change with elite QBs. 

**Rounding out the route / finishing the route** - Typically after completing a curl or comeback, you want the receiver to continue their momentum in a circle and continue up field. Not stopping and turning back the opposite direction. This keeps the players momentum and speed, while also giving them a better angle for breaking tackles that are closing in from behind (off their break and catch). 

**Balance**, We've talked about maintaining pad height (shoulders), sinking the hips, and nose over toes. This is important for any route over the middle. LBers are always trying to get their hands on a receiver to disrupt their route. A LB can ruin the timing of a play just by getting a hand on a receiver and pushing them a step off their route. Let alone when they chuck a receiver fully to the ground. It's always legal within 5, and can often be done a little outside that without being flagged. Keeping to their route and not allowing a defender to knock them off it is very important to the timing and spacing of routes. 

**Fakes/ Head Jabs**, Another tool to a great route runner are body, head, or even just eye fakes. The best route runners like Jerry Rice, could get a DB to turn their hips simply by faking the wrong direction. Either a hard jab step with their plant foot (outside foot), throwing their shoulders in the opposite direction, bobbing the head in the opposite direction, or the real good ones could simply get people with their eyes staring down a DB and freezing them like a deer caught in headlights. 

[Here is an example of a double move by OBJ](http://i.imgur.com/4hXMcXj.jpg), borrowed from /u/dNYG He gives the false step outside throwing in a head fake which moves his shoulders and exaggerates the step he's taking to the outside. He then plants across the face of the DB and blows past him as the DB has not only turned his hips but is sprinting full speed in that direction.

timeandspace11,patriots,Patriots,"Honestly, I'm beyond giving a shit what any other  team, player, coach, ex player, owner, GM or fan says. First of all the Wells Report, specifically clears everyone except Brady and 2 low level staff members. A first round pick, A 4th round pick, and a $1 million fine is absolutely absurd. It was a punishment completely based on how big the public reaction was, not the seriousness of the offense. 

In Vincent's letter to the Pats, he talked about how Brady didn't cooperate fully with the investigation. Vincent says he doesn't hold the Pats responsible for his refusal but that it is significant. What does that mean? Is the organization responsible or not for Brady's refusal? 

The League also said we are responsible for the conduct of our employees. Fair enough, but then shouldn't teams get fined when their players test positive for PEDs. Shouldn't the Steelers have been fined when Tomlinson walked out to interfere with a special teams return by the Ravens? Shouldn't the Jets have been fined when that coach tripped the Dolphin's player. 

Even if you think Brady is 100% guilty, you should still absolutely HATE the way the league has handled this, both in dealing with Brady and the Pats. Look at everything they did wrong. They were warned there might be a problem, but the PSI before the game was not recorded. We all saw how many leaks occurred during the investigation. And now after the NFLPA, Brady's Agent, and Kraft's rebuttal report an alleged bias, Goodell though it was a good idea to appoint himself as the arbitrator in Brady's appeal. 

You may hate the Pats and Brady, but you should hate the way the NFL has conducted itself even more. Eventually, it could be your team that has to deal with this shit. And if you are a good team, watch out. It is going to get blown out of proportion (remember this  is all about 15% or less air pressure in a football in a game that was 45-7) and the NFL is going to want to drop the hammer to make up for its own past sins. They won't be fair.

Play 1:

Crick in a 6 tech on Smith's outside shoulder. Powe is playing a true nose but is shaded to the left to Force Frederick left. Watt is playing a 5 tech over Free. Reed is playing a wide 9.

Play 2: 

Watt is an 8 tech. Pagan is a 3 tech. Powe is a 1 tech. Reed is again playing as a wide 9.

2.) Without Frederick's shove there is a good chance that Powe overpowers Martin and gets pressure up the middle which is one of Romo's weaknesses.

3.) Free's presnap read is Cushing, if that blitz comes than he would grab him leaving Reed for Murray.

4.) Tyron locks down Watt with his long arms. Free manages to shade outside with good technique and cut off the edge from Reed. Free does have problems with this type of player had a Bruce Irvin or Von Miller been here this play could have likely been a different story.

**Matchups**

1.) Frederick's assignment is the left side A gap from the get go, but due to the NT in the A gap on the opposite side he provides a a quick shove to help Martin get a hat on his guy.

2.) Leary knows he doesn't have help on his outside shoulder so he cuts off the B gap to force the 3 tech into the A gap where he gets negated by Frederick's double team.

3.) Tackles are taught to take the inside man, his eyes are on the linebacker in front of him in case Mohamed blitzes. When the ball is snapped he reads correctly and takes Watt.

3b.) Tyron gets his power clamps on Watts shoulder pads because of his unnaturally long arms. [On this still](http://i.imgur.com/jD7JAKI.jpg) you can see that Watt's arms are fully extended just to get to Tyron's shoulders while Tyron's arms are bent. Tyron knows how to use his physical gifts to his advantage.

**Summary**

*Give a quick summary of Houston's pass rush approach on this play.* 

Houston want's 1 on 1s with Watt and Reed.

*Give a quick summary of Dallas' pass protection approach on this play.*

The cog on this play is Frederick. He knows he needs to help Martin because of where Powe is presnap but he also knows that Leary is on an island against Pagan. Luckily Leary forces Pagan inside where he has help. Smith and Free are watching the linebackers in case of a potential blitzer with the secondary objective to take the edge rushers.

*Who do you give Helmet Stickers to for excellent play?*

The entire offensive line.

*Who do you give Extra Laps to for subpar play?*

skepticismissurvival,vikings,Vikings,"1. With the way the pass rush is set up, I think blitzing Tuggle would be most successful but I think blitzing Cushing is most likely because of the safety help over the top to take on Hanna. Mercilus definitely isn't blitzing with how he's head-up on Witten.
1. Powe is lined up at 1 tech shaded left and forces Frederick to move in that direction off the snap. Watt coming across Martin's face also forces him left, which leaves Free on the island.
1. The left side is basically able to maintain the same gap that they started in, but the right side needs to move over one gap to the right.
1. The protection call appears to be ""Half Slide Left,"" which means that three offensive linemen are blocking to the left while the two on the other side are left blocking one-on-one. This is a standard protection scheme and the back is also there to help out on the right side if needed.
1. That's a very good pocket. Romo has all the room he needs. Watt is encroaching a little bit but that's still a ton of space to step up into.

---

1. Leary's responsibility is to help Tyron Smith if he has trouble with Crick (or later potentially help Frederick). If Cushing blitzed it would have been his job to pick him up, but he really wasn't needed in any capacity in this play.
1. The Cowboys have Demarco Murray play Reed's outside shoulder. This allows Free to cheat inside a little and sufficiently neutralize Reed.
1. Martin does a good job of using Watt's momentum against him, forcing him to end up on the other side of Romo. One thing I'm concerned about is his arm placement, with one hand on Watt's back and the other on his opposite shoulder. That's asking for a hands to the face or holding call if he has to block for much longer.

---

1. As mentioned above, Houston's approach is to get Reed on an island with free. They are also hoping Watt can beat Martin across his face because he's JJ Watt.
1. As I also mentioned above, the Cowboys are using half slide left protection, with three blockers on the strong side of the formation and two blockers on the weak side. They also keep Murray to chip to help Free on the weak side.",1428931001,,False,1,15,nfl,True,False,401,0,Morning,0-20,0,7,"{u'probability': {u'neg': 0.42535267817720046, u'neutral': 0.8622117176188383, u'pos': 0.5746473218227995}, u'label': u'neutral'}",0.425352678177,0.574647321823,0.862211717619,neutral,"{u'tone_categories': [{u'category_id': u'emotion_tone', u'tones': [{u'tone_name': u'Anger', u'score': 0.138113, u'tone_id': u'anger'}, {u'tone_name': u'Disgust', u'score': 0.144865, u'tone_id': u'disgust'}, {u'tone_name': u'Fear', u'score': 0.457668, u'tone_id': u'fear'}, {u'tone_name': u'Joy', u'score': 0.392039, u'tone_id': u'joy'}, {u'tone_name': u'Sadness', u'score': 0.482227, u'tone_id': u'sadness'}], u'category_name': u'Emotion Tone'}, {u'category_id': u'language_tone', u'tones': [{u'tone_name': u'Analytical', u'score': 0.73826, u'tone_id': u'analytical'}, {u'tone_name': u'Confident', u'score': 0.0, u'tone_id': u'confident'}, {u'tone_name': u'Tentative', u'score': 0.512749, u'tone_id': u'tentative'}], u'category_name': u'Language Tone'}, {u'category_id': u'social_tone', u'tones': [{u'tone_name': u'Openness', u'score': 0.681438, u'tone_id': u'openness_big5'}, {u'tone_name': u'Conscientiousness', u'score': 0.087036, u'tone_id': u'conscientiousness_big5'}, {u'tone_name': u'Extraversion', u'score': 0.426681, u'tone_id': u'extraversion_big5'}, {u'tone_name': u'Agreeableness', u'score': 0.074509, u'tone_id': u'agreeableness_big5'}, {u'tone_name': u'Emotional Range', u'score': 0.664261, u'tone_id': u'emotional_range_big5'}], u'category_name': u'Social Tone'}]}",0.138113,0.144865,0.457668,0.392039,0.482227,0.73826,0.0,0.512749,0.681438,0.087036,0.426681,0.074509,0.664261

skepticismissurvival,vikings,Vikings,"1. The Cowboys are prepared for two blitzers with this protection: Tuggle (who is Murray's responsibility), and Cushing (Martin's responsibility). Ignoring his stance, I think Reed would have been most successful. If we're only counting Tuggle and Cushing, I think Cushing would be most successful. It's a numbers game. Tuggle could have two men blocking him while Cushing only has one.
1. Reed's stance is a clear indication he's not rushing the passer but is instead setting up outside leverage for coverage on Witten. The reason this is clear is because his stance shows that his weight is shifted toward the back, which means he plans to backpedal at the snap. If he planned to rush the passer, he would be leaning forward more to get a better jump off the snap. The foot placement is especially telling. If Reed were blitzing his stance would look a lot more like it does [in this picture.](http://i.imgur.com/T1Hjv37.jpg)
1. I see it in two places. Martin gets a hand on Powe, which pushes him a step the the left. Smith and Leary are left double teaming Watt (really, with Murray right there, it's more like a triple team). Smith's hand doesn't do much in my opinion as I think Watt was moving that direction to try to set up the spin move inside anyway.
1. I don't really know who calls protections for the Cowboys (either Frederick or Romo) but I'd imagine they noticed Reed's stance and called the protection to not include him.
1. By the result, advantage Cushing. Cushing is an experienced player, and quite strong. He gets leverage on Martin and drives him back.
1. It looks like the Cowboys might be at least a little concerned by the possibility of a blitz by the Mercilus, judging by the way Smith kicks out. I think it's pretty clear that Murray is assigned to block Tuggle if he blitzes. So, because the blitz came from the other side, it looks over defended on that side. With hindsight, if I were drawing up the protection, I would put Murray on Romo's right instead of his left.

---

1. The Cowboys are (to an extent) double teaming Watt with Smith and Leary. I mentioned the possibility of a Mercilus blitz before, but another reason to have Smith kick out like that is if Watt tries to go around the edge (with his presnap alignment I wouldn't expect it because he's heads up on Smith and that just seems like a waste of movement, but it's a possibility). Watt goes inside, and that rush is clearly Leary's responsibility.
1. Part of his job is to get in the passing lane, which he clearly tries to do. Another part might be deception, where they're trying to draw Martin to his right to clear up the rush lane for Cushing.
1. A couple of things - Cushing does a good job of using his hands to control Martin. First, he gets to push him back using ""one arm is longer than two"" principles, and then gets both hands back on him before Martin can reset. The other reason is that Martin's base is too wide and his feet end up to far apart for him to hold his ground. Oh, and also because Cushing won the leverage battle Martin is off balance, and falling backward.

---

1. Houston tried to cause some level of confusion by returning to a previous formation earlier in the game but blitzing a different player on a zone blitz.
1. Dallas has a double team on Watt, a double team on Powe, and Free assigned to block Pickett, with Smith, Murray, and Martin assigned to watch for blitzers.
1. Sticker to Cushing for a strong bull rush. Stickers to Free and Frederick. I'm not sure if Smith/Leary deserve stickers because they got an advantage but they *were* facing JJ Watt.
1. Laps to Martin for losing leverage. Laps to Dez for the drop. Laps to Tuggle for taking a terrible angle while presumably trying to tackle Dez.",1429102881,,False,1,13,nfl,True,False,676,0,Morning,0-20,0,18,"{u'probability': {u'neg': 0.6264101941450495, u'neutral': 0.17394233200715428, u'pos': 0.3735898058549505}, u'label': u'neg'}",0.626410194145,0.373589805855,0.173942332007,neg,"{u'tone_categories': [{u'category_id': u'emotion_tone', u'tones': [{u'tone_name': u'Anger', u'score': 0.129859, u'tone_id': u'anger'}, {u'tone_name': u'Disgust', u'score': 0.119486, u'tone_id': u'disgust'}, {u'tone_name': u'Fear', u'score': 0.135819, u'tone_id': u'fear'}, {u'tone_name': u'Joy', u'score': 0.436772, u'tone_id': u'joy'}, {u'tone_name': u'Sadness', u'score': 0.534594, u'tone_id': u'sadness'}], u'category_name': u'Emotion Tone'}, {u'category_id': u'language_tone', u'tones': [{u'tone_name': u'Analytical', u'score': 0.672517, u'tone_id': u'analytical'}, {u'tone_name': u'Confident', u'score': 0.0, u'tone_id': u'confident'}, {u'tone_name': u'Tentative', u'score': 0.722408, u'tone_id': u'tentative'}], u'category_name': u'Language Tone'}, {u'category_id': u'social_tone', u'tones': [{u'tone_name': u'Openness', u'score': 0.76599, u'tone_id': u'openness_big5'}, {u'tone_name': u'Conscientiousness', u'score': 0.078361, u'tone_id': u'conscientiousness_big5'}, {u'tone_name': u'Extraversion', u'score': 0.324479, u'tone_id': u'extraversion_big5'}, {u'tone_name': u'Agreeableness', u'score': 0.020874, u'tone_id': u'agreeableness_big5'}, {u'tone_name': u'Emotional Range', u'score': 0.689615, u'tone_id': u'emotional_range_big5'}], u'category_name': u'Social Tone'}]}",0.129859,0.119486,0.135819,0.436772,0.534594,0.672517,0.0,0.722408,0.76599,0.078361,0.324479,0.020874,0.689615

Zenryhao,saints,Saints,"**OFFICIAL PRO BOWL CHEERLEADER POWER RANKINGS**

1. **Liz** (Houston Texans) - Of the select few without a butter face, Liz is almost definitely the most attractive (one could split hairs over blondes vs. brunettes, but that would be a hotly contested issue). With a first-person blurb almost exclusively punctuated by exclamation points and a left eyebrow which just says ""Really? You're *not* going to pick me?"" Liz is the cream of the crop, even if the Texans aren't.

2. **Sara** (St. Louis Rams) - With a genuinely attractive face that actually looks like a human being rather than a makeup-drenched soulless troll, Sara could easily be elevated to 1(a) but this ranker doesn't believe in copouts like that. Additionally, her first-person blurb actually reads like an intelligent human being wrote it, and she's a full-time student going for a nursing degree which is very respectable.

3. **Katelyn** (San Deigo Chargers) - She's got that certain *je ne sais quoi* to her, by which I mean she looks like a porn star. Call it old-fashioned, but this ranker believes the best cheerleaders maintain an air of ""girl next door""  rather than going full casting couch. If you're a fan of Barbie dolls, though, Katelyn might be your hottest cup of tea.

4. **Nicole** (Dallas Cowboys) - The frizzy hair or whatever that style is called is certainly not flattering, but the slammin' body and cute as a button face are too good to ignore. Hairstyle is readily changeable anyway, so it's not a real issue. This University of Idaho (ha) graduate is set to break into the top 3, if only she could get her hands on a straightener.

5. **Sam** (Denver Broncos) - Rounding out the top 5 is the only cheerleader on this list rocking a short haircut. She pulls it off with all the dignity and grace you'd expect from an actual professional ballerina and also shakes her ass with all the technical skill of, well, a professional ballerina. She has two pet guinea pigs, too, which is definitely a plus.

6. **Alice** (Atlanta Falcons) - It might just be the white outfit on a white background (come on, NFL.com) but there's something about this one just doesn't look *real*. Aside from that certain unsettling quality, Alice defines the standard sexy co-ed look. Holding her back is the decidedly unremarkable career goal of *coaching* cheerleading after being a cheerleader.

7. **Sam** (Jacksonville Jaguars) - Apparently the Jags are better at cheerleader personnel than they are at football personnel, because Sam is way higher on this tier list than any of their QBs ever. The biggest question mark on Sam is whether she actually has the goods or if that's just a bra doing it's pushup magic. If nothing else, she can hang her hat on being a ""clinical research assistant in a motion analysis center"" whatever the hell that means.

8. **Charo** (Washington Redskins) - With a face and body that just makes you wonder, ""What race is this chick?"" it's no wonder Charo cheer-os for the Washington Why-are-we-still-called-this-shits. She does have the same porn-star charm as Katelyn before her, but Charo is more of a ""category"" actress than an all-around star, if you catch my drift. Apparently she also works as a tax accountant though, which is pretty amusing.

9. **Alicia Marie** (Philadelphia Eagles) - The body screams ""YES"" but the face mumbles some counter-arguments while the eyes simply say ""Let's get this over with."" But all that pales in comparison to the simply amazing fun-fact that Alicia Marie ""is the lead educator for"" a program called (I shit you not) ""HEAD for the future."" She's also passionate about breast cancer awareness, but her mouth is only the third-best tool she has for that cause.

10. **Melissa** (Miami Dolphins) - We're back to the first-person blurbs! Looks like Mel majors in Mass Communication which is code for ""getting railed in fraternities"" when she's not cheering on those darn Dolphins. There's not much to say about her physical appearance besides that she isn't Lauren Tannehill. Can we get her on the sidelines? That would be more fun to watch than any Dolphins game.

11. **Melissa** (Seattle Seahawks) - ""Damn, she's hot!"" is what guys probably said 10-15 years ago. She's the only one of the bunch with a husband, and there's a reason for that. That reason can clearly be seen in her knees. But to be fair, Melissa still looks pretty damn good. Can we focus on how her first-person blurb includes the phrase ""only a couple continents left to visit"" though? There are only 7 in the first place, and Antarctica doesn't even count. Settle down with the claims of being a master traveler.

12. **Taylor** (New Orleans Saints) - Taylor is 23 goin' on 13. Seriously, she should consider a career as an undercover cop catching pedophiles or something rather than her actual goal as a crime scene technician. It's so pronounced this ranker doesn't even feel comfortable commenting on her physical traits. No amount of homer-ism would let me rank her any higher than this, but most important is her message to everyone out there: Never give up on your dreams. (Unless you're a pedophile, then maybe stop.)

13. **Michelle** (Oakland Raiders) - Her body is almost perfect, *but her face*. It's a shame the Raiders are actually improving and have a quality young quarterback, because it takes the wind out of most of the best jokes which could be made here. Let's just assume that she totally deserved the Wanetta Horton Award, which is apparently a real thing they hand out to the ""most inspirational Raiderette of the season"" and move on.

14. **Cassie** (Tampa Bay Bucs) - Once again, a rockin' body *but her face*. Like, everyone's heard Afroman's ""Colt 45"" right? If you haven't, go listen to it, then come back. You good? Okay. That's relevant, because there is a good chance Cassie would whip out a dick that was bigger than yours, judging by her oddly manly face. She also ""performed"" at the Republican National Convention, which just, who knows what that means.

15. **Brie** (New York Jets) - The theme is continuing, okay? She has apparently performed ""numerous full-scale halftime shows"" with Lenny Kravitz. Suffice it to say, it's up in the air which of them looks more like a dude.

Alright, the rest of these power rankings would just be too mean and repetitive, so this is probably far enough. I guess there should be a ""Miss Irrelevant"" though, so here's a bonus ranking for last place.

I had attended a military academy in Virginia and had finally left there, headed back to DC, free from the regimentation and rules, a punk rock Lazarus. The 'Skins looked pretty fucking good that year and expectations ran high. We didn't have a first round draft pick that year and apart from a couple of picks, it was a pretty lean draft. The year before, the hated Dallas Cowboys and the New York Giants had eliminated us from the playoffs. Fans expected big things from the team that year as did the media and analysts. Solid, smash-mouth football, behind offensive and defensive  lines that promised to be pretty nasty.

I remember reading about Tuggle in the papers, his fight with his illness, the dream of coming back to football, it was one of those stories that sold papers and had movies made about it. It was fluff, my adolescent brain told me, manipulative media bullshit. But then, I turned on the news one morning and a reporter said that Tuggle was dead. This is not how shit goes, I remember thinking. This is football, the respite from all the bad crazy news about crack and Libya and the Challenger, this is what we watch to step away from the harsh luridness of Reality.

But the guy was dead. My teenage brain couldn't grasp that shit. This guy does all he can do to make his dreams come true, to play football in the pros, and he fucking dies. It was a pretty goddamned awful thing, one of those moments when life turns on the naked bulb in the room and nothing casts a shadow, it is just all there, too real, too awful to deny.

When the Giants won the Superbowl,  I was of course pissed that my team hadn't been there. But there was a moment when Joe Morris had his helmet in his hand and the voice-over was droning on inanely, Morris raised his helmet and pointed at that ""38"" sticker. And right there I realized that football, despite the divisive nature of fandom, was bigger than any one team, any one player, any bullshit analyses. It was a game, yes, but it MEANT something, a metaphor, that hundreds of thousands of people could grasp, even if only subconsciously. It was about fight and resolve and character and strength. It had merit in this insane world, beyond just a distraction. 

Man, I wanted the 'Skins to win that year. But the Giants had something to fight for. They earned it through adversity and pain and resolve. They deserved the label, ""Champions.""

Edit: I should clarify. While I wanted to see the Packers win, I'm not particularly upset that the Seahawks will be in the Super Bowl. The Seahawks were undoubtedly one of the top 2 teams in the NFL this season (along with the Pats), so on some level, I'm excited to see a Super Bowl with the absolute two best in the league. It's going to be a good game. What has me annoyed is the Seahawks fans who act as though it's some great thing they managed to win last night. As I said, that comeback was beyond exceptional, but I don't believe playing awfully for 55 minutes and managing to snap back at the very end should be called a ""miracle"". The Seahawks won a game they were projected to win. That just isn't a miracle to me. The ""fuck off"" wasn't geared at the Seahawks specifically, or even all Seahawks fans, just Seahawks fans who insist that winning last night was some grand accomplishment. You were supposed to win last night.

Pool Report

Referee Pete Morelli with Pool Reporter Todd Archer

Archer: Can you talk about the decision to overturn the call and why you overturned the call?  
Morelli: The back judge threw his flag for defensive pass interference. We got other information from another official from a different angle that thought the contact was minimal and didn’t warrant pass interference. He thought it was face-guarding.

Archer: Which official?  
Morelli: The head linesman.

Archer: What did you see?  
Morelli: It’s not my responsibility. I’m a hundred miles away.

Archer: Face-guarding is not a foul?  
Morelli: Face-guarding is not a foul. It is a penalty in college but not in professional football.

Archer: What is the process you go through after you announce the call? Should you have waited before you
announced the call?  
Morelli: Probably, yes. The information came and then the officials got together a little bit later, after it was given to me, the first information. It would have probably been smoother if we got together.

Archer: Do you remember this type of player [sic] happening before?  
Morelli: No, not particularly.

Archer: So one more time on who the person was that had a better view?

dipdac,cowboys,Cowboys,"FUCK the officials for tainting *our* comeback win with this bullshit. They called a shitty game the whole time, but this one call gets all this scrutiny because they made such a spectacle of it. They failed to call holding on almost every play that game, Matthew Stafford was clearly already on tilt, and he was making bad decisions because he finally got hit a few times. If Pettigrew hadn't tugged on Hitchens' face mask when Stafford made his pitch, Hitchens would have turned around and made a grab at that ball, and we'd all be talking about, ""Can Dallas beat Green Bay?,"" and, ""Boy, a lot of teams shit the bed yesterday, didn't they?""

I'm going to try real hard not to sound too sympathetic for all you salty hater-chips out there who wanted nothing more than to see Tony Romo fail, but bad officiating happened all game long, and this bad call just happened to come out in our favor, and it just happened to be close to the end of the game.

And the refs? Fuck them for opening this debate in the first place with their shitty, inconsistent calling. Fuck the journalists and commentators for feeding into the shit by *NOT* bringing up the facemask, and not bringing up all the no-calls that hurt Dallas in that same game.

We should be talking about what a tough game the Cowboys are going to have in Lambeau Field this weekend, and how Romo showed a lot more resilience and mental toughness and maturity than he used to to not give up, and how Cole Beasley stepped up and is tough as hell, but instead, we get this shit show, thanks to the REFS and the shitty officiating staff.

And for you ***** out there looking for conspiracies, if there was a damn conspiracy, Suh wouldn't have played in the first place. Go ahead, put your little conspiracy corkboard on the wall and connect the dots. Maybe you'll even get a history channel special, but in the end, you're just grasping at straws. 

EDIT: Speaking of Suh, the man played his ass off. I think he's guilty of playing dirty sometimes, but he played real hard yesterday, and I'm glad he was there.

And the better team did not lose the game. The Lions defense played hard all game long, but the offense didn't show up in the second half. We all saw it, one bad no-call doesn't change that, neither do the countless other no-calls in detroit's favor. That's not being the better team. Just for shits and giggles, however, let's say they get a FG (and the way they played in the second half, that's all I give them), then everything else plays out just the same. They shank a kick, we get a touchdown, and Matthew Stafford forgets how to hold the ball.  Same outcome, except we win by 1. Except we wouldn't have to kneel as many times because the clock would have been almost out already.

After all these years I got to the point last season where I was done with thinking about him as a Bear and couldn't care less where he went. 

Now, after reading these comments made by fans of other teams (both in this thread and across /r/nfl in general) I hope he has his greatest season in his career, and drapes his ballsack across the rest of the league. He's put up with so much shit since being here and has gotten his ass handed to him for years. While he may be an incredibly frustrating QB with a dumb wife, he's OUR incredibly frustrating QB with a dumb wife. I won't sit idly by while other teams mock his play, acting like they wouldn't touch him with a ten foot pole.

The ceremony takes place during halftime at the SB. Brady is the presenter.

Oh yeah. There's another game going on as well. GB cancels their tilt with the Seahawks. Adam Schefter reports the team ""forgot about the game in the midst of an intense Dungeons and Dragons session"". Later reports would provide conflicting motives, as the gameday uniforms of the Packers' offense were reportedly ""heavily soiled with excrement and urine"" at the prospect of facing the greatest defense ever assembled. Schefter heatedly denies any such foulness and claims he smelled each uniform for the presence of any bodily fluids. Tests were inconclusive.

chattymcgee,ravens,Ravens,"Sports in a vacuum don't mean anything.  In a vacuum they are no different than a spelling bee or watching somebody do math.  It's a bunch of people doing arbitrary things following arbitrary rules.

We care because we choose to care.  We choose to invest emotional energy.  The whole point is to feel emotions.  This is what people who say ""it's just a game"" miss.  If it was just a game I wouldn't waste my time.  It makes me feel.  It's like music and movies and literature.  I'm here for the feels.

So where does the ""we"" come from?  It's because I choose to make the team part of my self identity.  They become surrogates for me, I feel through them.  We become so engaged because emotionally they represent us out on that field, and if they didn't, we wouldn't waste our time watching.  

Over time, this sense of identity becomes stronger.  The team becomes we, my, and ours in the same way I saw ""we Americans"" when talking about wars  or space exploration even though I am not a soldier and have never been to space.

I have seen many people who don't follow sports get behind Olympic or World Cup teams because it has the country's name on it.  Team USA had a big following, and most of those people couldn't tell you how many players were on the field.  That seems easy and obvious to them because country is clearly a part of self identity.

madhjsp,titans,Titans,"**General Questions**

How would you describe the way the Left side of the OL (C, LG, LT) drop into pass protection compared to the right side (RG, RT)?

* *The most apparent difference is that their first steps take them in opposite directions.*  

Take a note of the Texans' [pass rush lanes](https://i.imgur.com/HtI4Lbz.jpg) and then watch how the play unfolds.  Sometimes, the pass rush scheme is designed to isolate a matchup on an ""island.""  Look at the freeze-frame [Here](https://i.imgur.com/CCFR39H.jpg).  It appears that the Texans do exactly that.  Explain how the rush lanes dictated this.  

* *With Powe immediately slanting to his right (carrying the C with him) and Reed taking a wide pass rush angle (taking the RT with him), Watt is given major room to operate in isolation against Martin.*

Why do you suppose the protection has 3 OL turning to the left, leaving 1-on-1s on the right side?  (Are you really going to intentionally leave the rookie RG in 1-on-1 with Mr. Perfect?)  

* *Poe's pre-snap position outside of Frederick's left shoulder dictated that Frederick pick him up. I would have thought that maybe they'd have Frederick chip him then leave him for Leary to handle while turning his attention to Watt, but in slow motion it doesn't look like it was ever Frederick's intention to do anything but block Poe. He doesn't appear to be attempting to disengage.* 

The Texans only bring a 4-man rush on this play.  Look at this [presnap image](http://i.imgur.com/C3TJZxa.jpg).  If the Texans were to Blitz a LB, which one do you think most likely would be coming (Tuggle, Cushing, Mercilus) and why?  How would Dallas account for Blitz if it were to come?  

* *Blitzing Tuggle behind Watt would seem to make the most logical sense to me. With Poe, Watt, and Reed each occupying a blocker, he ought to have a clear path to the backfield, and getting to the QB would be a matter of beating the RB in pass protection. Indeed, it looks like Murray is checking for a blitz-pickup assignment before he runs out to the flat.* 

[Here](https://i.imgur.com/CCFR39H.jpg) is Tony Romo's pocket as he's preparing to throw.   Romo goes from snap to initial read to checkdown in 2.5s.  Thoughts on why he gets rid of it so fast, esp since it appears that he has good protection.  

* *From the A22, it looks like the Cowboys are trying to get Terrance Williams open on a 10-yard in-route, with Hanna running a clear-out route up the seam. However, Cushing muddles the whole thing up with a powerful jam on Hanna, meaning Williams never comes open as designed. Romo notices this quickly, and with the situation being 1st and 10, realizes that you can't go broke taking a profit and dumps the ball off to his RB to gain what yardage he can.* 

---


**Matchups**

Watch the closeup GFY on LG #65 Ron Leary.  At first glance, it looks like he basically took the play off.  What do you think his responsibility on this protection is?  What effect does he have on his 2 adjacent line-mates even though he does not actually make a block on the play?  

* *I'd imagine his first responsibility is to pick up any blitz that might come from Cushing, which allows his linemates to pick up their assignments without hesitating to read and react to him.*

\#58 LB Brooks Reed (6'3"", 258lbs) v #68 Doug Free (6'6"", 325 lbs).  This matchup would favor Reed in space and Free in close-quarters.  The Texans manage to get Reed with a 2-way go on Free (ie., there is space to the left or the right) which is favorable to Reed.  Explain how the Cowboys' protection counters that and allows Free to (safely) overplay the inside.  

* *After checking for a blitz from Tuggle, it looks like Murray is assigned to get to the outside of the line of scrimmage, help with the outside pass rush if needed, before slipping into the flat for the checkdown. Free knows he has help if Reed takes wide angle, so he sets up to guard against an inside move.*  

All-Pro DE #99 JJ Watt has a 1-on-1 with rookie RG #70 Zack Martin.  That sounds like a mismatch, but Watt does not get any pressure on Romo.  How would you assess Martin on this play?

* *Remarkably, he does not get beat even though he has to change the direction of his slide. Excellent balance. Hard to tell if he gets away with an uncalled hold, though. Kind of looks like he does.*  

---

**Summary, Stickers, and Laps**

Give a quick summary of Houston's pass rush approach on this play.  

* *They rush 4 and drop the linebackers into zone coverage, which seems logical enough against a shotgun formation on first down, where you might anticipate a short pass play.* 

Give a quick summary of Dallas' pass protection approach on this play.  

* *They clearly trust their linemen to handle 1on1 matchups.*  

Who do you give Helmet Stickers to for excellent play?  

* *Hard to pick any individual Cowboys linemen, it looks like they all did their job superbly. Even if Martin committed a hold, he gets the benefit of the doubt for successfully preventing JJ Watt in open space from getting to Romo. Cushing also gets one for successfully interrupting the intended play.*

Who do you give Extra Laps to for subpar play?  

* *Not really sure what Tuggle was doing there. He drops himself into no-man's land, too shallow to affect any deeper pass patterns yet so deep that he essentially gives Murray free yardage on the dumpoff.*

&gt;A Crustacean Sensation across the Nation

If getting comped free things by local businesses is a such a red flag (relevant to the NFL), I have something to tell you about a lot of star athletes in college programs. Probably the worst offense Winston has committed (that's been proven), but if that's the worst...

&gt;The Soda Thief

Through both the linked article, and the TMZ article, you'll notice that the manager actually never says it's Winston on the 911 tape. All the NY Daily News article (which is a tabloid, remember) says is ""It's claimed that Winston was one of the trio."" [by who?] As far as I know, Winston has never been connected to the crime by a witness or investigator. If somebody has an article that demonstrates it beyond hearsay, then I'll accept that.

&gt;Fisher and Winston: Clemson, Part 3

&gt;Well, somehow, someway, Winston didn't get the Memo he wouldn't be playing, and came out in full padding to warm up. Jimbo Fisher then gets into another visible altercation with Winston. I think it goes beyond ""What, why are you in pads?

Winston is given a one game suspension, and you think that him dressing up in pads is indicative of what...that he thought he was going to play? Really? Why else would you be harping on him for dressing up? For all we know, some trainer set out his stuff for him, or he never thought that dressing up would be a big deal since it's (supposedly) his first ever suspension. Who cares if he accidentally dressed up for the sidelines?

&gt;Winston then made himself appear like an ass on National TV throughout the game

Huh? Dude was jumping and hollering on the sidelines because his team fought back to beat Clemson in overtime. It's more sounding like you have already made up your mind about Winston well before you set out to research his full history of character issues.

&gt;Fisher and Winston: BCS Practice

&gt;Fisher and Winston: Oregon

&gt;Fisher and Winston: Georgia Tech

Wow, Winston and Jimbo get into disagreements during stressful close games. This usually spells trouble for coach-QB duos. It's amazing they got to 27-1 with such an immature hothead under center.

Frankly I think that these ""red flags"" have been seriously *overplayed* for two years. Him doing dumb little shit with friends is something people tend to grow out of, especially with someone who now knows how much is on the line. He's not doing drugs or beating people up outside of bars or driving drunk (\*cough* PJ \*cough*) or sticking guns down his sweatpants. He's not going Johnny Football every weekend.

It's fine if you don't want Winston (as a non-fan of his potential destinations, I honestly couldn't care less where he ends up but am excited to see how he does), but judge it based on shit that matters, not beating a dead horse on these little tabloid headlines you're blowing out of proportion.

John madden is in the hall of fame. Plenty of Oakland raiders from all Davis' heyday are. No asterisk applied to their glorious history. And yet they cheated constantly. They didn't just do things that weren't regulated until the NFL made it against the rule, they also straight up cheated. All the time. 

But they were not paying off referees. They weren't purposefully losing or paying other teams to purposefully lose. They sought out and found ways to break rules that the NFL wasn't very good at enforcing. They constantly probed for advantages like that and when they got caught, they accepted punishment.

New england and bill belichek are no different. And from varying reports, most teams function this way, but ever since mangini ratted belichek out, coupled with his success in the NFL, they're under constant scrutiny. 

I would argue that Dallas and Washington choosing to load up salaries in an uncapped year when, legally or not, the NFL wasn't allowing teams to do so, would provide a way bigger advantage than under inflated footballs or video taped signs from 100 feet closer than the rule allows but neither team has been anything close to the dominant juggernaut the patriots are. 

Belichek will be punished and he will laugh it off because the reason he's got rings and AFC championships has nothing to do with spygate or deflategate. As a matter of fact, the only thing in common between his success and his scandals is that they both come from an all consuming desire to win and be the best. Belichek constantly probes the league's rules and regulations and constantly makes sure his franchise is always pushing the allowance of those rules and regulations. He approaches coaching players and developing schemes the exact same way. It's why he is so great. 

Anyone concerned about this 'tarnishing' his legacy or the patriots' need only look at how the Oakland raiders of old are currently viewed. 

Belichek doesn't hurt the integrity of the game and that is what is most important. Until he does, he will be the devilish pest that constantly pushes the NFL to do a better job of running the league and enforcing rules. He's not paying off refs. He's not paying people to hurt opposing people. He's not buying victories.

anchist,ravens,Ravens,"The most damning portions: 

&gt;**Based on the evidence developed in connection with the investigation and summarized in this Report, we have concluded that it is more probable than not that New
England Patriots personnel participated in violations of the NFL Playing Rules and were involved in a deliberate attempt to circumvent those rules.** In particular, we conclude that it is more probable than not that Jim McNally and John Jastremski participated in a deliberate plan to circumvent the rules by releasing air from Patriots game balls after the examination of the footballs by NFL game officials at the AFC Championship Game. We believe that McNally and Jastremski were aware that the inflation level of the Patriots game balls following pre-game inspection by the game officials would be approximately 12.5 psi and planned for McNally to deflate the balls below that level following the pre-game inspection using a needle provided by Jastremski. **Based on the evidence, we also have concluded that it is more probable than not that Tom Brady was at least generally aware of the inappropriate activities of McNally and Jastremski involving the release of air from Patriots game balls.**

This is the general stuff, basically outlining their findings. 

&gt;Our conclusion that it is more probable than not that McNally and Jastremski participated in a deliberate effort to release air from Patriots game balls after the balls were tested by the game officials is significantly influenced by the substantial number of communications and events consistent with such a finding, including that the same person (McNally) referred to himself as the “deflator” and stated that he was “not going to espn……..yet,” was involved in a series of communications about his impact on the inflation-level of Patriots game balls and using a “needle” surrounded by cash and sneakers (when his legitimate responsibilities as a locker room attendant did not involve the preparation, inflation or deflation of footballs), violated standard pre-game procedure by removing the game balls from the Officials Locker Room without permission of the game officials, brought the game balls into a bathroom before the game (for a period long enough to deflate them), and received valuable items autographed by Tom Brady the week before the AFC Championship Game. 


This is some heavy shit right here. A charitable interpretation would be that it is just a big coincidence the guys in question received valuable merch, but read on...

&gt;Similarly, the evidence establishes  that John Jastremski knew that McNally had referred to himself as the “deflator” and stated that he was “not going to espn……..yet,” was involved personally in a series of communications with McNally about the inflation and deflation of footballs using a “needle” and providing McNally with a “needle,” was involved in providing McNally with items of value, and had himself received a particularly valuable autograph from Brady earlier in the season. In addition, Jastremski spoke with McNally almost immediately when suspicions first arose (speaking by telephone three times in the hours after the game for a total of 37 minutes and 11 seconds) and **
communicated with Brady by telephone or text message with significantly increased frequency in the following days, as described below.**

Orders came from Brady: 
&gt;Evidence of Brady‟s awareness appears in text communications between McNally and Jastremski. For example, in text messages exchanged with McNally in October 2014 discussing Brady‟s unhappiness with the inflation level of Patriots game balls, Jastremski told McNally that **“[h]e actually brought you up” and “said you must have a lot of stress trying to get them done.”**

&gt;Moreover, taking the text messages as a whole, Brady is a constant reference point in the discussions between McNally and Jastremski about inflation, deflation, needles and
items to be received by McNally. In response to Jastremski‟s offers of sneakers and clothing, for example, McNally identifies Brady as the catalyst for those offers (“Tom must really be working your balls hard this week”; “Tom must really be on you”).

&gt;**Additional evidence of Brady‟s awareness includes a material increase in the frequency of telephone and text communications between Brady and Jastremski shortly after
suspicions of ball tampering became public on January 19 suggests that Brady was closely monitoring Jastremski.** After not communicating by telephone or text for more than six months (according to data retrieved from Jastremski‟s cell phone), Brady and Jastremski spoke twice by telephone on January 19 (calls lasting a total of 25 minutes and 2 seconds), twice on January 20 (calls lasting a total of 9 minutes and 55 seconds) and twice on January 21 (calls lasting a total of 20 minutes and 52 seconds) before Jastremski surrendered his cell phone to the Patriots later that day for forensic imaging. These calls included conversations relatively early during the mornings of January 19 (7:26 a.m. for 13 minutes and 4 seconds), January 20 (8:22 a.m. for 6 minutes and 21 seconds) and January 21 (7:38 a.m. for 13 minutes and 47 seconds). **Brady also took the unprecedented step of inviting Jastremski to the QB room in Gillette Stadium on January 19 for the first and only time that Jastremski can recall during his twenty-year career with the Patriots, and Brady sent Jastremski text messages seemingly designed to calm Jastremski (“You good Jonny boy?”; “You doing good?”). For his part, Jastremski sent Brady text messages confirming that he was okay (“Still nervous; so far so good though”) and cautioning Brady about questioning (“FYI...Dave will be picking your brain later about it. He‟s not accusing me, or anyone...trying to get to bottom of it. He knows it‟s unrealistic you did it yourself...”).**

None of that is in itself damning, but taken as a whole it paints a dark picture. 

&gt;**In addition, we believe it is unlikely that an equipment assistant and a locker room attendant would deflate game balls without Brady‟s knowledge and approval.**

For the record, neither do I. 

Later: 
&gt;**As discussed above, Brady‟s refusal to provide us with his own emails, text messages and phone records on relevant topics, in response to our narrowly tailored requests**, limited the evidence available for our review and analysis.

That right there is the kicker for me. Those requests were very narrow and I don't understand why Brady would feel the need to refuse access here.

Side note, the Georgia dome is, so far, the furthest walk from a body of water that you can trace back to the Mississippi.

**UPDATE:** All NFL stadiums are accessible via a water route. I'll post the list showing how each stadium is accessible later this afternoon. Right now I have to get back to doing actual work.

Here's the list of water way accessibility for every NFL stadium.

EDIT: I did not verify that every waterway was deep enough or large enough to navigate easily regardless of vessel size. I just found waterways on Google Maps and traced the nearest waterway to each stadium that could ""conceivably"" lead back major waterways. It was more an exercise to see if something like this could even be done under the best possible circumstances. Thanks for taking the time to read my giant wall of text.

vindicatednegro,bears,Bears,"It's hard to discuss this subject because a lot of people approach it in bad faith and try to support their own biases with the conclusions presented. One is tempted to put forth a litany of caveats before answering such questions to avoid, or at lest minimize, their statements being misinterpreted either willfully or by ignorance. What I'm saying is it devolves into racist bullshit. But it is a valid question. I'll try to break it down simplistically (so there are gonna be errors for the pedants):

Black people were brought to the United States and other colonies (Latin America, Caribbean) from West Africa. The conditions in West Africa produced people with a high proportion of fast twitch muscles as well as long limbs, especially legs (relative to, say, people of East Asian descent). Needless to say this didn't happen overnight. Anyway, what these traits boil down to in sports is speed. Had slaves been taken from East Africa (say Ethiopia, Somalia or the highlands Kenya), you'd have a bunch of skinny dudes with godly cardio.

The reason OLs are largely white is that the physical qualities required of that position are less about speed and more about size and absolute strength (compare and contrast with DLs who need to be pretty quick and fast). We are talking about a larger geographical range when we speak about the origins of linemen and this complicates the conversation but when you talk about a team like Wisconsin (Badgers fan) or really B1G teams in general, you are talking about regional recruiting in a region of the country with lots of German descent (and Nordic descent when you go up towards Minnesota). Far from all Germans are big just as far from all Scandinavians are big (I've lived in those parts of the world and we Americans would even consider them ""skinny"" nations but that's because the American diet is just so crazy) *but* they tend to have larger frames (especially average height) and more slow twitch fibers (as an overall proportion) than your average West African, not due to diet alone but also due to the same sort of pressures (environmental mostly) that shaped West Africans into speed demons. This means they have massive upper and lower body strength but a different ""power delivery"" profile; they'll squat more weight but, body weight being equal, will not achieve the same vertical jump ON AVERAGE (everything is on average).

The science behind this can be controversial because of history and racism and all that. But if you have been watching football for any length of time, especially NCAA and the combine, you'll know that Florida is the speed state. More generally, you'll know that they're faster and look like Greek Gods by the age of 16 below the Mason-Dixon line. You'll know that the aforementioned Midwest is the cradle of giant-ass, corn fed monsters who bench more than you'll ever squat, all in their sophomore year of high school. And if you've got half a head on your shoulders, you'll know these physical differences (based on averages which mean many people do and many peopled *don't* conform to the ""norm"") represent the most insignificant percentage of what constitutes a human being. And at this point I realize I've been writing this too long and that there are the theories of social push/pull factors which essentially cause people to self-sort themselves to positions according to their ""race"". This is more theory and less biology so much more debatable but not without merit.

The TL;DR as someone else said is that positions are filled by the best qualified candidates in a generally efficient manner (the wall of text above suggests how this sorting might occur).

DonEliado,falcons,Falcons,"In 1995 the Braves won the world series in game 6 by a score of 1-0 off a David Justice homerun. It was bittersweet for Atlanta fans who Justice had called out for their lack of support. 

The next year Justice was traded. He was extremely upset and badmouthed the City and the Braves organization. A few months later his marriage to Halle Berry fell apart. 

It is my belief that shortly thereafter, David Justice entered into a deal with Satan to curse the City of Atlanta to nothing but heartbreak and failure for all eternity. The city he had won a championship for exiled him and ruined his life. He wanted to make sure they would pay. 

In the nearly two decades after, the curse has claimed all the cities major franchises and even nearby college football teams. The braves continued their success but never won another championship. The Falcons rose up in 2012 only to blow a halftime lead in the NFC championship game while a wide open Harry Douglas fell down in what should have been the game winning touchdown pass to send them to the Super bowl. You already know what will happen to the Hawks this year. Streak into the playoffs, and get bounced out in the first round. 

It is the curse of David Justice. Not only to lose, but to get your hopes up enough, to be just good enough that you start to believe, and then  WHAM, heartbreak. 

So to answer the question, Dan Quinn needs to go offer David Justice a hefty coaching contract and the City of Atlanta needs to issue him a formal apology so he agrees to lift the curse, maybe an exorcism.
