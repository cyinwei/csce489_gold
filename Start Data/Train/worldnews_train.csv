"fappan_gaems","","","This is happening in at least 12 cities. 7 have been confirmed so far with arrests, and operations to stop it are happening in at least another 5 (and probably far more, in reality). These abuses have been going on for more than 20 years in some of these cities. The reason it's not been dealt with is simple: something like 98% (of the people currently charged with it) are Pakistani males. Not only are they Muslim, but they are a specific racial minority (and nationality). What has genuinely occurred is that police and social workers are so afraid of being called racist that this has been continually swept under the rug, something which is still going on in newspapers like The Guardian to this very day.

Here's an article from 2011 where the Guardian are trying to downplay the obvious cultural element in an incredibly disingenuous way:
http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jan/07/grooming-racialising-crime-tradition

If you can't be bothered to read the above - which I don't blame you for - the Guardian refers to the links being drawn between Muslims/Pakistanis and this kind of organised abuse ""dubious"". They later go on to admit that they are reporting on an article originally published in The Times, and the figure they think shows only a ""dubious"" link is that 50/56 people arrested for this crime (in the entire Midlands and the North of the country) were from that demographic. It's a small sample size, yes, but it's a hell of a statistical artifact if it is one. I'd like to see what those figures are like now, 3 years down the line. Something tells me the sample size has grown, but the distribution is probably the same or worse. I'm unsure what the numbers are, because The Guardian have stopped publishing them. Hmm.

Check the Guardian's output from this week, and you'll see the exact same thing still happening. At least one person from the above comments section states that they know a policeman who said that Muslim police officers were being removed from investigating these cases after it was found that evidence has a tendency to disappear if they are allowed to. There are also unconfirmed reports of witness intimidation on a fairly wide scale associated with these cases.

In 2001, concerned parents of the girls being abused went to Nick Griffin of all people after no-one else did anything regarding their concerns, including the council and the police. An MP was specifically aware of this case and also did nothing. Nick Griffin went on to condemn the abuse of young white girls (who make up the vast majority of the victims, with a very small minority being Bangladeshi) in a speech he gave in 2004. The result? He was secretly filmed, and ended up in court on two charges of inciting racial hatred. These charges were thrown out of court, but it's amazing how accurate his allegations actually were for someone so insane. He's effectively owed a public apology as far as I'm concerned.

This is what the EDL have been shouting about for years. I used to mock them, and laugh at their paranoia. I'm not fucking laughing now, they were almost completely right about this issue. Funnily enough when the EDL and UAF marched in the same places I favoured UAF. Dispatches, a documentary series on Channel 4, attempted to air an episode about the issue 2 years ago. UAF pressured them into pulling it. UAF have a very high muslim membership. Doesn't take a genius to put the pieces together.

Culturally, I believe the cause of this is a combination of sexual frustration (since people from within the Muslim community are not allowed sex before marriage), and the view that non-Muslim women are basically the lowest form of life and worthy of no respect. This has been confirmed again and again by quotes from those charged, too. As for why it's specifically Pakistan, I don't know. Until we as a society dare to have this discussion, it will continue. 

There's also, to add to the disgusting nature of this, a very strong appearance of the media refusing to cover these stories because they know it adds fuel to the extreme right's fire. Of course, in reality, this strategy has backfired, because not only is the abuse happening, it seems the establishment and the media have been in cahoots in covering it up for decades. If you live in Rotherham, where 1500 girls are confirmed to have been raped over the past 10 years as a result of these gangs, you'd be fucking insane to vote for Labour, who let this happen. The only remaining option would be UKIP. Good job, media.

I'm also used to seeing the exact same kind of denial of reality on Reddit, so I will be surprised if this ends up with positive votes. I know I'm right, though, and the more people deny reality, the worse this will get.",1425492456,"","1425496058",2,344,"worldnews"

edit: some people have brought up the point that if you release the name, there might be more victims who come forward. that's a valid point but there has to be a balance between protecting the rights and privacy of the accused (who might actually be innocent), and making it possible to collect enough evidence to convict a guilty person. in this case i think its unfair that some one becomes a pariah and basically has their life ruined (nobody wants to hire the accused rapist/drunk driver/etc. they saw on TV, much less put them in a customer-facing position) before they even stand trial.

Looks like he had an episode before, which said he required ongoing psychological checks. Maybe he was entering or in another episode, and always dreamed about going out this way, and knew he wouldn't have another chance if he was evaluated again.

People in a real depressive episode don't process things properly. He's a dick for taking everyone else out with him, but chances are he never really processed it.

The second he touched the autopilot he had no way out. If he let them back in, he'd be asked why he touched it, and he'd never be allowed to fly again, and would need to find some other way out.


He knew he'd die doing something he liked, and it would be absolutely instant.


Completely selfish, but maybe the same guy under medication, or in the right frame of mind, would be horrified by the thought of him doing that.


It's always struck me how Stephen Fry described bi-polar disorder. When you're depressed, you don't care about anything. You're not working properly. People can say there's no reason to feel down, that they're there for you, or you'll leave loved ones behind, or they won't understand it because he's rich, but nothing anyone could say or do would give any relief, or make you care. It's literally a fault in the brain making you experience morbid depression for no reason. You're prevented from even feeling care. It's a real cognitive fight. We are dominated by our feelings. We all know we should exercise more, eat less, read more, study more, sleep early, turn off the PC, wake up early. All make cognitive sense. We come to those conclusions ourselves, and even weak emotions override those plans.


Just as you can take MDMA and feel like you understand everything, and feel euphoric, for absolutely no reason; depression can make you feel completely hopeless, completely without care of empathy, for absolutely no external reason.


There's no justification or care, he brain is broken and is subjecting his consciousness to unbelievably strong feelings to the point logic goes out the window.


A faulty part on the pilot put the plane in the side of a mountain. One that should have had regular checks for airworthiness.


He should perhaps have seeked help when he first started noticing it, but that kind of recognition requires cognitive therapy. Perhaps the thought of him being grounded and not being able to fly again was enough for him to delay past the point of no return.


The US system of having two people on the flight deck might have been enough to stop him. I doubt he was violent. He just saw an easy way out, and switched off.



What he did was fucking awful. He's a killer of school children, and other innocents, but I see it more like a faulty actuator screw gear, than an act of terrorism or other evil. What a sad thing to have happened.



If it doesn't make sense to you, got take some ecstasy, and do nothing but lay in bed. No partying, just try put yourself in the most boring situation. See all the ways you try and rationalise why you feel good that aren't down to the direct effect the drug is having on the very core of what guides your conscious thought. Try and convince yourself you're bored, or uncomfortable. Try and think of all the reasons why your life sucks, and you should be sad. Try and be objective in all of this. Notice how everything seems fixable? Or you have all the answers?


No imagine the opposite of that. The guy was a faulty part of the aircraft. Shouldn't have been allowed to fly in that condition. I feel sorry for him now. And I think what he did was disgusting.

This doesn't even make sense.  Is it nuclear fuel? Radiation?  I think they mean ""Radioactive contaminant leak"", but their terminology is very confusing.

&gt;Radiation levels at the tsunami-hit plant measured 50 to 70 times greater than usual

This is outright wrong. It was not ""total radiation levels at the plant"".  If that were the case, then we would have an actual emergency on our hands.

&gt;Sensors at the Fukushima nuclear plant have detected a fresh leak of highly radioactive water to the sea

So they mean, ""radiation levels **at one point** in the plant measured 50 to 70 times greater than usual"", but even that doesn't tell us anything without knowing what ""usual"" is.

The water they hold is only technically ""nuclear waste water"".  Their dose levels are far lower than IAEA recommended guidelines for drinking water, and probably safer than the tap water in your home.

&gt;TEPCO has not been able to effectively deal with an increasing amount of contaminated water, used to cool the crippled reactors and molten fuels inside them

Also inaccurate. By volume, almost all of the contaminated water is groundwater that has leaked into the basements of reactor buildings 1-3.  Also, the groundwater that is stored in tanks has been purified and is basically pure water with heightened levels of tritium.  (Does not bioaccumulate in water as it is chemically identical to water. Any sane radiation contamination engineer would suggest dumping it into the ocean to purify it, but TEPCO does not take this option because of the PR nightmare.)",1424615159,"","1424615440",1,410,"worldnews"

1. Make sure to tweet something like 'oh, won't someone think of the muslims, please be safe tonight' - if you can get the tweet out while those French bodies are still warm, that's even better!

2. hashtag#notallmuslims - show solidarity. Your fracturing national identity and continuing cultural turmoil ain't no biggy; just make sure them muslim feelings aren't too hurt.

3. When you encounter anyone criticizing Islam, make sure you call them an Islamophobe and a racist. Ignore their arguments - even if you suspect that they may contain logic - and focus entirely on how they hate muslims because they're brown. If they bring up eastern european and african islamic countries, block and report them on twitter and write an e-mail to their employer.

4. State 'islam isn't the problem; it's the geopolitics of the region!'. This makes you appear informed of the complex situation in the middle east.

6. Make sure to worry about the hatecrimes muslims will face in the wake of this attack.

"heisgone","","","In Quebec, the question of integration has been well debated for quite a while. First, a little bit of historical background. Until the 60s, the French-speaking population had less political and economical power. Industries were controlled by English-speaking people and the Catholic Church was more than happy to keep the French submissive. Then came the social revolution of the 60s and 70s which too away all the Church influence. A strong sense of Nationalism developed along with a separatism movement. The cultural identity in Quebec developed itself in opposition with the rest of Canada. One of those differences was the question of Multiculturalism which was championed at the Federal level (originally by a French-speaking Prime Minister who opposed the separatist movement, but let's not complicate things here). 

The idea of multiculturalism goes against the idea of nationalism. For the English-speaking part of Canada, multiculturalism was a way to move beyond his colonial past. Meanwhile in Quebec, the question of cultural identity was alive and well. It led to a variety of demands by the province, notably the rights to evaluate potential immigrants, laws to defends the French language, a separation referendum that was defeated by 1%, etc.

In the early 2000, there was a host of incidents with immigrants asking for special permission. The most prominent case was about a 12 year-old bold Sikh that was refused to wear his Kirpan (a form of traditional knife) in school. In 2006, the Supreme Court ruled that the prohibition was against The Charters Of Rights And Freedom, and that companies and government had to provide ""reasonable accommodation"" to religious demands. 

This caused a lot of controversy in Quebec. Meanwhile, Muslisms were under the spotlight, notably regarding the right of covering one's face in public. Government were scratching their head on how there were going to handle each individual demands. What is a reasonable demand? What is a reasonable accommodation? 

In 2007, a village of 1200 souls in the middle of nowhere, Hérouxville, drafted a ""Life code"" for there village. It was intended to inform immigrants about how we are supposed to live in Quebec. It was a 5 pages document telling that stoning people was a big no-no, genital mutilation was forbidden and that burning women alive isn't really acceptable.

While this was met with quite a bit of derision, it did ignite a serious discussion on ethnical integration. A commission was created to ask Quebecers their opinion on the matter. It toured all around the province, and every evening it was live on T.V.. Everyone was allowed to speak so it was quite of a show. It didn't lead to anything concrete but it certainly had some therapeutic effect. 

The question of integration was somewhat left on the side until the separatist party took power in 2012 as a minority government and made the creation of a [Quebec Charter Of Values](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec_Charter_of_Values) his top priority. They went back in election in 2014, hoping to win a majority, but were defeated. Quebecers were uncomfortable with the Charter, which was judged to be too radical. It was close to the French doctrine of Laïcité, notably forbidding all prominent religious signs for government workers. At the same time, they were seen as hypocrite since they didn't want to remove a Crucifix  that is on display at Quebec National Assembly. 

So, the current government is probably going to implement a softer version of the Charter. The debate is still going strong and all those events is adding fuel to it.",1423979584,"","1423979895",1,83,"worldnews"

&gt;**NASA Mars Rover's Weather Data Bolster Case for Brine**
&gt;
&gt; ...
&gt;
&gt; **Perchlorate identified in Martian soil by the Curiosity mission**, and previously by NASA's Phoenix Mars Lander mission, **has properties of absorbing water vapor from the atmosphere and lowering the freezing temperature of water.** This has been proposed for years as a mechanism for possible existence of transient liquid brines at higher latitudes on modern Mars, despite the Red Planet's cold and dry conditions.
&gt;
&gt; New calculations were based on more than a full Mars year of temperature and humidity measurements by Curiosity. They indicate that conditions at the rover's near-equatorial location were favorable for small quantities of brine to form during some nights throughout the year, drying out again after sunrise. Conditions should be even more favorable at higher latitudes, where colder temperatures and more water vapor can result in higher relative humidity more often.
&gt;
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; ""**We have not detected brines, but calculating the possibility that they might exist in Gale Crater during some nights** testifies to the value of the round-the-clock and year-round measurements REMS is providing,"" said Curiosity Project Scientist Ashwin Vasavada of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, one of the new report's co-authors.
&gt;
&gt; ...

TL;DR the conditions are possible for brine (salt water) to form during *some* nights. They haven't discovered the brine, only calculated that it could exist.

**Well, maybe we can start talking about how this is not a new mistake? Eisenhower and Iran, a timeline of the consequences.**

*     Standard Oil agrees to split oil revenue with Saudi Arabia on a 50/50 basis in 1950.
*     Iran tells the UK that the existing 5% royalties for their oil just isn't going to cut it. They want half the money, too.
*     UK says fuck you to Iran. Secretly asks US for ""help."" Truman says no.
*     UK imposes sanctions against Iran--cutting off their own oil supply. The UK has to switch back to coal for electricity. The ""London Fog"" air pollution episode of 1952 kills 4,000 UK citizens.
*     UK secretly asks US for ""help"" and uses the word communism. Eisenhower says yes.
*     US CIA overthrows Iranian government. Installs puppet: The Shah in 1953
*     Iran gets 50% revenue anyway.
*     Shah is a vicious dictator for 30 years while the people of Iran learn that the CIA did the deed that took their democratically elected government from them.
*     Shah finally overthrown in 1979... by **an Islamist Theocracy. Religion was the only speech not censored by Shah--so it was his only organized opposition. Again, Religion was the only organized opposition.**
*     US Hostage Crisis 1979-1980.
*     Saudi king promotes conservative non-tolerant version of Islam as a response to Iran. Wahhabism was the family religion but now it is the national religion.
*     In 1979, the Russians invade Afghanistan--partly because they want to build an oil pipeline.
*     Saudi Wahhabist doctrine includes the idea of Jihad--and they try it out in Afghanistan.
*     US gives weapons to Saddam. Iran-Iraq war, 1980s.
*     US gives weapons to Saudi Jihadis in Afghanistan. Defeat Russians in 1989.
*     Saddam uses US weapons to invade Kuwait 1990. First gulf war. US installs military bases in Saudi Arabia and doesn't leave at war's end. The Islamists view the US bases as occupation. Jihad anyone?
*     US becomes target of Jihadis with WTC bombing of 1993.
*     US is still target of Jihadis in 1998. USS Cole and Kenyan embassy bombings.
*     911 ... and you probably know the rest.

History is not so different from people--if you watch what countries do, you can ignore what they say.

tl;dr Eisenhower was vaguely interested in opposing communism and inadvertently sparked the Islamist movement. Religion is the only answer that possibly believes it can defeat the undefeatable US military force. Religion as the basis of governing in the 21st century is approximately insane--but it's the only actual choice. Mossedegh PROVED that oil producers can't expect modern highly evolved diplomacy to be in good faith. Any answer other than faith-based is completely irrational because... you know you will lose.

Additional reading for the curious... (note: I am barely an amateur historian but I do like to read. Ask at/r/AskHistorians if you want the real deal) Strong recommend that you watch what politicians DO, not what they SAY. There is a fairly strong case that both World Wars were partially about that strange strategic resource: oil. As WWI started, Germany and Turkey (Ottoman Empire) agreed to build a railway to transport... oil. The UK had already begun shipping oil on ships.

* Winston Churchill. In 1911 he served as the UK's [First Lord of the Admiralty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill#First_Lord_of_the_Admiralty). His agenda? Convert the UK Navy from Coal to Oil. Single-handedly, he convinced the UK body politic that oil was a strategic material and worthy of military intervention. He was very instrumental in the signing of the first UK/Iran oil contracts. One of the first military orders of WWI was simple: ""Protect Baghdad."" Most of the weirdness of 20th century middle east politics traces right back to Churchill. When he said ""Never Ever Ever give up.""--I think he meant oil.
* Theodore Roosevelt. [Also a Navy man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt#Assistant_Secretary_of_the_Navy) and specifically the guy who arranged for the US to begin 'projecting power' overseas. During his presidency he invented what came to be known as the 'American Century' by strongly advocating for the near imperialism that the US is so often criticized about today. Sadly, it was normal in those times for racist ideology to drive policy. The Philippines were occupied because the people were considered too childish for self governance. Roosevelt launched a world tour of the US Navy to show off our military prowess: ""The Great White Fleet.""

It's always been a tranquil place for me although if [this article](http://wpolityce.pl/polityka/112967-o-czekistach-ktorzy-przezyli-swoja-smierc-czyli-dziwy-na-cmentarzu) is correct (unfortunately only in Polish) it tells a sad story of 2147 people majority of which fought the Nazis when the frontline moved and the rest being part of a political machine of oppresion of any Polish resistance that followed the army. Basically a story of Red Army coming into Poland - a lot of heroes in the front followed by a bunch of [chekists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheka) and other scum. *Fun fact - the guy that created the Cheka was Polish*.The source is sometimes deemed as biased but it is well written. 

Basically, us and the Soviet Union was always a complicated story.

Back to the point - when I was young, my imagination often went to all these Red Army soldiers that died in a foreign land, far from home, fighting Nazi Germany. Yeah - probably there were bad people there as well - but most of them wanted to defeat the Nazis and free our brothers Slavs of the Nazi scourge. That was clear for me. It was simple thinking but simple works when you're 15/16. The names on the graves IIRC are Ukrainian, Russian and I believe there are also Gerogian and Tatar names there. Guys that I believe wanted to fight the Nazi machine and who sincerely believed that it was the right thing to do. And I was somehow grateful to these specific individuals for that.

And now 60 years later this fucking clown comes in and basically slaps Russians, Georgians, Tatars, Belorussians in the face saying that it was *exclusively* Ukrainians that liberated Auschwitz. I know a few Ukrainians and all of them know it wasn't true. Yeah, they were there, the Russians were there, hell - the Polish were also there.

And now we have a guy that's making an unnecessary statement and it reminds of a dog that can't really bite because he's too small but at least he'll bark. 

Why do it? It's untrue, unjust and simply stupid to say shit like this. And to say it for some kind of political benefit to ride on the anti-Russian climate.

I am at a loss for words. And that's when I remembered the cementary and felt ashamed that my government is trying to use an ultimate sacrifice as a tool to bite contemporary Russia in the ass.

It's shameful.

It's news from Argentina, I saw it posted in /r/Brasil ([here](http://www.reddit.com/r/brasil/comments/36bhw4/pena_por_abuso_%C3%A9_reduzida_porque_v%C3%ADtima_de_6_anos/)) when the same ""news"" got to brazilian newspaper.

A user on the comments found the legal document that refers to the case. He read it and posted his conclusions. I read it as well and could not see *anything* saying that the kid being homosexual had something to do with the sentenced being reduced.

The change in the sentence was because the guy got some ""penalties"" for aggravating evidence/testimonies the first time, which caused the sentence to be the maximum or more than that. Reviewing the case the judges found these evidence was not valid and so the aggravating circumstances didn't exist, so his sentence should not be the one originally given.

From what I could understand, the original sentence was considering that the abuser took advantage of the kid's social situation (his parents were gone and his grandmother neglected him). It was proven that he didn't know about this situation, and so the time that was added because of taking advantage of it had to be corrected.

The document says something about sexual orientation, but I think it's something about increasing his sentence because his actions led the boy to being gay... and by the testimonies it could be seem he already had ""decided"" his sexual orientation prior to the abuse.

I do not agree with the little time the abuser got, but it was within the law (that I also think is not strict enough). The revision of the case was so that it would comply with the law.

I also don't agree with involving the kid's sexual orientation in any point of the case, and with that it could or could not be proven that he was gay at 6 years old, before the abuse.

Anyway, from what I understood his being gay or not had nothing to do with and would not affect the case in any way. I may be wrong about that, because my legal spanish is not very good.

**TL;DR: What I did understand is the sentence was reduced because the abuser didn't know the kid was neglected.**

The original document in spanish can be seem [here](http://www.scribd.com/doc/265719184/Reduccion-de-Pena-Piombo#scribd).

--------------------------------------


Edit: It seems the sentence always states that they removed the ""aggravations"" because the child did not turn gay because of the abuse, besides the neglection thing.

I'll be looking for the original first sentence document tonight so I can understand this better.

--------------------------------------


*(Also, thanks for the gold, I'm glad to be contributing to the discussion =))*

--------------------------------------------

Edit 2:

Ok, so I looked for the original sentence and could not find it. Some people in the comments below made translations of the controversial paragraph, and it can be interpreted in many ways. Some argentines also brought their interpretation and agreed it's not easy to understand and can be read in different ways.

What is clear for me, from the text and the law itself is that *the sentence was not reduced because the kid is gay*, as some articles are saying.

It's not clear if the paragraph about sexual orientation (mentioned below) was taken into account in the judges decision, but if it was it's still within the law. What is says is ""the child was already gay and didn't turn gay because of the abuse"". Even tho I personally don't think you can say a 6 year old is gay or not, even if he shows precocious sexual inclinations (which I think would be a reflex of his surroundings), I also don't think it's correct to say abusing the child is what makes his sexual orientation one thing or another.

So, if it was the case that the judge removed the ""turned him gay"" aggravation from the sentence, it may have been for the wrong reason, but the result would be the same if it was for the right one (if considered by someone who doesn't see being gay as a perversion). 

What *is* clear in the text, and what I stated in the first place is that the judge removed the aggravation of taking advantage of the victim because of his social situation, since there was no indication of the abuser's knowledge of said situation. I don't think there can be any doubts about that paragraph.

That said, I have read the articles of the law used to convict the abuser and I can't make sense of why the sentence was reduced to 3 years, since, even removing the aggravations mentioned before, the minimum time for sexual abuse with ""carnal access"" is of 6 years. **So that is still unclear**.

**I want to make it clear that in no way I'm in favor of the sentence, of how the case was treated and of involving the victim's sexual orientation in any way of this.** All I want is for people to look beyond sensationalism and direct their anger in the right direction. In my case, I think attentions should be directed towards the law itself. That is what has to change and what we have to be angry about, not that it was applied to a case as terrible as this was.

TL;DR 2 : The text is confusing. There are 2 factors that made the abuse ""outrageous"" (according to law): *1) the kid was neglected*, *2) the kid turned gay*. They clearly reduced time for *1) the abuser didn't know* and not as clearly may or may have not taken in consideration *2) the kid was already gay*.",1432224330,"","1432263429",1,844,"worldnews"

&gt; ... it is undeniable that Russian provocateurs and regular forces are active within the Ukraine. 
&gt; 
Before we even go into hard evidence, specifics, it should be self evident; for one, the man at the heart of the separatist movement -- Igor Girkin, alias ""Strelkov"" -- was, of his own admission, in the employment of the Russian FSB until 2013. From [this article](http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/russias-igor-strelkov-i-am-responsible-for-war-in-eastern-ukraine/511584.html), we have the magnificent quote: *""If our unit hadn't crossed the border, in the end everything would have fizzled out, like in Kharkiv, like in Odessa.""* And that was on /r/worldnews' front page only days ago!
&gt; 
Secondly, there's the fact that [Russia denied it was involved in Ukraine](http://en.ria.ru/russia/20140304/188087074/Putin-Denies-Sending-Russian-Troops-to-Crimea.html), only for Putin to later [confess *""Of course our troops stood behind Crimea's self-defence forces*
""](http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/04/17/russia-putin-crimea-idUKL6N0N921H20140417). Russia's word is fundamentally untrustworthy. 
&gt; 
[Rebel leader Alexander Zakharchenko has also attested that 1,200 of his fighters spent 4 months training in Russia](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-28817347). So even if Russia is not directly involved, we have it from the rebel's own lips that they are training and arming them. 
&gt; 
Does anybody remember the ten Russian paratroops (VDV) which apparently entered the Ukraine by mistake, and were apprehended? [Here's the link](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-28934213). The thing is, those paratroops belonged to the 98th Guards Airborne Division. Of the 98th Airborne, you have the 331st and 1065th regiments. Both are based out of Kostroma. Coincidentally, in [this article](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/29/us-ukraine-crisis-prisoners-idUSKCN0HO1MP20140929) you have two Ukrainian soldiers, belonging to separate units, both attesting they had fought Russian VDV out of Kostroma. 
&gt; 
On the subject of the VDV, [we then have the captured APC's with the documents of Russian paratroopers, paratroopers of the Pskov division's No. 74268 Brigade](http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/ukraine-gets-new-evidence-of-russian-soldiers-fighting-on-its-turf-photos-361543.html).
&gt; 
A basic understanding of the timeline of the content also demonstrates Russian involvement. Before the *massive* [Russian humanitarian convoy in August](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2014/08/russia-aid-convoy-moving-into-ukraine-201482282413556411.html), the Ukrainian army were on a veritable blitz, [ capturing a number of towns including Pervomaisk, Kalynove and Komyshuvakha](http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/218108.html), [tightening the noose around Donetsk](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-28724487) and [reclaiming much of Luhansk](http://news.yahoo.com/fighting-outside-key-ukrainian-city-kills-9-troops-091723576.html). Then, out of nowhere, a counteroffensive turns the tide. The rebels [capture Novoazovsk](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-28951319), and suddenly they're on the [doorstep of Mariupol](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/04/russia-rebels-ceasefire-approaches-ukraine).  That is not coincidental. 
&gt; 
Now let's dig into hard evidence. 
&gt; 
[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkRtOSk1tps) we have a handy camcorder video, from our friends the Separatists. They claim, as in the title, that's a T-72M; a common piece of Soviet surplus which the Ukrainian Army has never operated. They also claim to have captured it from the UA. Weird, huh? Despite that, there's another problem; that's not a T-72M. It's a T-72B3 -- a modernized variant of the T-72 which is operated exclusively by the Russian Federation, and is immediately distinguishable by its French *Thales* night-vision and reactive armour. The video gives a nice close up of those distinguishing features. 
&gt; 
On the subject of T-72B3's, we have [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKpsybu-x64) footage of another T-72, with a convoy of MT-LB's. It's clearly a modernized variant, as you can see from its reactive armour, though a definite identification is difficult. 
&gt; 
[More](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iWDkn-6mak) T-72's. Again, it's hard to tell what variants they are, but one wonders where they're getting so many T-72's when the modern UA pretty much exclusively operates T-64's. 
&gt; 
[Here we have a T-72BM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL-yofb3HzU), happily driving alongside an MT-LB Strela 10M and a BTR-ZD ""Skrezhet"" -- which is flying the flag of the Sevastopol Naval Infantry. That video was filmed outside Luhansk, and the International Institute for Strategic Studies [does not think it is a hoax](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-28961080). 
&gt; 
[Here](http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=2e1_1415920466), you have an interesting case of deja vu. The same MSTA-S, identified from Youtube videos, has been seen in Russia and Ukraine. It's worthy to note that those numbers are actually shorthand for ""oversized cargo"". 
&gt; 
Whilst people may suspect the [NATO satellite images](http://www.businessinsider.com.au/nato-satellite-photo-evidence-russia-lying-about-ukraine-2014-8), they corroborate what we've been seeing so far. 

&gt; And more:

&gt; I'd also like to bring up the fact that we have *video evidence*, actual footage, of these Russian convoys. Columns of Kamaz trucks which stretch out literally for miles.

&gt; [Here](http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=056_1409727656) we have a convoy of BMP's, Kamaz trucks and T-72's. Roughly 150 vehicles in all.

&gt; [Here](http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=056_1409727656) we have a UAZ, a T-72 and a 2S1 Gvozdika in Donetsk Oblast.

&gt; Those videos are a pretty big step up from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodMqzF37ME), which is the sort of convoy you'd expect separatists to have. That was on the 28th of April. You've got a BTR, which they could have plausibly captured, as well as a civilian lorry and an anti-aircraft cannon towed by a bus.

&gt; And here we have a clueless Separatist operating a 12,7 KSVK rifle, which is exclusively operated by the Russian Federation:

"LFT184","","","This is actually quite a bold statement. Orthodox Marxism is very hostile to religion in general. You know the famous quote ""Religion is the opiate of the masses"" from Marx's introduction to the unwritten Zur Kritik der Hegelschen Rechtsphilosophie. The actual quote is in English is: ""Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people.""

Marx was hostile to religion as he believed it to be a similar distraction imposed on the workers just as nationalism, race, party politics are to prevent the workers from rebelling and realizing they are all in the same category of downtrodden serfs. To prevent rebellion, some subcategories of the workers were made better than their cohorts so that the infighting and competition would occupy their time and minds rather than seeing the true class distinction.

There is a reason the French Revolution was so determined to rid the land of the Church's influence not only as one of the governmental estates but also their hold on the people. It was a fight between religious superstition and Enlightenment reason. 

The hold of the Church on state politics might have become more hidden, but such power and influence does not disappear over day and night. It adapts because those in power have the means and resources to adapt.

The Vatican is also probably the largest money laundering bank in the world. They have vast financial resources and ties to influential people. It is not a secret that the mafia mainly launders their money in the Vatican and surely their patronage network does not only extend to mobsters and old men wanting to become bishops. The Church was always a master player in the courts of kings and emperors. It is doubtful they gave up that mechanism of power but learned it is better to appear to have than to risk another de-Christianization attempt a la the French Revolution.

Cuba has always claimed to be Marxist-Lenninst (Stalinist), and a primary tenant of that is atheism. As Cubans Old Guard dies, the Castros seem to giving up their previous ideology piecemeal. THey couldn't do this while their revolutionary comrades still ran the country because doing so would risk destabilization by infighting. Now that they are dead or dying, the Castros may have realized the old way is finished and want to join the capitalist globalized world simply because *it works*.

The American Empire may have many drawbacks in this imperfect world, but it is better than any previous empire in the history of the world. The crimes they commit may be horrendous, but for the common billions of workers, they are living in a dream come true that their ancestors never thought possible. 

Marx predicted the Victorian state of affairs of worker exploitation (not saying workers aren't exploited today) would continue and spread as well as advance to even worser states causing a workers' rebellion. Obviously this hasn't happened as the standard of living for the workers' has drastically improved, but naturally the gap between bourgeois and proletariats still exists.

In addition, people here slamming US tax payer aid ignores that that a lot of the aid that mandates buying *American* equipment means that money flows back to the US. Yes, some of it goes to the leadership of those companies, but do people realize how many tens to hundreds of thousands of employees are employed by Lockheed Martin and subcontractors (which range from other corporations to mom &amp; pop operations manufacturing specific parts)? Or that the money often ends up in the form of grants to university labs and research labs for R&amp;D?

It's easy to slam the foreign aid, but people conveniently forget that money largely flows back into the pockets of Americans.

In addition, the Camp David Accords is why Israel and Egypt get as much money as they do - we're basically bribing the two sides to stop fighting each other, each of which were many magnitudes larger than the Israeli-Palestinian conflicts of the past few decades. The cost of the financial aid is a lot lower than the cost of those wars.

------
edit: It seems like I've touched on a lot of nerves, so let me expound on my views.

Prior to the 1979 Camp David Accords, Arab-Israeli war was a daily occurrence. The primary player for the Arab side, and considered the leader of the Arab nations (and certainly its military powerhouse), was Egypt. The wars routinely involved Egypt and Syria, with support from other Arab countries like Iraq, Jordan, Libya, Lebanon, etc. against Israel. 

The recent Israeli-Palestinian wars pale in comparison. We're talking about hundreds of thousands of troops and tens of thousands killed. They weren't just the Six Day War (in which tens of thousands of Arabs were killed in 6 days) or the 1973 Yom Kippur War, there was also low level conflict that occurred such as the War of Attrition from 1967-1970.

The 1979 Camp David Accords changed all that - the US deftly flipped Egypt, the main powerhouse of the Arab world, onto its side, ending Arab attempts at destroying Israel militarily. In addition, the US already had a long standing alliance with Saudi Arabia [forged by FDR when he met King Ibn Saud, the founder of Saudi Arabia](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ac/FDR_on_quincy.jpg), which meant the Arab leaders were now on the American side. 

In exchange, the US provided military aid to both countries - this shifted the balance of power permanently so that Syria (now without Egyptian aid) could never militarily defeat Israel, now with US aid money buying more US equipment.

In addition, the Egyptian military aid built up the military as an institution in Egypt, which was already held in high praise after it successfully breached the defenses along the Suez Canal in 1973. Egyptian officers were invited to the US to study at the US War Colleges (President Sisi was one such person) and build close relationships with the US and learn US doctrines, including secular government leadership.

For better or worse, one can argue that the strong Egyptian military is what has kept Egypt together (even if it used questionable tactics) throughout the Arab Spring, enforcing secularist government - one look at neighboring Libya or nearby Syria, which had extremely weak military institutions (kept intentionally weak by the dictatorships) and are now in chaos between secular forces and Islamist militias fighting for control of their countries, and one can easily see why the Egyptian model is the preferred method over the alternatives. (Hell, many would argue the disbanding of the Iraqi Army in the wake of the US invasion was the biggest blunder of the war, as they would've been put to work immediately on keeping the country cohesive, just without Saddam's brutality at its leadership).

I think most of us would agree that $1-2 billion per year to Egypt and its military is far better and far cheaper than having to go in there and clean up if an ISIS or Islamist force takes over that country.

The question is also asked - what does $3 billion in foreign aid (or roughly $10 per citizen in the US) mean, and how does it affect me, the average American? After all, doesn't this money go to a small segment of the US employed in the defense industry?

We can argue about the defense industry and its role on the US economy all we want - its important to remember that the defense industry isn't just big corporations but also research labs and even PhD students who receive research grants from the government or said companies. But let's focus on the immediate impact of the Arab-Israeli peace:

In 1973, in the wake of the Yom Kippur War, the oil embargo by Arab OPEC nations quadrupled the price of world oil by the end of the 6 month embargo. That meant relatively high oil prices, extremely long lines at the pump (hours in some cases - and an estimated 20% of gas stations had no oil) -- all of which had direct impacts on the average American citizen. In addition, a big part of the economic recession in the 70s was blamed on this disruption - high oil prices meant higher costs of production and distribution of products, leading to job cuts and a downtrend in the economy.

The Suez Canal was also cut off due to the Arab Israeli War. A HUGE part of world trade flows through here - and I emphasize world, as this is where trade from Europe flows through to get to the Indian Ocean and so on, not to mention trade from the East Coast of the US to the same regions. 

So yes, the average American can and has definitely felt the impact of the Arab-Israeli war. Saying we'd rather spend the $3 billion in foreign aid per year to Israel on other things is understandable - after all, we don't directly see the impact of that easily in everyday life. But to say it won't or hasn't affected us before in huge ways is simply ignoring  a matter of history.",1424640304,"","1424647888",2,234,"worldnews"

Hardly war POWs, much less uniformed POWs.

They're simply carrying out their sentences of some men and a woman who have become ISIS and Islamist symbols.

Now, going forward, I'm interested in seeing how the execution of this pilot plays out in Jordan and the rest of the Arab world. For those that don't know it, Jordan is a pretty unique player in the region - despite being a tiny country (in terms of population), and being poor, it is one of the closest allies of the West AND is a key ally of neighboring countries, including Israel.

Its strategic position is obvious - it borders Israel, Syria, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Iraq. People can't flow from North Africa to Iraq or Syria and vice versa without passing through Jordan.

But its cultural position is what a lot of people don't quite realize. Jordan is a monarchy ruled by a western-educated (British, in fact) King (who happens to have been an extra on Star Trek once, but I digress). At the same time, the King traces his lineage directly back to the Prophet, and as thus his tribe draws fierce loyalty from the Bedouin that made up most of Jordan's population in its infancy.

In recent years of course, the flood of Palestinian, then Iraqi, and now Syrian refugees has placed huge burdens on the Jordanian government and its people. This is a country with few resources (and certainly no oil like its neighbors) yet has the most educated Arab country and one of the highest living indexes of any country in the region. 

Now why did I mention the cultural position? Because Jordan is the most westernized of Sunni Arab countries - they have one of the lowest rates of religious participation in the area, have a westernized-style of education, close ties with the West, etc.

But also because they present a considerable alternative to the despots in the region: To the east was Iraq, once ruled by the secular but brutal Saddam. To the north is Syria, ruled by Assad and his secular but also brutal regime. To the south, the absolute monarchy ruled by Saudi Arabia, which is also home to some of the most hardline citizens and clerics in the Sunni world. To the west is Egypt, which experimented with democracy but is back to its comfortable anti-Islamist military rule.

Yet here in Jordan there is a monarchy that has shown benevolent rule (the current King's father, King Hussein, was particularly loved by everyone in the Arab world, western world, and Israelis) with a country that despite its lack of resources has given its citizens a lot - certainly a lot more than its neighbors whom even with the riches of oil don't seem to get it, ever.

Jordan isn't a secular country either - 90% of its population is Muslim (10% are Christian) - but it is certainly moderate compared to its neighbors. I was shocked to find liquor stores in Amman and what not, certainly a nod to the sizeable Christian minority in the country. Likewise, while it uses Sharia law in some areas of law - notably family law - it has also adopted westernized secular laws in other areas as well.

Long story short: Jordan has been one of the sensible moderate Arab country in the region, and their reaction to this militant Sunni Islam of ISIS may tell quite a bit about how moderate Muslims will act in reaction to the pilot's murder. Their military and King have already promised revenge - and it is telling that the King wore his traditional Bedouin garb to deliver the speech.

&gt;There was no evidence of a carcinogenic effect related to glyphosate treatment. The lack of a plausible mechanism, along with published epidemiology studies, which fail to demonstrate clear, statistically significant, unbiased and non-confounded associations between glyphosate and cancer of any single etiology, and a compelling weight of evidence, support the conclusion that glyphosate does not present concern with respect to carcinogenic potential in humans.

Note that there was a weak but slight association with multiple myeloma that the authors suggest that further follow up is required. Also this was among applicators who inherently are exposed to significantly higher amounts of glyphosate than end product consumers.

  
Also a re-analysis of the AHS data failed to show the same link between glyphosate and multiple meyloma.

I am immensely proud of the work the police has done. We are not a country that is used to violent crime at all, and there has been no precedent attack that is comparable.

Despite this, our police officers managed to not only defend the public, and stop the attackers plans from succeeding. 

They were on site and present when the terrorist attacked the free speech debate, and as a result the attacker could not even reach his target. 
Later they again were already present at the Jewish synagogue and prevented the madman from even setting foot inside. Finally they also within 24 hours identified the attacker's whereabouts and killed him.

They did this without  causing panic despite our media's best attempts to illicit it. They protected us not only with their weapons but also with their bodies, as at least 5 officers have been injured. 

Two victims Dan Uzan and Finn Nørgaard have died, and while their deaths were tragic and senseless, I know that it would have been much worse had our officers not been as fast. The  police still managed to protect at least 80 people, at the synagogue and the debate meeting and stopped the terrorist from achieving any of his goals.

Seeing some of the nonsense being written here that the Synagogue was unprotected and had to fend for itself, and other unfounded claims is simply frustrating.  If any of it was true, we would have had several more victims to mourn.

Like advertising, you repeat something enough times and it becomes true in the minds of most.

Israel is being bullied by the Muslim masses and anti-US countries that thrive on making the US look bad. However, its only crime is defending itself.

Yes in defending itself shit happens, and critics love screaming such injustices to the high heavens, but this conflict wouldve been resolved decades ago if not for Muslim belligerence and wet dreams of supremacy. And sadly, this supremacy is not gone, it has instead been replaced by a facade of peace by Abbas and his ilk- who line their pockets as de facto dictators with donor funds, saying how they only want peace, all the while teaching their youth hatred in schools and media and inciting violence. Promising peace while they tell Arab media they will not accept anything less than 100% of Israel.

Funny enough this conflict has a resolution: stop giving Palestinians money. When the people in Hamas/PLO realize war with Israel is no longer an easy path to billions, and that attacks vs Israel and the effects of its reprisals will no longer be funded by the west...theyll negotiate based on the reality. Otherwise be ready for decades of conflict.

"lablaakings","","","” Unlimited tolerance must lead to the disappearance of tolerance. If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them.


In this formulation, I do not imply, for instance, that we should always suppress the utterance of intolerant philosophies; as long as we can counter them by rational argument and keep them in check by public opinion, suppression would certainly be unwise.


But we should claim the right to suppress them if necessary even by force; for it may easily turn out that they are not prepared to meet us on the level of rational argument, but begin by denouncing all argument; they may forbid their followers to listen to rational argument, because it is deceptive, and teach them to answer arguments by the use of their fists or pistols.



We should therefore claim, in the name of tolerance, the right not to tolerate the intolerant. We should claim that any movement preaching intolerance places itself outside the law, and we should consider incitement to intolerance and persecution as criminal, in the same way as we should consider incitement to murder, or to kidnapping, or to the revival of the slave trade, as criminal.”

I'm transcribing what I hear on France Info right now:

It's getting more complex because there are two hostage situations going on at the same time.

- One hostage, the two Kouachi brothers (who presumedly did the Charlie Hebdo shootings) in an industrial area in Dammartin-en-Goële, situation is ""under siege"", authorities try to open negociations.

- ""at least five"" hostages, one guy dual-wielding AK47s in Paris (Avenue de la Porte de Vincennes), shots fired, one wounded, the guy is the one who presumedly killed a policewoman yesterday in Montrouge. The guy apparently called the authorities himself at around 1pm. The siege is happening currently in a Koscher Store (or whatever ""hypermaché cacher"" translates to).

Before Putin came into power he had to be elected. Now the problem with this is the timing. At the time he was really more of a nobody and had corruption charges against him and Anatoly Sobchak, the guy who was actually running the show at that point. Putin showed that he had loyalty to Sobchak throughout the charges and was then looked at by Yeltsin and promoted to head of Federal Security Services as a stepping stone into power once Yeltsin left. Still, was pretty much an unknown rising to power because of his connections and loyalty. So he runs for president and it looks like he will most likely not win. Then there are a series of bombings of residential apartments in Russia. Putin blames Chechnya and from his post as FSS goes about with a plan to strike back and rallies support from the people and eventually gains the popularity to win all while the elections are delayed. Can't have elections while the bombings are happening, so Yeltsin delayed them. Now one other part to mention that draws us back to where we are now with this specific case, one bomb didn't go off. After the investigation it was shown this bomb was similar in size and placement to the other bombs. In addition, it was military grade explosives and linked back to the FSS. You know the department that Putin ran? He said it was a training exercise and he was not responsible for the other bombings, but rather Chechnya was even though there was no evidence of this.

"Peejjet","","","These engines start using compressed air from another engine or the APU (tiny, no thrust engine in the rear of plane) and when dealing with the plumbing of this extremely hot, compressed air the valves sometimes stick.  The engine takes this air and has a starter to convert this energy into rotational force to start the engine and this is usually done via a shaft and gears.  If the starter valves don't close, the starter will stay engaged and the engine will run but it just won't be happy.  On most planes it is a simple fix of manually closing that valve.  Sometimes we can do that while the engine is still running and continue to our destination to have maintenance fix the valve there.  Usually maintenance can just exercise the valve and it will test and work just fine.

"crackanape","","","A couple months ago they did the same thing at the university library in Mosul.

I did some work there a few years earlier. You can't believe how hard those people were working with the shittiest of resources. Hand-curated card catalogs, barely any working modern equipment, electrical outages, and even then the constant fear of violence in the ongoing, rumbling post-war chaos. Still they came in every day to make sure that whatever knowledge could be shared, was as available as possible.

One afternoon I was talking with the library director about how they got journals in. They couldn't afford to subscribe, but professors who traveled overseas would gather up whatever they could and bring them back. Their collection held a random smattering of whatever found its way to the library. Thinking he might find it interesting, I signed his computer on via an institutional account that grants access to most scholarly journals. I said good night, put on my contractually-mandated flak jacket, and headed out.

When I came in the next morning, he was still there, packed in alongside professors from all across the campus. He'd called in a friend, word had spread among the faculty, and they were queuing up to look up the latest articles in their fields of study and print them out. I think the printer had been going all night long. It was a wonder the building's erratic internet connection, which consisted of a lone ethernet cable strung through the trees to another building, hadn't gone down and signed him out.

It kills me to hear about all their work - and that of their predecessors for generations before - going up in smoke, because a few jeeploads of jackasses are so fearful of knowledge that they'd tear it all down like angry toddlers. 

Over the years I've heard that several of the people I worked with have been murdered by the various waves of pointless, angry insurgencies. Academics have been a frequent target, and Mosul's been particularly hard-hit.

"flynavy88","","","Egypt acknowledging they're bombing IS targets - and likely other Islamist targets in Libya - is a huge development.

Beware, long history post ahead. (I know this is highly simplified, but bear with me, it covers 60 years of history).

For people not familiar, Egypt has largely been considered the center of the Arab world for decades. Though its influence has waned a little in the last couple decades, as the oil rich Gulf countries took on a larger role in world affairs, Egypt's influence cannot be understated.

For one, Egypt is the most populous nation in the Arab world - its 80ish million people is more than double the next closest Arab nation, Algeria, and is roughly three times that of Saudi Arabia. Another is that a LOT of Arab culture flows through Egypt. It has one of the largest (if not largest) entertainment industries within the Arab world and although Arabic is spoken with variation throughout the Arab world, most everyone can understand Egyptian Arabic because of how much of this.

Most of all, Egypt has played a unique role at the heart of the modern Arab world. As a bit of a simplified history lesson, one has to go back to when Napoleon was defeated by the British in Egypt. The Muhammad Ali dynasty was founded which nominally swore fealty to the Ottoman Empire. Instead, however, it became a British protectorate and more or less became a British puppet from the 1800s on after after the British directly occupied Egypt in 1882, and became a full blown protectorate in 1914 when the Ottoman Empire declared itself on the side of the Central Powers. It would remain under British rule until 1952.

Now, what happened in 1952? Well in 1952, the Free Officers Movement, a military coup led by middle class junior officers, led the Revolution which overthrew and exiled the last ruler of the Ali dynasty. The Republic of Egypt was created and the British kicked out of Egypt.

Who was the leader of the Free Officers Movement? Gamal Abdel Nasser, a highly charismatic man who made pan-Arabism a major ideology of the Arab world throughout the 50s and 60s. Nasser and members of the Free Officers Movement espoused increased secularism and nationalism which angered the Muslim Brotherhood and Islamist groups in Egypt which helped overthrow the old King. As the new Constitution was created, which was very much focused on secularism and modernity, the Muslim Brotherhood was angered and street clashes erupted. 

A 1954 attempt on Nasser's life by a Muslim Brotherhood member was caught live on radio - in return, the leadership arrested and executed numerous Muslim Brotherhood leaders and banned the organization which remained banned until 2011.

Nasser's stature in the Arab world grew from this and grew even further in 1956, during the Suez Crisis, in which British, French, and Israeli troops were sent to the Suez Canal to prevent Egypt from nationalizing the canal and to overthrow Nasser. Militarily, the western coalition was quite successful. However, it suffered immense political backlash - both the US and USSR condemned their invasion and pressured them to withdraw. In fact, President Eisenhower went so far as to threaten the UK financial system - a sign many saw as the end of British world power and the ascent of American world power in the west.

It was a HUGE political victory for Nasser, who cemented his power in Egypt, and made him a huge hero in the Arab world. He had lived up to his reputation as an anti-imperialist, a champion of anti-European de-colonization, and a fighter of Israel. How far did it it reach? In fact, from 1958 to 1961, the United Arab Republic was declared which consisted of a political union between Egypt and Syria, with Nasser as its president.

His revolution in 1952 and his growth as a hero in the 1950s inspired many similar movements throughout the Arab world - in 1958, a similar group named the ""Free Officers"" overthrew and killed the last King of Iraq (a monarchy established by the British, no less). Those same organizers would later align themselves with the Baathists, of whom Saddam Hussein would help use and consolidate his power. Not surprisingly, he stylized himself as an Arab champion after Nasser.

Similarly, in 1963, a movement in Syria inspired by Nasser overthrew the secessionist government there and vowed to restore the United Arab Republic. That movement was led by the Baathists of Syria, of whom one of them was Hafez al Assad, who would later seize power and rule for decades and then pass on leadership of Syria to his son, the current President of Syria.

Similarly, in 1969, Muammar Gaddafi and a group of junior officers seized control of Libya and overthrew the King there (considered a puppet of Italy). 

All this time, of course, Nasser was trying to grow his pan-Arab movement to unite Arabs around the world against the divisions created by the imperial powers which had drawn up arbitrary borders on a map that divided the Arab world. To do so, he rallied the Arabs around the Palestinian cause. Indeed, Egypt was the primary military power that opposed Israel throughout the decades of the Arab-Israeli conflict.

Now, that certainly angered the Americans. More-so, the socialist-leaning Nasser received a lot of aid from the Soviet Union - which in turn put them even more at odds with the US. All of this made Nasser a hero amongst Arabs -- a big reason why many major cities in the Arab world has a Gamal Abdal Nasser street to this day - and a big reason why Egypt became a leader in the Arab world.

Where did things start to change? Well, Nasser died in 1970 from a sudden heart attack. His funeral drew an estimated 5 million to 7 million mourners and leaders from throughout the Arab world - it is rumored that Muammar Gaddafi even fainted twice.

His successor, President Anwar Sadat, would change a lot of things. For one, he began to sever ties with the Soviet Union, expelling Soviet military advisors in 1972 and reforming the Egyptian military. His offensive on Israel in 1973 during the Yom Kippur War ultimately failed militarily, but it came as such a shock and surprise to the Israelis -- and were the first major victories for the Arabs in the greater Arab-Israeli conflict -- that it was viewed as a huge success. It also gave Egypt the realization it could never defeat Israel militarily, however, and also shattered Israeli confidence in its invincibility. This became the impetus for both sides to begin discussing a peace treaty which culminated in the Camp David Accords of 1978, making Egypt the first Arab country to recognize Israel and returned the Sinai peninsula to Egypt.

This, however, sealed the end of the pan-Arab movement. In 1979, the Arab League suspended Egypt and move its headquarters out of Cairo. It would not come back until 1989. Furthermore, this unpopular move with Arabs around the world forced many to turn their attention to other Arab leadership -- countries like Saudi Arabia were quick to respond and espoused pan-Islam. After all, instead of ethnic unity trying to cross artificial borders, why not unite under common faith which no borders can stop?

President Sadat was assassinated in 1981 by Egyptian jihadists at a military parade who had a fatwa issued by a cleric later convicted of the 1993 WTC bombing. The assassins were tried, found guilty, and executed. Soon after, Vice President Mubarak would become President, a position he would hold for nearly 30 years until 2011.

As one can see, Egypt had played a huge role in the Arab world for decades. Though their allegiances shifted from the USSR to the US, they were a great example of the internal struggle facing Arab countries in the 20th century. Here was Egypt, a country with a secular and nationalist leadership, being challenged by a large segment of its poor rural society to which the Muslim Brotherhood and other Islamist groups appealed to greatly.

Here is Egypt, a country that lead pan-Arabism and then simultaneously killed it off. With a large population with many of those enraged at its peace treaty with Israel, many turned to Islamist leanings directly resulting in the assassination of President Sadat, as well as numerous terrorist acts throughout the 80s, 90s, and 2000's in Egypt.

And it's no surprise that when Mubarak was overthrown in 2011, the long-banned Muslim Brotherhood re-surfaced, and tried to undo all that had been done since Nasser and the secularist military came to power. Unlike other countries in the Arab Spring, however, the strength of the Egyptian military and how strongly it was entrenched in Egyptian society led to General Sisi and the military overthrowing Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood in a year and a restoration to the old way of doing things.

So why is this a huge deal? Because Egypt, though lambasted this past year for overthrowing the democratically elected Morsi, seems intent on once again fighting back at Islamist forces both internally and externally. Egypt hasn't had problems with fighting fellow Arabs - it sent more troops to fight Saddam in the 1991 Gulf War than France did. Indeed, it is this deep nationalism that allows Sisi to bomb Islamists on behalf of executed Egyptian Copts (Christians) -- that they being Egyptians means more than them being of the wrong religion.

And if Egypt can regain its position as a leader in the Arab world, it can set a huge example for other Arab countries in how it deals with extremists - for better or ill. Whether they become benevolent reforms or a return to the old brutality remains to be seen, but I can definitely guarantee that countries like Israel are breathing a sigh of relief that Sisi is in power and not Morsi.

"rafa_the_rasta","","","Well you see folks of Reddit, when you live in a country where most places are limited to education and currency but abundant in illegal money to be made, some people decide to do the wrong thing and go with the more enticing gold plated ak's, designer clothes, and nice cars. And it doesn't help that some of the most popular music over there openly talks about these things. Not just the luxurious side but the parts where they talk about lopping heads off as military-trained hit men. Almost like the U.S. where the music talks about similar things, especially rap. The difference is the actual people doing the drug trading and head lopping are the ones paying the artists to write these songs and then these songs are fed to the poor, power hungry, and impoverished youth in these parts of Mexico. They're willing to sell large amounts of meth, marijuana, and cocaine and even traffick live humans. The police can't be trusted because they too can be bought off by even $20. So these places that see multiple deaths everyday at the hands of these cartels rely on Military to protect them. Even some of the politicians r paid off by these cartels. Corruption doesn't stop at the Mexican border people. It knows no boundaries and seeps into our own government. And this is when we have to look at the larger picture fellow redditors, the root of these horrendous acts of corruption and death. **Money**. You really believe that waging war with the cartels is the answer, please **wake the fuck up**. As soon as the heads of these cartels are cut off, they will only b replaced with more power hungry leaders. Which in turn means more tax money poured into the war on drugs. As if our government would even want the drugs to stop flowing into America. The more drugs that are on our streets means that there is more product to be pushed and consumed. Which in turn is more crime to be stopped by police and more drug users to be jailed and fined. And where do those fines go? Back into the governments pocket. The only answer is to render the majority of their product worthless by legalizing these substances. Drugs are so expensive because of the risk that goes into making and distributing them. And that is why cartels are so well funded. Some even hire engineers to design submarines in order to smuggle cocaine from south America. These people have always been oppressed by their government. When my parents were young they lived in a time where the government made it so hard to get a full education that the oldest siblings would have to drop out to work so that their youngest siblings could finish school. My parents didn't finish middle school, they went to work before their high school years. When they got together to start a family they didn't see a future in their home land. They went north to give their children a good life, the kind of life they never new as youngsters. When I hear people bitch and moan about how immigrants only come over to steal jobs and bullshit like that, it truly sparks a burning anger inside of me. These people come here to escape poverty and oppression and usually work jobs that citizens of America won't work. They work their asses off because they know what it means to have very little despite working since a young age. Since my parents have been here they have paid off a house, always stayed employed, and never broken the law. My dad even went back to school and struggled with material that i had done in 6th grade but he got his GED and is now taking college courses.

"vivasalt","","","ISIS and the Jordanian Pilot situation explained: 
From a jordanian point of view... 

ISIS the barbarian fucks captured Jordanian Pilot Muath Al-Kasasbeh a 26 years old newly married pilot who joined the allied countries in bombing ISIS rats in Syria and Iraq. 

How did it happen?
His F-16 had a technical incident and he was forced to lower his plane altitude which puts him in the range of RPG and basic anti- aircraft weapons that ISIS Owns... they shot the aircraft down and he ejected from it and was captured by them. 

Now, Pilot Muath is a practicing Muslim, and in islam it is forbidden to kill Muslims (or prisoners btw). 

After ISIS got him, the leaders inside Isis had a heated argument about what they should do to him. some said he should be executed and some said he should stay alive. 

the Jordanian part started an operations base aimed for negotiating with ISIS fucks for getting the pilot back alive...

THE CONFUSION: 

 ISIS is related to al Qaeda... and al Qaeda did a number of terrorist attacks in Jordan. 
since we Jordanians live in the center of a very fucked up world.. we are pretty impressed by our police and cia that they can control Jordan this much.. 
otherwise, we would be another ISIS ruled area or at best terrorist training area. 

in 2005 3 lunatics did a suicidal bombing on 2 hotels causing 60 deaths. 2 out of the 3 fucks did the job and killed themselves along with a dozen of innocent people. 
the third one, known as Sajeda Al-Renshaw, failed to do the job and fled to Al-Salt in which she was captured days after. 

Who is Sajedah: 

Sajedah is the wife of one of the stupid fucks who did the suicidal thing at the hotels, her mission was to detonate herself IN A FUCKING WEDDING alongside her husband. 
her explosives did not work and so she tried to escape. 

Why do they want her? 
because her husband was the right arm of al-Zarqawi which is a former leader of al-Qaeda. 
that means that she knows Al-baghdadi the current ISIS leader personally! 

She was sentenced to execution, but since Jordan stopped executions for being a part of the human right thing... so she was sentenced to stay in prison for a lifetime. 

ISIS Fucks VS. Jordan: 

the Jordanian king is the direct and closest descent of Prophet Muhammed... but he is open to different world views, good ally to U.S and not much of a religious man. 
He is really humble and cool king, he is a big fan of star wars, he once pranked [Russell Peters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUXsw3n_iCA)  and he sometimes disguise in some old man costume and go around checking the situation inside Jordanian governmental organization.


Now, Jordan is in a very critical position geographically speaking.
Everywhere around us is basically going nuts with terrorism... and Jordan is a very poor country, we have no Oil production and one of the poorest countries with water supplies, mostly desert and not much green areas. 

this would make you think of Jordan as something like a dessert full of camels and stuff... No. 
We have 36 worldwide recognized universities. almost everyone in the capital speaks at least 2 languages and we are a very educated population... no one dies of hunger or thirst in Jordan and in general we are holding strong. 

The economy of Jordan relies on Tourism... so we have to provide a safe environment and good relations with everyone. 

ISIS don't really like that and some extremists in Jordan agrees with them.. so they are trying to create some mess in Jordan, luckily we have a very well-trained army and police forces... and they are able to maintain safety of this country. 
IN-SHORT: Jordan is pretty fuckin safe now, don't worry. 

The Hero Muath Al-Kasasbeh: 

Muath was killed with the most brutal barbaric way, those fucks had put him in a cage and burned him alive while watching and filming the whole thing... I personally watched the video and really wish I did not... I don't advise anyone to watch it. 

Now, me and every other Jordanian wants to fight ISIS rats RIGHT FUCKIN NOW, you have no idea the volume of anger going on the streets of Jordan now. 

I think that what the government did in executing the two nutjobs was right, and I think the Jordanian army should respond with utmost brutality to such terrorist.. they don't understand humanity..

I hope I explained it well!

"Mornic","","","As a researcher I think there are a few things we need to clear up here:

* It is normal for researchers to rely on external funding. I work with sustainable transportation and reducing car-dependence but have received money from the car industry for some projects. Why? Because out of 5 funding sources they were the ones that accepted my application. Nothing spurious about that and I don't care where the money comes from. They have actually been some of the best sponsors since they didn't require a lot of additional BS administration and paperwork during the project, whereas you can set aside 10% of a research grant just to deliver progress reports with some public funds.

* In terms of research grants $1.2 million is not a lot of money. The funding alone is not really a problem and can't be used as an argument against the quality of research. I certainly don't deny anthropogenic climate change, but I understand the feeling of having your research interests overlooked again and again by public research grants and needing to seek funding elsewhere.

* There is nothing shady about promising deliverables. Nothing at all. All publications in a research project are called deliverables, no matter the source of funding. It means you have promised to publish your results (to *deliver* a report or article is a target *deliverable*), not that you have promised what those results will be.

Now, that doesn't mean Willie is in the clear, it just means that NY Times are mixing real concerns with nonsense and bringing in the wrong issues for 80% of the article. His research should be evaluated based on the data, methods and explanatory power, all of which are criticised by many experts in the field. The only two things that really matter in this article are that he failed to disclose his funding sources for 8 papers and that the impact of his findings is criticised by his peers. That is serious enough, but all the other fluff in that article is completely normal research practice.

Turkey will have a black start plan in place that will involve staged re-starts, perhaps by drawing power from neighbouring nations in order to restart their own power plants, or some of their own power plants will have self-starting capability and they'll then feed other plants to get them started too.

Losing a whole country is exceptionally difficult to do, but not impossible. For it to have been terrorists it would need to have been one of the best coordinated cyber-attacks seen in some time, as they'd need to hack into enough power stations to cause the entire grid to fall apart. In a country of 75 million that's a fuckton of power stations, or maybe Turkey's grid control network got hacked and they sent all sorts of commands out that weren't noticed to be ridiculous on time. (eg, if some huge 24/7 power station got ordered to turn off out of the blue you'd think they might ask why).

If I were to *guess* at this stage, I'd propose that a major power station in Turkey dropped off the Grid suddenly for one reason or another. This would cause a very rapid change on the Turkish HV network, with the load-generation balance changing and, as a result, power flows and frequency changing rapidly.

That *could* cause a chain reaction that, once started, knocked out most of the country. In the UK we almost went dark in 2008 because we lost two major power stations within 5 minutes of each other totally by coincidence, causing potentially fatal frequency drops because the initial drop in frequency kicked off a chain reaction of smaller generators shutting off to protect themselves (the doctrine at the time being ""if it's all going to shit, save yourself and we'll mop up once things are settled""). We saved the situation by a combination shutting down parts of the Grid in an effort to save most of it, and emergency start-ups of every generating unit we could get hold of, which worked.

Something like that might have hit Turkey, but they may not have been able to stage controlled shutdowns of sections or summon reserve generation fast enough to preserve the majority of the network.

"qwertie256","","","It's time for 'weekend environmentalists' to kick the habit of hating on nuclear power. Developing new, cheap reactors like LFTR/MSR at scale is the fastest and easiest way to start reducing CO2 emissions. People need to let go of the fantasy that the whole world will be willing to reduce their power consumption in order to reduce CO2 emissions, or increase taxes to subsidize solar &amp; wind, or increase electricity prices by taxing natural gas &amp; coal. The right way to tackle global warming is to make energy cheaper, not more expensive, through mass production of LFTRs or other MSRs (watch ""LFTR in 5 minutes"": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbucAwOT2Sc). Solar doesn't make sense everywhere (Canada, Russia...), base load is important because energy storage is expensive, and we don't have time to wait around hoping that PV panel prices will drop.

We also need to spread the message that nuclear power is statistically safer than petroleum power, and vastly safer than coal power, and that new reactor designs can use up to 99% of the potential of the fuel, making them (more or less) 100 times more efficient than traditional reactors, and also safer since there is up to 100 times less nuclear waste, and this waste is radioactive for a much shorter time frame.",1426951923,"","1426953411",0,1,"worldnews"
"MightierThanThou","","","He's right and wrong at the same time. 

The US has been the sole superpower in the world since the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The US has an inordinate amount of control over the global financial market. The US has an insanely, disproportionately powerful military with bases all around the world. American companies have a stranglehold in several key industries.The US is also the global cultural capital. American media is everywhere, all the time. The US has its thumb over human events more than any other country, even China.

Now, does the US abuse its power to maintain that status quo? Probably. But does the US want to completely dominate the world as the sole global hegemon forever? No.

The US does not actually want a unipolar world, the US wants strong allies who can handle affairs in their regions so the US is not required to get involved all the time. The US wants a strong EU and a strong Japan, and wants both to be major regional powers. The US wants a multipolar world. The wet dream of every foreign policy expert in the US is to have the EU become superpower. American generals as well as people in the civilian leadership of the US military have complained about the low military spending in Europe. Since WWII a lot of European nations have depended on the US for defense. You'd figure that this dependence would wane over time but it has actually become more pronounced in recent years. 

The ONLY US allies in Europe who can can project significant force outside of their own borders without depending on the US are the UK and France, and both only to a small degree. Germany, an economic powerhouse, has a pathetically weak military. The US is getting scared that we can't depend on our allies in the event of a major war or a western intervention.

In the 90's the western world intervened to stop a supposed genocide in the Balkans. There was basically a complete consensus that we needed to stop the Serbs. Despite the fact that pretty much all of western Europe was on board, the [US did basically all of the work](http://web.archive.org/web/20140826172028/http://www.library.eiu.edu/ersvdocs/4296.pdf). The US provided almost all the intelligence, command and control, and heavy firepower/air strikes. Some people may think that things have changed since then, but the recent [western intervention in Libya showed again that Europe depends on the US militarily](https://euobserver.com/defence/115650). 

The US doesn't want another Soviet Union and doesn't want Russia to dominate eastern Europe, and doesn't want China to dominate the Asia-Pacific or the world, but the US does not want to be alone in deciding the future of the planet. The US wants democratic, decent nations to start picking up the slack.",1431180381,"","False",2,636,"worldnews"

I can't speak for all 110 million Mexicans, but I can assure you, most of us do not want that kind of involvement by the US.

A number of old allies were set to go to trial and it's highly likely that they would try to negotiate a deal in exchange for information on their old allies - power in Ukraine is King, even if it means turning your back on your old ""friends"", there is a long history of ""fleeing ship"" when it goes down and joining the opposition. Death of a suspect is not a plus for the new government, when dealing with old/new representatives of power, demonstrative jailing and public disgrace is a much more preferred approach among the oligarch class (think Tymoshenko, Lutsenko, etc). Killing of an individual in Ukraine is a time-honored method to get rid of a problem (think Gongadze, Chornovol, the beating of Tetyana Chernovil last winter, for example). edit: yes, these methods are characteristic of all Ukrainian history since independence really, but the Kuchma/Yanukovych and Dnipropetrovsk/Donetsk fractions are a direct ""line of inheritance"" and embodied these traits more than others.

First of all, its not a legitimate reason to just presume women are uncomfortable working out with men in the room. If one feels conscious, embarrassed or ashamed in the company of 50% of the population then they should tackle their mental issues, not spread it and demand that everyone else change for them to accommodate their demands. 

If there is women's hours because they feel intimidated by men, then there should be a skinny guy hour too - for the same ""reason"". Citing religious reasons is becoming cheap because no one wants to offend another religion. But her religion doesn't say anything about not working out with guys. And even if it did, that's her problem. The University can only go so far in accommodating everyone's religious demands. Its not a church, mosque or temple. 

What if my religion requires me to carry a 6"" dagger everywhere I go (Sikhism)? Will you feel safe? If you are intolerant about that, then why make an exception to this.

Making a separate woman's hour indirectly suggests and supports the idea that women are not safe in the presence of men. That attaches a stigma to both men and women's minds. When in reality, no one gives a crap what you do at the gym - or anywhere. Why is she so butt-hurt about this. If she wants to work out only with other women then go to a private gym. Everyone works out and does their thing. No one bullies or intimidates anyone.

It's to mitigate further damage; these people are not apologetic, they are *proud* and their gigantic, post-bailout bonuses underline that pride and indeed under*mine* any notion that there has been any justice in this response. 

Edit: I have to write this here. There is *also* a sentiment in this comments section (and in the world, obviously) that thinks being rich is itself a crime, or proof positive of crimes committed. This is the sort of persona responsible for the murder of the Romanov children because they were born royal and also the sort that would go around nominating anyone not showing sufficient Leftness for the Guillotine after the French Revolution. The Great Terror, when people were hysterically forced to name their children Liberty and so on out of the fear of being beheaded by bigots, happened because people who confuse justice with arbitrary violence against innocents had control. This is the sort of persona that, if given half a chance, would steal from all of us just as quickly. These are the potential Stalins, Mao's and Hitlers of the world.

We may talk big about bombing them to kingdom come, annihilating their villages, and eradicating both soldiers and their families to thoroughly ""cleanse"" the world of their bloodline. But this kind of response will, like the brooms in Fantasia, make them stronger in numbers and justify their existence as soldiers fighting the invading western ""empires"".

The solution has to come from local nations that are occupied by or adjacent to ISIS controlled regions. Without their desire to see ISIS wiped from existence, foreign intervention will only be a temporary solution, and when the western forces leave, an even bloodier fanatical group will take ISIS' place.

This is exactly what happened in Iraq, exactly what caused ISIS to pop into existence in the first place. Western powers attempted to ""stabilize"" Iraq by removing a leader they thought was stockpiling weapons of mass destruction, and after they ended combat operations and executed Saddam Hussein, Iraq became a veritable Petri dish of Islamic fundamentalism. ~~Operation Enduring Freedom~~ Operation Iraqi Freedom (thanks /u/DrShaufhausen for the correction)  didn't have local Iraqi support, nor did it have support from Iraq's neighboring nations, thus the ""evil"" we were fighting to extinguish ended up getting replaced by something worse.

It got replaced by ISIS.

ISIS wants another invasion like that of Iraq in 2003. And they're probably going to get it with the length of barbarism they're achieving like today's sick display. But the end result is likely going to be an even worse region than it was before, because we do not have the local support needed to keep the region stable after any foreign military intervention.

And the biggest problem, even worse than the cowards and psychopaths living out their sick power fantasies under the false pretenses of Islamic righteousness, are the foreign interests supporting ISIS.

It will be a Religious War, a sort of Christian Jihad, fueled by religious hatred and led by merciless fanatics on both sides. It will be guerilla warfare on a global scale, with no front lines and no identifiable enemy. Osama bin Laden may be a primitive “figurehead” — or even dead, for all we know — but whoever put those All-American jet planes loaded with All-American fuel into the Twin Towers and the Pentagon did it with chilling precision and accuracy. The second one was a dead-on bullseye. Straight into the middle of the skyscraper.
Nothing — even George Bush’s $350 billion “Star Wars” missile defense system — could have prevented Tuesday’s attack, and it cost next to nothing to pull off. Fewer than 20 unarmed Suicide soldiers from some apparently primitive country somewhere on the other side of the world took out the World Trade Center and half the Pentagon with three quick and costless strikes on one day. The efficiency of it was terrifying.
We are going to punish somebody for this attack, but just who or what will be blown to smithereens for it is hard to say. Maybe Afghanistan, maybe Pakistan or Iraq, or possibly all three at once. Who knows? Not even the Generals in what remains of the Pentagon or the New York papers calling for WAR seem to know who did it or where to look for them.
This is going to be a very expensive war, and Victory is not guaranteed — for anyone, and certainly not for anyone as baffled as George W. Bush. All he knows is that his father started the war a long time ago, and that he, the goofy child-President, has been chosen by Fate and the global Oil industry to finish it Now. He will declare a National Security Emergency and clamp down Hard on Everybody, no matter where they live or why. If the guilty won’t hold up their hands and confess, he and the Generals will ferret them out by force.

[**France Broadens Its Surveillance Power**](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/15/world/europe/france-broadens-its-surveillance-power.html?_r=0)

&gt;And last week, with little public debate, the legislature approved a law that critics feared would markedly expand electronic surveillance of French residents and businesses.

&gt;The provision, quietly passed as part of a routine military spending bill, defines the conditions under which intelligence agencies may gain access to or record telephone conversations, emails, Internet activity, personal location data and other electronic communications.

&gt;The law provides for no judicial oversight and allows electronic surveillance for a broad range of purposes, including *“national security,”* the protection of France’s *“scientific and economic potential”* and prevention of *“terrorism”* or *“criminality.”*

[**French officials can monitor internet users in real time under new law**](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/11/french-officials-internet-users-real-time-law)

&gt;French intelligence and government officials will be able to spy on internet users in real time and without prior legal authorisation, under a law passed on Wednesday.

&gt;The legislation, which was approved almost unnoticed, will enable a wide range of public officials including police, gendarmes, intelligence and anti-terrorist agencies as well as several government ministries to monitor computer, tablet and smartphone use directly.

&gt;The spying clause, part of a new military programming law, comes just weeks after France, which considers individual privacy a pillar of human rights, expressed outrage at revelations that the US National Security Agency *(NSA)* had been intercepting phone calls in France. The president, François Hollande, expressed his *""extreme reprobation""*.

&gt;Article 13 of the new law will allow not just the security forces but intelligence services from the defence, interior, economy and budget ministries to see *""electronic and digital communications""* in real time to discover who is connected to whom, what they are communicating and where they are.

Now combine that with 10,000 French soldiers deployed in country, a large directly militarized police force with their Gendarme and this isn't exactly something to stand on a pedestal and be fucking smug about.

[**French Wiretapping**]( http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/how_they_do_it/2006/02/wiretapping_europeanstyle.html)

&gt;Washington's biggest European critic—France—also has a serious wiretapping habit, as Marc Perelman points out in Foreign Policy: *""In addition to judicially ordered taps there are also 'administrative wiretaps' decided by security agencies under the control of the government.""* Perelman argues that most French know about these policies but don't seem to care, despite clear cases of abuse in the past. Most prominent is the Elysée Scandal—named after the palace where the late President Francois Mitterrand set up an undercover listening room. Mitterrand's operatives tapped the calls of his political enemies: lawyers, businessmen, journalists, and even the actress and Chanel model Carole Bouquet. This took place in the mid-1980s but only surfaced recently, and 12 conspirators were brought to trial. What's interesting—and disturbing—about the Elysée Scandal is that at the time, French authorities had justified the surveillance as a necessary tool to fight terrorism.       

[**French government admits to wiretapping journalists in Bettencourt scandal**](http://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2011/09/fran-s09.html)

&gt;On September 1, France’s Interior Minister Claude Guéant admitted that last July French domestic intelligence spied on telephone conversations of Gérard Davet, a reporter at France’s daily of record, Le Monde. This followed a year of denials by Guéant and other officials including President Nicolas Sarkozy—in the face of a complaint by Le Monde—that any such spying had taken place.

&gt;Guéant confirmed that France’s DCRI *(Central Interior Information Service)* had *“localized telephone conversations”* of Davet. The purpose of this operation was to discover the sources of Davet’s reporting on legal investigations of L’Oréal billionaire Liliane Bettencourt. Guéant added briefly that the courts would *“decide the state of affairs”* regarding the legality of the police wiretaps.
Last summer the DCRI ordered Orange, the telephone provider, to give them detailed lists of calls *(fadettes)* made by Davet. This enabled them to subsequently identify the whistleblower, David Sénat, who worked in the department of justice. He was sacked.

**EDIT: Also in relation to this.**

The French criminal-justice system allows [detention for months, even years, after a suspect has been formally *“placed under investigation”*, but not yet charged. Police can also continue to interrogate suspects during that time](https://books.google.com/books?id=4aVBn4i_TTQC&amp;pg=PA155&amp;lpg=PA155&amp;dq=france+suspect+detention+months&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=IRtieto2xH&amp;sig=zuU5kzdOKWgaz24U7MK_Cs7Mp7c&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=nHm6VM35C8WZNoqQgJAB&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=france%20suspect%20detention%20months&amp;f=false).

In addition there is also a system of special non-jury courts for terrorism trials and it has a [broad terrorist offence – the so-called *“association of wrongdoers”* offence – which allows it to cast the net wide and imprison a broad range of suspects](http://icsr.info/2013/05/icsr-insight-counterterrorism-why-france-is-tougher-than-britain/)
