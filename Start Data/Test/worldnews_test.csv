**[New York Times sells Israel’s next war](http://www.beirutreport.com/2015/05/new-york-times-sells-israels-next-war.html)**

&gt; How hard is it for the Israeli military to launch an unprovoked war with its neighbor by casting itself as a victim of barbarianism, rallying international support and even apologizing in advance and exonerating itself for killing innocent civilians? It seems it only takes one phone call to the New York Times.

&gt; That’s right, the world’s most powerful newspaper has just published an article wholly inspired and almost entirely narrated by the unverifiable and belligerent claims of Israeli military sources. The article “Israel Says Hezbollah Positions Put Civilians at Risk” casts no serious journalistic or responsible doubt on these Israeli claims made by a military institution that has engaged in wars that have killed tens of thousands of civilians in the past.

&gt; The author, Isabel Kershner warns that Israel says “…many Lebanese civilians will probably be killed, and that it should not be considered Israel’s fault.”

Related New York Times article: **[Israel Says Hezbollah Positions Put Lebanese at Risk](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/13/world/middleeast/israel-says-hezbollah-positions-put-lebanese-at-risk.html?referrer&amp;_r=1)**

Essentially, Israel is announcing that they are about to raise hell in Lebanon, and, as usual, taking preemptive steps to fend off criticism of the countless civilian deaths they plan to inflict on the populous by pumping up propaganda.

Assad is effectively neutralized (thanks to the help of ISIS, al Qaeda the US, Saudi Arabia, and, of course Israel itself), and will not be in any position to provide material or other support to Hezbollah in Lebanon. 

Given the current climate, it should come as no surprise that Israel's next move would be to attack Lebanon, as part of their overall strategy to reshape the political landscape of the region to suit their whims.

Hezbollah is in no position to launch an offensive attack against Israel, and would be insane to do so, but that is the way that it will be portrayed. A ""situation"" will arise (or be manufactured) under which ""poor little Israel"" will be ""forced"" to take extensive action in Southern Lebanon *(for ""defensive"" purposes, of course!)*, and the IDF will rain hell in the form of air, artillery, and naval strikes, caring not how many innocent civilians they slaughter in the process. As usual, Israel will just claim that they were using them as ""human shields"".

Didn't they already warn us with the war-drum propaganda?

This whole scenario was predictable - and predicted. With Assad being neutered, once they've finished mopping up in Lebanon, Israel can focus all of their efforts on conning the US (and others) into taking out Iran.

When you take a step back and look at the broader picture, it all becomes surprisingly transparent, doesn't it?

"danypoa","","","~~This is a lie.~~ This is not exactly what happened.

It's news from Argentina, I saw it posted in /r/Brasil ([here](http://www.reddit.com/r/brasil/comments/36bhw4/pena_por_abuso_%C3%A9_reduzida_porque_v%C3%ADtima_de_6_anos/)) when the same ""news"" got to brazilian newspaper.

A user on the comments found the legal document that refers to the case. He read it and posted his conclusions. I read it as well and could not see *anything* saying that the kid being homosexual had something to do with the sentenced being reduced.

The change in the sentence was because the guy got some ""penalties"" for aggravating evidence/testimonies the first time, which caused the sentence to be the maximum or more than that. Reviewing the case the judges found these evidence was not valid and so the aggravating circumstances didn't exist, so his sentence should not be the one originally given.

From what I could understand, the original sentence was considering that the abuser took advantage of the kid's social situation (his parents were gone and his grandmother neglected him). It was proven that he didn't know about this situation, and so the time that was added because of taking advantage of it had to be corrected.

The document says something about sexual orientation, but I think it's something about increasing his sentence because his actions led the boy to being gay... and by the testimonies it could be seem he already had ""decided"" his sexual orientation prior to the abuse.

I do not agree with the little time the abuser got, but it was within the law (that I also think is not strict enough). The revision of the case was so that it would comply with the law.

I also don't agree with involving the kid's sexual orientation in any point of the case, and with that it could or could not be proven that he was gay at 6 years old, before the abuse.

Anyway, from what I understood his being gay or not had nothing to do with and would not affect the case in any way. I may be wrong about that, because my legal spanish is not very good.

**TL;DR: What I did understand is the sentence was reduced because the abuser didn't know the kid was neglected.**

The original document in spanish can be seem [here](http://www.scribd.com/doc/265719184/Reduccion-de-Pena-Piombo#scribd).

--------------------------------------


Edit: It seems the sentence always states that they removed the ""aggravations"" because the child did not turn gay because of the abuse, besides the neglection thing.

I'll be looking for the original first sentence document tonight so I can understand this better.

--------------------------------------


*(Also, thanks for the gold, I'm glad to be contributing to the discussion =))*

--------------------------------------------

Edit 2:

Ok, so I looked for the original sentence and could not find it. Some people in the comments below made translations of the controversial paragraph, and it can be interpreted in many ways. Some argentines also brought their interpretation and agreed it's not easy to understand and can be read in different ways.

What is clear for me, from the text and the law itself is that *the sentence was not reduced because the kid is gay*, as some articles are saying.

It's not clear if the paragraph about sexual orientation (mentioned below) was taken into account in the judges decision, but if it was it's still within the law. What is says is ""the child was already gay and didn't turn gay because of the abuse"". Even tho I personally don't think you can say a 6 year old is gay or not, even if he shows precocious sexual inclinations (which I think would be a reflex of his surroundings), I also don't think it's correct to say abusing the child is what makes his sexual orientation one thing or another.

So, if it was the case that the judge removed the ""turned him gay"" aggravation from the sentence, it may have been for the wrong reason, but the result would be the same if it was for the right one (if considered by someone who doesn't see being gay as a perversion). 

What *is* clear in the text, and what I stated in the first place is that the judge removed the aggravation of taking advantage of the victim because of his social situation, since there was no indication of the abuser's knowledge of said situation. I don't think there can be any doubts about that paragraph.

That said, I have read the articles of the law used to convict the abuser and I can't make sense of why the sentence was reduced to 3 years, since, even removing the aggravations mentioned before, the minimum time for sexual abuse with ""carnal access"" is of 6 years. **So that is still unclear**.

**I want to make it clear that in no way I'm in favor of the sentence, of how the case was treated and of involving the victim's sexual orientation in any way of this.** All I want is for people to look beyond sensationalism and direct their anger in the right direction. In my case, I think attentions should be directed towards the law itself. That is what has to change and what we have to be angry about, not that it was applied to a case as terrible as this was.

TL;DR 2 : The text is confusing. There are 2 factors that made the abuse ""outrageous"" (according to law): *1) the kid was neglected*, *2) the kid turned gay*. They clearly reduced time for *1) the abuser didn't know* and not as clearly may or may have not taken in consideration *2) the kid was already gay*.",1432224330,"","1432263429",1,844,"worldnews"

Badly written. MRSA is Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

Edit : The BBC have now amended the website to read ""The article says 'completely wiped out methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, otherwise known as MRSA'""  which makes more sense.

Edit2 : How on Earth does one get 4000 upvotes on a pedantic comment ?
For those who commented as to why the terminology matters:   

People have a well grounded fear of MRSA. It is difficult to treat, often persists as colonising flora on the , and can lead to some patients being discriminated against (some nursing homes and nursing agencies won't deal with MRSA positive patients because of the risk of spreading the organism)

""ordinary"" Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) is absolutely normal bacteria, found on most peoples skin - but because of the constant confusion in the media between MRSA and MSSA , eveybody who sees a lab report of Staphylococcus aureus automatically assumes they have MRSA and panics.

The engine takes this air and has a starter to convert this energy into rotational force to start the engine and this is usually done via a shaft and gears.  If the starter valves don't close, the starter will stay engaged and the engine will run but it just won't be happy.  On most planes it is a simple fix of manually closing that valve.  Sometimes we can do that while the engine is still running and continue to our destination to have maintenance fix the valve there.

"Mornic","","","As a researcher I think there are a few things we need to clear up here:

* It is normal for researchers to rely on external funding. I work with sustainable transportation and reducing car-dependence but have received money from the car industry for some projects. Why? Because out of 5 funding sources they were the ones that accepted my application. Nothing spurious about that and I don't care where the money comes from. They have actually been some of the best sponsors since they didn't require a lot of additional BS administration and paperwork during the project, whereas you can set aside 10% of a research grant just to deliver progress reports with some public funds.

* In terms of research grants $1.2 million is not a lot of money. The funding alone is not really a problem and can't be used as an argument against the quality of research. I certainly don't deny anthropogenic climate change, but I understand the feeling of having your research interests overlooked again and again by public research grants and needing to seek funding elsewhere.

* There is nothing shady about promising deliverables. Nothing at all. All publications in a research project are called deliverables, no matter the source of funding. It means you have promised to publish your results (to *deliver* a report or article is a target *deliverable*), not that you have promised what those results will be.

Now, that doesn't mean Willie is in the clear, it just means that NY Times are mixing real concerns with nonsense and bringing in the wrong issues for 80% of the article. His research should be evaluated based on the data, methods and explanatory power, all of which are criticised by many experts in the field. The only two things that really matter in this article are that he failed to disclose his funding sources for 8 papers and that the impact of his findings is criticised by his peers. That is serious enough, but all the other fluff in that article is completely normal research practice.

An armed man (Silenced handgun, looks like an USP/P2000 from my limited gun knowledge) entered the NOS (Nationale Omroep Stichting) building, and threatened a guard demanding live broadcast time instead of the 8-o-clock news. The man claimed to be hired by intelligence services, although speculations are he was with a hackers-group. He was dressed nicely, and claimed to have important information regarding our current society. 

The man was waiting for broadcast to be live, negotiating with the news reporter. They were discussing that he did not want to harm the reporter, and would let him go as soon as his speech was complete. Before broadcast went live, police entered demanding he'd drop his gun. He did instantly, exclaiming 'I DROPPED IT' and followed police's commands without resistance. 

They are still searching if he planted explosives somewhere. The building has been evacuated. 

If demand is here, I'll try to translate the dialogue in the video.

"az_st","","","First post on Reddit. Hi.

My Father was a farmer his entire life - started when he was a kid back in the 70s. As far as I'm aware, he'd been spraying crops for 20-30 years. Always a very pragmatic, safe guy (farms are really dangerous for a tonne of reasons), he was very well certified and was always extremely kitted out when working with chemicals.

A few years ago (2013), he got sick and was *eventually* diagnosed with Non-Hodgkins (Diffuse Large B-Cell specifically IIRC). I kept asking myself why him, he was physically very fit, never smoked, drank very little, maintained a healthy diet and was only 53 years old. People were surprised to say the least.

I recall being with him when we saw the Hematology doc for the first time - she asked him what he did, and specifically asked if he worked with pesticides. When I looked in to it myself, I found that pesticides were suspected of potentially causing it, but really the causes were pretty much unknown.

It'll be 6 months ago on Tuesday that he passed away, and although I have no hard evidence of any kind, I personally believe that his long-term exposure to such chemicals was a factor in his illness and ultimately his death. I'm not gonna sit here like ""omg must ban all chemicals"", I just think that not understanding the long-term (particularly 20+ years) risks of new technologies is a part of life in a world that has changed so quickly. I've no doubt that in time we'll get better at eliminating the risks of stuff like this.

---

TL;DR... Father worked with pesticides over a long period of time. Died of NHL. Personal opinion is that pesticides was a contributing factor but that it's an inherent risk of new technologies in a world that changes so quickly. Knee-jerk decisions banning beneficial technology on inconclusive research would be nonsensical.

"jonnyhogwild","","","What a fucking sham of an article. 

They completely gloss over the fact that the reason there's that much fucking oil on the seafloor is because BP used Corexit to ""clean"" after repeatedly being told not to. Corexit can be used to clean up smaller spills with efficiency...but when used in the volume that it was with Deepwater Horizon it does exactly as the article describes. It breaks down the oil and forces it to clump into denser droplets and...sink to the seafloor to be broken down by bacteria. For BP, this was perfect; out of sight, out of mind (as far as the oil slick goes). For everyone else, its awful. Corexit is highly toxic, kills not only marine life but also the cleanup workers exposed to it. Additionally, now we have a situation where we have a SHIT TON of clumped up oil on the seafloor, suffocating the bacteria that is supposed to clean it up. Its like getting coated in mud, and getting in the shower, and wondering why the shower drain backs up. You clogged it, motherfucker. 

Its weird, when I was a kid I never understood the hullabaloo about Exxon Valdeez, as in why it was talked about years upon years after the cleanup had ended. As an adult, a Louisiana resident, and just an American who appreciates the natural beauty of our nation, I'm fucking livid. I'd love nothing more than to see anyone involved with the decision to use Corexit put on trial for crimes against the environment.

"heisgone","","","In Quebec, the question of integration has been well debated for quite a while. First, a little bit of historical background. Until the 60s, the French-speaking population had less political and economical power. Industries were controlled by English-speaking people and the Catholic Church was more than happy to keep the French submissive. Then came the social revolution of the 60s and 70s which too away all the Church influence. A strong sense of Nationalism developed along with a separatism movement. The cultural identity in Quebec developed itself in opposition with the rest of Canada. One of those differences was the question of Multiculturalism which was championed at the Federal level (originally by a French-speaking Prime Minister who opposed the separatist movement, but let's not complicate things here). 

The idea of multiculturalism goes against the idea of nationalism. For the English-speaking part of Canada, multiculturalism was a way to move beyond his colonial past. Meanwhile in Quebec, the question of cultural identity was alive and well. It led to a variety of demands by the province, notably the rights to evaluate potential immigrants, laws to defends the French language, a separation referendum that was defeated by 1%, etc.

In the early 2000, there was a host of incidents with immigrants asking for special permission. The most prominent case was about a 12 year-old bold Sikh that was refused to wear his Kirpan (a form of traditional knife) in school. In 2006, the Supreme Court ruled that the prohibition was against The Charters Of Rights And Freedom, and that companies and government had to provide ""reasonable accommodation"" to religious demands. 

This caused a lot of controversy in Quebec. Meanwhile, Muslisms were under the spotlight, notably regarding the right of covering one's face in public. Government were scratching their head on how there were going to handle each individual demands. What is a reasonable demand? What is a reasonable accommodation? 

In 2007, a village of 1200 souls in the middle of nowhere, Hérouxville, drafted a ""Life code"" for there village. It was intended to inform immigrants about how we are supposed to live in Quebec. It was a 5 pages document telling that stoning people was a big no-no, genital mutilation was forbidden and that burning women alive isn't really acceptable.

While this was met with quite a bit of derision, it did ignite a serious discussion on ethnical integration. A commission was created to ask Quebecers their opinion on the matter. It toured all around the province, and every evening it was live on T.V.. Everyone was allowed to speak so it was quite of a show. It didn't lead to anything concrete but it certainly had some therapeutic effect. 

The question of integration was somewhat left on the side until the separatist party took power in 2012 as a minority government and made the creation of a [Quebec Charter Of Values](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec_Charter_of_Values) his top priority. They went back in election in 2014, hoping to win a majority, but were defeated. Quebecers were uncomfortable with the Charter, which was judged to be too radical. It was close to the French doctrine of Laïcité, notably forbidding all prominent religious signs for government workers. At the same time, they were seen as hypocrite since they didn't want to remove a Crucifix  that is on display at Quebec National Assembly. 

So, the current government is probably going to implement a softer version of the Charter. The debate is still going strong and all those events is adding fuel to it.",1423979584,"","1423979895",1,83,"worldnews"

Quick primer for those who don't know/don't understand:  Edit:~~The Taliban~~ *Taliban's situation is more complicated, they're not directly Salafist, they're Deobandi - that said, the two are similar*, Al Qaeda, Boko Haram, and a huge number of other *really nasty groups* all subscribe to a particular branch of Sunni Islam called Wahabism/Salafism (two names, same meaning - they don't like Wahabi as a name because it references the guy who came up with the school of thought IIRC).  In short, they're violent, backwards mofos.  The Saudi Royal Family also subscribe to this form of Islam - it's the official state religion in Saudi Arabia.  Connecting the dots from there, especially when you read a few articles on about these folks, is pretty easy.

"_skylark","","","A bit of background information on the Ukrainian political climate and circumstances: you have to understand that the Yanukovych regime was an intricate mob system of influence and crime bosses that divided resources, illegally privatized national industries, public land, ran energy schemes to raise dependence on fossil fuels and this is just on the surface. A number of old allies were set to go to trial and it's highly likely that they would try to negotiate a deal in exchange for information on their old allies - power in Ukraine is King, even if it means turning your back on your old ""friends"", there is a long history of ""fleeing ship"" when it goes down and joining the opposition. Death of a suspect is not a plus for the new government, when dealing with old/new representatives of power, demonstrative jailing and public disgrace is a much more preferred approach among the oligarch class (think Tymoshenko, Lutsenko, etc). Killing of an individual in Ukraine is a time-honored method to get rid of a problem (think Gongadze, Chornovol, the beating of Tetyana Chernovil last winter, for example). edit: yes, these methods are characteristic of all Ukrainian history since independence really, but the Kuchma/Yanukovych and Dnipropetrovsk/Donetsk fractions are a direct ""line of inheritance"" and embodied these traits more than others. Both the Kuchma era and the Yanukovych one are especially marked by censorship and physical removal of opponents (politicians, journalists, businessmen, etc).",1429164991,"","1429179130",1,-3,"worldnews"

Here is the entire quote:

""'We are aware of the link between the Elad (settler) group and the Israel Antiquities Authority. We are concerned that this link has led to Israel Antiquities Authority's support of radical settler activities in and around the Old City under the guise of tourism and protection of Jewish history,' Conservative foreign office minister Baroness Anelay said.""

Baroness Anelay is the Foreign Minister for Afghanistan, Pakistan, Bangladesh; Central Asia; Human Rights; UN, International Organisations and ICC; All of FCO business in the Lords. Think of a foreign minister like the head of a committee in the senate. They are considered experts on a field, but they also have political leanings. This wouldn't be that far off from a senator saying something like ""We are aware that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction""

All it means is he got a report from some sources that this is going on, but that details are likely too hazy to take seriously. Keep in mind they are ultimately part of a political party and they often push their own beliefs.

"DonTago","","","It is important that rankings like this be taken with a grain of salt. One problem with the Reporters without Borders methodology is that its results are largely based off of surveys/questionnaires handed out to a small number of pre-selected [journalists, NGOs and activists](http://rsf.org/index2014/data/2014_wpfi_methodology.pdf) around the world, gauging their specific individual perceptions of their countries and others press freedoms... that doesn't really seem like the most reliable type of data to use in such a ranking (being that there would be a lot of opportunity for respondents to insert personal bias and exaggerations). As a result, nations like the US and France bounce wildly in the rankings *every year* despite no real changes in the law or policy, but more so because of things like stories put out by Wikileaks or heavily reported or sensationalized events in the mass media. I suspect they bounce in order to generate news coverage on how ""Press Freedom is in decline in the US"" which sends many people, Redditors especially, into a gleeful tizzy.

Admittedly the US, as with most countries in the world, can certainly be working towards creating a freer system of press/media... much still needs to be done in fostering a more open system of journalism not just in the US, but across the world. However, being that we have Freedom of the Press literally written into the First Amendment of our Constitution puts us far above many countries, as far as extending press freedoms. You can say a lot about the US, but when it comes to freedom of speech, the US is probably the most protective country of it... I really don't think there's a whole lot of competition in that arena. I mean, we even lack 'hate speech laws', something very popular in many European country's legal systems now.

Furthermore, there are even parts of the press that are distrustful of the results these sorts of surveys put out. For example, NYT reporter Andrew Rosenthal asks, in an [article here](http://www.imediaethics.org/News/2626/Nyt_criticizes_reporters_without_borders_annual_press_freedom_ranking_of_us_below_hungary_for_occupy_wall_street_arrests.php), why, in the 2011 Press ranking, there was decision to move the United States down 27 spots because of Occupy Wall Street arrests, especially in comparison with countries like Hungary, which was is 40th.  ""*27 places? That seems arbitrary. What is that, one spot for each arrest?*"" he asked, going on to say:

&gt; ""For the 2010 list released in 2011, Reporters Without Borders placed the U.S. at 20, and Hungary at 23. Then a bunch of American cops harassed journalists at Occupy protests, and the Hungarian government tried to do away with the very principle of an independent press. Surely what happened in Hungary is worse than what happened here. Surely this is a more hospitable country for journalists. And yet, going by the Press Freedom Index, it isn’t.""


At the end of the day, these rankings seem weirdly topical and subjective and fail, I feel, to actually capture a real state of the world's press freedoms, meanwhile, I can't help but feel like the RWB might have a slight political axe to grind. If this survey means something, I'm not clear on what it is. More than anything, they seem like it's just proof positive for anyone who already thinks the US press is terrible. So I guess it's got that going for it. Do I think the US should be at the TOP of this list? Definitely not... but do I think we are 49th in the world, below such countries as Malta, Niger, Burkino Faso, El Salvador, Tonga, Chile and Botswana? I very much doubt that.

Also, if anyone is interested in reading more about the questionable aspect of this ranking, [HERE](http://www.onthemedia.org/story/press-freedom-not-decline/) is a good NPR On The Media podcast about it.

* A GDP per capital lower than Jamaica

* A tiny manufacturing capacity.
* No military.
* A tiny population of largely illiterate, uneducated immigrants torn by ethnic tensions.

Malaysia fully expected Singapore to collapse from the above factors and beg for readmission into the federation at a weakened bargaining position. Now look at where we are now compared to Malaysia, South East Asia, or even our former colonial master.

Lee Kuan Yew is the founding father of modern, independent Singapore. His legacy is transforming Singapore in the course of the late 20th century from a poverty-stricken malarial country equivalent of some of the poorest African countries, into a peaceful and economically prosperous state. 

Great respect for him even though I know that he's not morally impeccable. He's success was not built on liberalism or democracy but on enlightened authoritarianism, with a sizable helping of Confucian values. Democracy does exist in Singapore, but it was less pivotal than the fact of the meritocratic corporate state he built. Lee Kuan Yew has substituted the beauty of ideas in favor of what works.

Lee Kuan Yew was an authoritarian no doubt. But his rule led to economic and technological development, to better governance, and to an improved quality of life. Most important, his rule, however imperfect, have overall better positioned Singapore for better democratic reforms later on.

* It was composed of a Chair, 33 members of the Legislature (including 4 from Northern Ireland), and 66 ordinary citizens (randomly selected, but reflecting the age, gender, religious, and social makeup of the State). 

* Its terms of reference stated that it was ""to consider the following matters and to make such recommendations as it sees fit and report to the Houses of the Oireachtas"". The ""following matters"" were all potential amendments to the Constitution, including ""removal of the offence of blasphemy from the Constitution"". The public, and interested bodies, could make submissions for the Convention's consideration.

* December 27, 2012: The [first public submission on the topic of blasphemy was made.](https://www.constitution.ie/Submissions.aspx?cid=80)

* November 3, 2013: The Convention [made its decisions in relation to blasphemy.](https://www.constitution.ie/AttachmentDownload.ashx?mid=b7d9c660-a044-e311-8571-005056a32ee4)

* October 2, 2014: The Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality [announced in the Dáil that the Government had accepted the main recommendation of the report, namely, that a referendum should be held on removing the requirement for an offence of blasphemy from the Constitution.](http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014100200011?opendocument#N5)

* Over three months later: The Charlie Hebdo attacks took place, and thus entered the already ongoing public discussion on this topic.

**EDIT 2**: A few people are asking why we don't just get on with it and hold the referendum *now*. Well, the fact is, we have a lot of other referenda on the cards too (and some are far more important than this one). Remember, the Irish Constitution cannot be changed in any way without a referendum. 

Also, one doesn't want to hold too many on the same day, as this could lead to confusion in the electorate, and the lead-up to the vote would have to cram in debates on too many separate topics, leading to uninformed voters. 

Finally, we have a thing called voter fatigue. We hold a lot of referenda in Ireland (possibly second only to Switzerland), and the general public can frankly get fed up of having to learn about, consider, and debate disparate (sometimes obscure) topics one after the other. Thus, we like to spread them out so that we don't have more than one or two referendum days per year. 

All of that said, these are the referenda currently on the table:

* Constitutionally require that the State must provide for same sex marriage (to be held in May)

* Reduce the required age for President from 35 to 21 (same day as the above)

* Reduce the general voting age from 18 to 16 (probably later this year)

* Ratification of a Treaty setting up a Unified Patent Court open to EU Member States (probably later this year)

* Establish voting rights for citizens abroad in Presidential elections (no indication as to when)

* Amend a clause (that is now widely viewed as sexist) on the rights of ""women in the home"" (no indication as to when)

* Remove blasphemy (now most likely to take place after the 2016 general election)

"retro_texual","","","Hey reddit, here's a handy guide in how in how to respond to this in a way that's politically correct, morally superior, and sure to make you appear fair and level-headed.

1. Make sure to tweet something like 'oh, won't someone think of the muslims, please be safe tonight' - if you can get the tweet out while those French bodies are still warm, that's even better!

2. hashtag#notallmuslims - show solidarity. Your fracturing national identity and continuing cultural turmoil ain't no biggy; just make sure them muslim feelings aren't too hurt.

3. When you encounter anyone criticizing Islam, make sure you call them an Islamophobe and a racist. Ignore their arguments - even if you suspect that they may contain logic - and focus entirely on how they hate muslims because they're brown. If they bring up eastern european and african islamic countries, block and report them on twitter and write an e-mail to their employer.

4. State 'islam isn't the problem; it's the geopolitics of the region!'. This makes you appear informed of the complex situation in the middle east. Writing off the posibility of Islam as a reason behind this attacks also demonstrates you aren't an Islamophobe, and as such, gives you a nice moral and ego boost. If others present arguments that Islam is a significant reason behind these attacks, return to point 3.

5. Complain about how this is simply going to empower the rise of right wing parties.

"Providentia","","","A Russian court on Wednesday upheld a government agency's order evicting Polish envoys from their consulate in St. Petersburg in a move Warsaw called a breach of diplomatic convention and the Kremlin said was simply a matter of overdue rent.
lRelated NATO ministers to fine-tune readiness on Russian, Middle East threats

St. Petersburg arbitration court Judge Daria Andreyeva ruled that the eviction effort was justified and ordered the Polish government to pay arrears of $1.1 million to city authorities, according to Poland Radio's website, TheNews.pl.

Poland and the Soviet Union had provided each other's diplomats free accommodation at their consular buildings since 1983, the radio report said. That relationship extended to Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The report cited a statement from the Polish Embassy in Moscow accusing Russia of unilaterally breaking off the arrangement in violation of the Vienna Convention.

Russia's Foreign Ministry said in a statement that Poland was to blame for rebuffing Russian proposals ""to discuss all unsettled property issues comprehensively.""

Relations between the Cold War-era allies have been strained in recent years as Poland reorients its economic and security policies to the West. Polish officials have been especially critical of Russian President Vladimir Putin since he sent in paratroopers to seize neighboring Ukraine's Crimea peninsula a year ago and is suspected of sending weapons and fighters to back pro-Russia separatists occupying other areas of eastern Ukraine.

Poland's consulate in Russia's second-largest city has occupied two elegant buildings in the former imperial capital's historic center for 32 years. TheNews said the diplomatic premises covered more than 30,000 square feet.

An eviction notice was issued in August by the Inpredservice real estate agency, which manages the Russian government's diplomatic properties. Alexei Chernykh, an Inpredservice representative, told Russian news agencies that there was ""no political context"" to the arbitration court's ruling that Poland must vacate the consulate and pay arrears that have accumulated over the last three years.

The Associated Press reported from Warsaw that the Polish government opposed the court ruling as ""unlawful"" and insisted that the eviction order can't be enforced until the disputes over diplomatic properties in the two countries are resolved through negotiation.",1426595827,"","False",0,2,"worldnews"

"Abevege","","","Obama's got it wrong when he thinks the underlying problem is ""disaffected sunnis"" some of whom have no access to education etc. Wrong, wrong wrong. The rise of fascist Islamism has nothing to do with wealth or poverty, education or ignorance - the impulse to religiosity is not linked to wealth, social status or education.

In this case religiosity is indivisible from politics. Fascist Islamism is a political dogma, not a religion, and its first victims are secular Muslims who are termed apostates and killed.

This is why they kill atheists, apostates, they have beheaded Christians but will revert to the Sharia principle of suffering the Christians and Jews to live in return for the payment of the Jizya tax.

And yes, ISIS is probably a direct consequence of the invasion of Iraq - but the rise of fascist Islamism has nothing to do with it.

Fascist Islamism attacks countries all around the world that have nothing to do with the US adventures in the Middle East. 

Fascist Islamists have attacked:
Nigeria (Boko Haram)
Philippines (MILF)
Pakistan (Lashka-e-taibba)
Indonesia (Jemaah Islamiah)
Chechnya/Russia (Beslan bombing, Russian theatre attacks)
Somalia (al-Shabaab)
Kenya (al-Shabaab)
Sudan (Janjaweed)

and on and on it goes.

All of these groups are fascist Islamist. None of them have anything to do with Iraq. All of them share the ideology of implementing the Caliphate through Sharia. 

All get their inspiration if not their funding and money from the fascist Islamism of the motherland: Saudi Arabia - where atheists are executed, other religions are banned and no non-Muslims are even allowed to set foot in the city of Mecca.

Isn't it time we faced facts? Secular Muslims and former Muslims signed the 2007 St Petersburg Declaration warning the Western World not to allow the intolerance preached by fascist Islamists to grow a foothold in the West. They asked us to stand up for Enlightenment principles, for freedom of speech. To resist the push to blasphemy laws and to ban faith courts and Sharia outright as a seditious legal system that enforces laws not passed through the democratically elected representatives of a country's citizens.

Why have we not done this? We've done the opposite: pretended there is no such thing as fascist Islamism, betraying secular Muslims. Then we stomped on freedom of speech and gave the spies and cops unlimited power to pry into our emails and phonecalls, to track us by our mobile phones and our metadata. We persecuted whistleblowers like Edward Snowden, and trashed civil liberties instead of protecting them. We did the work of the fascist Islamists for them - we destroyed ourselves.

Overseas we tried to play tribal politics and kingmakers as if that will work. stupid stupid stupid. All because we won't call out the Saudis. Are they really that powerful? Surely the US and Russia between them have enough energy resources for us to exert a bit of ideological pressure on Saudi Arabia.

Boycott Saudi. Boycott them until they give equal rights to women, gays and atheists. Boycott them and leave them to the mercy of Isis until they introduce freedom of religion in the holy land. Tear down that tower of intolerance and religious fascism.

[**France Broadens Its Surveillance Power**](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/15/world/europe/france-broadens-its-surveillance-power.html?_r=0)

&gt;And last week, with little public debate, the legislature approved a law that critics feared would markedly expand electronic surveillance of French residents and businesses.

&gt;The provision, quietly passed as part of a routine military spending bill, defines the conditions under which intelligence agencies may gain access to or record telephone conversations, emails, Internet activity, personal location data and other electronic communications.

&gt;The law provides for no judicial oversight and allows electronic surveillance for a broad range of purposes, including *“national security,”* the protection of France’s *“scientific and economic potential”* and prevention of *“terrorism”* or *“criminality.”*

[**French officials can monitor internet users in real time under new law**](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/11/french-officials-internet-users-real-time-law)

&gt;French intelligence and government officials will be able to spy on internet users in real time and without prior legal authorisation, under a law passed on Wednesday.

&gt;The legislation, which was approved almost unnoticed, will enable a wide range of public officials including police, gendarmes, intelligence and anti-terrorist agencies as well as several government ministries to monitor computer, tablet and smartphone use directly.

&gt;The spying clause, part of a new military programming law, comes just weeks after France, which considers individual privacy a pillar of human rights, expressed outrage at revelations that the US National Security Agency *(NSA)* had been intercepting phone calls in France. The president, François Hollande, expressed his *""extreme reprobation""*.

&gt;Article 13 of the new law will allow not just the security forces but intelligence services from the defence, interior, economy and budget ministries to see *""electronic and digital communications""* in real time to discover who is connected to whom, what they are communicating and where they are.

Now combine that with 10,000 French soldiers deployed in country, a large directly militarized police force with their Gendarme and this isn't exactly something to stand on a pedestal and be fucking smug about.

&gt;Washington's biggest European critic—France—also has a serious wiretapping habit, as Marc Perelman points out in Foreign Policy: *""In addition to judicially ordered taps there are also 'administrative wiretaps' decided by security agencies under the control of the government.""* Perelman argues that most French know about these policies but don't seem to care, despite clear cases of abuse in the past. Most prominent is the Elysée Scandal—named after the palace where the late President Francois Mitterrand set up an undercover listening room. Mitterrand's operatives tapped the calls of his political enemies: lawyers, businessmen, journalists, and even the actress and Chanel model Carole Bouquet. This took place in the mid-1980s but only surfaced recently, and 12 conspirators were brought to trial. What's interesting—and disturbing—about the Elysée Scandal is that at the time, French authorities had justified the surveillance as a necessary tool to fight terrorism.       

[**French government admits to wiretapping journalists in Bettencourt scandal**](http://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2011/09/fran-s09.html)

&gt;On September 1, France’s Interior Minister Claude Guéant admitted that last July French domestic intelligence spied on telephone conversations of Gérard Davet, a reporter at France’s daily of record, Le Monde. This followed a year of denials by Guéant and other officials including President Nicolas Sarkozy—in the face of a complaint by Le Monde—that any such spying had taken place.

&gt;Guéant confirmed that France’s DCRI *(Central Interior Information Service)* had *“localized telephone conversations”* of Davet. The purpose of this operation was to discover the sources of Davet’s reporting on legal investigations of L’Oréal billionaire Liliane Bettencourt. Guéant added briefly that the courts would *“decide the state of affairs”* regarding the legality of the police wiretaps.
Last summer the DCRI ordered Orange, the telephone provider, to give them detailed lists of calls *(fadettes)* made by Davet. This enabled them to subsequently identify the whistleblower, David Sénat, who worked in the department of justice. He was sacked.

**EDIT: Also in relation to this.**

The US has been the sole superpower in the world since the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The US has an inordinate amount of control over the global financial market. The US has an insanely, disproportionately powerful military with bases all around the world. American companies have a stranglehold in several key industries.The US is also the global cultural capital. American media is everywhere, all the time. The US has its thumb over human events more than any other country, even China.

Now, does the US abuse its power to maintain that status quo? Probably. But does the US want to completely dominate the world as the sole global hegemon forever? No.

The US does not actually want a unipolar world, the US wants strong allies who can handle affairs in their regions so the US is not required to get involved all the time. The US wants a strong EU and a strong Japan, and wants both to be major regional powers. The US wants a multipolar world. The wet dream of every foreign policy expert in the US is to have the EU become superpower. American generals as well as people in the civilian leadership of the US military have complained about the low military spending in Europe. Since WWII a lot of European nations have depended on the US for defense. You'd figure that this dependence would wane over time but it has actually become more pronounced in recent years. 

The ONLY US allies in Europe who can can project significant force outside of their own borders without depending on the US are the UK and France, and both only to a small degree. Germany, an economic powerhouse, has a pathetically weak military. The US is getting scared that we can't depend on our allies in the event of a major war or a western intervention.

In the 90's the western world intervened to stop a supposed genocide in the Balkans. There was basically a complete consensus that we needed to stop the Serbs.

The US provided almost all the intelligence, command and control, and heavy firepower/air strikes. Some people may think that things have changed since then, but the recent [western intervention in Libya showed again that Europe depends on the US militarily](https://euobserver.com/defence/115650). 

The US doesn't want another Soviet Union and doesn't want Russia to dominate eastern Europe, and doesn't want China to dominate the Asia-Pacific or the world, but the US does not want to be alone in deciding the future of the planet.

"flynavy88","","","All the talk about morals and ethnics and the Geneva Convention and all that forgets that Jordan arrested and sentenced these prisoners to death years ago for *civilian* terrorism - in fact, in the woman's case, back in 2006 for her involvement in the suicide bombings in Amman that killed over 60 people, most of whom were at a wedding. Hardly war POWs, much less uniformed POWs.

They're simply carrying out their sentences of some men and a woman who have become ISIS and Islamist symbols.

Now, going forward, I'm interested in seeing how the execution of this pilot plays out in Jordan and the rest of the Arab world. For those that don't know it, Jordan is a pretty unique player in the region - despite being a tiny country (in terms of population), and being poor, it is one of the closest allies of the West AND is a key ally of neighboring countries, including Israel.

Its strategic position is obvious - it borders Israel, Syria, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Iraq. People can't flow from North Africa to Iraq or Syria and vice versa without passing through Jordan.

But its cultural position is what a lot of people don't quite realize. Jordan is a monarchy ruled by a western-educated (British, in fact) King (who happens to have been an extra on Star Trek once, but I digress). At the same time, the King traces his lineage directly back to the Prophet, and as thus his tribe draws fierce loyalty from the Bedouin that made up most of Jordan's population in its infancy.

In recent years of course, the flood of Palestinian, then Iraqi, and now Syrian refugees has placed huge burdens on the Jordanian government and its people. This is a country with few resources (and certainly no oil like its neighbors) yet has the most educated Arab country and one of the highest living indexes of any country in the region. 

Now why did I mention the cultural position? Because Jordan is the most westernized of Sunni Arab countries - they have one of the lowest rates of religious participation in the area, have a westernized-style of education, close ties with the West, etc.

But also because they present a considerable alternative to the despots in the region: To the east was Iraq, once ruled by the secular but brutal Saddam. To the north is Syria, ruled by Assad and his secular but also brutal regime. To the south, the absolute monarchy ruled by Saudi Arabia, which is also home to some of the most hardline citizens and clerics in the Sunni world. To the west is Egypt, which experimented with democracy but is back to its comfortable anti-Islamist military rule.

Yet here in Jordan there is a monarchy that has shown benevolent rule (the current King's father, King Hussein, was particularly loved by everyone in the Arab world, western world, and Israelis) with a country that despite its lack of resources has given its citizens a lot - certainly a lot more than its neighbors whom even with the riches of oil don't seem to get it, ever.

Jordan isn't a secular country either - 90% of its population is Muslim (10% are Christian) - but it is certainly moderate compared to its neighbors. I was shocked to find liquor stores in Amman and what not, certainly a nod to the sizeable Christian minority in the country. Likewise, while it uses Sharia law in some areas of law - notably family law - it has also adopted westernized secular laws in other areas as well.

Long story short: Jordan has been one of the sensible moderate Arab country in the region, and their reaction to this militant Sunni Islam of ISIS may tell quite a bit about how moderate Muslims will act in reaction to the pilot's murder. Their military and King have already promised revenge - and it is telling that the King wore his traditional Bedouin garb to deliver the speech.

"fappan_gaems","","","This is happening in at least 12 cities. 7 have been confirmed so far with arrests, and operations to stop it are happening in at least another 5 (and probably far more, in reality). These abuses have been going on for more than 20 years in some of these cities. The reason it's not been dealt with is simple: something like 98% (of the people currently charged with it) are Pakistani males. Not only are they Muslim, but they are a specific racial minority (and nationality). What has genuinely occurred is that police and social workers are so afraid of being called racist that this has been continually swept under the rug, something which is still going on in newspapers like The Guardian to this very day.

Here's an article from 2011 where the Guardian are trying to downplay the obvious cultural element in an incredibly disingenuous way:
http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jan/07/grooming-racialising-crime-tradition

If you can't be bothered to read the above - which I don't blame you for - the Guardian refers to the links being drawn between Muslims/Pakistanis and this kind of organised abuse ""dubious"". They later go on to admit that they are reporting on an article originally published in The Times, and the figure they think shows only a ""dubious"" link is that 50/56 people arrested for this crime (in the entire Midlands and the North of the country) were from that demographic. It's a small sample size, yes, but it's a hell of a statistical artifact if it is one. I'd like to see what those figures are like now, 3 years down the line. Something tells me the sample size has grown, but the distribution is probably the same or worse. I'm unsure what the numbers are, because The Guardian have stopped publishing them. Hmm.

Check the Guardian's output from this week, and you'll see the exact same thing still happening. At least one person from the above comments section states that they know a policeman who said that Muslim police officers were being removed from investigating these cases after it was found that evidence has a tendency to disappear if they are allowed to. There are also unconfirmed reports of witness intimidation on a fairly wide scale associated with these cases.

In 2001, concerned parents of the girls being abused went to Nick Griffin of all people after no-one else did anything regarding their concerns, including the council and the police. An MP was specifically aware of this case and also did nothing. Nick Griffin went on to condemn the abuse of young white girls (who make up the vast majority of the victims, with a very small minority being Bangladeshi) in a speech he gave in 2004. The result? He was secretly filmed, and ended up in court on two charges of inciting racial hatred. These charges were thrown out of court, but it's amazing how accurate his allegations actually were for someone so insane. He's effectively owed a public apology as far as I'm concerned.

This is what the EDL have been shouting about for years. I used to mock them, and laugh at their paranoia. I'm not fucking laughing now, they were almost completely right about this issue. Funnily enough when the EDL and UAF marched in the same places I favoured UAF. Dispatches, a documentary series on Channel 4, attempted to air an episode about the issue 2 years ago. UAF pressured them into pulling it. UAF have a very high muslim membership. Doesn't take a genius to put the pieces together.

Culturally, I believe the cause of this is a combination of sexual frustration (since people from within the Muslim community are not allowed sex before marriage), and the view that non-Muslim women are basically the lowest form of life and worthy of no respect. This has been confirmed again and again by quotes from those charged, too. As for why it's specifically Pakistan, I don't know. Until we as a society dare to have this discussion, it will continue. 

There's also, to add to the disgusting nature of this, a very strong appearance of the media refusing to cover these stories because they know it adds fuel to the extreme right's fire. Of course, in reality, this strategy has backfired, because not only is the abuse happening, it seems the establishment and the media have been in cahoots in covering it up for decades. If you live in Rotherham, where 1500 girls are confirmed to have been raped over the past 10 years as a result of these gangs, you'd be fucking insane to vote for Labour, who let this happen. The only remaining option would be UKIP. Good job, media.

There's two sides to every story. Here's the co-producer of the documentary exposing Leslee Udwin's agenda. . For some reason the article was taken off the internet. Some bright soul managed to save a cached link - http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:FeW8L6A-1R4J:www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/anjali-bhushan-co-producer-of-indias-daughter-speaks-out-full-statement/article1-1323775.aspx+&amp;cd=12&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=in

Make no mistake. Rape is a heinous crime. When public anger over the Nirbhaya incident boiled over, the question which confronted our society was how a human being could be driven to commit acts of such depravity. Although, it is said that the moral compass of all criminals is skewed the brutality of this incident made it necessary from a social viewpoint to examine the question of where such behaviour stems from.

The documentary ""India's Daughter"" was therefore conceived to serve a social cause which was unfortunately overshadowed by the self-promoting agenda of my collaborator, Ms. Leslee Udwin. I had fallen out with her by the time that the principle photography of the film was completed and was conveniently excluded from the final edits. Subsequently, her attempt to exploit the subject matter of the documentary in a self-advancing attempt to sensationalize the content has not only brought disrepute to my profession and the country but also resulted in hurting the sentiments of the victims of rape who would invariably be exposed to the film. Granted editorial and journalistic privilege, there is also a particular sensibility that should be a guiding factor as an ethical standard. This is the same sensibility because of which the international media decides against telecasting the brutal immolation of a Jordanian pilot by terrorists. The social message which is the very essence of the film I wanted to make is now lost in the unfortunate controversy which has followed. When one edits several hours of footage, it is this sensibility, suitably deployed, which comes into play. It was this 'sensibility' which I was not able to exercise having been prevented by Ms. Leslee Udwin from participating in the post-assembly review of the film. And it was the lack of exercise of this 'sensibility' on her part, (having denied herself of my input as an Indian woman), in a cynical attempt to capture eyeballs and headlines which has led to the unfortunate controversy which will continue to cast a shadow on her career as a film maker. The story does not end here. Regardless of her lack of sensibilities and judgment, Ms. Udwin knowingly and cynically breached the conditions and undertakings under which the permissions were granted. It was clear right at the outset that the permission to shoot the documentary was conditional upon the viewing of the unedited footage and the final cut by the authorities. Having completed the shooting, Ms. Udwin arrogantly refused to comply. On being shown snippets of the film, the authorities at Tihar Prisons had categorically stated that the comments of the convict were objectionable. The authorities further asked for the full i.e. unedited film to be able to review the same in the proper context. It was reiterated that the film should not be released till it is approved by the prison authorities and the Ministry.

When Ms. Udwin categorically refuted this demand by Tihar Prisons, I was horrified especially since I had repeatedly pleaded with her to comply with all conditions and formalities. Ultimately, in September 2014, I received a letter from Ms. Udwin's lawyers terminating our agreements. One of the grounds of termination was that my warnings had in fact led to the DG (Prisons) sending a legal notice to her company on the grounds of breach of permissions granted by the jail authorities!

Subsequently, when I accidently stumbled upon the fact that plans to release the documentary were afoot, I was both angry and surprised, since I had been informed that the BBC will not air the documentary until the Supreme Court hearings were over. I immediately proceeded to warn the media houses planning to telecast the film, both about the fact that permission to do so had not been received and also the fact that the matter was still sub judice.
That despite my warnings the documentary, which includes an abominable portrayal of the issue, was still aired is a sad reflection of the triumph of the personal ambition of a producer who valued publicity and international recognition over the social agenda of the entire production.",1425875301,"","1425876982",1,126,"worldnews"

&gt;Israeli officials justify demolitions of Palestinian structures on the grounds that they were built “illegally” without building permits in areas not zoned for residential construction. However Israeli authorities have zoned land in ways that unlawfully discriminates against Palestinians. Israeli authorities have zoned 13 percent of East Jerusalem for Palestinian construction, but expropriated 35 percent of the area for settlement construction. Israeli authorities in practice permit Palestinian construction in only one percent of the other area of the West Bank, “Area C,” that is under exclusive Israeli control. According to B’Tselem, an Israeli rights group, Israeli authorities have allocated 63 percent of Area C to settlements.

unacceptable policy has caused homelessness and accompanying trauma to thousands of

Palestinians.

About 45 minutes into the flight the plane went into a sharp and as yet unexplained descent from it's cruising altitude of 38,000 ft to roughly 6,000 ft. Contact with the plane was lost shortly thereafter.
Debris was scattered over a large mountainous area, with the largest piece being roughly the size of a small car.
The black box has been found, and no links to terrorism have been reported though the cause remains a mystery.

&gt;In a report assessing possible implications of faulty US intelligence Richard Lloyd, a former UN weapons inspector, and Theodore A. Pistol, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), examined the delivery rocket’s design and calculated possible trajectories based on the rocket’s payload. The authors concluded that sarin gas, “could not possibly have been fired at East Ghouta from the ‘heart’, or from the Eastern edge, of the Syrian government controlled area shown in the intelligence map published by the White House on August 30, 2013.”Even France, one of Assad's most vicious critics, plainly admits that ""samples it had collected suggesting Syrian government forces had used chlorine gas in the country's civil war may not prove to be conclusive.""If Higgins is certain that he has cracked the Da Vinci Code of the Syrian  chemical attacks, he needs to get on the phone with the Associated Press and the United Nations and set the record straight. 

&gt;“It’s clear and unambiguous this munition could not have come from Syrian government-controlled areas as the White House claimed,” Theodore Postol[professor in the Science, Technology, and Global Security Working Group at MIT] told MintPress News. Higgins, Postol said, “has done a very nice job collecting information on a website. As far as his analysis, it’s so lacking any analytical foundation it’s clear he has no idea what he’s talking about.

A) on depressurisation, as long as oxygen masks have been deployed they don't need to descend very rapidly - the O2 will last, although there will be cold damage after a few minutes, I believe it's normal to descend maintaining Vmo in this case

B) ICAO guidance is to turn off the flight path and start orbits when doing an emergency descent (as there may be traffic underneath)(note: UK recommends to stay on flight path) - there was no evidence of a turn on flightradar, 

C) One of the steps for an emergency descent is to check for terrain etc, and allegedly there should be a plan in place for a heading to follow to rapidly leave danger areas over mountains, from what I can see, the aircraft didn't change heading

D) Icing is a real problem on a rapid descent, and deicers etc should be set early in the descent just in case, as they may not have been set initially,

E) When flying at high altitude, they'd be using the default QNH (1013 IIRC) - if they descended on that and local QNH was vastly different, then their actual altitude would be massively different to their pressure altitude,

F) It's interesting to note how groundspeed was relatively constant - almost like double engine failure but autopilot was still on set to maintain groundspeed (haven't computed what the different airspeeds would be)

G) On an A320, I believe a descent rate above 3000fpm with idle engines would require spoilers in order to maintain a safe/constant airspeed, not sure how much thrust idle engines provide though,

H) No Mayday (emergency) or PAN (urgent issue) was sent, and squawk wasn't changed to 7700 - while communicate is the last thing to do, there seemed more than enough time.

&gt;nuclear leak

This doesn't even make sense.  Is it nuclear fuel? Radiation?  I think they mean ""Radioactive contaminant leak"", but their terminology is very confusing.

&gt;Radiation levels at the tsunami-hit plant measured 50 to 70 times greater than usual

This is outright wrong. It was not ""total radiation levels at the plant"".  If that were the case, then we would have an actual emergency on our hands.

&gt;Sensors at the Fukushima nuclear plant have detected a fresh leak of highly radioactive water to the sea

So they mean, ""radiation levels **at one point** in the plant measured 50 to 70 times greater than usual"", but even that doesn't tell us anything without knowing what ""usual"" is.  It could be that the sensor was in an abnormally non-contaminated area and some water rolled off some hill spreading contamination to it.

&gt;Fukushima Daiichi plant to a nearby bay, 

There is no bay near Fukushima Daiichi. [Here's the map](https://www.google.co.jp/maps/place/Fukushima+Daiichi+Nuclear+Power+Station/@37.4172153,141.0432371,13z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x6020dd48057a6a21:0x5c6983a9a9082bf8). See? No bay.

&gt;up to 70 times greater than the already-high radioactive status seen at the plant campus.

Some places in the plant have lower background dose than Ramsar, Iran (the highest background dose location inhabited by humans), although some places are much, *much* higher.

&gt;TEPCO said its emergency inspections of tanks storing nuclear waste water

The water they hold is only technically ""nuclear waste water"".  Their dose levels are far lower than IAEA recommended guidelines for drinking water, and probably safer than the tap water in your home.

&gt;TEPCO has not been able to effectively deal with an increasing amount of contaminated water, used to cool the crippled reactors and molten fuels inside them

Also inaccurate. By volume, almost all of the contaminated water is groundwater that has leaked into the basements of reactor buildings 1-3.  Also, the groundwater that is stored in tanks has been purified and is basically pure water with heightened levels of tritium.  (Does not bioaccumulate in water as it is chemically identical to water. Any sane radiation contamination engineer would suggest dumping it into the ocean to purify it, but TEPCO does not take this option because of the PR nightmare.)",1424615159,"","1424615440",1,410,"worldnews"

"Tickle_Me_H0M0","","","The leaked documents basically reveal that the NSA is preparing a variety of cyber tools in case of a major cyber war. Such tools include being able to take down entire networks of foreign governments and conduct sabotage of critical infrastructure. 

Such tools were necessary because adversaries like China and Russia had similar developments. 

In other words, there is a cyber arms race going on between the worlds major powers.  

Another interesting revelation is that while the NSA was investigating cyber attacks against the DoD, it was able to trace the attack from where it originally came from. They were then able to plant a bug inside that source which happened to be one of the central routers that China's intelligence services uses and intercepted whatever the Chinese cyber spies were stealing. One instance, the Chinese were stealing documents from the UN and in turn the US intercepted those documents. The NSA was also even able to get the identity of the hackers. 

This explains how the FBI was able to [publicly charge 5 Chinese military officers for espionage.](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-05-19/u-s-said-to-charge-chinese-military-officers-with-online-spying.html) It seems the US was warning the Chinese military that the NSA knew what the Chinese espionage apparatus was up to and knew the identities of their spies.

The documents also highlight the fact that the NSA caught other nations spying and doing similar things that they were doing (in particular China, Russia and France was mentioned). 

Snowden says that he is concerned about the NSA focusing more on offense rather than defense. 

However, despite all the NSA's efforts in protecting US government and US military networks, there were over 30,000 incidents in which foreign attackers had succeeded in penetrating such networks. 

There is no perfect defense. A good offense helps deter and mitigate the potential consequences.

EDIT: I would also like to point out that the title of the article is made in such a way that it deceives the reader into assuming the NSA is preparing to start a major cyber war which is obviously incorrect. The NSA is simply building up an arsenal of cyber weapons to deter major adversaries (mainly Russia and China) in the cyberspace domain. ",1421550636,"","1421553936",1,119,"worldnews"

"megamuncher","",""," Benjamin Netanyahu is facing a storm of criticism because of his ""embarrassing"" behaviour at Sunday's mass solidarity march in Paris and his calls for French Jews to emigrate to Israel following last week's deadly attack on a Jewish supermarket.

The Israeli prime minister was seen elbowing his way to the front of the parade of world leaders and also unsuccessfully tried to jump to the head of queue waiting for a bus that was to take guests to the starting point.

After he failed to get on the first bus, a nervous-looking Mr Netanyahu – accompanied by what appeared to be an Israeli security team – was shown on French video footage waiting for the next one.

During the march, Mr Netanyahu waved to the crowd in response to a pro-Israel shout from a woman spectator, a gesture some Israeli commentators deemed to be at odds with the sombre mood.

The alleged gaffes were further compounded by reports that the Israeli leader attended the event in defiance of a request to stay away from Francois Hollande, the French president, who reportedly did not want it overshadowed by the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Related Articles

    Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced his support for dispersing the Knesset (parliament) and conducting early elections amid a coalition crisis  
 
 Mr Netanyahu initially agreed but changed his mind after learning that two political rivals – Avigdor Lieberman, the Israeli foreign minister, and Naftali Bennett, the industry minister and leader of the Jewish Home party – were going.

His insistence on attending prompted the French authorities to invite Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian Authority leader, as a counterweight, reported the liberal Israeli newspaper Haaretz.

The most serious criticism has been levelled at his call for members of France's Jewish community – the largest in Europe – to move to Israel for safety reasons following last Friday's attack on a kosher supermarket in Paris, in which four Jews were killed.

Even before his plane departed for Paris, Mr Netanyahu issued a statement saying that he planned to tell French Jews who wanted to emigrate to Israel that they would be ""welcomed with open arms"".

That is said to have offended Mr Hollande, who attended a rally at Paris' grand synagogue on Sunday night with Mr Netanyahu but pointedly left before the Israeli leader addressed the audience.

Mr Netanyahu's appeal for emigration, echoed by some other Israeli politicians, was criticised by European Jewish leaders and – implicitly – by Reuven Rivlin, the Israeli president, who said aliyah (emigration) should be born out of choice and Zionist feelings rather than fear of anti-Semitism.

Rabbi Menachem Margolin, director of the European Jewish Association, said that instead of calling for Jews to emigrate after anti-Semitic attacks, Israel should ""employ every diplomatic and informational means at its disposal to strengthen the safety of Jewish life in Europe"", an Israeli website reported.

Ben Caspit, an experienced Israeli commentator, mocked Mr Netanyahu's attempt to portray Israel as a safe haven. ""Are the Jews of Paris more threatened than us?,"" he asked in Maariv newspaper. ""All of Israel's territory is targeted by thousands of accurate and heavy rockets and missiles that could be fired on our heads in the next flare-up with Hizbullah.

Looks like he had an episode before, which said he required ongoing psychological checks. Maybe he was entering or in another episode, and always dreamed about going out this way, and knew he wouldn't have another chance if he was evaluated again.

People in a real depressive episode don't process things properly. He's a dick for taking everyone else out with him, but chances are he never really processed it.

The second he touched the autopilot he had no way out. If he let them back in, he'd be asked why he touched it, and he'd never be allowed to fly again, and would need to find some other way out.


He knew he'd die doing something he liked, and it would be absolutely instant.


Completely selfish, but maybe the same guy under medication, or in the right frame of mind, would be horrified by the thought of him doing that.


It's always struck me how Stephen Fry described bi-polar disorder. When you're depressed, you don't care about anything. You're not working properly. People can say there's no reason to feel down, that they're there for you, or you'll leave loved ones behind, or they won't understand it because he's rich, but nothing anyone could say or do would give any relief, or make you care. It's literally a fault in the brain making you experience morbid depression for no reason. You're prevented from even feeling care. It's a real cognitive fight. We are dominated by our feelings. We all know we should exercise more, eat less, read more, study more, sleep early, turn off the PC, wake up early. All make cognitive sense. We come to those conclusions ourselves, and even weak emotions override those plans.


Just as you can take MDMA and feel like you understand everything, and feel euphoric, for absolutely no reason; depression can make you feel completely hopeless, completely without care of empathy, for absolutely no external reason.


There's no justification or care, he brain is broken and is subjecting his consciousness to unbelievably strong feelings to the point logic goes out the window.


A faulty part on the pilot put the plane in the side of a mountain. One that should have had regular checks for airworthiness.


He should perhaps have seeked help when he first started noticing it, but that kind of recognition requires cognitive therapy. Perhaps the thought of him being grounded and not being able to fly again was enough for him to delay past the point of no return.


The US system of having two people on the flight deck might have been enough to stop him. I doubt he was violent. He just saw an easy way out, and switched off.



What he did was fucking awful. He's a killer of school children, and other innocents, but I see it more like a faulty actuator screw gear, than an act of terrorism or other evil. What a sad thing to have happened.



If it doesn't make sense to you, got take some ecstasy, and do nothing but lay in bed. No partying, just try put yourself in the most boring situation. See all the ways you try and rationalise why you feel good that aren't down to the direct effect the drug is having on the very core of what guides your conscious thought. Try and convince yourself you're bored, or uncomfortable. Try and think of all the reasons why your life sucks, and you should be sad. Try and be objective in all of this. Notice how everything seems fixable? Or you have all the answers?


No imagine the opposite of that. The guy was a faulty part of the aircraft. Shouldn't have been allowed to fly in that condition. I feel sorry for him now. And I think what he did was disgusting.

I regret reading the comments on here they made me feel pretty shitty. I'm a secular liberal Jewish girl. I was born in a country with lots of antisemitism and my parents moved us as soon as it was possible when I started experiencing antisemitism in school. So from a young age I grew up in Israel, and there was some discrimination there too based on my country of my birth but I loved living there. It's beautiful, there are many wonderful people from different religions, cultures, countries. Since I was little I always hoped for peace and argued with those who believed security wasn't possible with peace. We moved to the U.S. I am still a supporter of peace and have always hoped for it. Every time I meet someone new from the Middle East I make it a point to mention I'm from Israel so they can see there are peaceful Israelis as well. My best friend growing up was Muslim and I have had wonderful experiences with friends from other middle eastern countries.

Of course there are Israelis who choose security over peace, but that's not all Israelis and not all Jews.

These comments lump all Israelis and all Jews together and vilify people based in the actions of their government.

The actual quote is in English is: ""Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people.""

Marx was hostile to religion as he believed it to be a similar distraction imposed on the workers just as nationalism, race, party politics are to prevent the workers from rebelling and realizing they are all in the same category of downtrodden serfs. To prevent rebellion, some subcategories of the workers were made better than their cohorts so that the infighting and competition would occupy their time and minds rather than seeing the true class distinction.

The Church, as we all know, has a dark history shown primarily in their marriage to the feudal classes. There is a reason the French Revolution was so determined to rid the land of the Church's influence not only as one of the governmental estates but also their hold on the people. It was a fight between religious superstition and Enlightenment reason. 

The hold of the Church on state politics might have become more hidden, but such power and influence does not disappear over day and night. It adapts because those in power have the means and resources to adapt.

The Vatican is also probably the largest money laundering bank in the world. They have vast financial resources and ties to influential people. It is not a secret that the mafia mainly launders their money in the Vatican and surely their patronage network does not only extend to mobsters and old men wanting to become bishops. The Church was always a master player in the courts of kings and emperors. It is doubtful they gave up that mechanism of power but learned it is better to appear to have than to risk another de-Christianization attempt a la the French Revolution.

Cuba has always claimed to be Marxist-Lenninst (Stalinist), and a primary tenant of that is atheism. As Cubans Old Guard dies, the Castros seem to giving up their previous ideology piecemeal. THey couldn't do this while their revolutionary comrades still ran the country because doing so would risk destabilization by infighting. Now that they are dead or dying, the Castros may have realized the old way is finished and want to join the capitalist globalized world simply because *it works*.

The American Empire may have many drawbacks in this imperfect world, but it is better than any previous empire in the history of the world. The crimes they commit may be horrendous, but for the common billions of workers, they are living in a dream come true that their ancestors never thought possible. 

Marx predicted the Victorian state of affairs of worker exploitation (not saying workers aren't exploited today) would continue and spread as well as advance to even worser states causing a workers' rebellion. Obviously this hasn't happened as the standard of living for the workers' has drastically improved, but naturally the gap between bourgeois and proletariats still exists.
