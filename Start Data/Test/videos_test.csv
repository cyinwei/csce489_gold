"xcomv01","","","There is more to the story than what you see here. Chevron has never operated in Ecuador. Texaco Petroleum (TexPet), which became a subsidiary of Chevron in 2001, was a minority partner in an oil-production consortium in Ecuador along with the state-owned oil company, Petroecuador, from 1964 to 1992. After TexPet turned its remaining share of the oil operations over to Petroecuador in 1992, pursuant to an agreement with Ecuador, TexPet conducted a remediation of selected production sites while Petroecuador committed to perform any remaining cleanup. The government of Ecuador oversaw and certified the successful completion of TexPet’s remediation and fully released TexPet from further environmental liability. Petroecuador, however, failed to conduct the cleanup it promised and has continued to operate and expand oil operations in the former concession over the past 20 years.

This one is from the show Ghost Stories, which was a kids mystery show, focusing on a group of children solving ghost apperances and stuff.

When the Dubbing studio (ADV) got the rights to dub the show, the original Japanese licensor, Aniplex, said they could do whatever they wanted with the script. So ADV decided to re-write the script to a comedic one, and let the voice actors ad-lib a lot of it on the fly.

From Wiki: ""Controversy ensued over ADV's dubbed version, which largely re-writes the original script (while still leaving the basic plot structure and storyline intact) in favor of a comedic one written by ADV screenwriter Steven Foster, and lines that the voice actors ad-libbed""

""In the dub, dialog changes from serious to tongue-in-cheek where characters often break the fourth wall, make pop culture references, engage in brief exposition, and use profanity. For example, in the first episode, when Hajime encounters Momoko for the first time, in the Japanese version, he says ""She's beautiful""; however, in the ADV dub, he says ""Giggity giggity!""""

""In addition to dialog changes, other elements of the show were re-worked to facilitate the comedic script. The vocation of Momoko was changed from a psychic to that of a fanatical evangelical, Pentecostal Christian, Satsuki's mother is portrayed as a lesbian, and the Miyanoshita name changed to ""Manshita"" as a pun. Although, Leo's character is a researcher in the supernatural, in the dub he is also Jewish and has an inferiority complex and Satsuki's young brother Keiichirou is depicted as being mentally challenged. Several minor characters' backgrounds are expanded slightly (mostly for comedic purposes), as well.""

"PiggyBankofDespair","","","I can't quite tell exactly to what extent this guy is joking, but I will say this is something I run into all the damn time and it is seriously the most horrible feeling in the world. Hell, just today I was approaching the line at a McDonald's and the woman in front of me saw me over her shoulder and immediately started trying to reel her kid in, as though if he'd gotten more than three feet away I was going to snap him up and she was never going to see him again. I don't even really have a problem with children, but I am absolutely terrified of people's kids because of what people might do to me if I somehow interact with them. It's heartbreaking to live in a world where more and more kids are being raised to see men as monsters.

And the way some women look at me when I'm in public, my god. I know there are assholes out there who treat women like crap and because of those assholes many women are on guard in public spaces. I sure as hell don't blame them for it. It's one thing to be on guard, but it's another thing entirely to just stare down a total stranger who isn't doing anything. When I'm minding my own business and some lady is making me feel so self-conscious with her constant glaring that I feel like I need to bathe in boiling water to feel clean again, it's pretty goddamn hard to think to myself ""Oh, right, even though I'm doing nothing wrong and I'm being made to feel disgusting and unwanted because of my sex, I'm actually not the victim here."" Over time, it starts getting to you. Any time you go somewhere by yourself you wish you could just be invisible. You start to think, ""Am I actually doing something wrong? Is there something wrong with me? Why do people keep looking at me like that? Is the way I'm being treated actually somehow my fault?""

And I think the worst part is that you're made to feel like you're not allowed to talk about it. Some people tell you more-or-less that you're full of shit and need to ""man up,"" while others might celebrate the ball of anxiety you've developed in your stomach as some sort of ""male awareness."" A small minority might actually step up and say ""Yeah bro, I know this and it sucks,"" but you're just as likely to encounter someone who tries to justify someone else making you feel like the biggest piece of shit on the planet by reminding you that the glaring and the sideways glances and the blatant disgust and the friendships you've lost to distrust, all of which have completely eroded your confidence, happened because you are guilty by proxy of actions you've never had anything to do with.",1423021073,"","False",1,251,"videos"

"mcanerin","","","Just so we are clear, there is a difference between true urban Chinese and rural Chinese. I know this sounds like a no true Scotsman speech, but hear me out.

You know how, almost without fail, that whatever country you happen to be living in right now, there is a backwards, less educated area where people seem to have missed the whole ""civilization"" memo? Often it's rural, but sometimes it's certain areas of big cites. They are usually uneducated, poor, racist,and if they are religious they tend towards an intolerant version of it. Often they drink or take drugs too much and are proud of it. I know you know who I'm talking about, and I don't even know what country or city you are in right now. 

The problem is that this area of China is currently MOST of the damn country. It's extremely aggravating to native Hong Kong, Shanghai and Beijingers, because these cities tend to get swamped by these folk arriving for jobs and ruining it for everyone.

A few years ago, only wealthy Chinese could travel, so you never heard about ""Chinese tourists"". ""Chinese tourists"" ruining things simply wasn't something that happened before the Beijing Olympics. 

Now, travel is becoming more open and suddenly all these, let's call them hicks, who can now buy tickets and visit countries. But these are not just any hicks. No, they are hicks that are MUCH more important than the other hicks back in their village. In their own minds, of course. 

So, arrogant, elitist hicks. That can travel. Result: suddenly, we have Chinese Tourist memes. The same thing happened when the American middle and lower middle class was first able to afford to travel - we ended up with the stereotypical ""ugly American"". They weren't ""normal"" Americans, they were hicks with tickets.

I know it doesn't seem like it, but this is actually a good thing in the big picture - it shows in very real terms the rising wealth and freedom in China. Yeah, it's the ugly side of it, but it is an important part of the process.

Here on the internet, we got the same thing when AOL users first got access to the internet (if you are old enough to remember it). We see a bit of it every fall when University starts. It eventually works itself out, but it takes a while because there is a new crop of hicks coming through over and over. But eventually the people returning, and embarrassing stories, start to have an effect on them.

Today, I don't see the ""ugly American"" tourist anymore. Sure, there are a few idiots, but in no more numbers than most other countries idiots. It took about a full generation to do it. Actually, of the WASP-type tourists I see being jerks, the baton has mostly been passed to Australians in Asia. Bogans with tickets.

The Chinese will eventually become normal travelers, but it's going to take a while. Just don't assume that every Chinese traveler you meet is a hick - usually the ones traveling solo or in small groups are pretty normal - it's the tour groups of people who are clearly new to the whole travel thing, and have never really had to actually deal with other cultures, races, religions, or history in their whole lives before - they often actually don't know any better, as sad as that sounds.

Besides that, none of us have any evidence (unless you can link it, please do) that these guys got called about a snowball fight.

**I DO NOT FUCKING GIVE A SHIT**. *Not now, not agter the first time you idiots shoved this irrelevant conspiracy quackery bullshit in my face and demanded that I pay attention to your pretty little hate machine*.

I do not give a shit and a half that Pao is CEO of reddit. I do not give a shit and a half that her husband has been accused of *anything*.

##DO YOU KNOW WHY I DO NOT GIVE A SHIT?!?!

Read very fucking closely, because this is important, you potato-brained jars of bacon grease:

^(I don't give a shit because my tax money pays for courts and prosecutors and police detectives to give a shit *for me*.)

I DO NOT CARE.

You little idiot conspiracy shitheads running around reposting the same shit over and over and over and hoping it will score you points, that this is going to be the pressure that finally makes a difference, that you're doing righteous work —

No. **NOTHING**. None of this is righteous. You're just pissing people off by whining about why we won't jump on your godsforsaken bandwagon.

Pao has to answer to a fucking Board of Directors. She has to answer to investors. It's literally impossible for her to walk into a data center and pull the plugs on reddit, she isn't going to sink the corporation, she isn't going to sell it to Time-Warner or any other media conglomerate, there is literally nothing she can do to rape or pillage or loot this company or screw it over.

As far as your bitching about the moderators goes: make your own goddamned subreddits and set your own rules. You want to live in an unmoderated hell, you go rigt ahead — no-one is obliged to join you.

"SirT6","","","I liked this video a lot. I empathize with the speaker, and I agree -- it is both heartbreaking and infuriating to watch media coverage of peaceful protests against police brutality get brushed aside to cover violent protests instead.

At the same time, however, I wonder if we have fallen victim to a master narrative regarding race and rioting. Too often the stories of rioting that we have seen coming from Ferguson and Baltimore have been juxtaposed against black culture (whatever that even means), with the implication being there is something fundamentally flawed with the black community because of their inability to peacefully assemble.

And frankly, this idea infuriates me. It isn't rooted in any sense of reality as far as I can tell. People judge the black community in Baltimore because some of its members robbed a convenience store. [Here are white people wrecking private property because they were angry that Joe Paterno, a man implicated in a child abuse scandal, was being fired](http://i.imgur.com/FP9alJl.jpg) -- yet that protest wasn't somehow conflated with white culture (a term that no one even tries to use because it sounds so preposterous). 

Hell, this country was founded when a group of marginalized white men gathered their muskets, ransacked a tea-ship and shot some British police officers. Yet, while they are revered, acts like the one we see in Baltimore are reviled. It speaks to a double standard; and the idea that there is something wrong with the black community in Baltimore, or anywhere else, because black people robbed a 7-11 is absurd.",1430183596,"","1432146028",2,688,"videos"

There's barely enough space for breathing room so I slowly stuck my mouth out of the water so I didn't bonk my head or make noise so she would hear me.

Well, after about 10 seconds I hear her claws and whimpers on the dock above and she dives in. After a few ungraceful doggy paddles she spots me under the dock and comes toward me with wide, panicked eyes. Apparently she didn't have a rescue plan so instead of gently biting my hand to drag me out she just scratches the fucking shit out of me. I bang my head on the dock and swallow water so now we're both panicking.

I shove her away to escape her toe-knives and climb back onto the dock. I lift her out of the water and set her down next to me. Her tail is going crazy and she licks my face thinking she just saved my life. I look down to examine the bloody scratch marks all over my neck and chest, sigh, and call her a good girl.

Edit to respond to a few things: 

* Thank you for the gold! 
* I'll definitely read all the cooking suggestions and try to push to make some. The drone assisted Twinkie frying is really firing up my imagination. 
* I know the correct way to pan fry gnocchi, and I know I was deep frying there. 
* I'll pronounce those potato dumplings any way I want and there is nothing you can do to stop me.
* Yes, the one audio channel doesn't work. I'm well aware. We discovered a problem after we rushed to record this many years ago. It happens. Back then we used to video in a closet with garbage equipment. The company that I work for, WebstaurantStore, has been very successful, so my video guys have top of the line stuff and we aren't typically flying by the seat of our pants anymore.
* I've always been okay with embarrassing myself to make others laugh, but I have to say it still really touches me that people tell me this made them laugh when they were having a bad day. I love that and makes all the goofiness worth it. 
* I geek out over all my kitchen equipment now, so keep those cooking suggestions coming! Making videos is a lot of work, but it is great fun...better than being at my desk. And I am an expert at food service equipment, so if you ever have any questions that way, feel free to pm me.

"bjKnizek","","","Zealous MotoGP fan here, I do not often see my beloved sport appear outside of the dedicated subreddits, so I thought I would take this opportunity to provide some context to the video and hopefully convert some new fans! (join us over at /r/motogp)

The video is of the 2015 Argentina Moto3 Warm-up session. Moto3 is the smallest of the 3 classes in the MotoGP championship, they ride 250cc 4 stroke prototype bikes. The two main characters in the video are Romano Fenati (on the Black/Blue Sky46 bike / the angry one) and Niklas Ajo (on the Black/Red RBA Racing Team bike/ the one getting kicked).

As some others have commented in this thread, Fenati has a bit o history with his temper and can be quite moody. Ajo is from Finland so he is usually cold as ice. While we cant see exactly what happened, it isnt that uncommon for the Moto3 riders to sometimes get in each others way when one person is doing a fast lap and another person is not for a few possible reasons that I wont go into. So Niklas messed up Romano's lap during the warm-up, how exactly we do not know but it is pretty safe to say it was not intentional. That being said, it is entirely possible that Niklas was just being thick headed and sitting on the racing line while going slow (a big no no). So what you see is Romano getting overly aggressive in response to his lap getting ruined (this is a warm-up where fast laps do not actually count towards any kind of points or position). At one point Romano hits the kill switch on Niklas's bike and then takes off (this is at the end of the session where most riders do practice starts). We see Ajo try to ""bump start"" the bike but these 250cc engines have huge compression ratios and are very difficult to start without some kind of external tool. 

All in all it turned out fairly harmless but Fenati was very childish here and was handed some penalty points and had to start the race from the back of the grid (last place).

Most of us are doing pretty well compared to the rest of the world, but our lives still lack any real meaning.  Few if any of us are actually driving change in the world.  Many of us are struggling with realizing the world is far too complex to encompass it all onto one mind, and this forces us to cope with out own weakness and incapability.  This lack of control leaves us feeling helpless.  All we can do is lash out at seemingly obvious injustice, and while injustice should be lashed, the way topics can be spinned obfuscates the lines between justice, injustice, benevolence and exploitation.  

We are hopelessly lost, thrashing about in the confusing smog of politics and propaganda.  Cynicism is a ladder out of the smog, but even from atop this lofty perch, all that is visible is the outside of the cloud.

"FoodForTheGods","","","I see a fight with my SJW friend on the horizon because I'm pretty sure she's going to do a happy dance about this shit. 

Look. Having a conversation about the shitty way that women and minorities are treated in society is great. We should absolutely be having these conversations. As a female I've been catcalled since the tender age of 12, told I do my job **really well**- for someone with a vagina, and gotten into a bar fight because I told a guy I wasn't interested and he, upon learning that my lack of interest was because I purely wasn't interested and not because I had a boyfriend, decided that trying to fondle me was okay. 

What bugs the shit out of me is the ad hominem invective that is generally used to have these conversations. Calling someone racist or sexist or whatever ""ist"" or ""ism"" you want to use does nothing to get the other side to listen to you and drive the social change you want to see. Personal attacks have this funny way of actually shutting down the conversation and increasing tension between the two parties. Then it just becomes a contest of who can yell the loudest and longest, rather than trying to articulately solve the core of the issue. 

I would still pay good money to see a hardcore SJW have a debate with Bill O'Reilly though. Pretty sure I'd need ear plugs to survive.

&gt; \#BREAKING - KSU places administrator seen in viral #ItsBiggerThanKSU video on leave. http://2wsb.tv/1cBG0ht  
  
---------  
  
Based on the available footage, I'm not seeing how the employee had grounds to demand removal let alone claim harassment.

* Kevin Bruce was an enrolled student.  
* The advising office is public and accessible to all students during office hours.  
* Bruce was waiting to speak with ""[one of his exercise science advisers](http://www.wsbtv.com/news/news/local/ksu-looking-viral-video-student-shot-advisor-telli/nmGrt/)"" ... (Mrs. Tilly?)
* Bruce was polite and did not appear to initiate or engage in violent, aggressive, or verbally abusive action.  
* The employee (Abby Dawson) in the video was [Kennesaw State U. Director of Advising and Internships](https://www.kennesaw.edu/chhs/essm/faculty.html). [thnx /u/goal2004 ]
* The student claims advising director Dawson had cancelled scheduled meetings in the past and implied Dawson had limited prior communication to email correspondence.

There's more to this obviously than what is shown, but simply sitting in a waiting area without a scheduled appointment is not grounds for immediate trespass or a form of harassment.  I wouldn't jump to call this racism, but at first glance it looks like the employee is not performing responsibilities of her job if Bruce's claims are accurate.

Edit: I just want to clarify something. When I made this comment, I was passing time in the bathroom on my phone and the douche part was just me being facetious.

"JLBate","","","Blue shorts guy is a twat. That Cop is my hero. 


**Edit:** Wow. Hate mail. To people who consider the Cop's use of force as excessive - you've clearly never restrained or arrested anyone. He was single crewed and outnumbered dealing with drunk, aggressive young males. He is completely surrounded at points and needed eyes in the back of his head. Despite repeated verbal instructions requesting the men to comply - which were clearly ignored - he *had* to use force to take charge of the situation. What if this guy's mate comes and tries to help him? What if somebody goes for my gun? What if my back-up doesn't arrive? What if one of these guys has a weapon? 

John McClane would've taken control using a couple of sarcastic one-liners, but this is the real world. Modern policing is tough. Hindsight is great, but this Cop could be forced to make split-second decisions that Lawyers could debate for 5 months. That's policing for you. 

If a little respect would've been shown to the Cop in the first instance then *all* of the BS that follows could be avoided. That Cop took control of the situation and performed a hard task to a good standard.

"Cogitotoro","","","""So a lot of people have been asking me about my choreography. Well, for a lot of it I had to choreograph myself not, like, moving around too much because my bedroom is pretty much really really small, and that's where I do all my dancing. And for a lot of it I have to not really move my feet too much, because my mom gets p.o.'d if I 'stomp' around too much. I'm like, 'Mother, this is my *passion*, don't you understand that I have been dedicating my whole *life* to dance?' So I don't care, I do that one part at the end where I really cut loose and go crazy on the dance floor just for my soul. But I haven't practiced that part as much because of my total square of a parent.

It was kind of far out having all those people from the Rest Home there, because usually I'm just looking at my mirror on my closet door when I boogie. But really, and this is the secret of the 'sizzle' in my moves, I'm imagining that I'm on stage and the audience is Robby Benson. Robby Benson or Leif Garret, it depends on my mood.

"Arknell","","","I know exactly how she feels, I got sick on the plane home from Bangkok airport once, had fever all the 12 hours home to Sweden, and then got sent to hospital, where they tested my blood and saw the ESR was through the roof, I had Campylobacteriosis. Some gut bacteria was playing Come All Ye Faithful with my bowels, the gas production was just astounding, awe-inspiring.

It was fun the first four hours, although the farts smelled like burnt plastic and hate. Then came the pain. The horrible cramps. The bowels have several sphincters in specific sections, like tollbooths, and when two of them lock up, and the gas builds inbetween, in the sensitive small intestine, like building a balloon animal, it feels like the Spanish Inquisition.

Then the anus started fracturing and bleeding from the loud and dragging farts, I had to shove some cotton in there to try and cushion the blow, but it just flew out every time. After a while I just shoved paper up the ass when a jumbo fart was coming, and then screamed and bit into the pillow during the delivery, and panted from the adrenaline afterwards. Two days of this. I was a changed man when I finally came home, couldn't do one pushup, only wanted to eat crackers and water. Second day home, boiled eggs and toast tasted like a feast for a king.

"MightyMorph","","","Ok lets get some things straight. Im a sikh so i feel i should speak up about some of the misinformation here.

Sikhism doesn't disallow people removing your Pag (turban), or having a turban or requiring a turban. The turban is a head garment that is meant to keep your head covered and take care of your hair. It also helps keep the head cool during hot direct sunlight. Its more cultural than religious. 

Its awesome that he decided to help out, but its not a brown man going against his religion issue. Its a human being helping another human being.


The actual  ""rule"" of the religion is to not cut your hair. Why? because sikhism says that by caring for our appearance we forget to judge people by their actions and values rather than their looks. That is why the religion tells people to keep their hair uncut and to not shave. NOW saying this doesn't mean that people who cut their hairs arent religious, its just how religious you are. The hardcore religious people follow all the rules. The semi-religious choose to let go on some, ie hair, appearance, meat, etc etc.


Sikhism is a religion born in Punjab in the 1500s. Its fundamental beliefs were born from influence from Islam Hinduism and Buddhism. It believes in freedom of religion and protection from tyranny from anyone for anyone. 

And for being a religion of peace, its history is with a life of a warrior.
Stories say that in the 1700s when the moghuls invaded the region and started trying to convert hindus into Islam, the Sikhs stood up against them. Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji went up to the Moghul emperor and gave him a challenge that if the emperor could convert him then all the hindus and other religions would accept conversion to Islam as well. The Emperor accepted and had Guri Tegh Bahadur Ji boiled alive and poured hot oil on, beaten and various other tortures over 5 days. It is said that he did not scream because of his past decades of experience in meditation and being a true devotee to god. () After those 5 days the emperor failed to convert Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji, and had him decapitated in the city in front of everyone.

This was perhaps the first recorded/written history stating a person giving up his own life to protect the religion of someone else. After the death of Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji, the 10th Guru of Sikhism; Guru Gobind Singh Ji, decided that the followers of the religion would not jsut be devotees to God but also warriors. And such was the birth of the Khalsa; the pure ones.

Over the last 500 years the Sikhs have been involved in many battles, from fighting the Moghuls who were in the millions with only a few thousand sikhs, being homeless for nearly 100 years, fighting persians to the British invasion in the 1900s. The fundamental belief has always been equality of all people and devotion to god. There is much more intricate history behind sikhism and it could be interesting to read for those who are curious.

BUT stating that like all humans, we are fallible. There are good humans in sikhism as there are bad humans in sikhism. But the simple belief that you should not judge a person by their appearance and that you should help those that you can is something everyone regardless of religion or ethnicity should follow.",1432477677,"","1432477971",1,44,"videos"

Last week we had a pretty big ice/snow storm. There are two handicap spots in our apartment complex, and we are the only tenants who have a plate/hangtag for disabilities of ANY kind. So there should always be at least one spot for us to use, right?

Wrong. There is always somebody parked in both of them illegally. Last week after that ice and snow hit, I had to park at the bottom of the hill. When I realized I couldn't get her adapted stroller (it's basically a wheelchair) through the snow, I put it back in the trunk and had to carry her on the slick, icy parking lot road. 

Carrying a preschooler with a medical device implanted on their brain is pretty much terrifying when you nearly fall every few steps. By the time I finally got to our apartment door I was bawling my eyes out. I was so scared we were going to fall and she would crack her head on the ice and bust her shunt up. 

People who park in handicap spots without a tag or plate are the worst kinds of people. We've confronted people like this before (politely) and it never EVER goes well. The kind of folks who are willing to do this aren't going to respond kindly to a ""hey, can you please move?""

"KatWYH","","","TL; DR at the bottom.

I already tried my best to refrain from posting in the /r/singapore threads that were lauding him as a vertiable God, but seeing how many of you think that this kid is a bloody genius, I couldn't help but feel that I should chip in with a bit of information.

Little disclaimer: I am Singaporean. However, I have nothing but pure loathing for many of the systems in place. I actually agree with the kid on some of his points. But that is not because he's right; merely because he's simply regurgitating the opinions of supposedly intellectually-superior people. And I'm here to tell you why this kid is a fucking idiot and you guys should stop sucking his dick. (~~Also, the legal reason he was arrested was because he offended butthurt Christians in his video; not because he insulted Lee Kuan Yew. Whether or not that's a bullshit excuse is yours to decide, but that would mean that, if he had staved off the jibes to Christianity, he wouldn't be in jail for any legitimate, legal reason.~~ I have since found out that his comments about Lee Kuan Yew also contributed to his being arrested. The reason being that the video ""contained remarks about Mr Lee Kuan Yew which was intended to be heard and seen by persons likely to be distressed"". While being arrested for rustling jimmies is definitely suspect, it still remains a fact that he knowingly uploaded the video while being fully aware of Singapore's limited freedom of speech. Trying to change it through the proper channels is admirable. Trying to be edgy for the sake of being edgy isn't.)

I would very gladly link you guys to one of his blog posts, but since I'm unsure if that infringes on rule 2, I shall merely quote a few interesting parts. If you want a link, PM me.

&gt; I think personally, the worst part of my experience in the Drama Club was the student leaders, specifically the ones who were a year older than me. There was this black president, who literally darkened the mood with her presence, she was senseless, illogical and **had this air of arrogance that unfortunately unlike me, was not validated by intelligence***.* She was oblivious to how inadequate her knowledge of drama was and always made herself seem like she knew her stuff, but we always knew she was full of bull. When she was voted for president, I literally thought a holocaust would happen to the drama club, which it did! **I cannot count how many black jokes I have made ever since we were ‘graced’ by her reign.** And the coincidence that many of the subsequent presidents and vice presidents who were elected all constantly sucked up to her, introduced a surplus of whore jokes as well. **She made me racist all over again.**

This one is self-explanatory. And:

&gt; However obviously, rules are valued more than discourse. **When I wrote my email as ‘Cocksucker@gmail.com’** when you had to write a PERSONAL email address in a piece of situational writing, and was penalized for it not because it had some form of negative impact on anyone, or did not adhere to the rules of writing a PERSONAL address, but because ‘it is against the rules’ to write something ‘vulgar’. It is evident that the discipline in the school is more concerned about punishing the student than talking to the student about ideas and what he thinks, and generalizes every student who watches pornography and says vulgar language as sinful and unruly. Think of all the people in the world who do those 2 things, who are successful and influential (George Carlin, Bill Maher, Tj Kirk) and then you see the huge amount of lost potential in cultivating great people. The school and its employees collectively try to rid of controversy, sees thinking of issues that are deemed sensitive to the public and sticks a knife to its back.

He effectively tries to justify the immature fictional email address by saying that people like Carlin and Maher boldly utilise swearing and porn. There's a difference here: they employ those tactics to enrich their entertainment mediums. If you're a teacher and this pseudo-intellectual who's been causing nothing but trouble thinks he's so smart to name his email address ""Cocksucker@gmail.com"", you're not going to think, ""Oh, my goodness, I've been enlightened! I've been wrong my entire life!"" No, you're obviously going to picture an idiot with a big shit-eating grin on his face, thinking he's edgy and mature when he's just another idiot doing shit you're tired of.

While I'm all for swearing and guys/girls jacking/jilling it, it seems like this kid has a persecution complex. Just go to his Youtube channel (again, because of rule 2, not linking it, but you know his name, and you know about Google) and watch the videos there. There's also a video taken down where he says (seriously; not sarcastically) that Chinese/Lunar New Year is a copy of the Western one. Let that sink in for a bit.

He actively does things that get people riled up so he can act as a victim. I'm agnostic and believe Christianity is bull. Do I fucking go to a random pastor and tell him that God is a sham and he should be ashamed for propagating cancer? No. You know why? Because I'm not an antagonistic idiot.

Obviously, I think there's absolutely zero wrong in fucking cursing every Goddamned shitty day. But that's not how the world works. I know it, you guys know it and he fucking knows it. People are going to get offended. If you want something from people or desire to not get into trouble, don't deliberately tread that line and get upset when it bites you in the ass.

Hopefully, some of you are getting a sense of the type of person he is. I used to be like him, in fact, and was constantly told I was smart for my language and ""mature views"". I was not and neither is he. He's just another teenage boy going through the ""OMG-I-DISCOVERED-ATHEISM-I'M-SO-MUCH-SMARTER-THAN-MY-CHRISTIAN-BRETHREN"" phase.

He's not intelligent. He's just an outcast that took to watching Youtube videos about atheism and such because he got ostracised in school. He needed a way to validate himself, so he resorted to educating himself in things that would make him feel superior to others. That's literally it. He's a social justice warrior but, instead of campaigning for illogical morality, he's championing for the supposed intellectual-highground that goes against societal norms so he can feel superior to the so-called sheeple.

***He's literally a fucking neckbeard.***

* Atheism is deemed intellectually-superior to any sort of theism, so he adopts it and shoves it in your face.
* The view that Lee Kuan Yew is an asshole is deemed intellectually-superior to lauding him as Singapore's savoir, so he adopts it and shoves it in your face.
* A ""reward-intelligent-people"" education system is deemed better than the ""rote-memorisation/hard-work"" one, so he endorses it and shoves it in your face harder than Verizon is telling you that it's better than cable.

He's not a ""smart 17-year-old"" who's fighting for his country's rights. He's just another idiotic kid who has a persecution complex and is using his opinions to make people think he's smarter than his stupid Singaporean brethren. He's bitter that he doesn't get rewarded for being oh-so smarter than the other kids, so he acts like a victim.

On to another point: while his English is definitely better than most Singaporeans' I've seen, it's nowhere near deserving of the level of praise you guys are giving him. It's rife with errors and mistakes, especially in his writing (referring to non-quoted portions of the blog post). The number of times I've seen ""it's"" to represent possession is giving me a larger migraine than people misusing ""your"".

In addition, he uses abhorrent amounts of rhetoric in his speeches/posts that are serving more to showcase his ""command of English"" than to actually convey a point. While I'm admittedly guilty of this (referring to the usage of rhetoric), at least I don't self-proclaim to be the next Einstein. Oh, and that reminds me. His Youtube banner is a picture of Einstein. Most apt, don't you all agree?

Stop calling him smart. He's going to get out of jail with a martyr complex and you guys are just fuelling the flames of self-righteous, immature stupidity. He may be more eloquent and well-informed (i.e. he has the knowledge, but not the wisdom to utilise said knowledge) than most Singaporeans, but he's still a dumb kid in many areas. It's okay to be correct without being ""politically correct"", but don't be surprised when the tiger bites your finger off because you decided to punch it through the cage.

**TL; DR:**

* - Stop sucking Amos Yee's dick.
* - He's an idiot. He justifies racism because a person of that race is a bitch.
* - He's an antagonistic idiot with a persecution complex.
* - He's a fucking neckbeard without a neckbeard.
* - His English is only good if your only frames of reference are Twilight and Fifty Shades of Grey. He uses flowery language to show off; not to communicate a point.

Nit-picking: No idea what all of you are smoking, but his voice pierces my eardrums. Here's something you folks probably don't know about Singaporeans: many people use foreign accents, usually American, to try to make themselves seem smarter/better than others, which is a recurring theme with Yee. However, his accent is very obviously and annoyingly fake. It'd be fine if he were to do either a legitimate American accent or stick with his Singaporean one, but using that cringeworthy bastardisation of the two is painful. Some of you may not understand why I'm so upset about this, since many of you seem to like his voice. I'm just going to say that listening to him is equivalent to listening to a weeaboo spouting off mispronounced Japanese phrases every other word and acting better than you when he does so.",1427773408,"","1427800537",1,89,"videos"

- What is the LAPD doing to clean up Skid Row?
- The LAPD is trying to give service providers (shelters w/ drug programs, etc.) more influence in the Skid Row community
- Separate the wolves from the sheep so that the sheep have more say
- Because it's a recovery zone, it attracts 2 types of people: people who need rehabilitation services who can't afford to go to a place away from the problem (Betty Ford Clinic, etc.) and individuals who want to prey on people trying to recover
- It's not about Blue and Red anymore, it's about Green
- There are some groups of people who benefit from keeping people on the streets so that they can promote an image of poverty for donations that the homeless people don't ever see
- The mentally ill in Skid Row are unable to get their medications from legitimate sources (hospitals), so their only source of medicine is the Crips and Bloods
- Skid Row is created by extreme right (not in my backyard thinking) who wants to put the homeless in a concentration camp type environment
- Skid Row is also created by extreme left who believe that the homeless should be left alone by the police so that they can continue doing whatever they want
- Both ideologies are responsible for creating the Skid Row environment
- Put down the politics, come to the middle, respond to Skid Row from a truth based perspective
- Another $10-63 million won't solve any problems
- Only solution is decentralization, don't close any drug programs, but also don't open another drug program in Skid Row
- 88 cities in LA county and not one, outside of Santa Monica and Long Beach and Downtown LA, decides to help the homeless
- This causes congestion and increases pressure on Downtown LA and people can't get well because of congestion
- If 8 cities opened up shelters and drug programs, pressure would come off of Skid Row and people will have a better chance
- The only thing the LAPD has is high visibility to combat the problem",1423169099,"","False",1,147,"videos"

"Mercury_NYC","","","As a resident, I guar-an-tee you that once she left that train (and probably gave a few roses away), she went on to sell the rest of her roses. 

I know ""cynical"" - but it is the truth. I will tell you a great story.

There's a woman who works at a specific subway stop and she is elderly, a woman of color, and walks up to people very nicely and tells them she is sick with cancer. Her who spiel is perfect and she isn't rude, she kills people with kindness asking for a donation for her cancer treatment.

I take the same subway daily, so I see her daily, and way back when I used to give her money too. Eventually I stopped because it was her, at the train, every day asking for money, and after a few years I became suspect.

So, while I was near the subway I had to go to the bank and use the ATM. I see her in the bank, standing in line. From under her coat, I see her pull out a bag. She opens it and there are bills, stacks of bills, not $1 bills but $10's, $20's and $50's. 

First off, I was shocked at the amount of money. Then I was pissed because after she deposited an insane amount of money (yes, I was snooping and curious by this point), she leaves the bank and gets into a brand new Mercedes E350 and drives away. 

The next time I saw her, I confronted her, and told her ""How is that brand new Mercedes?""

She sputters, ""MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS!"" and charges past me, but in doing so she hits me in my arm. At the subway, there are two police, who I happen to know from seeing them daily, who stand there to guard it and they see her do this. 

Now what I can't believe is how they wrenched her arm and slammed her to the ground. She's a big girl. It took two of them to wrestle her to the ground. Meanwhile it is a huge scene and a crowd is gaping at the spectacle and i'm actually feeling like a total asshole at this point, watching this old girl get treated like this. 

Finally, after getting her cuffed, they stand her up and ask me if I want to press charges. At this point, after everything, I can't do it. I tell them to let her go, that I won't press charges.

They uncuff her and leave, while she's standing there smiling at me. I'm still kind of pissed off and I tell her, ""Look, whoever you are, just find some other place to go. I think it is disgusting that you prey upon people like this.""

She replies, ""I will do that. And my name is Nessie. And I will leave if you give me tree fiddy.""

That's when I realize that she isn't some old woman, but that this girl was about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleozoic Era. That damned Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again, ""Damnit Monstah, I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!"", I yelled as she swam away into the distance.

1. The future he was talking about in the beginning of his talk has happened, is still continuing, and is still evolving. Mass donations to good causes happen regularly and many times, injustices around the world are quickly made viral. I'm not sure why he's downplaying that.

2. He provides this statement with no evidence to support him: ""That wasn't happening in 2010 [referring to arguments online]. Not with that speed. Not with that viciousness. Not with everyone getting in on it. Small communities sure, but the whole web? Eh, not so much...""

3. He interrupts his talk to pointlessly live stream and make a joke about it. So far, he hasn't taught anything and he hasn't provided any facts beyond funny things that were widely talked about online.

4. Next, Tom Scott continues to talk about current events (by talk I mean remind us that they happened) and explains the brilliance of a video camera on our phones. Then he sums it all up with... nothing.
