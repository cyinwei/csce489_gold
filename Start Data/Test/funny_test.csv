"killswitch1968","","","Medical doctor here with a (serious) explanation:

The digital rectal exam is a terrible test. It only allows you to feel less than half the prostate. However, if I feel something on the prostate, like a nodule or a mass, it is quite likely a cancer. But if I feel nothing, you could easily still have a cancer I can't feel. The risk of me doing this test is almost 0 and if I do feel something it could save a life (more on that later). I do this test almost daily and yes, that includes today. 

Why isn't there a better test yet? Well, it's not for lack of trying. A blood test called the PSA was developed but unfortunately it is very frequently positive without a cancer being there. If you have an elevated PSA it means you have to go for a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. This means someone sticking needles up your butt to take biopsies of the prostate. 90% of the time, no cancer is found. This biopsy has significant complications as you can imagine. If they detect a cancer, and you decide to have your prostate removed, that surgery has even more complications, potentially even more so that just letting that cancer grow.

Why?

While prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men among non-smokers, it also primarily affects older men in their 70s and is typically very slow growing, leaving a large window to detect the disease before it'll actually kill a person. 

It was found the PSA test DID detect more cancers, but didn't increase the overall survival of people having the test because most of these men were older, had heart or lung disease, and would have died of something else before the cancer ever would have. It is a decent test in high risk individuals (blacks or people with a family history). When people go for physicals I explain all this to them and let them decide if they want to deal with a positive test result.

**TL,DR: Our screening tests for prostate cancer suck because it usually affects older men who are going to die of something else, and it is frequently positive without a cancer being there subjecting people to potentially harmful tests or surgeries. The key is finding a test that reliable picks up cancers in young men, that test does not exist as yet.**

That woman is so god damn annoying, he just asked if you were healthy, he wasn't being discriminatory, if somebody came up to him and told him about their unhealthy lifestyle, whether it was drugs, alcohol, smoking or being fat he'd probably ask the same question, what does your doctor say?

For everybody out there judging this woman, please, realize something, she may be fat, but she's also stupid, and there's no correlation between the two (EDIT: I was corrected by /u/you-get-an-upvote, interestingly enough there is a correlation between being stupid and fat, although correlation does not imply causation, so while stupid people tend to become fat as their life progresses, one does not necessarily cause the other and vice versa.

"taint_882","","","I know this isn't a popular opinion around these parts, but after years of research into the matter I have determined that climate change is a hoax and conspiracy that was concoted by none other than the Carrot Growers Association of Bristol (CGAB), not to be confused with the British Carrot Growers Association (BCGA) which is to my knowledge not part of this conspiracy.  Al Gore may have popularized the movement of climate change over the past decade but the seeds of this hoax are much older.  This is going to come off as really far-fetched, but I assure you it's the truth and, if I may say so, quite chilling.

First, take a look at this graph that shows per capita carrot consumption from 1970 - 1995: http://www2.ca.uky.edu/agc/pubs/ip/ip58c/01f.gif

What do you notice?  Nothing particularly interesting or suspicious, right?  Exactly.  This graph is based on falsified reported data that the CGAB provided to USDA.  The USDA at times accepts and publishes data provided by trusted sources, including the CGAB.  Users of this data include scientists and researchers at public and private institutions across the country, including the duped agri-scientists at the University of Kentucky College of Agriculture.  What independent sources, including small-scale farmers who source their vegetables to supermarkets across the USA would tell you is that their sales have grown by a rate nearly twice on average that depicted in this falsified graph.

Here's the question nobody asked:  Why is a carrot growers association from the UK providing carrot consumption data to the USDA?  This isn't Bristol, Maryland, folks... this is a very shady organization out of none other than Bristol, UK.  Southwest England.  So tell me now, can you trust that the USDA is distributing accurate consumption data for carrots if they don't ask simple questions, like how the CGAB was able to determine U.S. consumptions numbers when their entire source of money is generated by membership dues paid exclusively by small-farm and organic carrot growers in a region of the UK the size roughly of Rhode Island?

I rather stumbled upon this during research I did for a company that was preparing to sell a food processor to compete with the big boys.  I won't name names, but if you've been paying attention to food-docs in recent years you may have taken notice of a film or two backed by multinational corporations selling juicers.  What you may not know is that the most fruit OR vegetable item people tend to juice is none other than CARROTS.

I can tell from the tapering and size that it's a Flügelsteiner Rizzo Medio , likely made from alpine birch with a spruce handle. It takes craftsmen 30 years to dry the wood to the right humidity and each mallet is made to gram and 1/10th of millimeter precision.
The mallet (also referred to as mazzuolo, italian) is applied to what mazzoulosos call anvil (italian: incudine), a block of precision-glued wood laminate in a self-stressing configuration. This block produces a specific-level noise profile, tailored to one of seven standard symphony noise profiles. Most musical pieces call for only a single mallet/anvil combination, but some call for four or five, and sometimes forces the mazzuoloso to change the anvils and mallets at a high speed, that and the heavy mallets themselves makes it a very physically demanding instrument to play.
Extra trivia, the E. Böltzer piece ""Thor a lovaglás a szekér"" calls for two mazzuolosi and a total of 20 mallet/anvil combinations. It's not very popular and most refer to it as torture or insanity. Most orchestras refuse to play it, calling it silly or stupid or fucking retarded noise.",1427734847,"","False",1,326,"funny"

First. 
The Slow Loris in this video was born in captivity, in japan. It has it's teeth. It didn't have them cut out with nail clippers. While yes, this happens in the illegal pet trade because people pay stupid amounts of money for people to hunt them in the jungle. 

Second : 
The Slow Loris is NOT poisonous or venomous.
Yes. Slow Loris bites cause a reaction in humans. However it is an allergic reaction. It is NOT a toxin. And it is NOT a venom.
It's an allergic reaction some people have similar to a bee sting.

The Slow Loris produces an oil to make it's coat shiney from it's armpits. It then uses it's teeth like a cat would use it's tongue to groom itself and keep it's fur healthy.

-----------------

Throwaway for a real scientist here. I'd make my name, research area, and organization openly available, but the fact of the matter is that *I don't like getting death threats*.

I'm a perpetual lurker, but I'm tired of looking through the nonsense that gets posted by a subset of the community on these types of posts. It's extremely predictable. Ten years ago, you were telling us that the climate wasn't changing. Five years ago, you were telling us that climate change wasn't anthropogenic in origin. *Now*, you're telling us that anthropogenic climate change *might* be real, but it's certainly not a bad thing. I'm pretty sure that five years from now you'll be admitting it's a bad thing, but saying that you have no obligation to mitigate the effects.

**You know why you're changing your story so often? It's because you guys are armchair ~~quarterbacks~~ scientists.**

 You took some science classes in high school twenty years ago and you're pretty sure it must be mostly the same now. I mean, chemical reactions follow static laws and stuff, or something, right? Okay, you're rusty, but you read a few dozen blog posts each year. Maybe a book or two if you're feeling motivated. Certainly, you listen to the radio and that's plenty good enough.

I'm sorry, but it's needs to be said: **you're full of it**.

I'm at the Ocean Sciences Meeting in Honolulu, sponsored by ASLO, TOS, and AGU. I was just at a tutorial session on the IPCC AR5 report a few days ago. The most recent IPCC report was prepared by ~300 scientists with the help of ~50 editors. These people reviewed over 9000 climate change articles to prepare their report, and their report received over 50,000 comments to improve it's quality and accuracy. I know you'll jump all over me for guesstimating these numbers, but I'm not going to waste more of my time looking it up. You can find the exact numbers if you really want them, and I know you argue just to be contrary.

**Let's be honest here. These climate change scientists do climate science for a living. Surprise!**

 Articles. Presentations. Workshops. Conferences. Staying late for science. Working on the weekends for science. All of those crappy holidays like Presidents' Day? The ones you look forward to for that day off of work? Those aren't holidays. Those are the days when the undergrads stay home and the scientists can work without distractions.

**Now take a second before you drop your knowledge bomb on this page and remind me again... What's your day job?** 

When was the last time you read through an entire scholarly article on climate change? How many climate change journals can you name? How many conferences have you attended? Have you ever had coffee or a beer with a group of colleagues who study climate change? Are you sick of these inane questions yet?

I'm a scientist that studies how ecological systems respond to climate change. I would never presume to tell a climate scientist that their models are crap. I just don't have the depth of knowledge to critically assess their work and point out their flaws. And that's fair, because they don't have the depth of knowledge in my area to point out my flaws. 

**Yet, here we are, with deniers and apologists with orders of magnitude less scientific expertise, attempting to argue about climate change.**

I mean, there's so much nonsense here just from the ecology side of things:

User /u/nixonrichard writes:

Using the word ""degradation"" implies a value judgement on the condition of an environment. Is there any scientific proof that the existence of a mountaintop is superior to the absence of a mountain top? Your comment and sentiment smacks of naturalistic preference which is a value judgement on your part, and not any fundamental scientific principle.

You know, like /u/nixonrichard thinks that's a profound thought or something. But it's nonsense, because there are scientists who do exactly that. Search ""mountain ecosystem services"" on Google Scholar and that won't even be the tip of the iceberg. Search ""ecosystem services"" if you want more of the iceberg. It's like /u/nixonrichard doesn't know that people study mountain ecosystems... or how to value ecosystems... or how to balance environmental and economic concerns... Yet, here /u/nixonrichard is, arguing about climate change.

Another example. Look at /u/el__duderino with this pearl of wisdom:

Climate change isn't inherently degradation. It is change. Change hurts some species, helps others, and over time creates new species.

Again, someone who knows just enough about the climate debate to say something vaguely intelligent-sounding, but not enough to actually say something useful. One could search for review papers on the effects of climate change on ecological systems via Google Scholar, but it would be hard work actually reading one. 

**TLDRs:** 

1) **rapid environmental change hurts most species and that's why biodiversity is crashing;** 

2) **rapid environmental change helps some species, but I didn't know you liked toxic algal blooms that much;** 

3) **evolution can occur on rapid timescales, but it'll take millions of years for meaningful speciation to replace what we're losing in a matter of decades.**

But you know, I really pity people like /u/nixonrichard and /u/el__duderino. *It must be hard taking your car to 100 mechanics before you get to one that tells you your brakes are working just fine. It must be hard going to 100 doctors before you find the one that tells you your cholesterol level is healthy.*  No, I'm just kidding.

 People like /u/nixonrichard and /u/el__duderino treat scientific disciplines as one of the few occupations where an advanced degree, decades of training, mathematical and statistical expertise, and terabytes of data are equivalent with a passing familiarity with right-wing or industry talking points.

I'd like to leave you with two final thoughts.

First, I know that many in this community are going to think, ""okay, you might be right, but why do you need to be such an ******** about it?"" This isn't about intellectual elitism. This isn't about silencing dissent. *This is about being fed up.* The human race is on a long road trip and the deniers and apologists are the backseat drivers. They don't like how the road trip is going but, rather than help navigating, they're stuck kicking the driver's seat and complaining about how long things are taking. I'd kick them out of the car, but we're all locked in together. The best I can do is give them a whack on the side of the head.

Second, I hope that anyone with a sincere interest in learning about climate change continues to ask questions. Asking critical questions is an important part of the learning process and the scientific endeavor and should always be encouraged. Just remember that ""do mountaintops provide essential ecosystem services?"" is a question and ""mountaintop ecosystem services are not a fundamental scientific principle"" is a ridiculous and uninformed statement. Questions are good, especially when they're critical. **Statements of fact without citations or expertise is intellectual masturbation - just without the intellect.**

---------------

##""What can I do if I'm not a scientist?""

You can make changes in your lifestyle - no matter how small - if you want to feel morally absolved, as long as you recognize that large societal changes are necessary to combat the problem in meaningful ways. You can work, volunteer, or donate to organizations that are fighting the good fight while you and I are busy at our day jobs. You can remind your friends and family that they're doctors, librarians, or bartenders in the friendliest of ways. You can foster curiosity in your children, nieces, and nephews - encourage them to study STEM disciplines, even if it's just for the sake of scientific literacy.

The one major addition I would add to the standard responses is that s**cientists need political and economic support**. We have a general consensus on the trajectory of the planet, but we're still working out the details in several areas. We're trying to downscale models to regions. We're trying to build management and mitigation plans. We're trying to study how to balance environmental and economic services. Personally, part of what I do is look at how global, regional, and local coral reef patterns of biodiversity and environmental conditions may lead to coral reefs persisting in the future. Help us by voting for, donating to, and volunteering for politicians that can provide the cover to pursue this topic in greater detail. 

We don't have all of the answers yet and we freely admit that, but *we need your help* to do so.

1. There has been NO evidence that the Pats actually cheated. In the past, yes, they did spy on the other team. On that occasion the fine was rather large and they friggen straight up said ""Yup. We did it. Sorry"" and took the f-ing fine. But ball pressure! Specifically 1 lb of ball pressure on 11/12 balls during half the game --- that's the scandal they'll never live down? 

2. BEFORE you judge the Pats, and claim that a lb worth of air pressure somehow ""won them the game"" do yourself a favor and actually inflate a ball to 12.5 and then to 11.5. The difference is almost undetectable. Who in their right mind would risk MORE scandal over such a negligible amount? 

3. MOST IMPORTANTLY, please do not lecture me on the ""integrity of the game"" and how this is going to be a tough scandal to explain ""to our kids"" when just a few months ago we were discussing domestic violence getting a pass and where to draw the line on child abuse. It implies that all that crap is overshadowed by slightly squishy balls which just pisses off my self-righteous half.

I would say that black people playing white people is more a satire of this sort of blatant racism. It may still play off stereotypes and be in bad taste but it is not at all equivalent to black-face. 

White people were never systematically subjugated and abused in America.  They are not subjected to discrimination and bigotry. Black-face is a reminder of an incredibly horrible time in history. When people use black-face it is at best in bad taste and at worst a flagrant display of racism.

"Saturn_Plus","","","I don't think they're saying ""ADHD isn't real."" I think they're saying the vast majority of behavioral problems that plague young kids are being diagnosed incorrectly (as not all deviations in behavior are the result of a psychological disorder). The biggest (and scariest) problem is that a racket has formed that churns out ""ADHD kids"" and ""ADHD medications"" in freakishly high volume. Most kids aren't ADHD, they're just the result of poor parenting or just genuine ""being a kid"" syndrome. Kids *require* play (in the same way kittens, puppies, etc. require it), and in most of these ADHD cases it's just a matter of something missing from what the child needs.

But then we take these terrifying drugs with enormously detrimental side effects like depression, aggression, apathy, and rage, and put a child who was only dealing with superficial behavioral problems into a cycle of antidepressants, ADHD medication, and therapy. And when you alter the balance of hormones and brain chemistry that much, no amount of therapy will resolve it.

We have a grossly underfunded and misunderstood mental health sector in our country. While Medicaid is the only agency that really shells out the cash to match the services being provided (insurance companies are cunts about it), it also directly sponsors turning children into pharma farms. Its policies encourage it (more money in the laws for medication, less for therapy and parenting resources). We need big changes and we need them soon; these children are the voters, employees, and labor force of the next 20 years and we are failing them BIG TIME.",1429853593,"","False",1,310,"funny"
