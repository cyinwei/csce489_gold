The only thing humanity loves more than having idols and heros is tearing them down, ripping those role models off the pedestal they themselves put them on and reveling in how *human* they are, how flawed.  Exaggerating these flaws makes people feel better about themselves and their own lack of achievement/recognition/whatever.

eSports is getting more popular, and this kind of thinking is inevitable.  Especially in something like this, where the participants haven't figured out how to isolate their real lives from their work lives.

True,Retardditard,,,"Sure, no problem, I'll tell you how to handle the cold!

Most cold viruses, over 200, thrive better in the cold, low humidity weather of fall and winter, and the most common are rhinoviruses. Common symptoms include head congestion, nasal congestion, sore throat, coughing, headache, sneezing, and watery eyes. Most clear up in a week to ten days. Occasionally a cold can lead to more serious conditions such as bronchitis, a middle ear infection, or sinus infection. Influenza can lead to lead to possibly life-threatening complications, particularly in older or frail people. It is estimated healthy adults get a couple colds per year.

**Unless otherwise stated the dosages here are for adults. For children between the ages of 12 to 17, reduce the dose to three-quarters(3/4) of recommended amount. For children between 6 to 12, use one-half(1/2) of the recommended dose, and for children under the age of six, use one-quarter(1/4) the recommended dose.**

Nutrients that are Essential include:

- ACES + Zn from Carlson Labs; as directed on label; contains Vit A, C, &amp; E, + minerals selenium and zinc
- Vit A plus carotenoid complex(Betatene); 15,000 IU daily, do not exceed 10,000 IU if pregnant; as directed on label; helps heal inflamed mucous membranes and strengthens the immune system. Antioxidants and precursors of vit A.
- Vit C with bioflavonoids; 5,000 to 20,000 mg daily, in divided doses; fights cold viruses. For children, use buffered Vit C known as ""calcium ascorbate"".
- Zinc lozenges; for adults and children, 1 15-mg lozenge every 3 waking hours for 3 days, then 1 lozenge every 4 hours for 1 week. Do not exceed a total of 100 mg daily from all supplements.

Important:

- Free-form amino acid complex plus N-acetylcysteine; As directed on label; to supply needed protein for healing and a powerful antioxidant, respectively
- Garlic (Kyolic from Wakunga); 2 capsules 3 times daily; natural antibiotic and immune system enhancer
- L-Lysine; 500 mg daily, on an empty stomach. Take with water or juice. Do not take with milk. Take with 50 mg vitamin B6 and 100 mg Vit C for better absorption.; aids in destroying viruses and preventing cold sores in and around the mouth; CAUTION: Do not take L-Lysine for longer than 6 months.

Helpful:

- Acidophilus, Cold-X20 from Olympian Labs, Maitake or shitake or reiski extract, multimineral complex or kelp, multivitamin complex with Vit B complex, olive extract or colloidal silver

Herbs:

- Astragalus, Boneset, catnip tea enemas and 1/2 to 1/4 of lobelia tincture every 3 to 4 hours until fever drops. This dosage can be used on children also. CAUTION: Do not take lobelia internally on an ongoing basis.
- Cat's Claw may ease symptoms; Chuan xin lian, aka Andrographis Anti-Inflammatory Tablets, helps rid mucus; Ephedra (ma huang) is helpful for congestion and coughing. CAUTION: Do not use this herb if you suffer from anxiety, glaucoma, heart disease, high blood pressure, or insomnia, or if you are taking a monoanime oxidase(MAO) inhibitor drug for depression.
- Elderberry is recommended for upper respiratory infection and headaches associated with colds. It promotes sweating and can help to break a fever. Research has found that elderberry is effective against cold because it contains antioxidant flavonoids that protect cell walls against foreign substances.
- Eucalyptus oil is helpful for relieving congestion. Put 5 drops in a hot bath, or put 6 drops in 2 cups of boiling water and inhale the steam. It is best to remove the boiling water from the stove, then place a towel over your head and inhale deeply through your noise for 3 to 5 minutes. be careful, don't burn yourself. Rosemary and sage oils can be added as decongestants.
- Hyssop, an evergreen that can be taken as a tea, acts as an expectorant and has antiviral properties; Mullein is useful for coughs and congestion; Red clover helps clear accumulated toxins in the lymphatic system that may cause congestion and inflammation
- For sore throats, add 3 to 5 drops of pure tea tree oil to warm water and gargle. Repeat this up to 3x daily. Take up to 2 tea tree oil lozenges and allow them to dissolve slowly in your mouth. Repeat this treatment as often as required, alternating it with goldenseal extract. These products can be found in most health food stores.

Recommendations:

- Take vit C and zinc lozenges at the first sign of a sore throat or stuffiness in the head or nose. This can shorten the duration of a cold, and may even stop it altogether. Take the lozenges every 3 hours the 1st day.
- Sip hot liquids. Chicken soup, carrots, onions, celery, potatoes, turkey, too!
- Remain as active as possible! Not only is staying in bed for ordinary sniffles unnecessary, but it will probably make you feel worse! Moving around helps you to loosen built-up mucus and fluids. Unless you have a fever, a brisk walk or any other type of moderate exercise should make you feel at least a little better.
- Flush those old facial tissues down the toilet! Tissues may harbor the virus and transmit or even reinfect yourself.
- Wash hands often. Cold viruses can survive for several hours on hands, tissues, or hard surfaces. A healthy person can contract the virus by touching a contaminated surface, then touching his or her mouth or nose. Using an antibiotic soap may prevent from from reinfecting yourself, but these soaps can also contribute to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, so it is best to use them only when necessary.
- Try not to spread the cold to your family or colleagues. refrain from close contact with loved ones. Even shaking hands is out; hand contact can spread the virus.
- Do not give aspirin, or any product containing aspirin, to a child with symptoms of any viral infection, including a cold. Taking large doses of aspirin depletes the body of vit C.

Considerations:

- There are many over-the-counter cold medications available. None of them can actually cure a cold, although they may sometimes be helpful for alleviating symptoms.
- It is unlikely that a vaccine will ever be developed to prevent the common cold because the viruses responsible have the ability to change in size and shape, and have hundreds of different forms. However, research being conducted in Britain may provide hope for code sufferers. An experimental drug, Tremacamra, appears to block cold viruses from finding a docking site in the nasal passages. So far, the drug's success rate has been impressive, cutting the risk of infection by 33% and symptoms by 45%.
- The possibility for real cold relief may lie in substances such as interferons, natural proteins that the body produces in response to viral infection. Interferons seem to improve the respiratory tract's ability to ward off viruses. Vit C promotes interferon production.
- A 5-week study of 79 adults deliberately;y infected with a cold virus revealed that those given the drug naproxen (Naprosyn), which is commonly prescribed for arthritis, suffered almost 1/3 fewer cold symptoms, such as headache, coughing.
- Under experimental conditions, polysaccharides found in the herb echinacea have been shown to enhance the immune system
- Anyone who has frequent colds or bouts with the flu should be checked for thyroid function self-test
- Congestion, cough, and/or, sore throat are signs of a cold, but if these symptoms occur together with fever or fatigue, you may have the flu. If congestion develops in the chest, it is best to consult a doctor, as chest/lung infections can be serious. Also contact you doctor if your fever goes above 102F for more than 3 days, if yellow or white spots appear in the throat, if lymph nodes under jaw and in neck become enlarged, and/or if chills and shortness of breath occur.

Further snippets:

- Analgesics, such as acetaminophen(Tylenol), aspirin, and ibuprofen(Advil), help relieve aches and pains and reduce fever. By themselves, colds do not usually cause significant fever. Allowing a low-grade fever to run its course may actually be beneficial; an elevated temperature is one of the body's ways of fighting infection. If you have a fever that reaches 102F or higher, you may require professional treatment.
- Antihistamines may cause sneezing &amp; runny nose. These products may also make you drowsy. In addition, **it is better to allow the secretions that contain the virus to flow out of the body rather than trying to block them, or ingest them.**
- Cough medicines come in two basic forms: expectorants and antitussives. Expectorants make coughs more productive. Beyond Guaifenesin, other expectorants are questionable. Antitussives reduce the frequency of coughing, which may be counter-productive, unless unusually severe or persistent or interfering with rest/relaxation and sleep.
- Decongestants shrink nasal blood vessels to relieve swelling and congestion. These medications can cause side effects including jitteriness, insomnia, and fatigue.
- Some experts believe many OTC medications include ingredients that work against each other. For instance, acetaminophen may increase nasal congestion, while the decongestant decreases it. If a cold is making you extremely uncomfortable and you feel you must take something for it, it is better to take a single ingredient product appropriate for the particular symptom you're treating.

My father lost custody of me and my brother to my grandfather because of unsanitary and living conditions (read there was no running water or electricity at his house and he had no intention of getting either) He had a new wife who had 2 kids, Laura and Billy.  They lived with my father full time.  *We* were however allowed to visit for a couple weeks at a time. During one of these instances fell Christmas. At the time I was 5 or 6 and a bed wetter, I couldn't help it, but that didn't stop him from beating me then standing me in the corner for 10 hours at a time because he insisted I did it on purpose....  Christmas eve was one such occasion, during the day my grandmother stopped by and I was given a 'break' while she was visiting to look like a normal child so that she didn't know anything was 'up'.  She dropped off a bunch of gifts for me and my brother and left.  Then back to the corner I went with a spray can balanced on my head and my arms at my side so that if it fell I got beat for moving....  I was dead tired by the time I went to bed and didn't want to ruin Christmas for everyone by peeing in my bed again so I forced myself to stay awake.  I failed at staying awake, but awoke Christmas morning to find I didn't pee the bed.  I was proud and gathered with the rest of the kids by the tree to open gifts.  they started handing out gifts to everyone, but nothing to me.   I thought it was odd that billy was getting similar gifts to my brother, including a couple transformer action figures I'd been wanting.  Then came the last gift under the tree, 6 inches tall by 4 inches wide by 2 inches thick and it had my name on it.  By this point tears were already welling up in my eyes because I thought santa hated me because I peed the bed.  My dad and step mom silenced all the kids and made them watch me open my gift, I was excited because I didn't think I was going to get anything and then I got a gift.  So I tore it open and what was inside... A lice medicine box similar to [this one](http://i.imgur.com/ozxRv.jpg) but it was blue.  I looked at it tentatively and then up at my dad and step mom who both had big smiles, by brother had started crying though I didn't understand why.  I opened the box and it was full of rocks.... Then I cried and they told me it was because I chose to pee the bed on purpose.  I later found out that he made my brother go get the rocks... and relabel all the gifts my grandmother gave us for Billy.  :-(",0,1354369860,,0,False,2,c79kx18,t3_143hrt,t1_c79kx18,t3_143hrt,,1430549317,1672,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,1672

* Based on Mickey's suggestion, AR offers to Nucky that he will convince Masseria to stop backing Gyp in exchange for at least partial ownership of the Overholt distillery.  AR is successful, and Gyp can be killed without further ramifications.
* Chalky &amp; Capone don't get along at first, but Nucky and Eil are able to broker a temporary alliance and their men go to war with Gyp's men.  Lots of people die.
* Lucky is forced to either start making payments to a corrupt prohie, or he has to agree to become an informant for the feds. Either way, he's not going to jail for the time being.
* Van Alden is not part of Capone's crew in AC; his storyline will be picked up again next season.
* With Masseria no longer backing Gyp, the Nucky/Capone/Chalky alliance will prevail and Gyp will get killed.  My prediction, like many others, is that Tonino, learning of Masseria's betrayal of Gyp, will finally take him out.
* Harrow will make arrangements with Julia to leave AC with Tommy.  He will go back to the brothel and kill a bunch of Gyp's men to reach Tommy.  He will not kill Gillian, but he will force her at gunpoint to give Tommy up.  Harrow will leave AC with Tommy &amp; Julia.
* After a lot of angst, Margaret will decide to stay with Nucky.

ETA: 
Disagreeing with myself a little here--the only thing that strikes me as off about Harrow going into the Artemis Club with guns blazing is that it puts Tommy in direct danger. He cares about Tommy more than anyone else aside from Julia, so it stands to reason that he would want to avoid any violence that could potentially harm Tommy.  Another possibility is that Gillian, knowing (now) that she can't get rid of Gyp, asks Harrow to get rid of Gyp and his men, and in exchange she promises to let Tommy go live with him and Julia.  That way Harrow and Julia have some reasonable chance to stay in AC (and in the show!).",0,1354395314,,0,1354402031,1,c79py9x,t3_143rs9,t1_c79py9x,t3_143rs9,,1430551754,7,False,BoardwalkEmpire,t5_2s0gm,7

Hmm, is someone fucking BURIED under this bath tub?! Or was there a sewage back up problem? It was the middle of July. The hallways were open air hallways that led to the apartments. When I went back up to the office to get my carpet knife to remove the caulking on the tub I decided to call the neighbor and leave a message that I might have to go into their apartment to see if there was a problem in their bathroom (the walls touched).

I knocked on the door and received no answer. 3 knocks and then I shouted ""MAINTENANCE ENTERING THE APARTMENT!"" When I opened the door I was greeted with a wall of flies. When I say a wall of flies... I cannot paint the picture detailed enough. It was like a snowy channel on television.

The smell and heat hit me and I immediately pulled my shirt up over my nose. As I looked inside the apartment I radio'd back to my boss and asked him to come take a look. When we walked in, there was a faux ceiling beam in the living room that divided that and the dining room. There was a hole that was broken through and drywall crumbles all over the ground. We walked further into the apartment...There he was. A man that had punctured a hole above his door frame, tied a telephone cord and the sash of his robe around that and his neck... and his neck was stretched farther than I thought imaginable. His head sagged lower than his nipples. I have never in my life seen anything more horrifying. He was a translucent green color. I immediately vomited and ran outside crying and scared to death.

I called the office staff and 911. I'll never get that image out of my head. I learned that he had been dead for 3 weeks with all electricity switched off via the apartment breakers. so he was literally baking in there....ugh. (edit: What got me the most as I was thinking about it over the next few weeks was that underneath his chair there was an ashtray with 100's of cigarette butts in it and the fact that he tried to do it in his living room... failed... and then did it again) TLDR: found a dead person. 0/10 would not bang.

True,[deleted],,,"Oh my god I have so many. I worked the ticket counter in a small town. You could stand in line for your ticket while watching your plane land. Almost every week we would have an irate passenger because they got to the airport late and as they are trying to check in they can see through the window their plane taking off. They expected us to call the plane back to the gate. I had a business couple come for their flight only to learn their flight was cancelled and they had be bumped to the next available flight. They left the airport for lunch and when they came back realized they missed their flight. It was the last flight of the day. Because the airport was so small I personally had gone and searched the whole damn place myself. I did call after call looking for them, called the number they had listed and got VM, and even went to the street to see if they were out there. Nothing. Of course they blamed us. We had to book them a hotel for the night, get them on the next flight in the morning, and then I personally drove them to their hotel in my pretty BMW on my own time so they didn't have to wait an hour for the next available taxi. They spent the drive demeaning me and telling me we have the worst customer service in the world and we were all so rude.

I was playing with my Dad's razor, pretending to shave and be all grown up (I was 5-6sh? Something like that) I got bored pretending to shave my face and for some reason I thought that it might be interesting to shave my tongue. 

I have no idea why I thought this would be a good idea, but I gave that razor a long lick like it was the tastiest lollipop ever.

I managed to open up a whole bunch of cuts on my tongue as the razor kind of stuttered down the length of it, taking the tops off all the ridges and bumps. 

It took a second for me to realise what had happened, but then the pain kicked in and I screamed like, well, like a child that just shaved his tongue. With my tongue still stuck out as far as it would go. 

My Dad always used to say that when he ran in I was spinning around spraying blood around with every breath and he near crapped himself as I had managed to cover pretty much every surface in range with a decent spray of saliva and blood. Looked horrific, and he had to grab me, hold me still and suffer a face-full of blood whilst I tried to explain (using my newly shredded tongue) just how stupid I had been.

He then told me I was a daft kid, gave me an ice cube to suck on, cleaned the bathroom and never told my Mum (at least in front of me) just how stupid a kid she had birthed.

True,MaticusArumus,,,"Throw away, needless to say.

I was 16 at time, I am now in my 60's. I had a good friend that I had known since grade 5, for sake of the story; we will call him John.

John and I were best friends, we did everything together and for the most part - we were pretty good kids. Sure we teepeed the neighbours house one, and did some stupid stuff kids so like light a mailbox on fire and give the neighbours dog stool softener. But nothing too horrible.

One summer John went to his cottage which he normally did each summer for a few weeks during the school break. He came back after and was pretty distraught, we drifted a bit apart and during the next few weeks; we didn't talk much, didn't ""click"" for a lack of a better term, he was depressed and started to be withdrawn from our group of friends.

One day after the school year had started in September, he came to me during the lunch period and asked to talk to me, he told me that during his trip to his cottage the past summer, his step-dad had raped him several times and beaten his mom. I tried to comfort him and console him, I asked if his mom went to the police, or if he told anybody else (including his mother) about being rape. He said no to both.

He then went on to tell me about how he wanted to kill his step-dad, I didn't think he was serious so I joked with him about all these ways to do it. Like burning him, poisoning, etc... He told me that he wasn't joking and he was going to do it, and asked me to help him. I agreed to, to this day I don't know why I agreed, perhaps because I felt bad or because I missed how we used to be close. Anyways, a week later after school he told me how his step-dad raped him again the night before, and how we were going to kill him today. By the time we went over to his house, his step-dad was already intoxicated and passed out on the couch, his mom worked the evening shift and has just left for work. We went to the kitchen to get a snack, he handed me a knife and told me the plan. He was going to hold his step dad down, and then I was going to stab him. Needless to say, the plan didn't go as planned.

See, two 16 year old arn't that strong, certainly not enough to hold down a drunk middle aged violent man. When my friend grabbed him, he jumped off the couch, started yelling and through John against the wall, he didn't see me there with the knife, but when he did he was shocked, I'm not sure if he was shocked because I had a knife, or if because I had seen what he had just done. But he came after me, I ran, oh fuck I ran. I remember running up the stairs to his room as fast as I could, running up the stairs he has slipped and grabbed my ankle as he fell. We both tumbled down to the bottom of the stairs and he tried to grab the knife from my hand, I had no idea what to do, I panicked and tried to get away and throw the knife to the side, I ended up stabbing him between the ribs by accident, he fell over in a heep while cursing me. I ran over, told John what happened as he was still sitting by the wall he was thrown against crying and we ran out of the house.

We came home a few hours later, figuring we're going to be in a lot of trouble and we should just apologies to him and take out beatings. But when we got in the house, we saw him laying on the ground, not far from where he was before, still. Not moving, no sound.

John looked at me and began crying, telling me that I killed him, I explained it was an accident I didn't mean too, but he was the one who wanted to kill him.

We sat in the living room watching cartoons, not saying a word to eachother as we waited for his mother to get home. Things were different back then, we lived in a small ""country"" town, so calling the police didn't even cross our minds.

Anyways, I digress. His mother came home, saw what happened and called the Sheriff. They came to take away his body and to talk about what happened. Turns out that he had died because I had punctured his lung.

We ended up going to court over it, he was dismissed because I was deemed at fault, his mother never mentioned the beatings, John never mentioned the rape. I was all alone and in trouble. I went to jail, I was in there for six years before his mother came out about the beatings, and John confessed to the rape and how I killed him in self-defense. I was discharged from jail and released.

I moved away from my home town to New York state where I live today. I don't know what happened to John, or his mom. I am thankful that he and her had came out to tell the truth, but it took far to long. For that, I could never forgive him.

**TL:DR- I killed my best friends step dad, went to jail for six years.**

True,Capissen38,,,"You replace a single neuron in your brain with one that functions thousands of times faster than its biological counterpart.

**Are you still you?** You'd probably argue that you are, and even a significant speed bump in a single neuron is likely to go largely unnoticed by your conscious mind.

Now, you replace a second neuron. **Are you still you?** Again, yes. You still feel like yourself. You still have the continuity of experience that typically defines individuality. You probably still don't notice a thing, and indeed, with only a couple of overachieving neurons, there wouldn't be much to notice.

So, let's ramp it up. You replace a *million* neurons in your brain with these new, speedy versions, gradually over the course of several months. Sounds like a bunch, right? Not really; you've still only replaced 0.001% of your brain's natural neurons by most estimates. **Are you still you?** You may find you're reading books a teensy bit faster now, and comprehending them more easily. An abstract math concept (say, the Monty Hall problem) that once confused you now begins to make some sense. You're still very much human, though. You stubbed your toe this morning due to poor reflexes, resulting from a lack of sleep. You briefly felt lonely for a moment. That cute cashier turned you on as much as ever.

But why stop there? You're feeling pretty good. You embark on a neurological enhancement regimen of two billion fancy new neurons every month for a year. After this time, you've got on the order of 24 billion artificial neurons in your head, or about a quarter of your brain. **Are you still you?** Your feelings and emotions are still intact, as the new neurons don't somehow erase them; they just process them faster. Or they don't, depending upon your preference. About half-way through this year, you began noticing profound perceptual changes. You've developed a partially eidetic memory. Your head is awash in curiosity and wonder about the world, and you devour Wikipedia articles at a rapid clip. Within weeks you've attained a PhD-level knowledge of twenty subjects, effortlessly. You have a newfound appreciation for music- not just classical, but all genres. All art becomes not just a moving experience, but an experience embedded in a transcendental web of associations with other, far-removed concepts. Synesthesia doesn't begin to cover what you're experiencing. But here's the thing; it's not overwhelming, not to your enhanced, composite brain and supercharged mind. Maybe you've subjected yourself to dimethyltriptamine or psilocybin before, and experienced a fraction of this type of perception. But this is very different. It feels so very soft and natural, like sobering up after a long night out.

You reason (extraordinarily quickly at this point, I might add), that since you don't seem to have lost any of your internal experience, you should go whole hog, and replace the rest of it. After all, at this point, everyone else is, too. It's getting harder to find work for someone who's only a quarter upgraded. Over the next three years you continually add new digital neurons as your biological ones naturally die out. **Are you still you?** Following this, you are a genius by all traditional measures. Only the most advanced frontiers of mathematics and philosophy give you pause. Everything you've ever experienced, every thought that was ever recorded in your brain (biological or otherwise) is available for easy access in an instant. You became proficient in every musical instrument, just for the hell of it. Oh sure, you still had to practice; approximately ten minutes for each instrument. You're still a social creature, though, and as such, you still experience sadness, love, nostalgia, and all other human emotions. But as with a note played on a Stradivarius violin as opposed to a simple electronic function generator, your emotions now have such depth, so many *overtones*. Your previous, unenhanced self could not have comprehended them. You are a god, but with the curiosity of a child. Though never religious, the phrase ""born again"" comes to your dizzyingly fast and complex mind.

Years pass. The same medical technology that allowed your neurons to be seamlessly replaced, aided and accelerated by a planetful of supersavants, has replaced much of your biological body as well. You're virtually immortal. Only *virtually*, of course, because speeding toward Earth at a ludicrous velocity is a comet the size of Greenland. There is general displeasure that the earth will be destroyed (and just after we got smart and finally cleaned her up!), but there's a distinct lack of existential terror. Everyone will be safe, because they are leaving. How does a civilization, even a very clever one, evacuate billions of people from a planet in the space of years? It builds some *very* large machines that circle the sun, and it uploads everyone to these machines. *Uploads?* *People?* Why sure, by now everyone has 100% electronic minds. If you've ever worked with a virtualized computer, or played a video game ROM from a long-defunct console on your new PC, you understand the concept already. These minds are simply software; in fact, they always were. Only now, they're imminently accessible, and more importantly, *duplicable*.

Billions of bits of minds of people are beamed across the solar system to where the computers and their enormous solar panels float, awaiting their guests. Of course, just as with your neuronal replacements all those years ago, this is a gradual process. As neurons are transferred, their counterparts in your skull are disabled. The only difference you feel is a significant lag, sometimes on the order of minutes, due to the millions of miles of distance between one half of your consciousness and the other. Eventually, the transfer is complete, and you wake up in a place looking very familiar. Virtual worlds, mimicking the earth to nanometer resolutions, have already been prepared. In the real world, gargantuan fleets of robots, both nano- and megascopic, are ready to continue building new computers, and spacecraft, and new robots, as humankind prepares to seed the cosmos with intelligence. We haven't achieved faster-than-light travel, but our immortal minds and limitless virtual realities make space and time irrelevant.

**Edit:** Well that escalated quickly! I had no expectations of getting bestof'd or reaching the front page, either with this or...ever, really. I am not an author by any stretch of the imagination, and I have never written any fiction before. Being an author takes hard work. This was the result of intrigue at OP's question (which I admittedly didn't *directly* address) and procrastinating on doing homework. I am considering doing more of this type of writing, and maybe trying to get a story or two published, as a result of the overwhelmingly positive response.

I don't believe any of the ideas I've laid out are original; I've merely stood on the shoulders of dozens of authors who write about the Technological Singularity and concepts similar to it.

There is an enormous amount of classic science fiction (Asimov, Bradbury, etc.) that deals with the same things, as well as many legitimate philosophical concepts. See the comments. The gradual transference of a mind to a different substrate can largely be credited to [Hans Moravec](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Moravec), a man with more intelligence and insight in his pinky finger than I have in my whole damn self.

True,skylark13,,,"She's doing really well actually. It's almost 13 years post-accident, and she's still going strong. Her career before her accident was in IT, and her employer basically gave her a year-long leave of absence after the accident. It was all paid because she had a ton of vacation, sick time and then all of her colleagues kept donating vacation time to her. After that, she went back to work part-time at a lower position, and has worked her way back up to the point where she's working full-time at a higher position, making 6-figures. 

She has never had to go on government assistance because of this, plus my dad is an engineer and makes enough that combined they can cover all of her in-home care expenses out of pocket (like Personal Care Assistants and medical supplies). Insurance pays for some things too, though they don't consider being paralyzed as loss of limb because (get this) they're not physically detached from her body. She's also a huge advocate for Spinal Cord Injury research, started her own non-profit, has lobbied on Capitol Hill in DC to (successfully) get legislation passed to fund SCI research. She's pretty amazing and inspiring. 

It's a really tough thing to come to terms with, that you're paralyzed at the C4-C5 level (making her quadriplegic, or paralyzed from the neck down). There's a lot of things she's been able to do, and a lot of things that she hasn't been able to. I think my mom has handled the mental state of things pretty well, though I think it's a semi-constant battle underneath it all to stay positive and keep going. Our family has really stepped up and been an amazing support for all of us, especially my mom's parents and my mom's sister. As a result, I have an amazing relationship with my grandparents and aunt because they basically helped raise me. I have a younger sister as well who was ten at the time of the accident. We are very close as a result of all this too, though I think she is still struggling a little to deal with the things that have happened to us through the years (car accident, lots of time spent in the hospital, almost losing my mom in 2010 due to complications from her condition, etc.).

Our family motto is ""Shit Happens"" and we pretty much live with the fact that bad things are going to occur. It fucking sucks, but all you can do is get through it and keep going. Which is what we've all been doing, and I think pretty damn successfully. We try not to let things get us down, you just can't.

True,SocialIssuesAhoy,,,"If you'd like to record the audio signal coming from your keyboard, all you need is a 1/4"" to 1/8"" male-to-male audio cable. The 1/4"" end is the large end which you commonly see in music settings, and that goes to to the line-out on your keyboard. The 1/8"" end is just a normal headphone jack.

Once you have that plugged in, you should be able to download Audacity for free regardless of whether you're on a Mac or PC. From there you just need to make sure the input source is your headphone/microphone jack, and hit record, and then start playing. ANY sound that your keyboard is outputting will be recorded so choose whichever piano tone you want, or something else. It will be recorded as an audio file.

If you want to record MIDI, you'll need to keep a few things in mind:

1. A MIDI signal TRADITIONALLY goes through a proprietary MIDI connector. On your keyboard it will be two circular outlets with a few holes inside. If this is your only option (see #2), then you'll need a MIDI-to-USB cable which is usually a cable with MIDI on one end, and normal USB on the other, and a dongle thing in the middle of the cable. Once you have that, you can proceed to the next step.

2. If your keyboard has a USB outlet (it won't look like a normal USB plug but it'll be a square USB outlet), that will be the better option. I'm not sure of the specifics but it allows for either a faster or wider (more data simultaneously) connection I believe. If nothing else, it's more convient. You just need a USB cable, plug it into your keyboard, and then into your computer, and proceed to the next step.

3. A MIDI signal, in case you're not aware, is not actually SOUND information... it's just data about what actions you took. What key you pressed, how hard you pressed it, how long you held it down. It also records whether any attached pedals were depressed (like your damper pedal for sustaining notes), and whether your mod wheel was moved and if so, how much. This is all data which is useless unless a program takes it and translates it into sound, so that's the next step. This is not as simple as recording the audio from your keyboard.

4. Pretty much what you need software-wise is a DAW, which is a Digital Audio Workstation. DAWs are the photoshop of music. It's where you record everything, work with it, perfect it, and finally ""bounce"" it (rendering the song). Unfortunately, if you're just a simple pianist who doesn't want anything more than to record yourself playing piano, it's a lot of work just for that. You'll have to learn all of this technical stuff kinda so you understand what's going on. On the bright side, once you understand it all, it will help you edit and adjust your recording to get a better sound out of it.

5. Within the DAW, you'll need a plugin. Plugins are, well... pieces of software which ""plug into"" the DAW. MOST if not ALL DAWs come with plugins ready to interpret your MIDI data, but I'm not sure which DAWs come with a piano plugin right off the bat. If the one you're using doesn't have a piano already, you'll need to purchase a piano plugin online. There are lots to choose from and this isn't my area of expertise because I already have MANY great piano plugins. The plugin is what will actually read your MIDI data. You'll hit record and start playing, and as it flows into the DAW, the plugin will take it and play the appropriate sound files, for the appropriate length, at the appropriate volume, based on what you're playing.

6. If you have a Mac, that's the easiest because that means you already have Garageband. Garageband is an example of a very low-end DAW. It's not really professional, but that just means it doesn't have a million extra features which you personally do not need. It's the simplest, mess-free way to record yourself and get a MIDI piano sound from the computer because Garageband is simple and it has a piano plugin already which is a very good one, especially considering it's free.

7. If you don't have a Mac, or don't want to use Garageband, I can't help you as much. Personally, I use Logic Pro 9 as my DAW. It's also Mac-only like Garageband, but it's a professional DAW. I'm not familiar with options at ALL really. Names you'll hear often are Pro Tools, Reason, Cubase, and Reaper. Reaper is cool because unlike the others, it's *only* $60. It's not quite as polished as the other ones, but it works well in my experience. You may have more trouble learning with it though, if you've never used a DAW before and it's all new to you.

8. There IS also the possibility of purchasing a piano plugin and using it as a standalone app. I'm not sure which plugins include this ability... but I know at least several do. I don't know which ones but I saw them when I was looking around before. I have a feeling it's common to make plugins standalone as well as actual plugins, especially for piano ones.

I hope I didn't insult you by including things that you already knew. It's just that I remember when I first started looking into this stuff and I got confused easily, and was very overwhelmed. It was daunting for me... and I was already a pretty solid computer geek! So I figured I'd just go through everything I could think of and explain it all, just in case you're coming at this from square one.

If you'd like to know why I went with Logic, it works well for me. I got into all of this when I started composing because I needed to record my ideas, and also flesh them out as far as orchestrations. That's the big thing... I needed to be able to hear an orchestra. It's certainly not the main reason people purchase DAWs but it's common enough. So I've amassed a decent collection of instruments (usually multiples of the same instrument, which all sound a bit different) and I can record all of them using my keyboard hooked up to the DAW. Still working with acoustic instruments, but digitally. Logic is also, in my limited experience, the most user-friendly out of the real DAWs, although Garageband is easier. This makes sense because Garageband is almost the same thing as Logic, just WAY stripped down and with lots of stuff hidden or simplified. It's the same stuff underneath though.

If you choose a DAW and want help with more specifics inside of the DAW, I highly advise coming back with more questions, that'd be a better way to proceed. Also you may want to subscribe to /r/WeAreTheMusicMakers. They're very production-focused and about more mainstream genres but your question is in their area of expertise because ANYTHING about audio software or hardware, they know all about it. So while your particular use isn't quite the same as most of them, they can definitely help and are a better place for software-specific questions really :).

True,Ftumsh,,,"Five years ago friends and I were walking down the street in London on a hungover Sunday morning, going for brunch. A family was walking towards us, with a three-year-old. The dad was holding the three-year-old's hand but he wriggled it free and just took off straight into the middle of the street. He was hit by a car immediately. I can see it still if I close my eyes but I won't describe it.

The kid was bleeding and injured, but was conscious and crying and talking. Strangely, what really affected me was the driver. He was a young tough-looking black guy, dressed in 'gangsta' style, but he was standing on the sidewalk crying openly. Everyone ignored him and fussed over the poor kid, but I felt incredible empathy for him, because he *had done absolutely nothing wrong*. He was driving safely, within the speed limit, he'd hit the brakes as hard as he could. He stuck around, checked on the kid's state, and was deeply upset.

I went over to him and told him I'd seen the whole thing and I would stand up for him. He was shaking so I gave him a hug and told him again, he'd done nothing wrong. Eventually an ambulance arrived and they put the kid into the back, and my friends went off for brunch, but I stuck around until the cops arrived and I gave a full statement on what I'd seen, that the driver was blameless, and told them I was prepared to appear as a witness if required. Never heard from them so I think everything worked out.

But despite our best efforts, we live in a violent world, and it's sometimes not of our doing. Shit happens, sometimes terrible shit, and it's nobody's fault. I'm glad you've come to terms with what happened to you and realised it was just bad luck. The universe is unfair: it's so unfair for that little boy and his father, but also unfair that you have had to suffer the burden of something random and terrible happening to you. Good luck to you.",0,1354441379,,0,False,1,c79ywuz,t3_143x1c,t1_c79ywuz,t1_c79tqz0,,1430556044,175,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,175
True,SilentDis,tftsflair,Professional Asshat Breaker,"Welcome to tech support.  It will either chew you up and spit you out a husk, or chew you up and spit you out into a better line of work.

Call control is vital.  I'm not sure what companies and training programs are calling it now, but back when I did it, they called it the 'Verbal Contract'.

Basically, you ask them what the problem is, listen to them spout verbal manure for 5 minutes, then repeat the exact problem to them in clear, concise language that takes 10 seconds, and ask if that is correct.  If yes, go with that issue **and that issue only**.  If no, listen to them drone on for another 5 minutes repeating the exact same problem and... well... repeat ad infinitum.

Once you get that ""Yes, that's my problem"" from the customer, the die is cast and the call has a clear end in sight for both you and them.  It is your only focus, your only goal, and your only mission to solve that one, single issue.  **NOTHING ELSE**.

If they bring some other issue in, you just say ""I've made note of that, we'll work on that once we've got this taken care of,"" and go right back to what their first problem is.  If they deviate from what you're working on together, it's ""You called me to help you with &lt;issue&gt;.  I'd like to help you get that taken care of.""  Do not proceed, do not deviate, do not allow them to derail the conversation.  **STAY ON TARGET**

All the time, use language that indicates 'the group'.  It's not ""Do this"", it's ""Lets do this"".  It's 'we' and 'us', not 'I' and 'you'.  This gets them following along fast, because they're 'part of the team'.  Plus, it gets them to actually listen.

As you're focused on one task and working as a group, more than likely, you'll also accomplish a couple other goals.  Your call times will be lower because of that focus.  You'll most likely solve the supposed 'multiple problems' the customer is having, too (can't access e-mail and browse are both solved when the router is off, for example).  Other problems, even unrelated, will also magically 'disappear' during this; not because you solved them, but because you solved the first issue quickly and the customer is now 'happy', and they forget about them and/or don't want to work on them.

Finally, stick to this even if it's unsupported.  You do ISP support, right?  The customer calls with a printer problem, **repeat it back and get that verbal contract anyway**.  Don't go into ""We Don't Support That"" mode off the bat.  Offer to make sure your stuff works.  An example:

-----

*Customer*:  &lt;5 minute long description of printer banding just the red&gt;  
*Agent*:  So, you're having problems when you print in red, correct?  
*C*: Yes. (Verbal Contract established)  
*A*: Ok, we're your internet service provider.  We make sure you can browse, get e-mail, and stuff like that.  Let's make sure that's all working first.  May I place you on hold while I test the line from our servers to your house?  
*C*: &lt;Engage sheep mode&gt; Uhh... Ok.  
*A*: Thank you.  

*&lt;Do a line test, ping their modem and the like.  Check to make sure there's no outages, etc.  Use the tools you have access to.&gt;*

*A*: Thanks for holding.  I don't see problems in your area, I can see your modem without issue, I see data going over your line.  Could you open a web page for me?  
*C*: It worked.  
*A*: Great!  Can you try getting your e-mail for me?  
*C*: It worked.  
*A*: Great!  It looks like your internet service is working flawlessly.  That's what we're here to make sure works.  Now, I understand you're having problems with a printer.  Do you know who makes the printer?  It's usually written on the front of it.  
*C*: Uhhhh... It just says HP on it.  
*A*: Ok, that's Hewlett Packard.  I have no information about it, because we don't sell anything like that, but, their website is &lt;website&gt;, and according to their website, their help phone number is &lt;number&gt;.  Since we have no affiliation with that company, I have no idea if they'll charge you for help with it.  Is there anything else I can help you with regarding your Internet service?  

-----

See what you did there?  You 'helped' a customer.  You did jack shit for their issue, of course, but you made sure everything you **could** help with worked, you proved to them you were **able and willing** to help, and you told them where to go without being rude.  You focused them.

Finally, stick to your support boundaries.  Some companies are incredibly strict about this, others let you meander; but either way, the boundaries are there for you and the customer.  Know where they start, and where they end.  Know what you can and cannot support.  There's zero shame in either having that up on your screen or printed out next to you while taking calls as a reminder (especially if you're new!).

If you are comfortable and allowed to go outside them, make sure the customer knows when you do.  Just like above, check what you can help with inside your boundries.  When you're going to go above and beyond, tell them; usually a simple ""That's what we're here to help with, and it looks like it works.  Your issue is not something we normally support, and if you ever call back, we won't be able to help you a second time, but I have some experience with this.  Would you like to see what we can accomplish?""

Do what you can, and fixed or not, end that part with ""Ok, we've got it working/done all we can.  I'm making a note here that you understood that we can't help with this again, but it looks like it's working/you know where to get more help"" or something similar.

True,NapoleonBonerFarts,,,"I was whipped by my father with a 2mm thick tooled leather belt that was 2 1/2 inches wide. I was spanked for almost everything I got introuble for. In middle school and junior high, I was regarded by teachers are the scapegoat bad kid that they could literally blame everything on. I can honestly say with confidence, that about 50% of the red slips (detention/check marks) I got sent home with had nothing to do with me, or were the result of being the last person the teacher saw and the only one to get punished. I had to get the slips signed, and when I presented it to my father he would usually say nothing, and by the time I got home I would get 3 lashes, he would say he loves me and that this hurts him more than it hurts me, yadda yadda yadda. 

Of course its not just the spanking that has affected the way I view and interact with my father but it has a huge part in my relationship with him. I do not love him. I work with him and if it wasn't for that I would be ok going the rest of my life without seeing him or speaking to him. I think the fact that I got whipped no matter what, even if it wasn't my fault and no matter how many times I could explain it, he wouldn't listen or trust me really damaged our relationship. To this day I still fear him, and I find it almost impossible to confide in him, or have anything of a close relationship. My mother only spanked me three times, once when I was three years old, once when I was nine and again when I was eleven. She cried every time, and was sorry afterwards. Sometimes parents get frustrated and don't know how to deal. I should say also that my parents have been separated since I was two, divorced since I was five.

True,DaenerysTargaryen2,,,"I was slapped as a child when I did something wrong. Growing up, I honestly bought the old line that 'it never did me any harm', and that it teaches you respect. I am sure for some people this may be true, but for me, like a lot of people, as a child you were never actually hit for doing something wrong but because your parents were so frustrated they had no other options but to resort to it. 

I have now realised that as a grown up, when things get difficult, I resort to violence to express myself. Not in an overly violent way, but I will hit my boyfriend on the arm or chest. It is just my go to reaction. 
I know it needs to stop and I am working towards stopping it. Something else that has backed up my theory with this as well is that my boyfriend was never hit once, neither was my best friend and they are the gentlest, most patient people ever and no matter how frustrated they get, would never do something like that. 
So, in short, I don't know if I will ever have kids, but if I do, I will make damn sure never to hit them as I was. It leads to a lot of repression and inability to express yourself in any other way, or for me at least.

We do not **currently** have our own team yes. That being said, we **had** [The Hartford Whalers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartford_Whalers#Departure_from_Hartford) up until 1997, and since their departure there has been overwhelming support to try to get our NHL team back.

True,Kinetic42,bestof,DM - Best Of,"Now, they're all in the forest and Steve gets this idea. You see, he knows Flux's robes are constantly swaying in the breeze, but dude, he knows how high he is and he ain't so high that he can't feel the breeze. He's flat tripping out now, because DUDE, that breeze is fucking with my nature's flow.

So, he does what any rational hipster stoner druid would do. He decides that he needs to see if any leaves can get caught in this breeze. While Flux is going on and on about this and that, Steve is passing me notes about how his druid is gathering leaves. Right as we start to get into town, he puts his brilliant plan into action. He starts dropping leaves around Flux to try to find out where this breeze begins. Not one at a time though. No, he gathers all of the leaves and then uses Gust of Wind to blast them at Flux.

I'll admit it, I laughed, as did the rest of the table. It was even funnier when Flux realized that the leaves were sticking to his face, hair and cloak because of how he worded the spell that kept his cloak and hair ""wafting"" in the breeze, forcing him to dismiss the spells to remove the leaves (I may have been having a bit of fun now too at Mike/Flux's expense), but I think everyone thought it was in good fun. The table was laughing, and even Mike seemed to be in on the joke... Oh no, no he wasnt...

So, we get into town, and Flux now has all of his spells off and he can't bring them back up until the next day, so he is sort of looking dull and frumpled. He made sure to give me the evil eye about this as he lamented about it all day. I thought it was done, Steve was still experimenting though...

So they all sleep at the Inn, and finally Flux has his ""charm"" back. He goes off about how he walks down the stairs, orders a drink for the bartender, and starts flirting with all the wenches down stairs. This is when Steve's druid arrives behind the counter and hands him a beer. On top of his head. Just to see if liquids can escape his little ""magical effect"". At this point I ruled that they could, but I could see that things were starting to get a little bit less funny. I asked Steve to knock it off, and he laughed, but Mike was starting to get angry. After some terseness, the game went back to normal.

But Steve had one more plan to push Mike's buttons, and it might have been the best of the three. You see, Steve's druid was convinced that all Flux needed to do was relax a bit, and maybe take a whiff of the good bud man. 

So, at night, while Steve is on watch and speaking with his ""iPod"", he puts his last plan into action. He finds Flux's tent, and then finds a long hollow tube, and slips it between the flaps, careful to keep it closed. When it is all set up, he starts smoking and blowing the smoke into Flux's tent, hotboxing Flux's tent in the middle of the forest. All. Night. Long.

Now Mike is a bit straight edge, or so he says it. And I wasn't quite clear on what the rules would be for a Aasamir Sorcerer that was higher than Bob Marley after a concert in Jamaica. So I just went with the ""Mad Hallucination"" Spell, and explained to Flux that when he woke up, all of the surfaces seemed to be swimming, he was filled with a tent that appeared to be on fire, but that he was the calmest he had ever been in his life. And that he had a craving for cookies. 

While everyone was laughing, as they figured out what Steve had did, Mike was a ball of fury, barely keeping his seat. As it was getting late, I decided to call the game there, and it seemed like everything was fine. Mike, though, got up from his seat and hoevered over Steve, standing right next to him and staring him down. Steve asked him what was up, and Mike just stared and said nothing.

He kept staring at Steve like he was trying to burn holes in his head with just the power of his Care Bear Stare. After a couple times asking him what was up, Steve just shrugged and gathered his things and walked out. And Mike followed him, step for step.

When they got outside, Steve asked what his problem was, Mike got right up in his face, and continued not to say anything. Mike was quite literally an inch from Steve's face and wouldn't say anything. At this point Steve has just about had enough. He tries to open his door to get in his car, but Mike is standing right there, and won't move. I though Mike was going to hit him or something, but he just kept staring, I don't know if he was working up the courage to do it or something, but it was just.... weird... This goes on for about a couple minutes and then finally Mary is able to coax Mike away from Steve and Steve then gets in his car and drives off.

I got a text from Steve a couple days later, he wasn't coming back to the game. Mike was fucking crazy man. And, to tell you the truth, I was starting to think the same thing.",0,1354462449,,0,False,1,c7a1coq,t3_1456hn,t1_c7a1coq,t1_c7a14e5,,1430557195,1767,False,DnD,t5_2r9ei,1767

True,Expressman,,minarchist,"&gt;Ok, this is an honest question. 

We like those.

&gt;The capitalist system is set up where one guy has the money and another guy does the work. But the guy with the money gets all the profit. 

False premise. The capitalist system is a risk-reward and value-exchange system. Value is based on results, not effort. 

The men putting in a new culvert may be working very hard, but they are not creating as much value as say a grocery store owner. The culvert crew is operating at low risk, and offering relatively low returns to the community. Their role *does* have value and *is* necessary, but only so much. If you were to overpay the culvert crew or underpay the store owner that causes distortion where people are not getting the value of what they are paying.

&gt;Most people think hard work should be rewarded but in capitalism its the opposite. 

Capitalism does reward hard work. An immigrant can come here and pick beans and be wealthy by other standards. I grew up in a farming community, and remember a Mexican laborer family piled into a current year Corvette, covered in dust and littered with fast food trash on the inside. Those people were living their dream!

We live in an amazing society where the multi-billionaire and the 7-eleven worker both have an iPhone 5. That kind of equality was unimaginable even 20 years ago.

&gt;The rich make tons just by the virtue of being rich but the people doing all the work are left with the scraps. 

The rich take tremendous risk. Our history is full of success stories, of people born in poverty dying in opulence. That usually only happens in socialist models to the dictators themselves. But we also have the reverse; people born into wealth who die in abject poverty. Why? Because in our system there is something more to having money than simply having money. You have to steward it.

Take for example your trust-fund child. Now, I have next to no respect for a lot of those kids. They get everything they want, they cheat their way through Ivy League schools, and they get at least a low-level executive position handed to them. Definite advantage there. *But* here comes the but. Even if they do nothing of significance, as long as they don't rape their trust fund, they are still delivering a magnitude of value to society.

Why? Because that trust fund money is working. I was just thinking the other day, there is something about being diversely invested. Anyone who has a good diverse investment portfolio wants everyone to do well. Do you want to see someone who wants the best for everyone? It is someone who literally has dollars invested in everyone. A diverse investment portfolio includes hundreds of companies domestic and foreign.

But there is a lot of risk. That trust fund kid is vulnerable. He could end up with nothing. The culvert worker has more security. He can pick up a similar job elsewhere (usually), and usually has less expense liabilities. The wild thing is, the trust fund kid's money might be helping pay the culvert workers paycheck.

&gt;But when Obama wants to make things a little fairer we just get libertatians yell ""THATS THEFT"". 

What is fair? The distortion that you perceive benefits you?

&gt;But is it really theft when the system is set up where 1% of the people get 95% of the money and the other 99% do all the work and get the remaining 5%? 

Keep in mind, on the world stage the 99% in the US are the 1%. Capitalism creates wealth for all so that even the poor are orders of magnitude more wealthy than the poor in other countries.

&gt;You call it theft. I call it getting what we are owed.

If you pay the culvert worker and the store owner the exact same, say you pegged each at $60k. The incentive for the store owner is gone because he is now accepting unnecessary risk. He could get a sweet gig ditch digging and make the same money without the stress and risk of running a business. We can all install culverts till we are more prosperous than we have ever imagined!

Here's the usual disclaimer: the sytem we have now is not free-market capitalism. A lot of rich people enjoy their station without risk because of government protectionism. The FDIC is formed, and now banks can do whatever because they are federally insured. When you take risk out of the equation then you take the responsibility of stewardship away also. That does create a class of people who are utterly wealthy without the need to invest in their own society nor deliver any kind of value.

That's who you should be hatin on.

True,Soltheron,,,"I see spanking defended on Reddit a lot and it makes me very sad. It is also often done by people who have been spanked themselves but ""turned out just fine"" despite the fact that it is impossible to know what the alternative result would have been, and many children *don't* turn out ""just fine"" after having been spanked.

Spanking is very inefficient and can have dire and lasting effects on children. I work with children, and I've seen these effects myself even here in Norway where spanking is completely illegal and pretty rare. On the one hand you are teaching children to solve problems with words, and on the other you are hitting them. 

With spanking, you undermine your own authority by making it about ""might makes right,"" and you can easily create feelings of insecurity, mistrust, and fear. It is also heavily correlated with a lot of negative behavior such as aggressiveness. The most important part about this is that **discipline is not punishment,** and it is vitally important that it is crystal clear to the child that it is the behavior that is bad, not them: they are still loved and accepted.

Anyway, as to how to deal with unruly children:

If it is excessive or aggressive behavior, it's useful to have a designated time-out spot. If it's in public, take them out into the car and be firm about how they should behave in public then **completely ignore all their crying and screaming.** Attention from parents—even if it is negative—is sometimes their goal in the first place, and by doing this you teach them that they won't get your attention by being bratty. When they calm down, ask them if they are done, then you can go back to what you were doing with them.

If you are in a place where their screaming isn't a big nuisance to others, ignoring them is the best way to make them understand that their behavior won't result in anything for them. If they escalate, give them a firm warning, then do another time-out in the car or your designated spot at home if they don't stop; do this every time and **always** follow through when you do give your warning. You might have to spend a lot of time at first interrupting your errands by having to go out and put them in the car this way, but they *will* learn fairly quickly that they don't get anywhere with their screaming.

The key is to be consistent but also fair. Try to avoid extreme rules outside of the obvious stuff (no hitting, no bullying, etc), and also explain the rules and why they are there. Listening to children and compromising is also extremely helpful, as being authoritarian is not a great way to parent (kids with very strict parents often grow up to be either an extreme rebel, or an extreme authoritarian like their parents). Last but not least, it's essential to reinforce and reward good behavior. You can do this with, for example, a point system towards something they want, a general allowance, or a privilege of some sort.

This is all in line with the best type of parenting style: [authoritative](http://psychology.about.com/od/childcare/f/authoritative-parenting.htm).

*****

Authoritative parents:

*    Listen to their children

*    Encourage independence

*    Place limits, consequences and expectations on their children's behavior

*    Express warmth and nurturance

*    Allow children to express opinions

*    Encourage children to discuss options

*    Administer fair and consistent discipline

*****

Hope this helps future and existing parents out there! 

TL;DR: Corporal punishment is about as settled among child psychologists as evolution is to biologists, or any other big issue with their respective experts. There are many studies out there that correlate spanking with bad behavior among children, so please do not spank children and educate yourselves as to the many better ways to discipline children. There is a reason that spanking is illegal in 33 countries, and the US was the only U.N. member that did not ratify the Convention on the Rights of the Child.",0,1354467033,,0,False,1,c7a29b9,t3_145dv5,t1_c7a29b9,t1_c7a06h3,,1430557625,1118,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,1118

True,brainiac256,,,"OP, here's your answer (**not tested**):

[This guide](http://askubuntu.com/questions/43950/how-can-i-apply-a-ladspa-plugin-to-a-pulseaudio-stream) runs you through the process of loading `module-ladspa-sink` which allows you to route all audio through an LADSPA (""Linux Audio Developers Simple Plugin API"") plugin. An LADSPA plugin is an insert effect like a pitch shift, reverb, equalizer, filter, or --in this case, what we want-- a compressor or limiter.

Let me take you through some basic digital audio so you can fully understand what's going on here. If you already know this, just skip over, I just want to cover all the major points. Without getting into output-land and talking about amplifiers, what you can control in the software is basically just reducing the volume of a sound. So when audio is still ""in the box"" and not output it's measured in negative decibels -dB according to how much the volume is reduced by the volume control Minus zero (-0) dB is ""peak output"" or *no volume reduction*. (This is also the same kind of volume control that's seen inline on headphone cords -- max volume is really ""no reduction applied"".) Amplifying the signal level beyond +0 dB requires extra power, and that's almost always handled in analog land (after the digital signal has been converted to an output, like for your headphone jack).

Now, what a compressor does is comparable to a little gnome with his hand on the volume knob and his eye on the dB level. He's turning the volume knob *down* when the incoming sound gets over a certain dB level (for this example let's say -12 dB). When the volume exceeds -12dB by *x* dB, he turns the volume knob *down* according to a number *n*, the attenuation amount. The difference between the excessive volume and the attenuation amount is the *ratio* of the compressor. So if we measure the incoming audio at -7 dB, we have an excess volume of 5 dB. If the gnome turns the volume down by 2.5 dB that's a 1:2 ratio; if he turns it down by 4 dB that's a 1:5 ratio. With me so far?

Good. Now, a *limiter* is a special kind of compressor where the ratio is *infinity*, which means that the gnome just turns the volume knob down to compensate so that the output volume never exceeds a certain level. On the surface this might seem like what you want but applying a limiter (especially the free LADSPA limiters) can result in some unpleasant-sounding artifacts in the sound.

Personally I'd go with a compressor set around -12 dB with a ratio of 1:3 and a fast attack and release time (like single-digit milliseconds). If you have Audacity you can open a music file and play around with the SC-1 plugin (Simple Compressor) to see what all the settings do.",0,1354468902,,0,False,1,c7a2oee,t3_145a10,t1_c7a2oee,t3_145a10,,1430557821,2,False,Ubuntu,t5_2qh62,2

True,Thehealeroftri,,,"I was a male prostitute for a decent portion of time.  I didn't realize how dangerous it was until this incident happened.  I wasn't a normal male prostitute, I didn't service to other males.  I was unique in that I only serviced females, which is very rare for a male prostitute.  I was eye candy and a former model, so that helped me gain customers. (I needed the money, college, man.) 

One day the place I ""work for"" got a call from a young girl, only 22 years old.  This was quite unusual because we usual serviced older women who were tired of their husbands, 22 year olds usually never called us and when they did it's because they were incredibly obese or ugly beyond hope.

I went to the address specified in the call and a pretty girl opened the door.  She said she was the one who called. She introduced herself as Annie.  I felt very lucky, for once I didn't have to help an old hag reach orgasm, I had a beautiful young girl.  I clicked at once with her.  She started talking to me and we had a surprisingly good conversation.  She said that she had gotten involved in some bad people and the reason she was calling a male escort service was she just wanted some male company for a night.  She knew she'd get a decent looking young man, and she hadn't had sex in awhile.

Annie said was afraid to leave her apartment because the ""bad people"" was her exboyfriend.  Apparently, he was involved in some gangsters and she broke up with him because she didn't like that.  She told me the gangsters weren't normal hoodrats, they were pretty organized.  She'd gotten death threats and was afraid to even call the police.  So she stayed home.  She'd been in her house for months, only going out to get some food from a grocery store a block down.  

She feared for her life, basically.  

I felt bad for her and desperately wanted to comfort her.  But I knew my place.  I was a male hooker.  So we started.  Long story short, unlike my other clients I genuinely enjoyed this one.  I liked the work for once.  

We finished and layed in bed cuddling (even though that technically didn't come with what she paid for).  After an hour or so I asked Annie if I could use her restroom.  She said that would be OK so I got up and went piss.  As I was shaking my penis to get the last drops of urine out, I heard a loud **BANG** and heard some glass shatter.

I ran out to see what had happened, I assumed she had slipped or something but when I came in I was shocked at what I saw.

She was on the ground lying in her own blood.  I saw a bullet wound on her neck.  I ran to her and said, 

""Annie Are You OK?
So, Annie Are You OK
Are You OK, Annie
Annie Are You OK
So, Annie Are You OK
Are You OK, Annie
Annie Are You OK
So, Annie Are You OK
Are You OK, Annie
Annie Are You OK
So, Annie Are You OK,
Are You OK, Annie? You've Been Hit By,
You've Been Struck By
A Smooth Criminal""

So there's that.  

I quit shortly after this happened, you never know what's going to happen in that business.  I'm happier now, anyways.

My dad grew up in a very old fashioned family that believed in physical punishment. I remember being hit with everything from metal kitchen utensils to being struck in the face with a cord to an electrical appliance because I ran under blankets and my parents would just whip me til I came out. I would have welts all over my body for hours. I remember crying when I saw my sister getting hit with a belt anywhere from 5 to 15 times in a row just for disobeying. Most of the time my dad just kept going until my mom ran in and begged him to stop. I wasn't any more rebellious than the average child but once I got older I saw how much this affected me. From this I have a lot of trouble getting close to people because I'm afraid of getting close to someone and having them hurt me physically and emotionally. It has hurt my love life the most because I always have so many walls up and won't let people in. The other thing is that I'm pretty desensitized and believe that people deserve harsh punishments for crimes or actions. I have trouble feeling sympathetic when it comes to others because of my ability to block out feelings and emotions.

I don't currently have children and I am scared of ever having them, mostly because I'm afraid my anger towards my past would overcome me. I would like to say that I wouldn't punish a kid because I know how it feels but I can't be 100% certain. I truly don't believe any parent should ever hit their child because it has a huge impact on their traits as they grow up.

True,raaaargh_stompy,,,"Ok, since you said please twice I shall share my opinion, but it is only that. 

**Sex is a complicated interaction**. It combines among other things, the physiological and the social.

It can be viewed through a lot of different lenses: if you consider just the physical / anamilistic side of it for example, you've got a species propagation mechanic going on, where perhaps men and women size each other up against various requirements. Let's say men enjoy curvy shapes for their child rearing goodness, and women enjoy well muscled men who have nicely divergent genes from their own for maximum geney goodness.

The above, extremely complex set of push and pull factors is the simple side of things, and just one of the aspects being played out when sex is taking place.

**Let's look at some possible others,** the more social ones. Sex can be (and often is) used as a bargaining chip or power play. Let's examine a case study (somewhat popular in the zeitgeist in our cultures as ""the norm""): a guy is physically interested in sex with a partner who is less interested (he's horny, she isn't). She may have sex with him anyway for a variety of reasons:

1) He's taken me on a nice date, and put the effort in, and seems nice, I'll ""give him"" this reward

2) I'm his girlfriend, I'll just be nice to him

3) I have a feeling if I do this, he's likely to give me shiny gifts

4) I don't want him to loose interest in me and consider other women

5) It's just my duty as his female partner

6) He may physically hurt me if I don't 

7) I'm bored, why not.


All of the above are what I would consider to be interactions where power is exchanged. Before the act, the man wants something. He may end up getting it through either giving something away (time and money on the date, the promise of gifts) or by taking or threatening to take something from her (his partnership (fear of other women), her safety (fear of physical threat) etc. In all cases something is gained and lost by each party and as such sex becomes a currency, or a power exchange.

After sex the woman might feel empowered (I have bestowed the gift of my body to this man), or the man might feel empowered (I dominated this woman and taken her body). Please note, I'm playing to social stereotypes here, there is absolutely no reason those power exchanges cant be opposite.

The model previously described is something like a capitalist approach to sex (something is exchanged, both parties get something out of it but the benefit isn't necessarily equal, someone has probably made a power profit, and the benefit is per person (each person has their own agenda)

**So what's the alternative?**

Well, if you don't treat sex like a power exchange you have to move to thinking of it like a communist model of economics, rather than a capitalist one. Now when the community size is 2 people, and when the currency is intimacy, the issues communism faces as a large scale economic plan don't get in the way , so don't freak out.

In breif, if both parties act for the good of the collective, then power is not exchanged, but increases for both parties. Practically what this means is that any one person in the couple wants to have sex or not because of what is good for both of them.

Now lets look at a situation where the woman wants to have sex but the man does not (it happens :P )

-He may do it anyway because he knows that the relationship benefits from physical intimacy

-He may do it because it doesn't negatively affect him, but positively affects her and so net gain is +

-He may do it because while he may not be in the mood, he knows that she gave him a blowjob yesterday cause he was horny and he wants to repay the favour.


**Some notes on altering mentality:**

There's a very common view point in our culture, that men are out for sex all the time and women are the gatekeepers, we have to do a kind of dance to impress them and if they are suitably impressed we are let into her bed.

This right from the start sets up a power differential, which has to be crossed to get anywhere (The man has to give up his power and perform for the woman). This mind set results in all sorts of common attitudes today - the eye rolling of women as men try and impress them, the smack talk between guys about conquering girls, the idea that women share between each other that ""oh isn't it adorable when they try and act all tough""... ""honey men only want ONE thing, and when you give it to them, your power is gone"".


All that, it's goign to resutl in power exchange sex, cause when the man finally gets it, the womans power is gone and the man is powerful.

Well flip it around in your head:
Think what it's like to be a woman. You think you don't want to have sex? Not likely, of course they do. Ok, so they want it too - are they lonely? Yes, just like men are.  Do women lust after men? Yup. Do they fantasize and get themselves off? Play games and do their hair when they know guy X will be working that day...? Yeah! Just like men do, there's really no difference. 

So next time you are courting a lady, you can go in with an attitude of ""hey. we both want this, if it's right between us this will be a lot of fun for everyone"" rather than ""I sure hope I can find a way into her pants.""

True,[deleted],,,"Reposting this top-level because it was buried under a shitty comment:

There is an answer to the question ""Why is it so bad?"" The answer is because the submission titles on this site suck. Very, very badly. They're generally non-descriptive and useless. People use submission titles as punchlines to a joke, not as an actual title.

If a submission is titled ""Look what I found"", and it's a picture of a gold dubloon, what are you going to search for when you look for it 2 months later? ""Gold coin"", ""gold dubloon"", or something. You're not going to search for ""Look what I found"", because a) You won't have remembered that title, and b) That would turn up about a million results.

Go to a subreddit that enforces submission titles (try the SFW-Porn network, they generally have very good titles), and try searching for something (restricted to that subreddit of course). I guarantee you'll get what you're looking for, if it exists.

I've been saying this for a long time, but I'll say it again:

Reddit should have a system which allow users to tag submissions with keywords, like ""gold coin"", ""dubloon"", and other descriptive words, which would then be weighted heavily in search results, based on how many times a post was tagged with a certain phrase or word. If 20 people tag a post with ""gold coin"", that will be weighted very heavily in the search results, and will probably be the #1 result when someone searches for ""gold coin"", even though the submission contained none of those words and just linked to an image hosted on imgur.
The tags would be hidden from the public for the first hour or two (same as the vote count), so as not to encourage the same type of hivemind bias that exists with the voting system.

And what's the incentive for people to tag posts? Besides helping to improve the search mechanism, it will help YOU find posts later (without having to save them). Tag a post appropriately and you know that when you search for ""gold dubloon image"" in a few months, it'll show up. I think there would also be a lot of people who would post tags just for the fun of it. Sort of like ""Knights of the New"", except it would be, uh, ""Titans of the Tags"" or some stupid shit.

The other good thing (which the admins should like) about this feature is that it would discourage people from using Google for their search purposes (which may or may not take the user to a reddit page, possibly just taking them directly to the content), thereby increasing ad impressions. The reason is because Google wouldn't be very good at indexing the tags and using them in a meaningful way like the reddit-specific search algorithm would.

True,muffinkiller,,,"You're right; the reason why there is little lesbian media is because there are few lesbians, or few people willing to make it.  It's part of being a minority.  Most of us realize that though.  It'd be really fantastic to wake up one day and see as many gay books on shelves as there are hetero ones, but that's never going to happen.  That doesn't make it any less frustrating.  

I took this post more as how it's frustrating to live in a society that constantly reminds you that you're different.  Sometimes you just want to feel normal and do what other people do, like go to the bookstore and just browse that huge romance section instead of going to the squidgy little lgbt section that's predominantly porn (and in my case, next to the bible section so I got judgmental Christians glaring at me).  

And it's not that straight people are bad or you can't relate to them, but sometimes you just want to feel normal.  It'd be like if all the media you had available to you was queer.  You'd feel out of place.  You can still relate, you can still grow attached to characters, but you also wish sometimes the people you watch or read about would reflect that part of you that becomes increasingly different.

I can't see this situation really changing, and the reason why it happens makes sense, but it doesn't mean it's not frustrating.

True,[deleted],,,"If you're looking for the powerhouse, I'd say look into the Browns. They are a team nobody likes to play, and they show us their skill year in and year out. They have possibly the GOAT quarterback with Weeden, and their defense is in the top 5.

There are really only 2 powerhouses in the NFL right now. The Browns being one, and the Chiefs being the other.  The Chiefs have two shoo in Hall of Fames quaterbacks with  Matt Cassel and Brady Quinn, and they arguably the absolute best defense in the league. 

These two teams battle year after year to see who the best is in the NFL, and they usually go deep into the playoffs. So if you're looking for powerhouses, look no further than the Chiefs and the Browns.

I don't follow NBA, but by bobcats, I assume you mean the bottom of the Barrel. So, if rooting for the underdog is the way to go, check out the Patriots.  They are an up and coming team filled with newcomers. They are generally regarded as the worst team in the NFL, and people treat them like a joke, but despite this, they have a great fanbase, and are always looking for new people to join their ranks.


Edit: The Lions have also been doing particularly well. With the ACF, the Browns and Chiefs are probably going to end up in the championship, and the winner will go to the Superbowl. In the NFC, the Lions have been rolling teams. In a recent subreddit poll, the Lions came in first to represent the NFC with a strong 68% of the votes, the closest team being the Panthers with 12%. So, the Lions are the favorite team to represent the NFC in the Superbowl this coming February.

True,thatfool,,,"There are many surviving texts, but Latin is a very old language that has been used for thousands of years and its pronunciation has changed significantly during its long history. 

Case in point: The Church Latin pronunciation of ""Caesar"" is more like ""Chesar"" (Ch like in the word ""church"", e like in ""red""). But that's not how the Romans pronounced it. (Also note that there would be many dialects of Church Latin, too, if Pius X hadn't declared the Roman pronunciation standard.)

Of course not all of the sources we have for pronunciation are learning guides, but there *are* a few texts on language by scholars. Priscian is probably the most well known Roman gramarrian for his Institutiones Grammaticae (""Grammar Basics"").

Another thing is that we render Latin texts completely differently nowadays. It wouldn't have been ""Gaius Julius Caesar"" during his time, it would have been CAIVS IVLIVS CAESAR. We've changed the C to a G and the first I in IULIUS to a J because *we actually have G and J letters now* that represent these sounds better. We don't, ever, write UIA, we always spell it ""via"". The Romans didn't consider U and V to be different letters, but we do now.

(Edit: The G letter existed during Caesar's time, but the name Gaius is older. Caesar's name is recorded with both spellings. I've also changed U's to V's, for some reason I didn't remember to do that even though I wrote that bit about U and V in the same paragraph.)

But as I wrote, we do have classical Roman sources for Latin pronunciation as well as other hints. Let's go over the word Caesar again, just to illustrate what kinds of hints we have. It's not just literal ""this is pronounced by forming this shape with your mouth"".

C: 

- Many old Latin inscriptions use it interchangeably with K and Q. (Also representing the G sound at the time, in addition to K.) 

- Grammarians like Quintilian (1st century) and Priscian (5th) write that they represent the same sound.

- Marius Victorinus (4th) writes that X sounds like CS.

- Diomedes (4th ... no the other Diomedes) writes that Q before a vowel other than U is a contraction of C and U.

- Greek translators always transscribe C as kappa.

- Misspellings of Latin words in inscriptions where C is replaced by a different sound (e.g. ""paze"" instead of ""pace"") appear much later.

- If you spend some time with the letters C, K, Q, you'll find that in very early Latin, the vowel that followed determined which letter was used. For example, ""pecunia"" would have been spelled ""pequnia"" because it's followed by a U. So the sounds might actually have been different at some point, but the Romans then went and changed most of these to C's, so it was probably not a very big difference. Think the difference between K and G (which only got its own letter in the Latin alphabet in the 3rd century BC, at which point sources start explaining how it's different).

AE:

- In Church Latin, this is actually the E sound (as in ""red""), but we can actually see that change happen as AE is replaced in Latin texts by æ and ę in medieval texts. Modern Romance languages are similar. But this started about a thousand years after Caesar.

- Pre-classical Latin actually uses AI in places where classical Latin uses AE. It's possible that this similarly corresponds to a change in pronunciation.

- Greek translators transscribe it as αι (alpha iota). 

- The pronunciation of Latin loan words in Germanic languages is a big hint. The obvious example is ""Kaiser"", the German word for ""emperor"" that is directly derived from ""Caesar"" -&gt; Old High German ""Keisar"" -&gt; Middle High German ""Keiser"" -&gt; modern standard German ""Kaiser"".

- Other dipthongs did survive in modern Romance languages, for example ""au"" still exists in some of them as a diphtong. Many of the above points apply to it as well, for example it was transscribed into Greek as αυ (alpha upsilon).

- There actually is a bit of controversy over this. It's generally accepted that AE was pronounced as a dipthong, but interestingly, we do have classical Latin sources for AE being replaced by E *in rural Latin* (but perhaps this means *city Romans didn't do this*). E.g. Varro gives ""hedus"" as a rural variant of ""haedus"" (child [goat]).

S:

- See above about X sounding like CS.

- Quintilian writes that a master of speech will not prolong the S sound too much, meaning people must have hissed too long for his taste or he wouldn't be whining about it.

A:

- Marius Victorinus very directly writes that you make this sound with your mouth wide open and your tongue not touching the teeth. That's fairly precise. 

- In pretty much all modern Romance languages (languages directly derived from Latin), A is pronounced in the same way.

- Even other languages influenced by Latin pronounce it in the same way (e.g. modern German) or used to (e.g. English until around the 15th century). 

R:

- There's probably not a lot of controversy around the general idea of this sound, but Marius Victorinus specifies it as a trilled R.

- There are some sources that compare it to animal noises such as a dog growling or a cat purring, or use the R sound to represent these noises.

The Big Boss sat down at his computing machine
and pressed the go-goer, a button of green.

But the machine did not go, and the screen stayed dark black,
and the boss nearly had a third heart attack.

""What should I do?"" the boss cried with dismay. ""Computers confuse me, though I use them each day. You would think I would learn, after all of these years, but instead, I'll just sit here, and cry such sad tears.""

The clock struck nine, and in came some commuters, 
and the men from The Board, the three piece suiters,
and the sycophants, and suck-ups, and the boss saluters,
and the I.T. technician, Johnny Astuter.  

""How can I fix this?"" said the Big Boss. 
""If I can't finish payroll, the staff will be cross!  
I'll call my IT guy to come here on his scooter,

And a few moments later, Johnny Astuter
scooted right over on his small, silver scooter.
""What can I do?"" he said to the boss.
""Shall I wipe your nose, or help you to floss?""

True,Im_just_saying,coei,Anglican Communion,"So, here's the deal. We can argue back and forth over what the Scripture does or does not say about the possibility of redemption after death - because the Scripture doesn't say *much* about that issue, one way or the other (and what it actually says is up for dispute).

But what the Scripture *does* say - in spades - is what the heart of God is like. I think, partofaplan2, that part of the problem too is that people have a really lousy understanding of the Trinity, and see God the Son and God the Father as holding *different* sentiments. You know, God the Son is all loving and forgiving and merciful, God the Father is all strict and exacting and judgmental. Western Christians have come by this naturally, what with Anselmian soteriology and penal substitutionary atonement and such.

BUT, the Father and the Son are *not* two different beings, and there is no conflict of sentiments. The Son is ""the exact representation"" of the Father (Heb. 1.3). If you've seen him, you've seen the Father (Jn. 14.9). So, what do we know about God's attitude toward mercy and forgiveness?

Some would have us believe that death is the slamming of the door, beyond which there is no chance of reconciliation. You know, God is full of love and mercy and longsuffering, not wishing that any should perish but that all should be saved, willing to forgive at the drop of a hat, or the drop of a knee, *until* you've breathed your last physical breath. But in that instant - BAM! - no more mercy.

But Jesus tells us to be like God; indeed St. Paul says that's the process of salvation - that we be ""conformed to the image of the first born Son of God"" - and part of the plan too, partoftheplan2, is that we reflect the nature of God in our own nature. So when Jesus tells us to forgive 70 times 7, to love our enemies, to do good to those who despitefully use us, etc., he is describing God's character to us. When he says from the cross, ""Father forgive them, for they know not what they do,"" he is describing God's character to us.

(If, on the other hand, we were to model what we *are told by some Christians* that God the Father will be like in eternity, we would be the worst of people - only the most evil despots come close to it in this life: unforgiving, torture chambers, locking away people for the entirety of their lives, and the punishment far outweighing the crime.)

God's nature is to always have mercy. He is *full* of mercy.

I think part of the puzzle too, partoftheplan2, is that people get thrown off by the idea of mercy AND punishment. They automatically assume that if people are forgiven they endure no punishment; that hell and forgiveness are incompatible. Of course the Bible tells us that God chastens those he loves. And that he is ""is slow to anger, abounding in love and forgiving sin and rebellion. Yet he does not leave the guilty unpunished (Nu. 14.18; cf. Ps. 99.8: ""you were to Israel a forgiving God, though you punished their misdeeds."").

If you see hell as chastening, purifying, and corrective rather than as vindictive, then all of this makes sense. If you see it as a refining fire, it works.

Combining the two notions - (1) that God is always merciful, and actually ""the same yesterday, today, and forever"", and he is never ending in his desire for reconciliation, and (2) hell is not a display of God's fury and anger, nor is it the torture of relentless vindication, but is instead the painful but purifying refining of the gold of our lives, then the sensible, consistent conclusion is that there *is* hope for redemption beyond the grave.",0,1354551792,,0,False,1,c7ai4a2,t3_147bw5,t1_c7ai4a2,t3_147bw5,,1430565241,125,False,Christianity,t5_2qh6c,125

I am trying and fighting hard to win my mom's freedom in this country. She came legal but let her residency expire before I was born and has been living in fear ever since. Been going through USCIS paid up to $3k in application fees to be stopped due to a prior issue she had when she came to the states that she wasnt aware of because she didnt know english. Now, I'm just afraid, she's suffering a slavewaged job because she cant get anything else, has horrible social skills so I am her only friend. She suffers from severe depression and on her bad days hurts us verbally and shes overall ill from High blood pressure and stress. She always tells me to be there for the family iin case anything happens to her ( basically drilled this into my head since I was six) and now is starting with the whole "" I hope I can stay with you guys longer"" for fear of getting deported to a country full of violence.

True,Nougat,,Windows Admin,"&gt;  Do I owe to myself to stay and try to make it work?

Invalid question. If you ""owe"" anyone to stay, it's the company, not yourself. And you don't owe the company anything; they've paid you for your work.

&gt; I've done so much in the past 3 years here, I feel bad just leaving it.

It's work you've done, but the product isn't yours. It belongs to the company. They've paid you for it.

I don't understand why people feel guilt about leaving jobs. That guilt is what allows the company to overwork and underpay you, while still keeping you on. You're shackling yourself to the company with your own guilt, they know it, and they don't have to pay you for that.

Shifting gears, I think there are a few kinds of IT people:

* Builders - people who make new shit happen
* Maintainers - people who keep the existing shit running and fine tune it
* Demolition - people who gracefully decommission old shit
* Firefighters - people who respond to emergencies
* Documentarians - people who let other people (execs, users, tech team) know what shit is going on, how today's shit is different from yesterday's, and how tomorrow's shit will be different still

Of course, many people wear multiples of those hats, depending on the day and the need. But I think that if you take a close look at those categories, you'll find that you really, really enjoy one of those more than the others. And you really *dislike* one more than the others, too. Or your workplace environment consists of a lot of one, too little of another.

When you're begging for another employee to assist, try to fill *those* roles primarily, with technical skillsets as secondary. You've got a handle on the day-to-day stuff, including setting up and tearing down, but there's a gap in communication to stakeholders? You need to bring on a documentarian (who can probably also help fight fires occasionally). You *really* enjoy building up and tearing down, but the day-to-day stuff is a total drag? Hire a maintenance person.

And when you're looking for a new job, figure out which ones of those roles you like, and which you want to avoid. Craft the questions you ask in interviews to figure out what the position is like, and if you're going to fit well in it.

True,[deleted],,,"Alright here goes. This might get a bit long winded so try and bear with me...

TLDR a 32 bit adder takes two 32-bit values (a bit can be either 1 or 0), adds them up, and returns the result. See below for how to implement this.

Links at bottom of explanation.

Let's start with half-adders, since those are relatively simple. Half adders take two 1-bit values as inputs, let's call them A and B, and produce two 1-bit outputs, one containing the ""sum"" of the addition (let's call this S) and another containing the ""carry-bit"" (let's call it C).

So it turns out that in binary arithmatic it's possible to calculate the sum of two values simply by taking the logical XOR (exclusive or) of those two values. This produces the following truth table:

    A    B    S
    0    0    0
    0    1    1
    1    0    1
    1    1    0

Now for the carry-bit. This is the bit which in decimal notation (base 10) would represent the 10's value. In binary notation (which is base 2), however, we can calculate it using a logical AND gate, which has the following truth table:

    A    B    C
    0    0    0
    0    1    0
    1    0    0
    1    1    1

So here's the combined truth table:

    A    B    C    S
    0    0    0    0
    0    1    0    1
    1    0    0    1
    1    1    1    0

Or in arithmetic terms:

    A + B = CS
    0 + 0 = 00
    0 + 1 = 01
    1 + 0 = 01
    1 + 1 = 10

We now have a 1-bit half adder. Yay!

True,isleepinahammock,,,"Tax cuts are ""handed out"" because Republicans run promising them as rewards to their constituents. They act with them EXACTLY like Democrats act with new welfare programs. 

Republicans cater to upper class voters by promising to put more money in their pockets through lower tax rates.

Democrats cater to lower class voters by promising to put more money in their pockets through increased spending.

Both sides often do this without even attempting to cover the cost. 

And yes, you make the childishly simplistic argument that ""ARGHH taxes are theft"" while completely ignoring that every penny you have ever earned in your entire life was only possible because of the taxes paid by others and those that came before you. Others paid taxes to make your life possible. This isn't bank robbery. This is paying back to a society that has been instrumental to your entire existence. 

Both sides hand out their own treats like Santa Claus, but both sides also can claim absolute moral legitimacy. 

Republicans will scream, ""you have no right to my taxes. I sprang from the Earth fully grown, educated myself, and owe nothing to nobody. I am a self-made man, a god upon the Earth, I owe you NOTHING! Taxes are theft simple as that!""

Democrats will scream, ""how dare you cut welfare benefits? There's 40 million people on food stamps. If we remove that program, 40 million people are going to starve to death! You're a monster! You'll callously watch while babies die of famine! You're worse than HITLER!""

Both of these opinions are childish, shrill, simplistic, and downright idiotic. They lack any nuance or understanding of the real world. Tax cuts aren't automatically theft. Every penny of wages earned in this country is only possible because of the safety and security that taxes in a large part provide. Taxes are not so much theft as dues you pay when you choose to live in this country. If you don't want to pay them, if you don't want to be in our club, there is nothing stopping you from moving to another country, giving up your US citizenship, and joining their club.

The liberal screams are just as inane. Every cut to government spending is not an apocalypse. There is a fair amount of waste to be wrung out of the system. While benefits do help people, they also do breed dependency. Designing a system that genuinely helps people without making people dependent is a huge and ongoing problem.

&gt;upper-income Americans already shoulder 70 percent of this nation's tax burden.

You're cherry picking the one tax that makes it look like rich people have it so bad. Income taxes are only but a fraction of all the taxes imposed in this nation. At the federal level, payroll taxes are another major element. These fall much harder on the poor than the rich. At the state and local level, there's sales and property taxes. Again, these fall more heavily on the poor.

How can you lie like that? I mean seriously, what is wrong with you? Do you have no scruples? How can you write something like that without being ashamed of yourself? You've picked the one tax, that accounts for only 40% of the federal government's revenue, that falls more heavily on the rich and made the dastardly claim that upper income folks cover 70% of the total tax burden.

True,StevieWondersGoodEye,,,"I had a similar thing happen. I was driving down a 6 lane road that had a center turning lane. Traffic was very light. I noticed this Maxima flying up behind me, weaving through the lanes. I thought that was stupid since there were only a few cars on the road. The driver tried to swerve around a Jeep, started sliding, then to compensate straightened his wheels and drove right into the middle turning lane. He decided to gas it to go around the Jeep right as an oncoming car got into the center lane to turn. The driver never hit his brakes, just sped up and jerked over to avoid collision. The Jeep driver had to swerve hard to avoid being hit and nearly rolled. I slow down to get this guys plates, I hate stupid drivers!  
This guy flies past me, swerved across all 3 lanes and tried to turn off the road onto a side street. He didnt notice that this side street cuts back at an angle. He was going so fast that he had to turn wide to make it. Unfortunately, there was a car just coming to a stop there and got sideswiped. The Maxima floors it and is gone. I turn around and speed up the side street to catch up. By this time I got the PD on the phone and am telling them what i witnessed. They tell me since the car has disappeared, to just let them handle it. Im disappointed. Ive been the victim in a hit-n-run and it boils my blood thinking this sumbitch just got away.  
I turn around and head home, dejectedly. About 3 minutes later, my phone rang. An officer asks me to meet him at a corner convenience store. While waiting for the officer at the store, I noticed the Maxima! Oh sweet justice! I walked up to the store entrance, trying to look casual. The car has 3 teenagers around it, all of whom are on their phones, talking about how their car was just hit. As I stood there listening and giggling, a huge F350 flew up and braked hard. This man jumped/fell out, ran up to the car, inspected the damage while the teenagers recite their tale of misfortune. Turned out, he was the drivers dad/vehicle owner. About this time the officer shows up. He walked up and casually said he'd be with me in a moment. The father starts bellowing about crimes committed, the justice system broken, his family victimized. He was turning all shades of red to purple, outraged at the state of this country. The officer took everyone's statement. They claimed that they had stopped at the store and while inside, the car was hit. After hearing the stories, in a truly dramatic fashion, he informed everyone that he now had to get a statement from a witness. All eyes went wide open, looked my way. Im dying of laughter on the inside, stone cold business on the outside. The father comes over and listened with great interest. I finished the telling of actual events, smugly thinking its all over but the crying.  
But no, I was mistaken. There was more. The father points out that the cars bumper is pulled off and hanging. How could the car drive with the bumper barely attached? The officer begins to look at me questioningly. I hadnt noticed the bumper until then, it would have flown off during the sharp turn. I had no answer, and had gotten rather sweaty. Everyone thought I was mistaken or lying. At this moment, the owner emerged from the store front. He didnt know exactly what we were talking about, but thought the officer should see something. The officer emerged and informed us what had happened. The teens parked at the side of the store, where they wouldnt be noticed easily. They then tore the bumper off themselves, along with other various bits of car, to make their story more believable. They didnt know that the owner had installed cameras that saw their every move, even on the side of the store. The officer and I had a chuckle at their attempt. The officer thanked me and dismissed me. The father even shook my hand and thanked me for being a stand-up guy.

True,IWasMeButNowHesGone,,,"&gt;What kind of species loosely values qualities like arrogance and flamboyancy as attractive, and qualities such as compassion and attentiveness as unattractive?

No that's B.S.  There's a reason we've (humans) evolved to find certain traits attractive and others repulsive, there's logic to it but it must be seen from the correct point of view.

Compassion and attentiveness are **not** unattractive, neediness and manipulation are.  And that's exactly what ""nice guys"" are doing when they think they are being nice.  What's the difference:  expectations.  Nice guys aren't compassionate or attentive out of the goodness of their heart, they do it because they want this girl to approve of them, to fuck them, to talk to them, to confirm they're not going away to leave them all alone in the frightening cold world.  Nice guys see being ""nice"" as a great feat they should be honored and rewarded for, when in reality it's nothing more than a baseline expected trait of functioning adults within a society.

There's a desperation and a longing to their ""niceness"" that shows the real intention even if the nice guy is clueless to it (or to the fact that he shows it) himself, which is why it is actually manipulation born out of fear.  If the nice guys were being genuinely nice, there would be no strings attached to their kindness.  They wouldn't be doing it for the reaction, and they damn sure wouldn't be sent spiraling into a self-pity fest over a girl not jumping their bone over it.  If they were genuinely nice people, they wouldn't cry about how the girl only likes assholes after supposed 'kindnesses' and they would be just as nice to most women instead of just the ""hot"" ones.

Neediness and manipulation are signs of insecurity and immaturity.  When women think of their dream guy, what is typically thought of?  A strong, charming, fun, sexy, decisive husband and father.  And exactly what man can be that if their afraid of they're own shadow?  What man has the potential to be that ideal in any situation that could arise where the family will need their 'rock' if the guy lives in such fear they don't even act or speak genuinely when around others?  None, because such a person is not a man yet but instead still a boy desperate for approval.  

Arrogance and flamboyance aren't attractive, being genuine is.  *(BTW, who ever said those two are attractive?  It's confidence that always stated as attractive, which is quite different from those two.  It's false equivalency, used to support the statement that what humans have evolved to find attractive is illogical instead of understanding the underlying logic.)*  A man that's confident enough to be himself, speak his mind, have his own opinions and plans is far more interesting than the ""nice guy"" who never does any of those things, instead never saying or doing anything unless first having learned what will yield the desired reaction from the manipulated.  A man that speaks passionately about his interests and invites others to join in on his fun plans is far more attractive than blank yes-man that only ever says what he thinks you want to hear or ""i don't know, what do you want to do snuggle-muffins"" ad nauseum.",0,1354570504,,0,1354578074,1,c7antk8,t3_147jeb,t1_c7antk8,t1_c7amfwm,,1430568000,193,False,seduction,t5_2qhrv,193
True,TheHeartOfTuxes,,,"Is *hard* the only option? Or the best option? Maybe we think of *hard* as the best way because we are afraid of what may come, so we strategize in terms of armor -- putting shields over our bodies, walls in front of our hearts, and rigid structures around our thinking. But it may just turn out that by hardening ourselves we are already losing the liberty that we hope to preserve.

What about *responsive*, and *adaptable*, and *relaxed*?

The teeth are hard, and their hardness is useful; but the teeth chip and crack and eventually fall out. The tongue is soft, and because of that it lasts a long time. (I'm not just talking about our physical makeup here, I'm pointing at alternative approaches.) A boulder is ancient, and strong, but when water flows onto it the boulder wears down and can eventually be penetrated or split.

Rather than thinking of hardening, I like to think of a strength that is able to move and respond. When someone is strong enough, they don't have to resist the situations that arise. So I like to think in terms of healthy discipline: keeping the body and mind and emotions in wholesome states.

Part of this, *especially* for men but including all people, is the importance of getting out of the comfort zone and challenging ourselves. The mind, the emotional heart, and the body all become more healthy with appropriate challenges. We should ""put ourselves on the line"" more often, by trying difficult things. But these difficult things should be wholesome, things that increase our integrity rather than things that separate or hurt us or each other.

Physically, being exposed to the elements more frequently is usually a good and healthy tactic. It should be done within the bounds of what the body can deal with; so that means that the kind and duration of activity will be different for everyone. Everyone has a different constitution — some people are naturally tougher, some are naturally more sensitive; both of these can be beneficial qualities, they are just different.

Mentally, learning to live with all different kinds of people, and engage with all different kinds of thinking, develops an adaptability with society. We can become tougher in terms of our ability to thrive in all kinds of communities, not requiring one narrow way of life for our survival or comfort.

Emotionally, the discipline of offering your heart can likewise bring about a greater strength in terms of relating to others in the real world. When you can offer kindness or love without being attached to the response you get, then you have a very strong and noble foundation. When you can express yourself sincerely (whether it's anger, or joy, or fear, or compassion), then you will have a greater balance in all kinds of situations. It's those of us who have to hide behind a frozen self-image who are the most threatened by the changes that always come in life.

Please take this to heart: the *central* reason your grandpa is a hard ass is that he is himself. He doesn't try to be someone else, he just goes to pick up the newspaper in his bare feet. So if you want to be like him, you should be yourself. Learn from him and use what you find useful, but don't be a copy — be an original, following your own nature and your own physical constitution, and your own situation. If you follow your own situation, you will have the power of the world at your fingertips.",0,1354571774,,0,1354575480,1,c7ao8nq,t3_147spz,t1_c7ao8nq,t3_147spz,,1430568202,869,False,Survival,t5_2qh7j,869

True,Bananafanafofaser,,,"You don't actually need to use the handle in the middle. Back in the 1930s, Nintendo was a Japanese jewelry-making company. in 1935, they invented the first mood ring! Ever since, Nintendo's been perfecting its mood-sensing technology; and when the company branched out to the new video game market in the 1980s, their executives started thinking about how best to combine their two products. The result: The N64 controller. The device was an innovative attempt to channel a player's enjoyment of a game into their performance in the game itself. The controller featured a sensor that would read players' minds and determine what they were feeling about what was onscreen. If, for instance, the player was excited about a race in a game of MarioKart, his or her character would drift around corners with effortless ease. If a player was feeling afraid of a monster in The Legend of Zelda, the controller would sense that, and back the character up to a safe position. This technology didn't translate well to most western countries, because online gamers intent on violating their opponents' female relatives were sending mixed messages of lust and violent aggression to their controllers, which caused many games to crash. On a side note, experiments attempting to cope with this problem later became the ""Duke Nukem"" video game franchise. Despite its initial failure, however, Nintendo later altered its ""joy-stick"" to be operated manually, and it has since become an industry standard.",0,1354577467,,0,False,1,c7aq0g6,t3_147qls,t1_c7aq0g6,t3_147qls,,1430569032,64,False,ExplainLikeImCalvin,t5_2sp85,64

True,[deleted],,,"There is definitely some correlation between the gestation periods/size of the animal at birth and its subsequent evolutionary advancement.  The concepts of paedomorphosis (somatic development stopping early, and the adults resembling ancestral juveniles) and peramorphosis (development stops later--a longer gestation period--and the newborns attain a larger size or have new structures which contribute to their overall fitness) are one example of this.  The species which exhibit peramophosis have experienced more development in the womb, and the newborns are born already more advanced than comparable species with a shorter gestation period.  Also, as humans evolved from our ape ancestors, one of the crucial changes in bone structure was the pelvis: the closer the species was to today's humans, the larger the birth canal was to accomodate a bigger, more advanced baby.  Basically, as we evolved into a more complex and intelligent species, our infants also became larger.

True,MrMentallo,,,"I was 15 and moved to Philly from Texas. I had a pretty strong accent and had never been out of the state before so I didn't know what to expect socially. On my first day of school I had the bad judgement to wear a Dallas Cowboys jersey thinking people will just laugh. Throughout the day, I got a few dirty looks and a few ""you've got balls"" comments. Last period goes by and I'm waiting for my bus out front when this huge guido comes up and starts talking shit. I tell him to piss up a rope and he knocks me out in one punch. He gets suspended and I'm told not to antagonize things. 

Time goes by and he's a constant pain in my life bullying me around on a weekly basis. He outweighed me by about 75 pounds thanks to his steroid use and had a temper to match. I got my ass kicked many times thanks to him and his manipulations. We graduate and I don't see him for a few years. 

I had always been into cooking and decided that's what I wanted to do with my life so I went to culinary school and started working in the industry. I worked my way up the ladder quickly thanks to focus, a willingness to sacrifice a social life  and hard work. A few years later I was the executive chef of a small bistro and we had a policy of taking a prisoner on work release from the county jail as part of a rehabilitation program. The owner was a great guy who grew up without guidance and made some bad decisions early in life that got him thrown in jail for a few years. He got out, got a job as a dishwasher where the owner of that place saw some promise and took him under his wing giving him the life lessons he never got from his family and so on. This was his way of paying forward what he got. We had gone through a few guys that seemed to do well and so far the program was working out well. One day we were slated to get a new guy and guess who walks in the door... He doesn't notice me at first but then is introduced to me as his direct boss. The owner starts to introduce me but I interrupt saying that we already know each other quite well and need no introductions. I told the owner about our history not leaving any details out and he asks me what I want to do. I tell him give me a few minutes in the walk in (large walk in refrigerator that is soundproof) with him and it's all good. I take him in there and ask him why he was in jail and where he was in his head. I also told him how I would treat him was up to him and that this could go well or he could turn right around and go right back to jail. He ended up breaking down and spilling his heart out. Between drugs, an abusive household and having no real friends in school due to a total lack of social skills, he had no idea how to have a real relationship. He told me that the days he would kick my ass were the days after his old man would beat him when he got drunk. His life just went downhill after school and he ended up getting busted for dealing. I told him to clean himself up and I'd do my best to show him how to get his shit together. He ended up being one of the hardest workers I have ever seen. Five years later he ended up being my sous chef. He has his own restaurant now and we guest chef at each other's place all the time. I wouldn't trade his friendship for the world.

Finally, as far as the ""100-1000"" range, that's certainly ridiculous. This isn't ""noise"": it's a cohesive, consistent effect. Were it ""noise"", comments in those threads would be equally as likely to be upvoted as downvoted; while in fact, there's a strong tendency for post-SRD-submission votes to pile on in the exact opposite direction from the original votes applied by the actual community of the linked subreddit. (For example, I didn't make a meta-post about it, but on one of those threads - [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/ainbow/comments/13zv3z/im_gay_wish_i_was_bisexual/c78lw82) - while 31% of the comments had their scores flipped from positive to negative or vice-versa, fully 69% (tee-hee) were previously-negative comments that SRD in the aggregate upvoted, or the reverse; which is to say, for more than two-thirds of comments, votes coming from SRD users counteracted the voting trend of /r/ainbow's own users, whether they fully overcame that trend or not.) It's also worth noting that the average change in a comment's votes in the threads I've looked at it is significantly more than the original score - like on the order of scores on comments in the thread I just linked changing by *2.6 times* their original values.

And like I said, it's not like an isolated thing: this is pretty well established at this point as what happens when SRD links to a thread in /r/ainbow, because the aggregate views of SRD's community (also reflected in the comments and voting trends in the discussion threads here in SRD for any given thread) differ from those of the community it's linking, and a not-insignificant percent of users choose to use the vote buttons to express them there. (For example, on the thread that I've mentioned a couple of times now, assuming - as /u/ledownvotele would have it - that total score is the **only** valid piece of data for each comment and that therefore the total score pre-link represents the number of users voting beforehand and the change post-link represents the number of SRD users voting, SRD's users voted at about 83% the rate, relative to the size of the subreddit, that /r/ainbow's users did.)

Now, the harms for this are the really crucial part. I don't want to make this wall of text much wall-of-text-ier than it already is, so I'll try to be brief in listing just some of the problems this causes:

* It makes the linked community feel hostile to members whose views actually are shared by it, but to whom it appears that the community at large holds very different, and potentially directly antagonistic, views

* It discourages users who *do* actually have things to say that the community at large considers to be good and valuable contributions from bothering to post in the future

* It *encourages* users who have things to say that the community considers to be problematic and bad

* It makes it appear to outsiders and newcomers that the community, again, holds views very different from what it does - again driving away people who actually would have been appreciated, and attracting people who would not",0,1354602197,,0,False,1,c7ax8ue,t3_148ksg,t1_c7ax8ue,t1_c7awta9,,1430572509,-5,False,SubredditDrama,t5_2ss5b,-5

Imagine you live through your life with one goal, one dream, one purpose, and that is to become a music composer. You practice every day and work your ass off for years and years before anyone even hears your first composition. People are constantly telling you that it can't be done, that you'll never do it, that you're not special, etc, but you push on.

It not only stands the test of time in your generation and the rising one, but for centuries to come. Your name withstands countless other musicians,  artists, albums, and genres for centuries, and continues to go strong.

True,[deleted],,,"I've been there my friend. I was cripplingly shy and didn't develop even basic social skills. People will come down hard on you for it, because it's just so simple, but they just don't understand. However, I'd recommend to keep pushing yourself every day. Start small, intentionally make eye contact with someone you don't know. Don't stare, just a glance and then move on. It's actually terrifying, but the point is to just get yourself used to it. Just focus on that for a while. Then you can move to saying hi to acquaintances (someone who borrowed a pencil, asked you a question, held the door open, etc). Mention them by name. Don't interrupt them, but if they are passing in the hall just say ""Hi _______"". If they say hi back success, if not they are probably not someone you should be concerned with anyway (I know that doesn't sound great, but it is strangely true). Again, just focus on that for a while. It's a process. Then on to small talk. People you have a class with say some inane thing about the teacher or the homework. It's kind of silly, but the truth is small talk is silly. Again, terrifying, but to desensitize yourself it takes repetitive action. Hopefully your subconscious starts to realize there is little to no consequences. With practice it becomes apparent that it doesn't matter what people think, just what the people you care about think. Hater's gonna hate is actually a very profound statement. There are always a few people who talk shit about inane things and all I can say is that these probably aren't the people you should worry about.

True,notadrugdealer001,,,"Well here is my experience with drug dealing, I have a throw away account for obvious reasons (just don't want my main account to be known as a drug dealer)

I no longer do this, I am now in college and have too much to lose if I get caught.

Anyway here is my story, I started smoking trees my sophomore year of high school and good lord it was an expensive habit. 20 dollars a gram, 100 dollar a quarter (we called them quads) and 200 dollar a half. The weed we got was from the city of Chicago, it was really really really good weed. A small ten sack would stink up an entire room with a skunky smell, we often got legit strains like sour diesel. Opening my jar left the most unreal lingering odor, it was great.

Anyway, after a few months my friends realized that buying a gram at a time was a waste of money. 20 x 7 = 140 but if I spend 100 I get 2 grams free.

FREE WEED? You bet, that logic blew my mind as a kid! So buying quarters quickly turned into half ounces. But man I was beyond broke, I was doing so much yard work to keep up this habit.

I had another wonderful idea, I should sell a quarter of my half o and I basically smoke for free! Little did I know selling to my group of friends would turn into a much bigger game then I thought. All my friends smoked all of my high school smoked. I'm not exaggerating that, my town sucked all there was to do was smoke weed and drink beer in peoples basements. There were no parties, we were lame as hell. 75% of my school surveyed that they smoke weed at least once every 30 days. I knew I could make some serious money doing this. It was also amazing how much weed my town consumed and yet we were still productive.

I would buy a half o and sell a quarter within 10 minutes of picking up, I was getting quarters basically for 60 dollars each. Well, my name spread pretty fast because I gave fat sacks, smoked everyone out, and everything always properly weighed out. Plus I delivered, I was your dream dealer in high school. This also forced me to get a ""Trap phone"" as my friends called it. It was just a prepaid phone I threw minutes on every week.

I eventually started expanding, I bought my first ounce after talking to my dealer to give up his connect. This kid was making bank off me so I said I would work with him if he let me in on cheaper prices. But that was bullshit because I'm not trying to share profits or get caught out of his stupidity. I bought the ounce for $325 and sold 2 halfs for 200 each to a few smaller local dealers the same day. I went back to the guy a few hours later and asked for another ounce, no deal, he flagged me as a snitch and cut me off.

At this point I was working through 4-5 high school dealers (some younger and some older then me) just to keep supplying myself and friends with weed. I bought low amounts to keep myself off the grid, I'd buy a quarter from as many people that could supply me and then keep one and sell the rest gram by gram or eighths, nothing higher, I needed the profit.

Then one Friday after finals I got like 20 phone calls for people trying to pick up weight, people wanted quarters, halfs, eighths (mind you I'm still a sophomore, a half o is a lot of weed to rookies.) I was like fuck it I got this, I call up all my dealers in my phone and all of them were dry, I ask my friends if they have any other dealers and they were dry. I ran my local dealers out of weed, I made the town dry because I could move it so fast.

My trick was that I had a 2 hour window of when you could buy from me, I'd only accept orders from 4pm - 6pm mon-sat delivery only, don't deal from your house especially if you don't own it. I don't need to get my parents involved if I fuck up. I got away with these hours because my parents worked everyday until 11pm sometimes later. People knew I was serious about my window and I was always told I was a great dealer so people respected my hours. I didn't brag, I didn't need to advertise, my clients did it for me.

Now back to the entire town being dry, I wanted weed, my friends wanted to smoke, my town needed the weed, I wanna be a hero. I called up the guy who cut me off as a last effort. His buddy put in a good word for me saying that I'm legit and just new what I was doing. He said he would sell me an ounce and told me to come to his house again. I go back to the hood which is less then a mile from my house 
he asked me how much I am moving and I explained it. From there we sat and smoked a blunt and talked for about 15 minutes. He fronted me the ounce and his exact words were ""Lil' skinny nigga, flip this shit for what you can and I gotchu from here on out."" I worked my magic, called up my 2 local dealers who bought a half every time and came back with 400 cash in about 30 minutes. The look on this dudes face was priceless, he realized I'm his ticket to mad profit because I had the connections he needed in a very wealthy neighborhood. My neighborhood was a great place to live middle class to super rich people.These kids had money to throw around, I was in the not really maintained 1-story house zone, I had to work for my money, my parents didn't do freebies.

This guy then gave me the real deal, I didn't realize what I was getting myself into, I was just a kid and I'm doing shit that is going to get me thrown in jail, shot, stabbed or even killed. It's weed, not anything to die over. I look back on it today and can't believe what I did.

I got my ounces for 225 a bag after I met this guy, that unlocked entire worlds of profit and I had fucking mountains of weed, I could finally afford to smoke out all my friends, myself, and then pay for food too. It was great.

I am guessing you made several other trades throughout the year with the same money.  In 2010 brokers were only required to report the gross proceeds of a trade.  The individual had to report cost basis and gains/losses.  If you did not report anything about it, the IRS may assume $0 basis and start off saying the entire gross proceeds is taxable income.  In reality the taxable portion should be gains only (sometimes offset by losses elsewhere).

True,StormXMX,,,"I was just at the protests outside the Presidential Palace (my first ever protest, and also the first time I have ever experienced tear gas). The tear gas was unexpected. We were talking to officers around the Presidential Palace who were very compassionate and understanding. This was following a withdrawal of a security cordon earlier which allowed Protesters to enter the main road.

All of a sudden while chatting to one of these officers, tear gas starts to be fired (which I found surprising since their own people were out there!) According to news reports I have read, it appears that the tear gas coincides with the time that Morsi fled from the Presidential Palace.

The protesters that were present were children, students, women, men - not one thug, but people that truly care about the future of their country. They were the most peaceful, respectable, and honorable people I have ever stood by.

**Edit 2**: I am on my way back there now (I initially returned because my dad was badly impacted from the tear gas). I will update everyone with photos and videos when I get back. Wish us luck.

**Edit 3**: I have returned home. Numbers have declined but there's still tens of thousands there. There is absolutely no security presence: walls of the Presidential Palace are coated in graffiti and protesters are peacefully chanting: it's quite a festive atmosphere.

**Edit 4**: Some have stated that the protesters attacked a police vehicle and took it over.

True,sweezey,,,"The filters are gonna be outside. Normally they are in a big metal box on the side of the building. Slow sleeds can be caused by a few reasons.

These are the people that are uploading 30gig of data a month. They should be on a business account. Knology is on par with comcast as far as speeds(last I checked our plans are very close) I do believe they offer a 100mb plan, which I think we top out at 50 now. Im not sure what their upload plans are tho.
Comcast is the ferrari of cable systems. When everything works, it works beautifully. But when it breaks, and it will. You might have to sell your soul to get it working right again.They have more HD channels, the new hd/dvr box is fantastic. 
The flip side is our system works, constantly. Its not 100% perfect, storms give us problems, people hit cable and poles. But normally if its an outage its only gonna be out a few hours at most. Even during storms and power outages, your cable will still work.
Comcast is running all digital which helps, but their system is severely outdated. But they have deep pockets, and they build everywhere and anywhere. 
We could run much higher speeds, but the closer you get to the ragged edge, dependability takes a hit.

True,wawin,,,"It was way too late to answer the call so I stayed in my bed rebelliously, hoping for silence.  The ringing started for a second time, again I ignored it.  Finally I'll get my much needed sleep.  Right as I was falling back into my dreams I heard a final ring.  

I don't really know what possesed me to finally get up, for some reason I just needed to know what it was all about so I could rest calmly.  On my way to the phone I bang my pinky toe on the bedpost.  Wide awaken now.  I jump to grab the phone and throw myself back on my bed to listen while I grab my aching foot.  I don't listen at the beginning, the pain deafining my other senses then, my attention gets peaked. 

""We've just been informed that an Unidentified Object has crashed on a nearby suburb, no one was hurt.  First responders are clueless as to what it could be.  A few markings are visible, but most are charred away.  It doesn't look like an asteroid, this seems like it was made by someone"".

I drive like a maniac and reach the area where it crashed. My credentials let me slip through the manned security cord.  My heart is coming out of my chest as I get closer and closer to the crater.  I'm greeted by some colleagues that got the same call that I did.  The emergency responders are pretty much finishing up on clearing the place for us.  Patiently we wait.  Finally, they let us get near it.  It's pretty banged up but some of it still looks intact.  We get some dirt and ash  off the metal casing and see the strange marks the first responders were talking about.  First, a flag of sorts with many stars and some basic colors.  As we are cleaning it up some more, the casing opens up.  Inside something shines differently with the reflection of our flashlights.  My colleagues open it completely and remove what appears to be a Golden Disc, and a strange small casing containing a needle. I'm having difficulty breathing as they are handed to me.

Shivers run down my spine as I try to read the inscription stamped on the center of the disc.  Can't read it at all, it's all scratched up.  The rest of this side of the disc is encircled by some depressed grooves which look in pristine condition.  I look to the other side it and see a diagram.  [It looks like these are instructions of what to do with the disc.](http://i.imgur.com/ZrHw3.jpg).

Days pass and we hardly sleep, yet no one wants to go.  Nobody wants to say to their grandchildren ""Yes, I was sleeping when someone finally cracked the code given to us by the first intelligent alien life ever to make contact"".  Finally, after many sleepless nights, one of the youngest engineers screamed while crying ""I got it!!!"". He explains that the trick was to understand what the two small circles on one side of the disc were.  Almost screaming with joy he states ""This diagram illustrates the two lowest states of the Hydrogen Atom!  The Vertical Lines with the dots indicate the spin moments of the Proton and Electron.  The Transition Time from one state to the other provides the fundamental clock reference used in all the cover diagrams!"".  Silence swept the room, followed by a loud roar and applause.  Kid was a hotshot.

The rest was fairly simple.  Like many codes, once we got the cypher, the rest of the puzzle made sense.  When the team finished, we understood that the following would be possible: The disc is meant to be played, the aparatus that contained a needle was a stylus. If the disc was played at the correct frequency, as the diagram showed, then images and sounds should come out of it.  We would know it was the correct frequency if we saw a small geometrically perfect circle.  Everybody was told to get a good night's sleep, we would play the record tomorrow.

I didn't get any sort of sleep, and I assume nobody else on the team actually managed to get any shuteye.  I ""woke up"" at 6 am, jumped out of my bed with an unhinged excitement that I didn't know I could still produce after all these years.  I ran to grab my phone again and swiftly dodge the bed post -  ""not this time!"" - I told the bed while hitting my foot on the night stand.  ""Fuck the pain"" I thought and ran to my car while my foot was still throbbing.  It's funny how I always thought to myself that there was no excuse for speeding and driving wrecklesly.  After several days of driving like a psycopath I felt more sympathetic to all those people I had screamed during my years commuting to work.  
As I was nearing the lab I noticed that more and more cars were lining up on my route. 

The weather could've been better, but the rain did nothing to deter interest in the situation.   The parking lot was oversaturated with random cars, press vans and just about everybody that found out what was going to happen today.  This was obviously going to happen, why the fuck did I leave the lab at all!?

I park my car and run through the shorter but wetter route to the lab entrance. My credentials let me slip throught the mass of humans accepting their rainy fate and forming a line. I receive lots of jealous stares, for the first time in my life I felt like an absolute VIP Rockstar.  Met up with my colleagues, and while I was drying myself up I heard one of them mention that we were scheduled to play the record in 2 hours.  Everything had been set up through the night.  Only three people were allowed inside the room with the disc that day.  The young engineer that had cracked the hydrogen cypher and two other scientists.  A glass wall would divide the public from the three that would be lucky enough to play the disc for us.  The limited press seats had been taken by the correspondants.  The rest of the seats were distributed amongst the team of scientists that worked on the cleanup and studying of the disc. 

As the room filled up, we received an announcement from the PA to please remain silent as we were about to begin.  The lights dimmed off and the curtain was lifted from the glass wall.  A white light emerged from the bottom until it reached the ceiling.  As our eyes adjusted we saw the room clearly. It was white, mostly empty and in the center lay the disc with the stylus lying on top of it.  For an inanimate object it had an eerie way of looking like a little kid just aching to tell you a secret.

The chosen three entered the room. The Young Engineer came forward with a microphone and greeted us.  He could have said something spectacular that would have been remembered for generations. Instead, ever the scientist, he simply said ""Thank you all for coming.  I hope we all receive a nice surprise today"".   He signed the thumbsup to the other two and they switched on the Disc-player.

The player was synched up to a couple of screens and speakers.  The disc started spinning, we hear some muffled indistinct sounds and some horizontal and vertical lines.  This was it? What a load of crap.  This went on for a couple of minutes while they did some minor adjustments to the machine; then, while the room started getting unsettled and the sounds of the discontent were starting to drown the speakers we saw it.

[A circle](http://i.imgur.com/op893.png).  The diagram said this would happen, when the playing frequency was correct, we would see a perfectly round circle.  We fell silent. Then, it started.

A voice, many voices.  They changed in tone and pronunciation.  Something seemed strange yet similar.  Slowly a few in the crowd started recognizing the words.  They were greetings in many languages.  What started with pictures of what appeared to be the Milky Way Galaxy, planetary positioning, color spectrums gave way to closeups of Earth.  Then a cross section of a human, then another.  The diagrams and pictures started to describe in detail what the human body was and how we reproduced.  After all this excitement, turns out we had opened up a message sent by ourselves.  To say we were let down was an understatement. 

Then, some buildings started to appear.  That's when I said to myself ""huh, that's funny"".  If we sent these pictures, why don't I recognize any of the buildings?.  It continued on and it got to a written message in clear english.  Some things were extremely confusing.  As I try to understand it better I look again at who signs the letter.  It says ""Jimmy Carter - President of the United States of America"".

When the message was over, the lights turned on again and people started getting up and arguing with each other about what they had just seen.  I couldn't talk to anyone, I was completely dumbfounded.  
I got into my car and started driving back home.  While I drove on a deserted highway I just looked up at the stars. The sky was clear and decided to stop right there and just stare in awe at the vastness of space.   I start up the car again and go home. 

Haven't payed attention to my wife and kids in weeks.  They knew it was important so they didn't pressure me too hard.  My wife greeted me with a warm hug and a kiss. I kneeled down and my lovely girls hugged me like only a man's own daughters can.  At the dinner table I retell what we saw at the screening. Same thing everyone else had seen.  The entire planet had viewed this great event and just like me they were left very confused.  As  we fell into silence, my youngest girl asks me: 
""Daddy, who is Jimmy Carter, what is a President? what is the United States?"".

put apache behind SSL so you're not taking in sensitive data nd passwords in plaintext.

set ACLs on the apache layer so the application can only be accessed from the trusted corp network (this requires they have a static IP or a VPN). this means that random folks on the internet won't be able to brute-force the system. it also means that a rogue user can't log in from home and steal all the data.

obviously, you need some permissions on the CMS. if everyone is accessing the data/docs via the CMS, that's the primary access control / audit trail.

for Linux permissions and SQL, you're solving a completely different problem. at this layer, there is almost zero benefit in adding additional security. all you will be doing is preventing sysadmins from doing their job. try and remove ""other"" read/execute from all the data directories. if you run multiple web apps, give them all their own SQL database, user and password. segmenting SQL access in an application is entirely at the application level and most apps do not support ""put foo-data in dbA with this password, put bar-data in dbB with this password"".",0,1354657029,,0,False,1,c7b8n8c,t3_14a4dx,t1_c7b8n8c,t3_14a4dx,,1435661882,3,False,webhosting,t5_2qn3h,3

True,notadrugdealer001,,,"Alright here is part 2 of my story since most people are very interested. For the record, I'm not asking for Karma, it's a throwaway account, but please upvote this so good kids stop becoming drug dealers. I may make it seem interesting or even fun, but its fucking scary, you meet the shittiest people in the world and its very stressful knowing you can go to jail, shot, stabbed, jumped, etc... The worst part is if you make friends from it, you don't know who your real friends are. Easily 75% of the kids I met were only hanging out with me for the free weed.

Here's part 2/3:
So I just met a guy who can give me an ounce of weed at half the price of what it is in my town. I'm getting to the end of sophomore year and greed is getting to me. I'm making about 150-175 dollars a day for doing 2 hours of work by just buying an ounce and selling it all. Let me remind you I'm doing this every day except Sundays. 

After a couple weeks of that, I went from moving grams, eighths, and quarters to random people from my school to moving half o's and ounces to the local drug dealers because of this guy. I would pick up a quarter pound of cheese (4 ounces) a week for $800 and sell the ounces for $325 each to 2 friends who dealt and then an ounce for $400 to a kid who just smoked a ton of weed. I would either keep an ounce for myself and pocket 250 bucks after re-upping, or I would sell the last ounce to just my closest friends for 200 so they all had their own personal stash to smoke when I wasn't around. 

You may ask why would I give up 150-175 a day to get 250-450 a week? Because that's still good fucking money for a 16 year old plus I work once a week so it's less suspicious and I deal to 4 people not 60 plus I cut out the middle man.

I have a ton of money at this point, I was making up to $1050 a week for about roughly 3 weeks, then I made 250-450 for another 3 weeks before Summer. I did spend a lot of that money though, I treated my real friends very nicely by funding parties and such when their parents went out, I paid for probably a hundred dollars worth of food a week for us and so I maybe had $2000-3000 cash in my floor boards going into Summer.

I started working with the guy that got me my awesome connection for a little while. We became pretty good friends and I went to a public school and he went to a private school in a different part of town. I ran my section he ran his and we both enjoyed our lifestyles. One day we were joking around he said ""man if we did this shit with coke we wouldn't have to work for the rest of high school."" I laughed it off and thought nothing of it, I didn't plan to do this much longer and cocaine is expensive and something people get shot for. He was serious though, he was able to sell coke to his private school buddies and I immediately stopped associating myself with him once people started to hit me up for it too. My friends didn't do coke and neither did I, I would only sell a drug I personally know is safe because I use the same product that I hand out. I'm not going to start doing cocaine for a new paycheck. That's when I took a break, people think I'm associated with cocaine and that is not the image I want.

Honestly, who wants to hang around with a cocaine dealer? Weed gave me a system that works and no one cared if I showed up with lots of weed because everyone loves lots of weed. I took a break from dealing for a good week and my entire side of the town went dry. I finally realized how much power I had in the neighborhood. You wanna talk shit to me? I make a phone call and your dealer gives you a nice ""go fuck yourself"" instead of a bag of weed because if he didn't I cut him off too.

I had respect in my school for what I achieved, but it was the wrong kind of respect. I try to be a good person to make up for what I do: I am very generous, I don't make fun of people, I don't argue, I won't raise my voice at you, I started a basketball league for little kids at my community building, and I volunteer at a hospital every winter break where I read Christmas stories to mentally ill patients. I wanted respect because I tried to be a good person, not a weed dealer. Dealing weed was just something I did because I was sick of never having money and it was super easy.

Again, I'm not cocky in any way and didn't think I was Al Capone and could get away with whatever I wanted. I didn't brag about my money, how much weed I have, how much I smoke, if people talked shit to me I didn't straight up say ""I'm gonna caught off your supply."" I just walked away and called people until I found out who sold to him and I would say ""Hey man xxxxx got popped off a few days ago, don't sell anything to him for a bit alright? I don't want you getting busted either."" The dealers always bought it and would thank me and carry on with their day. People just got jealous of what I had so I had to start to watch my back. They knew I usually had a quarter in my pocket and most likely had a decent amount of money too. (Jokes on them I never had more than 25 bucks cash on me....But I did have lots of weed.)

So, you're essentially not with him because of the fine qualities he is displaying NOW (in the present), you're with him because he's a safety net. No wonder your relationship is so dull! You have essentially created an image of him inside your mind, and in that image he is a good husband/father. He is neither a husband or a father now, so this essentially a conclusion that you yourself have created to lull you into a sense of security.  Essentially, you're with somebody that you share no passion with because you prefer to live inside your own fantasy. 

In other words, you are dating two people: The first is the physical boyfriend who you see and interact with. The second is the person that you expect him to be - the good husband/father that exists in some far off future. It's all the same person, but your mind has refracted his persona into two people. Your expectations of who he should or will be in the future are way up there, but the reality of the situation is somewhere down here. No wonder you're confused! 

I can't tell you whether to stay or go. The only thing I can tell you is to become more aware of who he is NOW. Clear your mind of future expectations, of who he could be or should be. These expectations are fantasies made in your mind, and are not solid enough to sustain a relationship. In fact, it could lead to heartbreak in the future, since you have no guarantee that he will indeed one day be a good husband/father.

True,thetoethumb,flaireduser,Chemical Engineering,"It's probably vinegar (acetic/ethanoic acid, CH*_3_*COOH) and bicarb soda (sodium bicarbonate NaHCO*_3_*).

I'm going to estimate there's about 100 mL of vinegar in there at about 6 % acetic acid. This equates to 1.05 mol of CH*_3_*COOH. We'll also assume this is our limiting reagent and that all of it reacts. 

CH*_3_*COOH + NaHCO*_3_* → H*_2_*O + CO*_2_* + CH*_3_*COONa

By the chemical reaction above, we find that 1.05 mol of CH*_3_*COOH equates to 1.05 mol of CO*_2_*. Using the ideal gas law:

    PV = nRT
     V = (nRT)/P
       = (1.05 [mol] * 8.31 [J/mol/K] * 298 [K]) / 101325 [Pa]
       = 0.0256 [m^3]
       = 25.6 L

So it'll only generate 25.6 L of CO*_2_* which isn't a lot. If you were in a room that's 5m x 5m x 5m, that's 125 m^3 which is 125,000 L. That 36 L will only make up 0.0205 % of that volume so you don't have to worry about anything.

True,darkenspirit,,,"It really has to do with the confidence fairy as everyone likes to call it. Its interesting how our markets rely a bit on confidence in that the markets will continue to do well.

You often see satirical cartoons that exaggerate this phenomena where a stock broker says one thing such as ""Corn is going to drop! Sell Corn!"" and the entire mass market creates its own oversale of corn.

Anyways Confidence is very important to the market. It keeps prices stable, keeps people investing, and overall plodding along.

The fiscal cliff is the oncoming financial storm. At the end of 2012 there are automatic budget cuts that will go into effect that will reduce the deficit by about 600 billion. This is gained from a combination of tax increases and spending cuts.

However the economic impact of this is very easy to calculate. This will reduce GDP by nearly 4%. As of 2011 we had only 1.7% growth in GDP this means at least a negative of 2.3% GDP shrinkage which = recession. This is also coupled with the predicted increase of unemployment by almost a full percentage point, some 2 million jobs will be lost.

The real issue is that the indecision is costing the market even more than this. The markets and financial investors cannot predict what kind of event will happen. Maybe congress will come together with a plan and delay it. Maybe Obama will just let the cuts go through and we take the recession for a bit and just deal with the Bush Cuts that way, many argue this would be therapuetic for the economy and the only thing we would have to worry about is getting the economy together to make sure it doesnt plunge further due to the cliff. Either way, markets do not know, and when markets are unsure, they are not confident and begin to retract and save and protect their assets rather than take more risk.

This also comes at a point where the healthcare industry is going through drastic changes what with Obama care and medicare changes. Our health industry which is arguably a huge part of the economy and economic activity, is also at a very unsure position.

True,sbetschi12,,,"After having read the comments here, I feel as if I should present a ""feminist"" perspective on this issue.  While I do not claim to be a feminist, I have studied feminist literature in the past while taking a class on literary theory.  I think it is important for people to have at least some idea of what they are railing against before making broad statements.

Reading through the comments, I see many people have said, ""But 'man' is a word that is used to include everybody . . . all mankind.""  The problem here being that the word 'man' is not at all inclusive.  The word actually excludes approximately 50% of the Earth's population (the Chinese ""one baby per family"" rule offsets most national averages, putting male population at ~50.3%).  So, while many people may say, ""Hey, what's the big deal?  It's our language structure,"" a feminist might reply, ""The big deal is that our language is inherently patriarchal, and I do not feel as if I have equal representation within society as a direct result of the subordination of the feminine.""  

A perfect example of ""the subordination of the feminine"" can be found below.  [For the lazy, confused.](http://www.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/comments/14aco4/college_says_men_working_sign_is_sexist/c7bik95).  Someone referred to people who take offense at patriarchal language as ""a pussy.""  Snuggl was quick to point out that the commentater had responded ""to a women right's issue by using the female reproductive organ as a synonym for weak and whiny.""  The use of words and phrases such as ""pussy,"" ""throws like a girl,"" and even ""wears the pants in a relationship"" become common-place in our daily communication.  We hear these phrases in childhood and are, therefore, more comfortable using them to express our meaning.  What many fail to realize, however, is that this type of language serves to invalidate females.

Not only does it invalidate females, but--some might argue--it also serves to validate ""a masculine idealizing tendency that uses the feminine as a mirror for its own narcissistic speculation.""  Therefore, to say ""you throw like a girl"" not only subverts women's abilities, but it also reinforces the idea that a man could obviously do it better.  I am a female, and I guarantee you this is false (because I can throw faster, more accurately, and more beautifully than almost every man I know [grew up playing football]).

French feminist [Luce Irigaray](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luce_Irigaray) suggested that women sabotage ""the theoretical machinery"" of our language structure in order to interpret ""the way in which . . . the feminine finds itself defined as lack, deficiency, or as imitation and negative image of the subject"" and to signify that ""with respect to this logic a disruptive excess is possible on the feminine side.""  Essentially, women should reappropriate the language.  I can only think of two examples of this off the top of my head:  think of the way Republicans used the term ""Obamacare"" in a derogatory manner.  Democrats started using it in the sense that ""Yes, Obama DOES Care.""  Time will tell us if that was a successful reappropriation of the word.  Also, remember learning in American history class that the Limeys called us ""Yanks?""  Well, we took that word and turned into a really popular song that we now teach our toddlers.  Suck it, Brits!  (Notice how, by using the term ""suck it,"" I have reinforced the idea of male dominance.  Phallocentrism is a sneaky thing.)

Basically, if you are a man (especially a straight, white, middle class man) you have not had to endure many prejudices that women put up with on a daily basis, so it is easily conceivable that you would not notice when these instances occur or would not realize how deeply hurt the ""others"" marginalized by such language feel.  It is basically the same principal involved in the outrage surrounding a panel of male, Catholic priests who come together to discuss and determine a woman's reproductive rights.

If you are a woman who thinks it's no big deal (I honestly can't say that I've ever been bothered by a ""Men Working"" sign), voice your opinion like everyone else, but please don't put these women down too much.  While it may seem trivial to us, it is only through the struggles of past generations of women that we have the good fortune to be able to ""wear the pants"" in any relationship, freely tell others that some of us have neither interest nor talent in cooking, attend and excel in the same universities as men, and walk into a job interview for any position, not just secretary (if you are a secretary, though, good on you!  You opened the door for the rest of us.).

A little understanding goes a long way.

True,WhenSnowDies,,,"After looking at the responses to you, TIL that Reddit's going to make for some extremely shitty and detached parents that think they're their kid's friends and doing them a favor in not socializing them and leaving them to their devices under the guise of open-mindedness. What a load.

If I were in your shoes, wtf_Paranoid, I'd think through my own intentions a bit before approaching the boy; if only to be sure I'm clear on why I'm talking to him about this and to what ends so it doesn't become an argument. Once clear with myself, I'd approach him.

My own reasoning and intentions would be that I want the best for my son, for him to be and feel like a normal person, if not an exceptional one, and that I understand that his way of pleasure seeking (even pleasure seeking itself) isn't optimal or, in this case, normal. Having coached people before, and even helping one through a serious eating disorder and into extraordinary health, I can tell you that your follow through is the most important. It's not your approaching him that matters so much as your follow up.

Unlike Reddit's thinking, buying a dildo for the kid only makes the problem go away for *you* and leaves the kid to go off the rails into whatever for his ""happiness"". That boy doesn't know what happiness is, he's a kid. You're his father. You know things and have regret in your pride and know what you wished you would have done, and if you wouldn't have wished an egg in the ass for yourself then I sincerely doubt you do for your son--that is why you're concerned. Also, don't be fooled--this isn't a huge moral or social issue, it's an egg in the ass.

It's your job to teach him from your successes and mistakes and make him a comfortable, confident, and strong man. In other words, that lack of investment or giving a shit about him by way of buying him a dildo in order to wash your hands of it, as well as the ""whatever makes you happy"" attitude that Reddit recommends, is why most Redditors are a bunch of people pleasers who want desperately to be liked. As a father, invest in him extraordinarily and believe in your son, and you must give him confidence and teach him to be actually shrewd and clever rather than just wise in his own opinion.

Spend some time with him. In your shoes, I'd make him more comfortable as a man so he can live a happy life as a man. How? I'd treat him like he's coming of age and like the torch is being passed, and that he's worthy for it to be passed to. I'd let him try ""manly things"" that can be dangerous and require temperance and responsibility, like shooting guns if he hasn't, or maybe have him try whiskey, and physical things like wood-splitting and working out and running. Maybe he has tried alcohol with friends already, but does he know *how* to drink? I'd also choose something socially unacceptable that's associated with strength, like smoking pipe tobacco; something that would make Redditors shit themselves and toss their scarves over their pretty little shoulders and scoff.

The point wouldn't be to start addictions or fads or faux manhood, but to be introduced to and to be taught *how* to do things that will be done. Unlike smoking pot or a cigarette, pipe tobacco requires skill and time and technique. The same goes with sipping whiskey as opposed to shots, shaving with a straight razor, or hitting a target with a pistol as opposed to Call of Duty and such. Do you catch my drift? Anybody can seek pleasure from cramming an egg up their ass or find a half-eaten meal in a dumpster, but what makes a man a man is knowing *how* to do things and having pride in doing them right and not settling. He can cram an egg up his ass, but can he win a girlfriend, speak rough and soft when he needs to, and please a woman? A real man challenges himself constantly and sees that everything that he does lives up to his character and expectations. Is an egg in the ass really good enough for your son? He seems to think so. Your job is not to think so and to show that by investing in him and having patience with him, as if you already know that he's every inch the man that you are. This requires you to have pride as well.

So, in short and regardless of downvotes, fuck Reddit in the ass with an egg--because they think *that's* good enough for *your* son. Maybe it is for their sons, but you go and teach your son skills and how to be a man, how to have attention to detail and patience and to master things so that when his friends do a bunch of shots of cheap vodka he might join, but he knows in the back of his mind that it's cheap shit and that's not how *he* drinks and certainly not how he lives.

True,ParanoidObsessive,,,"We'll start at the top and try to clear up some misconceptions for you. White holes were just a possible solution to the Einstein field equations, they were mathematically sound and very symmetric (which, I think, is why news and sci-fi latched on) but didn't make any sense in physical reality. We can now say that black holes will eventually release everything they 'captured' (Hawking radiation) and white holes aren't needed (unless you call them equivalent to black holes which is mostly semantic quibbling). 

A singularity is really just a point in a field equation where a field goes to infinity at t=0. Nothing can meaningfully be said to be a 'part of' a singularity. Relatedly, nothing can have come 'before' the Big Bang because that is like saying North of the North Pole. Wormholes as you are thinking of them are definitely not a thing. Some wormholes can appear in solutions to the field equations but they disappear immediately and create a number of other problems.

Next is some misconceptions about black holes. Black holes are very strange and are unlike anything else in the universe, they can't really be compared to anything or be similar to anything. They are different. The best way to think of them is as a piece of spacetime that does not exist. They are bounded by a spherical 'event horizon' but it has no other side, there is no 'inside' a black hole, no 'through', no 'into'. Kind of like more north than north except no good analogy presents itself.

Instead, things 'scatter' off the event horizon, sort of the way some glass would scatter off the floor when dropped. What's strange is the fact that, due to very strong gravitational time dilation and some thermodynamic stuff, this scattering takes much much longer than the current age of the universe. This stuff (information, matter, particles, what have you) that has fallen on the event horizon is not 'available' in the universe but it isn't gone. It is pending. It has not yet scattered, but it is scattering.

The interplay is fascinating - these four guys are so in tune with each other that it's unreal. You can hear them get more and more energized by the enthusiasm of the crowd as the show goes on. Some great moments include the weird unplanned intro to ""Pennies From Heaven"" (the band jumps in not knowing what the hell Brubeck is doing; Paul Desmond quotes it back at 1:20 and you can hear one of the guys laugh 'Yeah' at 1:24 when they catch the joke). The solo in ""Castillian Drums"" is pretty cool, and ""Blue Rondo a la Turk"" burns in 9/8 time before settling into an extended jam. Desmond's solo is really slick (I think it's Brubeck who goes 'yeah!' at 3:50, and Morello throws in a seamless snare *pop* at 4:53 for Brubeck to start his solo - so perfect, yet it happened spontaneously). It gets even more interesting Joe Morello starts to throw little drum accents toward the end before stepping on the gas and bringing them to a fever pitch - they all keep up perfectly. He's literally on fire when he launches into ""Take Five"" for the finale.

If you hadn't guessed, I really love this recording. I started listening to Brubeck almost 25 years ago and started learning from him about improvisation and the strange unspoken communication that happens when you're just jamming. His recordings taught me so much about *how* to listen to music, and I consider myself lucky to have seen him perform on several occasions.

Regular plastic toys like action figures, play sets, etc are molded with a few very simple criterion:  fit, form, function, and appearance.  If they don't have any noticeable major defects and fit together with other mating pieces it doesn't matter if say an action figure's arm is .05"" too short.

On the other hand, legos are a completely different animal.  Every single lego brick made has to fit together perfectly with every other lego brick EVER MADE.  So the piece you get in your new super star destroyer has to snap together perfectly with a piece from a model house made in 1970.  To achieve this, they run size tolerances on the order of .0005"".  That is half of a thousandth of an inch.  The amount of process control to get that tolerance on a plastic part is truly incredible.  And it's not just one dimension on each piece that has to be that perfect, it's every dimension where a piece can fit together with another.  This means that the maintenance they do on their molds is much more thorough than is normally done and the molds don't last nearly as long before they need to be rebuilt (ie the mold cavities taken out and replaced with new ones).  Any time a part falls out of the spec they have to call in engineering to evaluate and make sure the process changes they make to compensate are ok.

That's why Legos are so expensive.

True,RelativisticMechanic,maths,Mathematical Physics | Geometry | Octonions ,"**TL;DR** We can formulate quantum field theory in a curved spacetime just fine. The problem is in figuring out how the curvature should then respond to the field.

**Constructing Quantum Field Theories**

The standard construction of a quantum field theory for, say, the Klein-Gordon equation depends critically on the existence of a globally inertial reference frame. Once that frame is chosen, one expresses the Lagrangian in terms of a plane-wave basis and further assumes provisionally that that the space of interest is T^3 rather than E^(3); i.e., that the spatial variables are bounded with periodic boundary conditions. Once the Lagrangian is fixed, one realizes that it can be expressed as an infinite number of independent quantum harmonic oscillators. One introduces appropriate creation and annihilation operators, and from them constructs *field* operators, which, in principle act on the underlying Hilbert space to give the value of the quantum field at a specific point. Then the lowest energy state corresponds to a vacuum, and excited states can be interpreted as the presence of particles, since the Hilbert space in question is the Fock space associated to a traditional single-particle quantum system.

Now, this formulation has one major problem from a particle physics perspective: the field operators are expressed in terms of *divergent* series. So physicists came up with renormalization. It turns out that there's actually an alternative construction that *is* well defined, in which case the field operators become operator valued distributions. In short, the fact that we can do this is why renormalization schemes work.

Now, this new construction is formally equivalent to the above, but it has two major advantages. First, as mentioned, it's entirely well-defined and doesn't require any mathematical 'trickery'. Second, it makes no reference to a plane-wave basis and doesn't require the introduction of a global inertial reference frame. This makes it ideal for extension to curved spacetimes where no such reference frame need exist.

At this point, I should make a comment about the previous discussion. In the original formulation, we have a plane-wave basis for single-particle states that served as a natural choice for our basis Hilbert space. In general, one must still choose a subspace of the solutions to the Lagrangian to act as the appropriate Hilbert space, but in curved spacetimes we don't, in general, have any sort of *natural* choice because we don't have our globally inertial observer.

**On Curved Spacetimes**

In any case, the reformulation in terms of operator-valued distributions generalizes to curved spaces just fine, and when you do it you get ""quantum field theory in curved spacetime"". And, it turns out, *that works just fine*. You do this and you get all sorts of fun results like Hawking radiation and the Unruh effect. However, there's a lingering problem. In order to do all this, we have to *first* specify a metric, and *then* write down the Lagrangian in terms of that metric. Then we can solve for the quantum field solutions, and everything's great. *Except*...those quantum fields interact. They carry energy around. In general, *stuff happens*. And that should *really* feed back in some sort of self-consistent manner. Remember, the metric is *dynamic* in that a change to the stress-energy tensor (which can be suitably quantized only in certain cases) should result in a change to the metric.  Unfortunately, when one tries to do that, even for reasonably small perturbations where we treat the Einstein field equation classically but use a quantum stress-energy tensor we get things like solutions for which the curvature diverges to infinity on Planck time scales.

And that's all just for a Klein-Gordon field. This can be generalized to other bosonic fields, but fermion fields present a new set of problems. Namely, the traditional formulations of the general theory of relativity in terms of the metric tensor can't handle fermionic matter. In order to do so, one has to reformulate the theory in such a way that the curvature tetrad is the fundamental object and then modify the equations appropriately.

**Conclusion**

In any case, the problem, as I've indicated, is in the back-reaction of the quantum field on the curvature. We can, and do, formulate quantum field theory in curved spacetimes; we just don't know how to make the curvature respond appropriately to those fields without getting nonsensical results.

For further reading on this, I would suggest Wald's ""*Quantum Field Theory in Curved Spacetime and Blackhole Thermodynamics*"" and Rovelli's ""*Quantum Gravity*"" (a loop quantum gravity textbook). If you want something more introductory on these topics, Mukhanov and Winitzki have ""*Introduction to Quantum Effects in Gravity*"" while Gambini and Pullin offer ""*A First Course in Loop Quantum Gravity*"". All of those texts deal with the problems encountered when trying to connect quantum field theory to relativity.

[edit]

**Alternative perspective**

There is another way to look at this, which is what people *usually* do when they discuss these problems, and I figure I should mention it. One can treat the tetrad field and the matter field as a classical field on a flat spacetime. Then one can attempt to perform canonical quantization on those fields. However, unlike traditional fields, which evolve in time, the tetrad field *determines time evolution*. In other words, what it means to ""evolve in time"" depends on what you mean by time, which depends on things like the timelike geodesics associate with the curvature field. This makes the associated quantization scheme highly nontrivial. However, if one decides to leave the curvature field classical while quantizing only the matter field, it reproduces the standard quantum field theory in curved spacetime that I discussed above (I believe the procedures are even formally equivalent).",0,1354760023,,0,1354781247,1,c7by1lx,t3_14cijk,t1_c7by1lx,t3_14cijk,,1430591591,8,False,askscience,t5_2qm4e,8

You turn the lights off in your house, and suddenly there is someone in the house with you. You are sure of it. In the back of your mind, you know this is preposterous, all the doors are locked, you haven't heard anything, but your brain insists that *there is someone in the house with you. You step only on every other staircase step, because this is going to help.


Nothing out of the ordinary has happened today. Suddenly, you feel *dirty*. You couldn't possibly stand the idea of letting your hands come in contact with yourself. You feel utterly vile and disgusting, and are sure everyone else can notice it too. To the washroom you go, to scrub until the feeling goes away.


Suddenly, you are struck by the idea that your SO is dead. They're in the room next door, reading a book. But your brain *refuses to believe that they are in fact still alive*. You start to physically react as if they were dead, bawling uncontrollably and shaking as you remember them, because now they're gone forever. Your brain is sure of this. 

Alternatively, as you get on the plane, you *know* it is going to crash. You can see it perfectly and can't stop thinking wbout it. You're like the guy from Final Destination. The catch is that you're wrong, but that doesn't stop your brain from flipping out on you. The worst part is that you need to go home. Every minute spent away from home is pure agony because there is ""stuff"" you think ""must be done, right now"". The bright side is that you'll never procrastinate, because every second that you have something that needs to be done and hasn't been is like living with a piano dangling above your head.

Level 1 is ""known"" because there are too many of them. 

Level 7 is ""known"" because of one guy, one thread. http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showpost.php?p=26540441&amp;postcount=1

----

&gt;What is less commonly known is that all the Max's Severed Heads had their histories wiped by Valve

False. Not *all*. Steam Support cleans duped Max's Head from the Nov 2011 exploit *only if* the ""victim/owner"" submits a support ticket. Ref: http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showpost.php?p=29518631&amp;postcount=6 

Furthermore, there are still duped ones from that specific exploit that were not cleaned. Ref: http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/uj34u/psa_the_quality_of_tf2_data_grew_three_sizes_this/c4wl0k0?context=4

----

&gt;we can break down how many of each level exist and find out just how badly duped the Max's Severed Heads was during its duping heyday

Stats.tf does not count duplicate original_id. Ref: http://stats.tf/faq

""Only the latest one of these duplicate items will be counted based on the Original ID. ""

So your evidence cannot prove anything about the Nov 2011 exploit, which retains original_id. 

Even if an item of certain level was duped 100 times. Stats.tf will still show as 1. 

----

&gt;many level 1 Max Heads than average. This item at this level was duped so many times

Some time ago, most promo hats have random levels. Later on, Valve standardized the levels. For example, a bunch of Genuine is always Level 10, and another bunch was made to Level 1. 

Even before the end of the pre-ordering period of Sam &amp; Max: The Devil's Playhouse, considerable amount of Level 1 Max's Head were issued. This was caused by the promo granting system. 

The new Level 1 Max's Head (with 800,000,000 original_id or above) are from recent activation of Steam Pre-Order Key. Someone must have managed to crack the pre-order codes, or found the codes somewhere. Most of the time, they use shell account, activate the game, and immediately visit Outpost, or just dump to Warehouse. I saw those accounts with my eyes.

Literally the only thing that had anything which is reminiscent at ALL of Star Trek in that entire trailer is their combadges. The rest of it may have well all been from any movie about anything at all other than Star Trek.

Star Trek has always been a patiently-paced and thoughtful speculation about the possibilities of intergalactic exploration, interaction with new and entirely different alien cultures, focusing on the surrounding diplomatic, social, political, ethical and moral dilemmas of it all.

That shit was just (BWAHHHHHHH), GIANT OBJECTS CRASHING INTO THINGS! (BWAAAAAH), SUPERHUMAN STRENGTH GUY FIGHT SCENE! (BWAHHHHHHH), CHAOS AND PANIC IN THE STREETS! (BWAAAAHHHH) MAIN CHARACTERS IN DIRE SITUATIONS AND LOOKING DISTRESSED! So much trite, typical latest-generation-action-movie bullshit.

As a fan of what Star Trek has always been, I'm pretty disgusted. If I wanted to watch Michael Bay's latest puddle-deep cookie-cutter Transformers-clone appeal to the lowest common denominator, I sure as hell wouldn't be looking for it in the STAR TREK franchise.

Really?), to have realized that was necessary.

True,[deleted],,,"A gray sweater will work with any shirt.  That should be a wardrobe staple.  A navy blue sweater will work with most shirts.  That should be your other sweater staple.

Crew neck vs V neck.  I like them both.  V necks are nicer when you wear a tie.  For crew neck you want to make sure the shirt collar fits you really well so it doesnt freak out when it gets held down by the sweater collar.  I tend to wear my crew neck sweaters more with only T shirts.

The majority of sweaters are solid color.  So just pick the colors you like.

Some sweaters have patterns on them like fair isle prints or argyle.  The key with those is to pair them with solid shirts.  You can't mess that up.

Other than that, it's really up to you which colors to match.  You can do a navy blue sweater with shirt A and look great.  Personally I try to avoid when picking colors that match up with local sports teams.  I also avoid blatant red/white/blue combos to avoid looking overly-patriotic.",0,1354810447,,0,False,1,c7c7em6,t3_14dy7k,t1_c7c7em6,t3_14dy7k,,1430596067,28,False,malefashionadvice,t5_2r65t,28

True,tanpopo77,,,"Most people CAN afford it, they just refuse to give up ANY of their own creature comforts (even briefly) all for the comfort of a small creature. All you have to do is tighten the belt for about a month. You know that sixer of PBR you were planning on buying? Save it. That pizza you were going to get this Friday? Eat Ramen. Save every extra penny you were going to spend on yourself for a couple of weeks.

A few years ago, I fell on hard and desperate times. After losing my professional employment, where I made bank, I waited tables for two years, and as I'm sure we all know, when you work in a not-so-reputable restaurant, the tips aren't nearly what they would be, if you worked in a nice place. I could barely afford to feed myself, much less have internet, cable, etc. I let every extra thing go, and that's way harder than it sounds. But, when you and your beloved dog and two cats are starving to death, you make it happen.

You have to actually commit to it. You can't say, ""Well, gee willikers! I can't afford that!,"" then go pick up dinner at McDonald's. If you can afford to eat out, you can afford to fucking get your pets fixed. You also can't get pissed off when they head back out there to bang again. If it's what we as people do, and we have consciences, you cannot seriously expect an unaltered animal to not do the same thing.

Say what you want, but after working with animals for MOST of my life, I can GIVE YOU SCIENCE that altered animals are MUCH happier than unaltered ones. They don't ""need a chance to fuck."" It doesn't make them ""less of a male/cat/dog,"" and if you think that, you're a really ignorant person and have NO BUSINESS having a pet. You're not ""taking away their rights."" And, in altering thousands upon thousands of animals, we STILL won't ever ""run out of animals."" Domestic animals run rampant, and for forever, we're still going to have morons who make the above ludicrous claims and refuse to get their pets fixed. WE WILL NEVER RUN OUT OF ANIMALS WHO NEED TO BE FIXED.

The long and short of it is once your pet is of age, get that shit fixed. If you need help, then fucking ask for it. For someone who doesn't get their pet fixed, all they're doing is perpetuating the suffering and the misery. I won't even elaborate, because you all know what I'm talking about.

It's different for each person, but she might have things that 'set her off' so to speak. Things that bring it rushing back. When that happens just remember to be gentle, and dont push anything. Go by the way she reacts, she might need a bear hug and protection, she might need to be alone and un-touched for a little while.

True,kerrywatson,,,"It's like you're arguing a voice in your head but not actually debating anything that has to do with feminism. A quick google search is recommended before you keep posting statistics.

* Domestic Violence

55/45% is bullshit. It's a feminist issue because:

""Women are more likely than men to be murdered by an intimate partner. Of those killed by an intimate partner about three quarters are female and about a quarter are male. In 1999 in the United States 1,218 women and 424 men were killed by an intimate partner,[125] and 1181 females and 329 males were killed by their intimate partners in 2005"". 

Also, 

""78% of female survivors are assaulted by someone they know and 58% of female homicide victims are murdered by a family member"".

Patrocentricity creates a culture of violence, that's why it's a feminist issue. Domestic violence can occur in any relationship, feminism does not imply that only women are victimized, it critiques the culture of violence.

* Sexual Assault

The double standards you're referring to do exist, but do not mean that all feminist thought goes out the window. First of all, violence against women is always more prevalent in society, be it in the media, in prejudicial law-making, in the workplace, or in the home. This does not imply that it doesn't happen to men either. The reason there is a social stigma against men reporting sexual assault or domestic violence is because of the patriarchal culture we live in, it's a double edged sword and doesn't help either gender. The reason men feel more inclined to violence over women than vice versa is the same reason men are ridiculed (sometimes by ""feminists"" who don't realize their hypocrisy) for reporting it against themselves.

* Genital Mutilation

So, because people agree that genital mutilation is bad, it's not a feminist issue anymore? Oh right because feminists can only be wrong about things, I forgot. The world outside of the western world still exists. You explicitly asked for issues that weren't first world problems, and your problem with this is that it doesn't occur in the first world. Right.

* Abortion

It seems you're implying abortion is a non-issue today. That is incorrect.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_law

Feminist issue, political decisions made mostly by males governing a woman's bodily health, still debated today and still illegal or unsafe in many parts of the world. Can't make it any more clear.

* Employment Prejudice

You can't ignore history, this was one of the most important early-feminist issues, would you call it a first-world problem? And what about parts of the world where women still aren't allowed a full education, much less the same work opportunities. Still a first-world problem? And I'm not referring to conspiracy, I'm referring to the documented glass ceiling, and you would be hard-pressed to prove it doesn't exist.

* Reproductive Rights

No, I mean reproductive rights. Sorry if that wasn't clear, I'll give you another chance to come up with an argument.

True,[deleted],,," Many natural procrastinators I know (including myself, and much of Reddit) are people who are praised for their intelligence, and misinterpret that as a sign that they don't need to have structure for their brain's daily activities, and don't need to give it the proper respect and exercise that it requires and deserves. So they neglect it - let it run wild on the internet, gorge itself on Reddit and Facebook and porn and games (the mental equivalent of junk food and jerking off), and allow it to lapse into a vicious cycle of unaccountable information binging and inevitable self loathing. 

Your brain adapts to, and then perpetuates, the habits to which it is constantly exposed. That fact doesn't work in your favor right now, but you can change that. My suggestions:

**1) Structure your time.**  By scheduling your daily activities, you provide a motivation to be present and diligent for your responsibilities. Plus, this will discourage the huge, unhealthy blocks of surf time that arise when you don't plan your time out ahead. As far as skill acquisition like studying goes, I recommend time management methods like the [Pomodoro Technique](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) to give your brain a healthy routine length. You may also want to invest in a timer, or a program that acts like one, so you can monitor how much time you're actually spending plugged in, and hold yourself accountable for it in the future.

This tip also extends to structuring your sleep schedule. I assume you're in college, and there's always fun stuff like parties and dorm CoD seshes and recreational drug use happening at any given time in college. Even if not, there's always the internet. Learn to pull the plug, even when you don't feel like you want to stop, and get your 6-8 hours a night. It does wonders for your self-control, self-image, and your presence in real life as opposed to inside your head.

**2) Figure out why you procrastinate.** Procrastination is a type of [experiential avoidance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiential_avoidance) that causes itself through an unwillingness to feel uncomfortable emotions, or be in unpleasant situations, even at personal detriment. I personally was an internet/League of Legends addict because I wanted to avoid confronting my anxiety, low self-esteem, and feelings of helplessness, and losing myself in my laptop provided an avenue where I could feel 'in control'. It's different for everyone, but this attitude is rather common nowadays. You owe it to yourself to be honest about what it is you're procrastinating from, and why you fell into the habit. It may take some reflection.

**3) Learn to tolerate, or even enjoy, putting time and effort into your work.** Many Redditors, and internet users in general, have been conditioned into believing that truly intelligent people don't need to work hard at what they do. I was one such dumbfuck, and since I breezed through my AP science courses in high school, I deluded myself into thinking I didn't need to study for anything, and that cramming was enough. Then college-level Organic Chemistry came along and punched me in the face. 

You may, presently, also believe that you are smart enough not to study. Don't kid yourself anymore. That's your brain talking, spoiled by lack of discipline and fattened up on trivia that it'll never need to use, trying to sweet-talk you into not eating broccoli and having ice cream instead. You've got to be a tough-love parent, and make sure your kid eats his vegetables.

**4) Incentivize your productivity. You are your own RPG hero.** Procrastinators have a problem with delaying gratification. Technology addicts, specifically, are driven to surf by the easy 'accomplishment' feeling from learning tidbits of Avatar or My Little Pony trivia, or perfecting their last-hitting in LoL, or racking up no-scopes in CoD.  This is an easier way for your brain to create and savor small hits of dopamine than confronting real-life responsibilities -responsibilities that are harder, more time-consuming, and that give less obvious, more ambiguous rewards.  

You can combat this addiction by substituting it. Many recovering procrastinators come to see themselves as their own RPG player-character, their own Tamagotchi or Sim or Pocket Pikachu. Doing practice problems? EXP into your INT stat. Gym time? Boosting your STR. Going to networking events for your major, socializing with professionals in your desired career? Major levels in Charisma, with points into a possible class change in the future.

Personally, I'm not totally absorbed into that style of discipline. But I *did* borrow an idea from the Pomodoro Technique and DDR, which is combo chains. Every day that I accomplish a general task (studying, exercise, writing in a journal, not looking at porn, etc.) is a link on the chain I drew on my whiteboard, while missing a day erases the chain. I want those suckers to get too long to fit on the board.

The main thing about this mindset is that you need to invest in your personal development in terms that your tech-addicted brain is already familiar with. Think about this - if you were playing the Sims, and your Sim self needed to go to work but was playing computer games instead, would you let him stay at his laptop? HELL NO.

**5) You are not going to like the change in lifestyle. It is going to feel like shit. Accept it and power through it anyway.** The emotions that an addict suffers through while quitting are sweet siren calls, seductively beseeching you to slam your ship into the rocks. Your brain is used to the habits. It likes the habits. It doesn't want you to stop. It will present you with thoughts that tempt you to break your combo and forsake your willpower.

You are not your habits. You are not your thoughts. They are the many drops of water in the ocean that you are sailing in. The waters may be stormy and fickle, and may, without the force of your will, push you into shipwreck after shipwreck. It may seem easier just to let your ship be tossed wherever the follies of your brain take it. But it is your duty to captain your ship, especially in harder waters, and wrest yourself back on course with gritted teeth and the knowledge that you are stronger than the storm.

**TL:DR - Get sleep, stop fapping your brain, organize yourself, it'll feel like shit but that's a good sign. Also [this infographic](http://i.imgur.com/sQt1Q.jpg).**",0,1354822883,,0,False,1,c7cb177,t3_14e9lt,t1_c7cb177,t3_14e9lt,,1430597928,28,False,IWantToLearn,t5_2rjo5,28

I think we're all in this together--gay, straight, atheist, Christian, Muslim, whatever--and we all need to realize that this world would be a better place if we just helped one another.

I'm happy that because of a gesture so small on my part, OP's kids will now have water at least until the new year. And I hope he pays it forward when the time comes that he is able to.

True,ohgodmyface,laa,Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim,"The World Series Champion Houston Astros owe their victory to a pair of snafus that popped up during their inaugural season in the American League. Firstly, previously unnoticed wording made qualification for the second Wild Card spot based on win count, as opposed to win percentage. Normally, such an oversight would not be an issue, except that the Houston Astros were accidentally scheduled for full seasons in both the American and National Leagues in 2013.

The 2013 Astros stormed into both leagues' Wild Card spots with 105 wins, despite having 219 losses, 6 of which were accrued when Houston managed to be swept by itself during an interleague series. The National League Astros were knocked out in the Division Series by the Reds, only to face them as AL Champs in the World Series and best them in 6 games.

Statheads were up in arms over the BBWAA's Award selections, naming Bud Norris as the AL Cy Young for his 23 win, 407 inning, 341 K season, in spite of 35 losses and a 5.13 ERA. Similarly, Justin Maxwell's 68 home run, 184 RBI, 382 K campaign netted him the NL MVP.

The “pay gap” is probably the most widely-cited example of supposed disadvantages faced by women today. It is also totally misleading, as it is only a snapshot of average yearly full-time incomes that does not account for overtime (about 90% male), type of work, or other non-discriminatory, voluntary factors.

Young women now earn more than men in UK

The only chairwoman in the FTSE 100 index of biggest British companies, when asked about government efforts to force companies to make at least 25% of board member to be female said: ""there's no real evidence to suggest women being on a board makes the companies any better – what we're doing here is forcing an experiment.""

This was further supported in the book “Why Men Earn More"" by Warren Farrell, Ph.D., examined 25 career/life choices men and women make (hours, commute times, etc.) that lead to men earning more and women having more balanced lives, and that showed how men in surveys prioritize money while women prioritize flexibility, shorter hours, shorter commutes, less physical risk and other factors conducive to their choice to be primary parents, an option men still largely don’t have. That is why never-married childless women outearn their male counterparts, and female corporate directors now outearn their male counterparts.

http://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idUSN0752118220071107?feedTy…

Farrell also lists dozens of careers, including fields of science, where women outearn men. Women simply have more options than men to be primary parents, and many of them exercise that option rather than work long, stressful hours. That is why 57% of female graduates of Stanford and Harvard left the workforce within 15 years of entry into the workforce.

http://edition.cnn.com/2005/BUSINESS/03/15/optout.revolution/

This is an option few men have (try being a single male and telling women on the first date that you want to stay home).

Blaming men for women’s choices is unfair. In fact research shows most men have no problem with their wives outearning them.

Research also shows most working dads would quit or take a pay cut to spend more time with kids if their spouses could support the family.

http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/Careers/06/13/dads.work/index.html

Research also shows that parents share workloads more when mothers allow men to be primary parents.

There is also the myth that women are kept out of certain more lucrative fields by sexism. The truth is that women stay away from math out of their own free choice

True,cycostinkoman,,,"I just shared my worst creeper story, but here's my best creeper story. Where I'm the creeper.

I see this cute girl at my college in a Sonic the Hedgehog t-shirt. Since Sonic Adventure 2 was the greatest game of my childhood, I noticed her quite quickly. I slowly became obsessed with her, despite knowing nothing about her. I would sit in the school cafeteria and wait for her, and when she was in I would secretly watch her. I picked up on a lot of the silly things she would do, like wrapping her cup in napkins before leaving, and how she would always get the hot chocolate. She was really quiet and rarely sat or talked with other people. I memorized her backpack, mouse, computer, etc. I would always try to sit somewhat close to her to learn more. I could not find her on facebook for the longest time, though. So her name to me, and when talking about her to my friends, was ""Sonic Girl"".

A lot of small but memorable events happen, that if happened with someone else would be forgotten within minutes. Things like almost walking into her, and saying ""oh sorry"" or ""oh excuse me"" (these were the only words spoken between us). Standing next to her to get a drink at the pop machine. I became more and more obsessed, and I would even go to events on campus in hopes of seeing her. I remember one time they were showing Tron, and I went in hopes of seeing her. There she was, on the bench outside of the doors. We sit on opposite sides of the room, but she gets popcorn (that's located at my side) at one point. 

One day at the cafeteria I am sitting somewhat close to her as usual (we have restaurant seating, so the individual tables make it weird to sit next to someone you don't now), and she is with some friends. I listen in, and she calls two of them that looked like a couple by name. I look for the names on facebook, hoping to find a couple with the same names. I finally find the people she was sitting with, so I go through the friends list of one of them. I have done this before while trying to find her facebook, going through the friends list of someone, bringing up all possibilities, and checking if they're her...but this time I found someone I knew she knew. I finally find her, but everything is private. Well, at least I have her name now, and I begin my internet creeping. I don't find much at all. When I tell a friend who she is, we find that my friend knows someone that is on her friends list. So my friend borrows this other friends computer for ""printing"" or some bs excuse, just to look at her facebook. I wanted to know dealbreaker details about her, like her religion and if she has a boyfriend. She's single, and we're both Christian so everything looks perfect. The only thing is, I find out this is her last semester before she graduates.

Now to get up the nerve to talk to her. I spent many hours in the cafeteria working up the guts to say something, to sit next to her, anything. I chicken out every time. On the LAST day of the semester, I'm sitting in the cafeteria waiting. After a while, in she comes, and sits down in her usual seat by the window. I know it's my last shot, but I'm nervous as heck. I'm horrible at talking to people I already know, let alone her, but I knew that I had to do it that day. I get up, walk over, and stammer out something like ""hey, mind if I sit here? I've seen you around and figured I'm come say hi""

So we talk, and things are going really well. We add eachother on facebook while there, and we're making nice conversation. We end up talking until the cafeteria closes, and we agree that we should hang out over the summer. We do, and things go really well. We get ice cream, hang out at her place, in a town midway between our houses, etc. I eventually ask her to be my girlfriend and she accepts. AWESOME! 

So after dating for a few months the truth comes out that she was creeping on me as well. She remembers all of the small interactions we had, and she actually found my facebook way before I found hers. She went to the Tron showing to see me, and I went to see her, and we never said a word to each other. She got the popcorn because I was on that side of the room, as well. She would check up on my facebook multiple times a day, or in some cases many times an hour. Even the last day when I finally talked to her, she only went to the cafeteria because her roommate told her that I was sitting in there. 
We've been dating for about a year and a half now and things are great!

True,thedancingj,,_Bikram and more,"I teach hot yoga too, and this issue comes up periodically. Here is a GREAT answer that was posted to another group I belong to. This comes from a health care practitioner:

""Having worked in ED for 20 years I would never initiate a conversation with an ED as a yoga teacher. To start with the people who are most at risk to drop dead from a class are in fact not the anorexics but the bulimics (due to the loss of potassium from vomiting) and they are impossible to detect because many of them are at normal or higher weight. I have seen several anorexics recover from simply doing their yoga and being in a supportive environment. They have plenty of people telling them that they are too skinny so this is not news to them I can assure you. The support and acceptance is more importance than the constant reminder that they are different. If they are really in the middle of the ED they are more likely to perceive the interference as jealousy. In 20 years I have only heard one person tell me that this intervention was helpful the overwhelming report has been that it has been exactly the opposite. It is particularly unhelpful for people to tell them that they are looking good, better, or nice if and when they do gain weight.
""Often when people are motivated to speak with someone it is because they are uncomfortable with having this person in their class and I would suggest that they process this in the same way that they process this issue with anyone else - look at what this means to you - what are your feelings telling you about yourself and your beliefs about yourself and the world around you. I am aware that they do have some concern for the person but let's be honest we encourage people who are very over weight to do the practice. We tell them to go at their own pace and to take breaks when they need too - they are often just as much at risk as an anorexic why should we be telling people at the other end of the continuum anything different - we either believe in the yoga or not."" 

Basically be as supportive as possible, and NO body comments. Keep an eye on her and just say, ""Hello,"" ""Great to see you,"" ""Have a good class,"" ""Good job today."" ",0,1354850380,,0,False,1,c7cj0gm,t3_14e3d5,t1_c7cj0gm,t3_14e3d5,,1430602110,12,False,yoga,t5_2qhq6,12

And tell you why my eggs are upside down next to my beer. 

In western America, born and raised

In the kitchen is where I ate most of my eggs

Sippin and drinking my good Old Chub, 

Grabbing my knife to cut up my grub

When a girl from Sydney said she wanted some food

So I showed her to the fridge like a normal dude

She flipped out cause everything was right side up

She said ""Oh my god, make it right or you'll be fucked""

So I grabbed each item, Eggs, beer, milk 

I even tried the ham but it just wouldn't stay still 

If anything, I thought it wouldn't be hard

But it was, so forget it. This bitch can eat lard!

She. Came. Up to the fridge to slice her some cheese

She said ""fix the ham"" and I said ""BITCH PLEASE!""

True,Quo_Usque,,,"Reddit Saves Christmas

Twas early December, with snow on the ground

the month of good cheer, christmas spirit abounds,

but joy and good cheer skipped a house that year,

the house of ProZacDose was gloomy and dreer.


He had four young children, whom he loved very much,

but ProZacDose had no job, he'd hit a rough spot.

The bills up were piling, he had no more credit,

in a burst of frustration, he posted on Reddit.

“I've got to get this off of my chest!” He said,

“My kids deserve the very best!

I have failed them! And now, for Christmas, they'll have

neither water, nor light, nor gifts- this is bad!”


But Reddit was feeling somewhat human that day,

and Girlinthecity cried out- “I will pay!

I'll pay for your water, you deserve some assistance!

PM me, I'll see that your family gets Christmas!”

And with that act of kindness, the ball started rolling.

And once it got going, it kept growing and growing.


Illaqueable said, “I'll help with the power!”

GeorgeNorfolk said “Me too! This guy's one of ours!

We can all afford to give just a bit

to help a fellow human who's life's gone to shit!”


“Come on guys, we've got it, Redditors,  we're close!

Let's save Christmas for our friend, ProZacDose!”

They paid all his bills, and much more besides,

(as of right now, the indiegogo's splitting its sides!)

And Mr. TrashedTalker discovered he lived

not half an hour from ProZacDose and his kids.

He offered, in the most gentlemanly style,

to buy them a tree, to go with their gift pile.


Four children, and one dad, this year will get

a Christmas they will never, ever forget.

Thanks to the friendly strangers on Reddit,

and simple human generosity that no distance can edit.


ProZacDose is inundated with your generosity,

and now he's giving to others, just like Girlinthecity.

So one act of kindness can touch many hundreds,

Even though from each other we're sundered.

Across hundreds of miles, and through wires and tubes,

the spirit of Humanity just helped save this dude.

This generosity shown to complete strangers shows

the Internet is better the more that it grows.

It connects different people from all over the land-

and let Reddit save Christmas for one lucky man.

.

EDIT: The internet is still just amazing

True,Spongi,,,"It was a mutual thing.   I didn't really choose him, he choose me.   At that point I had worked with probably well over 500 dogs and had managed to keep it unpersonal.   

 So one day this study comes up.  They were always coming and going so nothing unusual here.   Something goes wrong with the study and whatever it was they were testing, all I know was it was a neurological drug was epic fail.   They were doing the range finder part (buddy was part of that) and the goal of the range finder is to find out how much of the drug it takes to kill the animals and base the doses off of that.   

So they go to do the range finder and accidentally give the dogs 10 times too much.  Not only does it not hurt them, their bodies filter the drug out of their system in minutes.  That's practically unheard of.  So they up the dosage another 10x (100x total now) and try again.  Same results.  So even if the drug did what it was supposed to, it lasting like 4 minutes would be worthless so they just scrapped the whole thing.   

That was highly unusual and to my knowledge only happened once in 2 years.    

So I end up playing babysitter in this room of dogs for a few weeks.   Spent a couple hours a day in there on average.    One of my jobs was to 'exercise' the dogs.  This meant they got to get out 3 times a week for 15 minutes.   Typically when you let them out they just wanted to run around and be puppies.  Didn't want much to do with you as they got 2 days worth of fun to get out in 15 minutes.   

One day I randomly picked up one of the dogs which i did once in awhile and held him in my lap.  Most of the time they'd be cool with this for like 10 seconds and then want to run and play.  This dog though, he loved it.   Totally ate it up.   Then after I set him down, he just sat there and pawed at me to pick him back up.  Trying to be unattached I tried to ignore it and was successful for a few days.  But he'd literally just sit there the entire time and paw me to pick him up.  Then when I would he'd just fall asleep in my lap.    Didn't want to play with the other dogs or do normal dog stuff just wanted to sleep in my lap.  

So I end up just letting him stay in my lap the whole time.  Took 2-3 hours to exercise all the dogs and since they were being used on a study, a little fudging didn't matter.   

So we started to bond and I taught him some silly tricks and one day the stress of the job just really got to me, bout had a breakdown.  I ended up back in that room just talking to this dog and sharing crackers with him.     

So this goes on for awhile. I know I'm fucked as he's fucked and it's gonna kill me.   Then one of those 'what the fuck' studies came up and they were scheduled to be on it.    Not only a what the fuck study but THE single worst study I'd seen there.   I knew he was literally going to be tortured to death and I couldn't deal with it.   

So I went to the head of the study and requested to adopt the one dog and even offered to reimburse the company (looking at an easily $1k) which was like 3 weeks pay for me.  She was a bitch though and didn't care much for me.   So she no and they'd already had the paperwork filled out and whatnot.   

So here's the thing. I knew it was against federal law to use the same animals in two different studies.  Huge fine, huge deal.   So she had somehow forgot that those 4 animals had already been 'used' but had signed them up to be used again.    So that's when I played my ace in the hole and basically blackmailed her into signing off on it.   

I got mysteriously fired a month or two later and it was the happiest day of my life, well second to taking 'buddy' home.

True,sumchinesewill,,,"Not really a missing person per se but one night after leaving the gym on my way home I saw this old Asian man wandering along this empty street. It was around 3 AM and it's really odd that some old man is just walking around alone. I made a u turn and drove next to the old man and asked if everything was ok. He had this really freaked out look on his face. He said ""Chinese"" and I responded with ""yes I can speak Chinese"" in uh Chinese. He said that he was lost and had no idea where he is. I told him to hop in and I'll see if I can help. I asked him where he lived and he said something in Chinese to me but I didn't know the Chinese names to the districts in the city. I asked him to let me take a look at his wallet and I found his ID. I saw the address and I was surprised. He lives basically on the other side of the city across the freeway. I drove to the address listed on his id and let him off. He thanked me and kept saying that he wouldn't know what to do if I hadn't helped him. He opened the door and went into his house. Before I could drive off, a young woman emerges from the door the old man went into. She walks up to my car and asks if I was the one who brought her grandpa home. I said yes. She started crying and said he had been missing for almost a full day and thanked me for returning him home safely. 

The old man had apparently fallen asleep on the bus on his way home. The bus dropped him off at the last stop which was in another city. He was suppose to get off at the last stop before the bus hopped on the freeway. Since he couldn't speak English, he couldn't tell the bus driver that he doesn't know where he was at. He was scared to wave down police and to ask random people for help so he just picked a direction and started walking and hoping he would see something familiar or someone he knew. He got tired and fell asleep on a bench inside someone's yard. He woke up and continued walking until I picked him up and returned him home. He was actually walking the complete opposite direction from his house. Needless to say I felt really good that night and ate some pie. 

tl;dr. Helped an old Asia man back home who had been supposedly missing for 24 hours.

Edit: For the people who is wondering why I was at the gym at 3 AM. I worked at a shipping company and worked crazy long hours during the holiday seasons or the beginning of the holiday seasons. I got off work at around 11 PM after working a 14 hour shift. I did not want to miss a day at the gym because it was biceps and back day and chicks dig biceps and back muscles. So I went to the gym at around midnight that was opened 24 hours called well....""24 hours fitness"".

True,ayeaye,,,"Having experienced and seen depression up close (I've walked in on my brother trying to hang himself, held down my mother in the back seat of our car on our way back to the hospital to stop her from kicking out the car windows due to her anxiety, watched my dad for 1.5 years unable to get out of the bed, and also had some pretty intense and persistent anxiety myself for the last 15 years), I must say you don't have the full picture (that sounded a bit dramatic :)). Neither do I by the way, as I luckily haven't suffered from really severe depression myself, but I think I have some perspective on the issue. Its an understandable comment to make though as I can remember my brother saying the exact same thing before he got sick for the first time.

Suicidal depression is neither a problem in the traditional sense, nor temporary when it comes to the experience of the person suffering from it. Suicide comes in to play when your mind has exhausted all possible ideas of a better future (your mind is unable imagine anything better) and the pain is so suffocating that you don't care about anything else but stopping it. Its a vicious trap because the imagination needed to produce any hope and better experiences is suffocated by the pain (imagine trying to do anything productive with a severe tooth ache). Depression can be triggered by some solvable real life problem, but in severe depression the real problem is the pain itself. It creates a deep dark hole, puts you in it and takes away the tools to get out of it.

For anyone who's suffering from depression and reading this, there is hope though. Even if the depressed person can't imagine a positive outcome, a calm, patient and understanding person can really help with coming up with more hopeful ways of seeing things. Cognitive behavioral therapy combined with meditation has helped a lot in my case. My mother and brother, having exhausted all other forms of treatment, received electro shock therapy and man, despite its image problems that treatment is just pure magic (at least in their case). Highly recommended. Both recovered fully in couple of months. My father got out of his depression as well with help of traditional therapy and medication. So from from a person who's seen some depression, it really is a crappy and painful thing that many people don't understand, but there are ways of getting out of it, even if you can't imagine any of them right now.

(*) To anyone still reading this. My positive view on ECT is based on my own experiences. It brought my mother and brother back from such a dark place that its difficult not to say positive things about it. But my praise for it is based completely on the feeling of relieve that I've gotten seeing my mother and brother get better, not any actual medical knowledge or experience. So please don't take it as medical advice, but as single person's experience. Your doctor will definitely give more accurate information and advice about the treatment.

True,Joyjoyfruits,,,"I am an ICU nurse and got a very interesting patient one day. She had been running in mid-day 100+ June heat in Houston and had suffered a MASSIVE stroke. It was unclear how long she had been unconscious before she was found. On her person was only a house key safety pinned in her sock. Many of my coworkers assumed she was homeless but I knew immediately that couldn't be true. She had gorgeous flawless skin and amazing dreadlocks, not matted messy dreads but lovely long cared for dreaddies as well as some pretty gorgeous ink. Plus I don't know too many homeless people who run regularly. As days turned into weeks it became obvious my Jane Doe was dying. She had uttered only one sound when she was found originally before never waking again ""Stephenson"". My opinion was that must be her name. The thing is privacy laws (HIPAA) had my hands tied. Finding her family before he died would be difficult. So I put my nursing license on the line and called the local police and described my beautiful Jane Doe. No reports matched her. The next day I guess the cop I spoke to was haunted as well by this quest to identify a dying woman and sent me a picture of a missing woman who was reported later that day, after I had called. It was my Jane Doe. I called administration and they weren't sure, but they thought it might still be against HIPAA to identify her. Screw a nursing license. If HIPAA meant I couldn't reunite a dying woman with her family, then I didn't care to follow it. I positively ID'd her and her family came. All she had was her son and ex-husband. Her son had been at football camp for a month and returned to no one waiting for his bus, no mom at home. His name was Stephen. She wasn't saying ""Stephenson"", she was saying ""My son, Stephen"" 
She died two days later. As it turned out, she was a devout Buddhist and the day she died, monks in orange robes carried her body out. Stephen thanked me for giving him the chance to say goodbye.

True,Lonelan,,,"Nintendo: adding a touch screen to their controllers since they saw sega add an LCD to the dreamcast

I think nintendo and sega were having an interesting race back in the 90s. and then sony showed up and even though he had just started, god damn was he fast. sega was like 'fuck this shit' and bailed. nintendo kept going in the same direction. meanwhile, sony kept running on the beaten path and was joined by microsoft who, while they had an amazing running outfit and a set of pretty nice shoes, started out doing the moonwalk instead of running. sony stopped to laugh for so long that microsoft eventually caught up, and wiping a tear from his eye, sony decided to keep on after microsoft. after a little while they were like, ""wtf, where'd nintendo go?"" and they turned around went back to where nintendo broke off of the main race. they watched nintendo doing parkour through a kid's playground and said to each other, ""you know, he's been doing this a lot longer than us, this is probably part of the race"" and they both joined in for a while. nintendo, ecstatic that he was in the race again, said, ""HEY CHECK THIS OUT GUYS"", climbed the monkey bars, AND STARTED SPRINTING BACK AND FORTH ACROSS THE 10 FOOT TALL MONKEY BARS.

True,mattaugamer,,,"English is a funny language. It has half a dozen words for there not being a lot of light, but only one word for ""love"". We use the same word for ""I love lamp!"" as we do for ""I want to be with this person forever"". It leads to some pretty strange conversations where we're saying ""I love you... but I'm not... in love with you.""

Because we're really talking about multiple different things. Greek has more words for love. Phileo, brotherly love. You can say to a mate ""I love you"" and have them say ""Yeah, you too"" instead of ""dude, I'm really not comfortable with that"" because you only have one word.

There are others - storge: sort of... affection. generally a familial love, but also old friends, old couples. Eros: passion, desire.

But the one that the bible refers to the most is Agape. When the bible says ""God is love"" or when Paul talks about ""love is not cruel, etc"" the word is Agape. Agape is most like what we would call ""love"". It's an unconditional love. A close friendship, a lover. Paul actually describes it pretty well.

Moving on... Love. Well, let's be honest, love is a pretty well understood thing, from a biological point of view. Hormones and pheromones and good genetic compatibility and all of that.

I find it fascinating that theists (especially) so often want to split things apart. You ask 

&gt; is it the result of a symbiotic relationship giving us a survival advantage? Or something more?

Honestly, can't it be both? Are these two things mutually exclusive? I would argue that they're not.

Please don't think that atheism is a desire to strip the world of poetry and beauty, to lay the world stark and cold and real and lifeless. A rose by any other name would smell as sweet. Understanding how the rose petals form, understanding what makes the bloom open at certain times, understanding the nature and content of the perfume... if anything that just adds to the beauty.

To me, and sorry for getting off topic, but it's 3am here, so maybe I'm rambling, the most beautiful and amazing things I've felt in my life, the things that truly touched and inspired me were things that were true. The first time I learned about the way nuclear fusion burns materials down in stars, forming heavier materials until the star collapses, and an unthinkably large explosion creates further elements spraying the rich materials back into the universe... How is that NOT beautiful? How is that not poetic? Does knowing that's what is happening make a single star shine less brightly in the sky? Does knowing that mean a person can't look up and say ""Look, it's orion's belt"". No. It doesn't. It doesn't detract in any way from a poetical, metaphorical view of the world. It just adds another layer, possibly more profound and surreal.

In very overdue conclusion: the understanding, the knowledge, that love is a complex series of chemical and emotional triggers does not make it any less real or meaningful. Whether we're ""programmed"" to care or care for some fabricated metaphysical reason makes no difference.

True,ls1z28chris,,,"I don't understand why this is a difficult concept to grasp. We have an example of this in the American military. The Marine Corps prides itself in its warrior ethos and focus on being battle oriented. ""Every Marine is a rifleman."" Every single enlisted Marine, whether cook, supply clerk, intelligence analyst, or bulk fuel specialist, is trained to be a basic rifleman in an infantry platoon. Every single Marine officer is trained to be an infantry platoon commander.

So they build a strong warrior culture around the notion that everyone is a rifleman and expected to be able to perform the duties of a warrior at a moment's notice, even if they are just a small cog in the vast machinery of the MAGTF. The glorious warriors in the ground combat element cannot honor their ancestors without the support of the command element, the logistics combat element, and the air combat element. Back in my day the ""logistics combat element"" was called combat service support. It was renamed in order to remind everyone of the vital importance of logistics when it comes to combat.

[As they say, third world generals study tactics and strategy. First world generals study logistics.](http://americanhistory.si.edu/westpoint/history_5b.html) This being something vital to the conduct of successful combat operations, there is honor in being a supply or admin clerk. And if you do not treat them with the respect appropriate for such honorable warriors, [you might find yourself getting your throat cut with a broken FEDLOG CD or getting garroted with a Cat-5 cable](http://www.duffelblog.com/2012/04/centcom-commander-general-mad-dog-mattis-set-to-retire/), because guess what, they're warriors first.

You should really read that last link that I provided. Duffel Blog is basically the military version of The Onion, but the story I linked speaks to this topic. It is a satirical story about General Mattis aka Mad Dog Mattis aka Chaos embracing retirement because, goddammit, being CENTCOM commander is not the same as being a glorious warrior engaging the enemy on the field of battle.

&gt;General Mattis, 62, is circumspect about his upcoming retirement. “I postponed my retirement to lead CENTCOM, but it’s just time to move on. Years ago I was called to serve my country by means of conferences and briefings, but I feel like, after forty years of that, I’ve done my duty.”

&gt;Mattis, pausing in a dead hang to speak with reporters during a set of weighted pull-ups, continued, “Now it’s time to admit that two hour update meetings are a young man’s game, hang it up, and live out my next sixty years as a private citizen back on the world’s battlefields, away from the constant stress of the office, like Al Gray would do.”

&gt;Mattis then effortlessly raised his chin above the bar, in spite of the thirty-five pound plate hanging from his dip belt.

He knows his duty is to his Corps and his country, so he agreed to take command of CENTCOM because he was the best man for the job. Yet he isn't exactly enamored of the work, because he would rather be on the battlefield sweating and fighting with the young warriors. And to prove he can still hang with the young napalm spitting Lance Criminals, he does a dead hang pull-up with a 35 lbs weight attached. Get some.

You know why this story is funny to Marines and Marine Corps veterans? If it came out tomorrow on CNN.com or BBC.com as a serious news story, we'd believe it. Anderson Cooper breaks from regular coverage to announce that General Mattis has choked someone to death with a Cat-5 cable, that being the only readily available instrument of death at his disposal, and I do not disbelieve the report. I accept it without hesitation, because in spite of him basically just being management, being an office worker reviewing PowerPoint slides and studying TTP, he is still a warrior. The lust for battle and honor still flows through his veins.

So look at this, and you can tell it directly applies to the Klingon Empire. The Empire needs you to provide logistics support to its glorious fleet doing battle against the Dominion and the evil Cardassians, so you put away your Bat'leth and pick up your Consolidated Memorandum Report. Why do you do this? For the Glory of the Empire. It is an honor to put aside your natural lust for the blood of your enemies in order to do a duty that is normally seen as less glorious than battle, as that takes discipline and a commitment to the cause. You are putting aside your own personal glory for the greater glorification of the Empire.

I mean, that is a major wall of text, but it seems pretty simple to me.

True,pseudolobster,,,"Here's a handy tip for understanding graphics cards model numbers:

eg: Geforce 670 or Radeon 7870

The first number is the generation. Basically the year it came out. 6xx is the current gen of Geforce, 7xxx is the current gen of Radeon.

The second number is the **most important**. This describes whether the card is a low range, mid range, or high performance card. A Geforce 610 is this year's shittiest card. It's new, but it's shitty. A Geforce 480 is two generations old, but it was one of the most expensive cards on the market in its day. A 480 will vastly outperform a 610, even though ""the number is bigger"". 

 Edit: Generally it goes like this: Low-end is x1x to x4x. Midrange is x5x through x6x (AMD often stretches midrange to x7xx cards), and x7x through x9x are high end cards. Current generations of low end cards can't play games newer than five years ago at decent settings. Current generations of midrange cards can play old games at ""ultra"" settings, new games at high settings. Current generations of high-end cards can play any game at any setting at 1080p resolution, and will be able to play near-future games at high settings, and semi-distant-future games at medium settings. Edit(edit): As a side-note, most times the highest-end card, the x9x, is a dual-GPU card. It's two video cards in one. This is considered to be excessive, and you only get an x9x card if you're bleeding money. For instance the Geforce 690 is about the same as two Geforce 670's, but in one card. This is often true of AMD boards too, but their numbers are a bit more confusing. Some generations, the x9xx is the dual-gpu card, other generations the xx9x is the dual-gpu card. This generation, the 79xx series seems to be actually a new card, should be called 8xxx, and their 7990 is a dual-gpu next-gen card.

The third number in Geforce cards is almost always 0, unless they're trying to squeeze in an extra card later on in the product lifecycle. The third number in Radeon cards is a 5 or a 7. These are the same card, only the 7 is from a higher bin, it's a better quality chip, and they usually unlock more cores and clock it at a higher frequency than the 50. Edit: This is sorta like a Geforce 660 vs a 660Ti. It's the same card, but the chip ""came out better"" and is capable of more. Edit: I've been corrected, that's a bad analogy, a 660ti is more like a neutered 670.

**So**, if you're trying to play a game from a couple years ago, and it says a ""Geforce 450 or better"" is required, that means a 550 or 650 will be fine, but a 530 or a 620 will likely not be, even though they're much newer cards, they're low end, not ""gaming"" cards.

Edit(edit(edit)): Final edit: PPS: PS: Older Nvidia cards had four digit model numbers (6400GT, 9800GTX, etc.) (and *even older* ATI cards used 4 digit models starting with 9000, but those are *ancient* and you shouldn't even *think* of playing games.)

It really is just an endearing character he plays.. he is a sharp, witty, extremely intelligent guy with quite a bit of personality. Personally, as horrible as some of his policies were, I kind of miss him, he was fun to make fun of all of his bushisms.. and EVERY form of media did. With O the media seems afraid to poke fun at him and defend his every whim as if he can do no wrong. Quite polar opposite effects despite the fact O is carrying on where Bush left off and doing virtually the same thing only under the guise of helping the poor or humanitarian aid.

True,Blend41,,,"In the 1990s I was managing the snowmaking department and supervised the crew for a popular ski resort. We worked 7pm - 7 am and by our first break (about 10pm) everything in our area was closed so you had to bring your lunch, snacks or anything else or you were up shit creek.

We had a new hire named Nino who was a huge Samoan guy. Nino was a damn hard worker when he wasn't drunk. He showed up several times completely trashed and I'd send him home. (employee housing which was within crawling distance) This really didn't bother me because we had a badass crew and the slack was easily picked up. 

Sometimes it was more trouble than it was worth having him there because of the crazy shit he would do. Once, he drained a water line that held about 7500 gallons right onto the middle of a popular intermediate run. It was 6am when I discovered the massive glacier he had created. I had to go get a grooming cat and attempt to break it up before we opened. I roped off the area and finished clearing the ice at about 11am, well after opening. I covered for his ass because I felt bad for him and told the hill manager that it was a busted hose that caused it. This was strike 1 for him.

Strike 2 was when he decided it would be ok to try clean the inside of every grooming cat interior with lemon pledge. Seats, hand controls and all, including the windows. It took 3 hours to clean up that waxy, hazy shit.

Strike 3 was one of the most WTF incidents I have ever seen in the workplace. Nino showed up for work sober for once but started asking if anyone had any food. He hasn't been to the store and had nothing in his shack in employee housing. At lunch (midnightish) he was nowhere to be found and didn't show up when the break was over. We chalked it up to him going somewhere to get drunk. 

At about 4am I'm the only snowmaker near the main lodge at the bottom of the mountain when I hear an explosion somewhere near one of the chairlifts. I head towards where I heard this explosion and it was not a pop. Or a bang. It was a window shattering, car alarm tripping explosion. As I near the area where I heard this blast come from I see the flashlights from the security guards waving in all directions. I get to the chairlift and see this large naked man covered in what looks like shit and blood is flowing from his face. As I dismount my snowmobile I realize its Nino. He's standing there naked and badly hurt. He starts screaming at me to help as he covers his face. There are fucking chili beans everywhere. I see the security guards running towards us and I'm on my radio with first aid getting the emts on the way. 

I'm trying to look at Nino and calm him down. His face is a mess of blood, glass chili beans and a corn chip shaped piece of sheet metal embedded in the side of his head. The security guys are here now and they're as bewildered as I am. We get Nino down to the day lodge deck where we lay him down on a rubber door mat. Emts show up and get him packaged for transport.

As I go to leave the day lodge I notice there are chili beans all over the place,  little clusters here and there, chili beans on the roof, windows and peppered all over the snow.  I follow the intensity of the bean blast to the main chairlift nearest the lodge. 

The ""lift shack"" which is the indoor control room for thar chairlift (for you non skiers/boaders out there) looks like it had been bombed. This isn't some old 1950s plywood lift shack either, this is a multi million dollar high speed quad ""lift shack"". The windows are gone. The door is hanging on by only it's lower hinge. Chili beans everywhere. And blood. It smelled like Taco Bell and burnt electronics. That fried amp smell, with cheese. The control panel is missing knobs and LCD panels are shattered. The 3x5"" aluminum window frame was blown out and laying on the ground  in the loading area of the lift. Whatever happened here was big. 

The lift was shut down until they could repair it. I went to visit Nino at a nearby hospital. He tells me it goes down like this: 

He was looking for food so He went to he lodge and found a can of chili beans by the kitchen loading dock. Nino couldn't get in to cook them so he decides to go to the liftshack and see if they had a microwave in there (which many did). His clothes were wet so He turned on the heater and hung his clothes up to get dry while He ate.
There wasn't a microwave in there but finds an old space heater. This was a 1970s exposed element (like a toaster) heater. I had used it myself hundreds of times in the past and it kicked ass. Well Nino turns the heater onto its back and places the 3 GALLON can of chili beans on it, apparently unopened.
Nino plops his naked ass into one of the chairs as his beans cook and his clothes dry.

Nino falls asleep.

Chili beans everywhere. He can't hear, his eyes are swollen shut and he has a piece of metal in his head. He then tells me he didn't know where he was or how he got there. He said he couldn't even remember who he was. Nino must have been out for a minute because it took me a couple to get to him and he was still in Narnia when I approached him that night. 

I didn't really have to fire him. I don't think I legally could under the circumstances anyways. Nino never came back. He left all his shit in his employee shack and didn't even come to pick up his last check.

TL:DR - Almost death by chili beans.

Snowmaker falls asleep naked in a lift shack with the heater on and a huge can of unopened chili beans on it. Chili beans explode and demolishes chairlift control room and almost kills naked snowmaker with shrapnel/concussion.

It's a really great sounding portable amp/DAC and I really love it together with other headphones, but sadly not with my Q701's. In my opinion it is too weak to drive them properly and they sound a bit tinny together. I also own a Little Dot MkIII, a $200 tube headphone amp, and this was not a very good match either. Too lifeless and lean sounding for my taste, although the clarity and details were among the best I've heard. But still... naaah.

There were some fingerprints on it but that was fine by me. :) Maybe you can look around a bit to see if you can find a good deal somewhere?

I guess the main question is what kind of source you are going to use.

True,SockPants,,,"Sure, below I've explained some more basics so that you hopefully actually know what you're doing. I got ~~a bit~~ hugely carried away, you don't have to read all of it if you're not interested.

^(*First I'd like to remind you that if you do certain things in the Terminal you can mess some stuff up. Only do something if you understand what it will do. I won't go anywhere near things where a typo can mess up your system in this post, but regardless.*)

The Automator part is pretty much a separate step from installing the [imguru](http://figbug.com/?page_id=29) tool. This is because I make Automator use imguru for the actual uploading part. Automator just does the automating part. So, let's start by getting the imguru tool. 

Unfortunately, imguru doesn't offer an actual app that is installed via a .dmg disk image, most likely because it isn't actually an app and works only from the command line (cli, shell, bash, Terminal all pretty much refer to the 'command line').

First a little bit about Terminal:
Open it up. You'll see your computer's name, followed by the folder you are in (usually ~), and then your username. You can now type commands. The ~ folder is your home folder, it's actually an abbreviation of /Users/&lt;username&gt;. Try the following command:

    pwd
Press enter. This should give you the 'absolute' path to the folder you are currently 'in' in this Terminal 'instance'. In my case, Terminal now looks like this:

    Last login: Sat Dec  8 19:28:24 on ttys000
    Jeroens-MacBook-Pro:~ jeroen$ pwd
    /Users/jeroen
    Jeroens-MacBook-Pro:~ jeroen$ 

The reason this works is because *pwd* is a binary program stored in a location where your 'shell' looks to find binary programs when you type a command. To find out where it's stored, you can use the *which* command with the 'argument' *pwd*, which means 'where is the following program located: pwd'. Just type the following in Terminal:

    which pwd
It will tell you it is stored in /bin/. The file system used in Mac 'behind the scenes' has the root '/'. There are a few folders in there, like 'Users' and 'bin'. You can't normally get here in Finder, but you can make it anyway by typing the following command in Terminal (you can also press *Cmd+Shift+G* in Finder and put /):

    open /
Many of the 'system' folders like 'bin' are hidden in Finder though. The cli-equivalent of listing the directory structure is *ls*. Commands like *ls* can be used with no 'arguments' (it will list the files and folders in the current path), or with 'flags' which alter the behavior and/or the directories you want to list. For instance, try these:

    ls
    ls /
    ls -a /
    ls -al /

The first will give you a listing of the files in your home folder.

The second will list the files in /.

The third will actually list all the files in /, even those that are hidden (they start with '.').

The last one will not only list these but provide more information about each one.

---
Ahem!

To navigate the cli, use the *cd* command. It takes the argument of the directory you want to go. This can either be absolute, i.e. */usr/local/bin*, or 'relative', like *Documents*. Tip: if you start typing 'Doc' and the folder Documents exists in your current path, press the tab key to auto-complete this. If there are more than one, press tab twice to list all the matching entries.

Anyway, let's get back to what we were actually doing. We want the *imguru* command to work so we need to put it somewhere where the system will find it. To do this, use the *mv* command (move). It takes the following arguments:

    mv &lt;move what&gt; &lt;to where&gt;
Because arguments are separated by spaces, you can't have spaces in any of these paths unless you surround them with '' marks (or escape them but I won't go into that). Download imguru and locate where the imguru file is now (for instance, */Users/jeroen/Downloads/imguru*). You want to move it into */usr/local/bin/* which is the folder where you put your own binary files. To do that, I used:

    mv /Users/jeroen/Downloads/imguru /usr/local/bin/imguru
Now that it's in the right place, try using it:

    imguru
This will happen:

    Jeroens-MacBook-Pro:~ jeroen$ imguru
    -bash: /usr/local/bin/imguru: Permission denied
    Jeroens-MacBook-Pro:~ jeroen$ 
Every file in the file system has a number of permissions attached to it, the most commonly used are **r**ead, **w**rite and e**x**ecute. The last one allows users or the system to actually run the binary program in the file. This is disabled by default for downloaded items of course, so that you have to actually enable it explicitly in order to protect you from running bad stuff. To change this stuff we use *chmod*. As arguments it first takes the change in permissions, and then the file to operate on. So:

    chmod +x /usr/local/bin/imguru
This tells the system to add (+) the e**x**ecute permission to our file. *-x* would do the opposite.

Now try imguru:

    Jeroens-MacBook-Pro:~ jeroen$ imguru
    usage: imguru [-odpilmbdrhv] [-s max_dimension] source_file ...
    Jeroens-MacBook-Pro:~ jeroen$ 
It didn't work because you didn't give it arguments it needs. The ones in square brackets are optional, the other ones, in this case: *source_file*, are not. This is the file that you want to upload to imgur. If you want you can try it out by specifying a path to an image file, if all goes well it will output an imgur url.

--- 
Now that this works, let's do some actually relevant stuff like make your screenshot folder. This is the last Terminal part. 

Right now your screenshots are being saved to ~/Desktop. We will later be making a 'Folder Action' in Automator which does stuff with any new file in the folder it is listening on. Because we don't want it to upload *everything* in the Desktop to imgur, only screenshots, we need to make those go to a different folder. Let's use *~/Screenshots* for that, but you can use whatever you want.

First we need to make the folder. Simply use the mkdir command:

    mkdir ~/Screenshots
Now that we have the folder, we need to make the screenshots go there. This is a system setting, and system settings can be changed using the *defaults* command. I will copy this from the link I provided in my other comment:

&gt;For example, if I want to have the screenshots appear in my Screenshots folder, I would use:

    defaults write com.apple.screencapture location ~/Screenshots/

&gt;To have the changes take effect, you then must type:

    killall SystemUIServer
The last part simply makes OS X restart the part of the system that handles the screenshots (among lots of stuff, you will see the notifications bar restart as well). Much better than restarting the whole computer.

To see if it worked, make a screenshot. It will now be in the Screenshots folder in your home folder.

---
Now for the Automator part. I won't spend nearly as much time on how Automator works.

Open up Automator (the fastest way is probably *Cmd+Spacebar*; ""aut""; Enter). It will ask you what kind of thing you want to make, so select 'Folder Action'. In the *Choose folder* box, pick *Other...* and choose your screenshots folder. Now we want to use *imguru* on every file that is put in here at any time. So, search for the action 'Run Shell Script'. In there, you can put what you would put in Terminal and it will do just that. I used this, I'll explain each bit below:

    /usr/local/bin/imguru -d ""$@"" | tr -d '[[:space:]]'
The first part simply calls *imguru* with its absolute path. This is a best practise and might even be necessary. The *-d* flag makes it output the link. The *$@* represents the input it gets from Automator: the file name of the file that has been added to this folder. It is surrounded by """" marks because it will have spaces. Then the 'pipe' symbol 'pipes' the output from *imguru* as input to the *tr* command, because for some odd reason the url output includes a 'return' sign which is highly annoying. *tr* will trim any 'whitespace' away from the url, including this 'return'

This action will yield the imgur url. Now I want to have it in the clipboard. So I go get the 'Copy to clipboard' action. Done. Now I want to know when this thing is finished, so that I can wait for it and then try pasting, so I use Growl. If you don't have Growl installed, you won't have this action in Automator.

Now you can save this workflow and it should all work! It should look like it does in the video.

^(Well there goes a good 30 minutes of my life I'm never getting back...)

Please ask me questions if you're having problems or are confused or just interested!

tl;dr The steps to make this work are:

 1. Install imguru:
* Download imguru
* Move it to the right place (install it):

            mv /Users/jeroen/Downloads/imguru /usr/local/bin/imguru
* Make it executable:

            chmod +x /usr/local/bin/imguru
 2. Make a screenshots folder:
* Create the Screenshots folder in your home folder:

            mkdir ~/Screenshots
* Make OS X use it to put your screenshots:

            defaults write com.apple.screencapture location ~/Screenshots/
* Restart the service that handles screenshots:

            killall SystemUIServer
 3. Make an automator script:
* Create a 'Folder Action' workflow on the screenshots folder we made above
* Use the following Shell command action:

            /usr/local/bin/imguru -d ""$@"" | tr -d '[[:space:]]'
* Add a 'Copy to clipboard' action
* Optional: add a Growl action",0,1354994654,,0,1354998123,1,c7day9n,t3_14hwiz,t1_c7day9n,t1_c7d9u62,,1430615688,2,False,apple,t5_2qh1f,2
True,BOLDTHUMB,,,"After spending a lot of time following threads discussing gender issues on Reddit, I've started to notice a trend:

Instead of discussing solutions to the issues (practical, productive), everyone is arguing over who is the bigger victim of oppression or has the least privilege (impractical, unproductive).

It seems to me that, regardless of the statistics regarding particular issues, today's state of gender imbalance is overall quite even. Women and men have different privileges and different ways in which they are oppressed by our culture. And that's the key. **Our culture**. We're *all* accountable for *all* of it. I guess what I've learned from my time following these gender discussions, is that bickering over it doesn't get us anywhere. It's the same arguments over and over. When are we actually going to acknowledge the imbalances as simply what they are and work toward improving them?

Some of my suggestions for how to go about doing this:

- **Stop blaming.** Blaming women or feminists is not the solution just as much as blaming men or MRAs is not the solution: we must all accept accountability. Despite what some people say, both misandry and misogyny exist in various forms. It's everyone's collective responsibility to do something about them.

- **Stop with the self-victimization.** Life is cruel to most of us since everyone suffers despite their gender, race, or whatever else. We all experience discrimination in one form or another. This is important to realize: anybody can be bullied, manipulated, or abused.

- **Be open-minded and be self-aware.** Do plenty of research and try to be aware of your own biases and your own privileges. It's easy to fall prey to dismissing contrary evidence when we are convinced that our beliefs are right. This is dangerous and only leads to absolutist thinking, which in turn leads to intellectual stagnation. Really listen to people and think about their arguments rather than immediately responding with rhetoric or attacking a straw man version of their argument.

- **Don't be a troll.** This just creates more tension and hostility between people. It's completely counter-productive. Show some respect for your fellow human beings.

- **Be realistic about your expectations of people.** If you expect people to stop making offensive jokes, you're going to be really disappointed. If you expect people to give up their opinions just because you don't agree with them, you're going to be disappointed.

Well, that's all I can manage right now. I'd be happy to add more to the list if others are willing to bring some constructive suggestions to the table.

Well, I believe that there are two forms of anxiety disorders... acute and chronic. Acute stress can cause anxiety (eg. a family member dies, and you are suddenly experiencing panic attacks every day due to the stress), or chronic (life-long). 

I know that a lot of doctors play it by ear as to whether an anxiety disorder to acute or chronic. They don't want you to suddenly stop taking your medications at the first sign of ""feeling better"", because you could easily 'relapse'. 

However, many people do experience short bouts of anxiety or depression that needs to only be treated for a temporary period of time. How to determine which you have all depends on the severity of your anxiety, and the causes of it. I can't give you a better answer than that, other than perhaps to ask your doctor whether or not you'll need them permanently or not.

True,rhinotation,,,"
Let's take two example languages as your ""Regular"" and ""Object Oriented"" languages: C and Ruby respectively. 

C is one of the most widely used languages of all time. Part of the reason behind this is that it's a *small language*, i.e. it doesn't have many features that would slow it down or make it hard to port to small systems.

The entirety of the code you write in C is found in subroutines, or functions. The main reason these exist is that you use them to separate out a small job that needs to be done many times with different data. Each function uses other ones to do the same thing, and you end up with a program that is mostly a lot of functions acting on the data they are given, to produce a result. It's important not to confuse this style with the aforementioned-in-this-thread Functional Programming; in languages like C, functions can change state and have side-effects, unlike those in FP, which can only transform the data they are given.

Another thing about C is that most of the time, if you replaced every time you used a function (`processData()`) with the function body:

    int x = 10 + GLOBAL_CONSTANT;
    shoveInDatabase(x);

... you would still have a regular program. It would just be a long list of statements that mutated state and data and eventually gave a result.

So let's look at Ruby. The first thing you new to know is that Ruby, at least the official version, is written in C. WAT? Yeah, that's right, it is, and if you think about it, every time you run a Ruby program, the code you write is just passed in as data to a C program, which figures out what you want to do and does it. This just goes to show that Ruby is a big language; it has a lot of abstractions on top of this ""regular programming"" we speak of.

The main difference is that in Ruby, everything is an object. What does that even mean? Well, instead of just being a long line of manipulations on data, a Ruby program is a web of Objects interacting with each other, sending messages and replying, often sending other objects back and forth. 

So, this is what an object means: it's a programming structure that contains data and functions, called 'methods'.
In Ruby, as I said, everything is an object; numbers, ""strings"" and [arrays, of, objects] are objects. If I wanted to add two numbers, I would write `1 + 2`, but Ruby actually rewrites this as `1.+(2)`; here, the `+` is actually a method on the 1 object, that takes one argument, the other number, and returns the new number. 

For another example, let's examine these lines:

    a = String.new
    a.concat(""SHXOO"")
    a.downcase

Try typing each one into [TryRuby.org](http://tryruby.org ""TryRuby""). You'll find that the string `""""` is an object you can perform methods on. If you want, try typing `""hello"".methods` into the prompt; it should give you a list of methods you can perform on a String.

Now look at `String`; what is this? It is in fact another Object, but it's a special one that we call a ""class"". A class is like a template for making objects. It lets many different objects with different data be created according to the same common structure; every time you write a string, like `""hello""` or `""Uzbekistan""`, the content of the string is different, but all Strings can be joined together or converted to lowercase. Those two pieces of common functionality, and many more, are defined when you define the String class. Any String you create has all these properties and methods, and we call `""hello""` an instance of the String class.

But then you ask the obvious question, What's the point? And sometimes the answer is that there is no point; when you are writing a small program like one that throws a virtual die when you really want to play a board game but don't have one on hand (`puts rand(1..6)` in ruby), it's really not that advantageous to have Objects. However, the key reason behind actually having and working with them is for organisation.

Objects make it easy to separate functionality and to keep a rigid structure to a program; they help avoid ""spaghetti code"". In Ruby, it's very easy to use the Model-View-Controller pattern where one class covers you database code, many classes cover displaying that data on a screen, and some other classes do processing and shuffling between the two. In C, that's not so easy because the environment tends to encourage a programmer to write lots of code without organising it. That's not to say that you can't be organised in C, it's only that classes and objects make it easy and the standard libraries provided with a language encourage a programmer to follow suit.

So, to illustrate the way a project might be organised in Object Oriented Programming, I offer Rails, the web application framework that brought Ruby fame. A Rails project consists of three main sections, as I mentioned before the Models, the Views, and the Controllers.

A model class looks like this; it's connected to a database and has one property, a name:

	class Song &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
	  attr_accessible :name
	end

A controller looks like this, and a SongsController instance grabs all the Song objects in the database to send to the view when some browser requests a list of of them (which is what `index` is for).

	class SongsController &lt; ApplicationController
	  def index
	    @songs = Song.all
	    respond_to do
	      format.html
	    end
	  end
	end

And a view looks like this, and renders each Song object into HTML:

	&lt;ul&gt;
	  &lt;% @songs.each do |song| %&gt;
	    &lt;li&gt;&lt;%= song.name %&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	  &lt;% end %&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;

In this fashion, we have a clear separation of code between each of the different roles, and that separation is built into the system.

Anyway, I hope that helps!

True,smartalecky,,,"&gt;His plans for restoring his home include raising the house several feet to prevent damage from a similar storm surge in the future.

*Disclaimer: I owned two insurance agencies in Florida...and have a little practice with issues such as these.*

This is the issue in a nutshell. Home insurance companies, regardless of who it is, do not...and can not cover flood damage. Flood is listed as ""rising water"" to encompass all forms of surges(river, lake, ocean, wind related from hurricanes, etc).

The National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 created the Federal Insurance Administration and made flood insurance available for the first time. The Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 made the purchase of flood insurance mandatory for the protection of property located in Special Flood Hazard Areas. These flood areas are mapped by FEMA, and give designations via a letter system to your flood risk.

There are two types of flood insurance programs, preferred and standard. Preferred is when you are not in a flood zone, and are purchasing the policy for your own peace of mind. As these areas are relatively trouble free, the premium is negligible. When I sold insurance in Florida, the maximum of $250,000 on house and $100,000 in contents was only $376 for the year.

As this guy is paying a rather hefty flood premium, he is obviously located in a high risk zone. In those cases, you are required to get an elevation certificate, usually completed by the mortgage company before purchase, and submit that along with your application. Elevation certificates, once entered into the rating system, rate your home from +1, all the way down to -4. As you might imagine, the further down the scale you go, the more expensive the coverage gets.

It is also important to note that flood premiums are the same *everywhere* you go. As only the Federal Governments sells it(they broker out to agents/agencies), they set the rate.

Now, back to the issue at hand. Insurance works on the basis of who is first in line to pay. With the bulk of the damage coming from storm surge, the insurance company will not be the first in line to pay. That designation will fall on his flood policy. If anything, he should be calling the NFIP(National Flood Insurance Program) to ask when they are going to get an adjuster out to assess his claim. If his Allstate agent wrote the policy, Allstate(as all of the big companies do) will have a flood contact center. He needs to raise hell with them, rather than the home insurance side, because they are two separate entities.

While it's great to note that part about the tree, remember, that can also get chalked up to storm surge, plus the argument could be made that without the saturation, the tree might have stood. Most likely, Allstate will have to pay for that, but remember our order of paying lesson here.

Once the flood adjuster assesses his part of the damages, and issues a settlement amount, then the secondary insurance(his home insurance) will kick in and pay the remainder of the damages. No insurance company, regardless of how great you think they may be, will pay out more than what their share of a claim should be...hence the waiting on the NFIP adjuster to make their assessment of damages.

Unfortunately, neither he, nor the article writer, have any idea how this process actually works...and either no one has explained it to him, or he is willfully ignoring what they are saying. He will get it fixed, and money will be paid out by both parties. Most likely, the flood policy will pay the $250,000 on the house, and $100,000 on contents(assuming he opted for contents coverage). From there, Allstate will have to foot the rest of that bill.

**TL;DR: No. Go read it. It helps explain how your flood policy and home policy work in situations like this, and can be educational for you.**",0,1355027206,,0,False,1,c7diuyc,t3_14ip0s,t1_c7diuyc,t3_14ip0s,,1430619573,2092,False,pics,t5_2qh0u,2092

True,MyLifeInRage_,,,"The relationship between the father/hunter and Alan Parrish (Williams) is the cornerstone of the plot and the two main themes of the movie; facing one's fears and becoming independent. The two themes are actually one if you consider Alan's independence as the core theme and facing fears as the vessel through which he will achieve it. I will quickly discuss the modern children Judy and Peter at the end of my rant! They are effectively the converse of Alan :)

The first words the father says in the movie sums up the two of the major themes of the film (facing one's fears and becoming independent):

            Look, Alan.
            Is Billy Jessup picking on you again?
            Son, you're gonna have to face him sooner or later.
            Look, if you're afraid of something, you've got to stand and face it.
            Now, run on, son.

Note the heavy foreshadowing. Both the obvious and also the ""run on, Sonny Jim"" as the Hunter says later in the film. The next scene (after the father practising his speech) is once again between father and son. The father is proud of his son for facing his fears; so much so he believes his son has become independent and is ready to start boarding school:

            I want you to know I am proud of you.
            I mean, you faced them, even though you were outnumbered.
            And since you took it like a man...
            your mother and I have decided that you're ready to go...
            to the Cliffside School for Boys.

            Congratulations, sweetheart. (mother)

Alan does not take this news well, because he isn't really ready at all. He **isn't independent** yet and he argues with his father. Fearful of his family's heritage and unsure of himself and where he fits within his family. Is he really good enough for the family and more importantly his father? His solitary act of bravery may have convinced his father that he was independent, but it did very little for Alan himself. Clearly he needs to face more fears before he will become fully independent.

Then you get the whole sucked into the jungle and the return, etc, etc. THEN you get 

             ""A hunter from the darkest wild...
             makes you feel just like a child.""

Needs no further explanation. Van Pelt steps in with his own first lines of high significance:

             You miserable coward! Come back and face me like a man.
             Not good enough, Sonny Jim.
             Coming, ready or not.

He is the embodiment of everything Alan was afraid of as a child. Not being good enough, being seen as a coward and being entirely dependent on his family. The ""coming ready or not"" is a nice follow on from Alan's fathers line ""Now, run on, son"" uttered earlier in the film. It's almost as if his father stepped through time from his lecture about standing up for himself directly to Van Pelt's introduction. The conversation full of pride and seeing his son as a man has been circumnavigated and all that remains is a heightened level of disappointment with none of the concern and love.

After this meeting we get some more ""Sonny Jim's"" and ""Start running."" Soul-destroying comments from his father's mouth until finally at the end of the movie we come upon this conversation:

             End of the line, Sonny Jim. Game's up.
             Start running.

         (Alan) [pause] No.

             Aren't you afraid?

          (A) I'm terrified. But my father says you should always face what you're afraid of.

             [lowering the gun; chuckling] Good lad. You're finally acting like a man. [again leveling his gun]
             Any last words? 

          (A) Jumanji.

This conversation *is* the movie. The hunter shows the same pride the father had at the beginning of the movie; both he and Alan see that through facing his fears Alan has become a man. Of course the hunter is the embodiment of everything Alan fears from his father and is evil, therefore there is no lasting appeal and the hunter won't let him live. Alan ends the game (winning it Charlie Sheen style) and the world returns to normal. A little more abstract is Alan doesn't need the hunter, nor the game, any more and thus it is allowed to end.

Scene cut to the beginning of the film, just after Alan's argument with his father.

                (Father) Forgot my speech notes.

                (Alan) I'm so glad you're back.

                (F) I've only been gone five minutes.

                (A) It seems like a lot longer to me.

                (F) I thought you told me you were never gonna talk to me again.

                (A) Whatever I said, Dad...
                I'm sorry.

                (F) Look, Alan, I was angry.
                I'm sorry too. I'm sorry.
                You don't have to go to Cliffside if you don't want to.
                Let's talk it over tomorrow, man-to-man.

                (A) How about father-to-son?

And with that final line ""father-to-son"" we all look back emotionally at the roller-coaster Alan has suffered through. Just a boy who wanted to show his father he could be independent. A boy who faced fears that weren't really his consistently throughout the movie until finally facing what he feared most; not being good enough for his father.

So in effect Alan's relationship with both the hunter and father (or perhaps just the ""one"" of them both) *IS* the movie Jamanji (Jamungi in my head). Without it it is simply a few people running away from bats, with it it is a story of self-discovery, relationships, fears and growing up.

True,kitsovereign,gilded l-14j1s7 c-c7dlwvt,stand-in for /u/TheNarratorOfBastion,"Kid was real confused. Lotta sick, hurt people in this world. Who's lookin' out for them?

The kid came from a real big country. Land of the free, they called it. Some say that country was founded a long, long time ago. Some of them, well, they say it wasn't that long at all.

Anyway, when that country was born, they said that all the folks livin' it had the right to life, and liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  Sounds nice, at least.

Now, the doctors of this world are a hard-working sort, havin' studied for a long time, and their knowledge don't come free. Funny thing about havin' the ""right to life"" though - you can't have folks droppin' dead in the streets, just because they don't have two coins clangin' in their pocket.

So these people built rooms all over the land, for when other folks had... well, emergencies, let's call 'em. You get in that room - and it may take a long time before you get in - but they fix you up good, before they even ask you for a dime.  Now if somebody gets there and gets fixed up, but doesn't have that dime - well, the land of the free's gotta pick up the bill.

Now, some people have a few dimes, but not always enough to pay the doctor. That's where these gamblin' men came in. Ensureants, I think they called 'em - 'cause you wanted them to ensure you could pay the doc if you ever fell ill.

Anyway, you'd go to this Ensureant, and he'd make a most perverse bet with you. Every month, he'd bet you, that you wouldn't get sick. And if you lost the bet that month, well, you have to pay him, but at least you have your health.

If you did get sick though, the Ensureant would pay up, and he could pay you more than you ever had in the first place - he had a lot of money, from makin' so many bets.

So that's the system, how it was.

Now this land of the free had one man at the top. Called himself the President. He looked at this system, and saw that it was a dark, dark mess.

You see, there's a lot of bad things that can happen to a person. One kind of disease, part of a person grows and grows, faster and faster, takin' over the good parts of the body until there's no good parts left. Kid shuddered just thinkin' about it. Now, ideally, when you get a real nasty sickness, the Ensureant pays up so you can get treated.  It don't always work like that, though. A lot of Ensureants see you get real sick, and suddenly they don't like the odds of that bet they're makin' with you. And then they pretend it never happened.

Some people weren't so sick, but didn't have the money to pay the Ensureants in the first place. And, well, when that happens - all you can do is hope for an emergency.

The thing about emergencies, though, is that they cost a lot more than things that aren't emergencies. Especially if it gets so bad that the land of the free has to take care of you for the rest of your poor life. And if the land of the free is gonna have to pay for it anyway, wouldn't it make more sense to just pay off the Ensureant, so everything gets done quicker and cheaper?

The President thought so.  He saw all those folks, sick and dyin' and nothin' in their pockets, and thought things would be better if he just made it so that everybody who didn't have an Ensureant would get one, courtesy of the country.

Lotta folks weren't happy about this, though.

When the land of the free pays for something, though, well, it comes from the folks livin' in it. So anytime it does something new, a lot of folks know that they'll be asked more money, and there's always complaints.    
Some folks thought this would mean they'd pay more money, but they usually weren't thinkin' about how the land of the free already spent a lot of money on emergencies.

Some folks didn't understand what was happening, or thought it was a good idea but that he didn't do it the right way. That ain't too surprising. Like I said, it's a real big country.

Some folks were unhappy because they just didn't like the President. Ain't nothing to be done about that, I suppose.

The President did a lot of other things, too, tryin' to keep his people healthy. For instance, usually a mom and dad will pay for a kid's Ensureant, since young kids don't really have money of their own. Sometimes the kid grows up, though, and times are still tough. Well, the President made it so a kid can stay with his parents' Ensureant a lot longer. Gets to go around the sun twenty-six times before he's on his own.

The kid thought about his own upbringin', workin' hard at the Breaker Barracks, tryin' to get by.

Must be nice, havin' parents.

True,FTFYcent,,,"I've had the same problem, and for me I've found that the reason is just that I have an active filter up on what I say compared to what I think. It's to the point where when I'm in the moment I feel I have literally nothing to say, because I'm not even sure myself what I'm thinking. It's hard to explain. It's like there's a disconnect between my thoughts and the world outside my head, and one doesn't necessarily translate into the other. There's a voice inside my head that does the ""thinking"" but a separate voice that does the talking. So I have to first think in my head, and then think about how I'm going to say it, instead of having the two be the same step.

The solution I've found is through writing or journaling. Working on not thinking too hard about how to say what I want to say, and just letting whatever I think spill onto the page. My worry in conversation (and it seems to happen a lot) is that I'll say things that don't make sense, that have no internal logic or ""flow"". Getting my thoughts down on paper and seeing that they actually do make a lot of sense, and can at times actually be pretty freaking articulate, is a huge boost for me.

True,[deleted],,,"&gt;Do those struts (between vertically stacked tanks) actually help the stability?

Yes. Well-placed struts can reduce movement in joints, and since movement in joints is what causes wobble, the more fixed/immobile your joints are, the more stability you have.

I don't link to radial decouplers, ever since [an Apollo rocket I made](http://i.imgur.com/6eDgd.png) kept blowing up its second stage because of a radial decoupler with struts attached to it (it kept glitching into the nearby fuel tanks).

True,thisisvienna,,,"Someone gave me this advice and it really has done wonders for my confidence. He said everywhere you go, whether it be the bathroom or an important meeting, always walk like you're going somewhere important. I started focusing on walking with purpose, and at first it felt really stupid. Then slowly people started wanting to walk with me... for no real reason. They just wanted to say hi and have a quick conversation. Suddenly I had all these acquaintances, and before long a few of those turned into friendships. More than one person would walk and talk with me, and I didn't do anything at all except pretend I was confident.

I don't know why, but people are really attracted to confidence, like the confidence will rub off on them or something. Work it. I faked it so long that I have a ton of real confidence now. I still don't talk any more than I used to, but when I do people listen because I speak with the confidence that my thoughts are worthy of their attention.

Edit: Just for clarity, I'd like to add that I don't mean this works on random strangers on the street.

True,catminusone,,,"I think the most confusing thing about the picture is that when portals are around, there's no such thing as a global inertial reference frame. This makes arguments that rely on conservation of momentum and conservation of energy really easy to get tripped up by.

To explain: let's say you want to argue (A) based on conservation of momentum. To make that kind of argument you first choose ""inertial"" coordinates on space-time and then argue that the momentum of the block before and after it passes through the portal, in those coordinates, is equal. I think the intuitive thing is to use the coordinates ""as shown in the picture""; these coordinates, in particular, are discontinuous at the portal, where as you pass through the plane of the portal there is a sudden rotation, translation, and velocity shift in your coordinates.

Alternatively, someone else might come along and choose coordinates that go smoothly through the portal, but are discontinuous somewhere between the left and right sides of the picture. To be specific, choose coordinates on the left side of the picture such that the orange portal is not moving with respect to us, and on the right side choose coordinates ""as shown"" (i.e., such that the blue portal is also not moving). There's no reason to believe these coordinates are any ""fundamentally"" worse than the ones that are discontinuous at the portal, but everyone agrees that in these coordinates the block does something like (B) (since on the left side we're seeing it fly into the orange portal).

How does one distinguish between these two cases? The fundamental difference between these coordinate systems is that in the latter case, the block does not pass through the region of space-time where our inertial coordinates are discontinuous, so classical conservation of momentum should hold. In the former case, there's no reason to expect that conservation of momentum should hold, since we haven't made a choice of coordinate system encompassing everything interesting about the system that looks anything like classical Newtonian physics.

True,milky_funk,,,"Okay:

Pants

1: keep

2: keep

3: return

4: keep

5: return

6: return

The third pair of pants okay in the seat and thighs but too blousy with that straight cut below the knee for your build and height. 

The last two pairs of shorts are too long, too baggy, too patterned, and too dark. They are the worst things you bought. 

The navy vans are nice and work really well with everything I told you to keep. 

Return the other things and use that money for other purchases. Here is what I would buy, in the order, assuming you are twenty and don't need a ton of business-oriented clothing.

General Priorities:

1. Dark blue slim jeans (if you don't already own them). Levi's 511 are fine, or 510 if you want really slim. If you want to go upmarket a bit, Unbranded 101s are what I'm wearing. $90 + $15 for tailoring = $105 well spent. After this slot is filled, you will be fine for pants for a while.

2. T-shirts. White + Grey. Target's Mossimo brand does some quite nice ones for slimmer guys. Everlane also offers fairly good quality shirts for reasonable prices although I hear mixed reviews on the fit. H&amp;M / Topman tees fit me well though I always imagine my nipples are poking through because they're quite thin.

4. Shoes. I don't know what you have, but in addition to those vans, I would get a pair of brogues, a pair of boots, and a pair of sneakers (sambas or dunks or something like that). Spend time researching/thinking here because you if you spend *$money$* anywhere, it should be here.

3. Casual button-up shirts: Just get a few, white and light blue are your most versatile options. Maybe a few nice flannels in here as well.

4. Outerwear. Jackets are my obsession. If you have money, buy a cool leather jacket. You're 20 so I'm assuming you don't want to blow $750 on a new leather jacket. M64 field jacket replicas are cool (or buy the original from a milsurp place) as are denim jackets. Levi's does a raw denim trucker jacket that is really really beautiful. That would be my recommendation. Then, if it fits your style, pick up an unstructured or more-casual blazer in khaki or navy blue. 

6. Accessories. Underwear, ties, watches, more belts, socks, etc, etc.

7. Suit. Navy or Grey, 2-button, middle-width lapel. Make sure it fits in the shoulders. Get it tailored.

True,i_start_fires,,,"Okay, I made some 3D plans based on what I could gather was going on in the picture.  It looks like the whole thing folds together flat when not in use so that's what I went with.

[Plans Here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/kmetqjogir4dgoh/Book%20Holder.pdf)

The only major tool you will need is a table saw.  Hopefully you have one or can borrow one, because I don't recommend trying to build this with anything else.  The plans use only 3/4"" hardwood which you can buy at any hardware store or lumber yard.  The only piece you might have trouble with is finding a large enough base.  You could get away with using 1/2"" plywood for that if you don't mind a rough edge, or you can cut and glue/clamp two pieces together.  Although the picture is pretty small, I used arbitrary dimensions of 12x18 with the thought that something like this would be good for cookbooks and the like (no that's not a woman in the kitchen joke, just an observation).  If you want something smaller you can just halve the dimensions and use 1/2"" hardwood.

Anyway, here's the cut list:

Vertical Panel:

(2x) 2"" x 12""

(3x) 1 1/2"" x 14""
(2x) 1"" x 14""

(1x) 2 1/2"" x 14"" (notch out 1"" x 3"" cuts for flip-up book holders)

(2x) 2 1/2"" x 3/4""

Base:

(3x) 3/4"" x 13 1/2""

(1x) 18"" x 12""
 
Glue/Clamp everything together as shown in the diagram.  Make sure you use wood glue and you shouldn't need nails.

The two pieces connect with a piano hinge which you can also find a a hardware store.  Two small cabinet hinges could also work.  The only piece I don't have in the plans is the metal kickstand, since I'm not aware of anything that can be pre-bought.  I'm sure you can figure that part out on your own.

The truth about most big, soft off-season guys is that they're blasting anabolics for mass gain, which causes them to retain more water than they would ordinarily have. Dbol, Anadrol, Deca, some Equipoise (if they can find the real deal) test, and usually a solid amount of GH so that the body can use it.  

Then, when it gets around to contest time, they tighten up the diet just a bit, switch it up to Tren, low dose test, Masteron, keeping the GH in there, and at the end, probably dropping the Test completely, and adding some diuretics in for that finishing touch, to get really freaky looking.

True,FusionXIV,,,"A) Each individual atom in the bar would accelerate downwards infinitely (edit: not actually infinitely, thanks indigoh), just like the player does in the game. This would result in the entire rod accelerating uniformly downwards. 

[Edit: Here's some more detail on why the bar would fall, rather than staying still because of the infinite tower of bars](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/14kg5w/my_brain_just_exploded/c7dz3so)

Interestingly, if the bar contained a magnetized portion in the center, this could be a great way to generate infinite energy by inducing electric current in a coil wrapped around the bar every time the magnet falls through the coil (and demonstrating nicely that portals are impossible under the real laws of physics [edit: unless you have a large input of energy to sustain the portal]).

.

B) The bar would probably skew sideways. If held perfectly vertical from the sides, it would compress itself, generate massive stress inside it, and crumple outwards, just as it would if clamped in a massive vice. The difference here is that the bar is compressing ITSELF, by having one end of the bar push against the other end, which is possible in a 1 dimensional loop (which is what the bar can be modeled as after you solder its ends together).

You can calculate how far you would have to move the portal to start crumpling the bar by calculating how much stress will cause the bar to break, and then calculating how far the bar would first be compressed by applying that much stress.

.

C) As the portal switches locations, it will close for a brief moment, and the molecules at the blue portal will no longer be adjacent to the molecules at the orange portal. This will mean the forces binding them together will no longer be in range to attract the molecules to each other, and an incredibly clean cut will be made along the border of where the portal was when it closed and relocated. 

Due to the distribution of subatomic particles within the atoms, it's unlikely that that boundary would cross any atomic nuclei; the worst problems that would occur with any frequency would be electrons isolated from their respective nuclei on each side, but since this would happen with equal frequency in each direction, it would probably self-correct with minor electrical currents on each side shortly after the portal closes.

As some sort of energy source(a ala matrix) , the sun gives more energy and way more easily obtainable from the billions of suns in our galaxy.

The earth has nothing special , we mined pretty much everywhere and there isn't some unobtanium mineral that isn't 1000 times more dense in asteroids(that are easier to mine because of low gravity) not to mention closer to their home

That leaves a race thats just evil(per out point of view) that uses all of their free time to search other lifeforms and kill them. Problem is this sort of narrow mentality means they might never reach the stage of galactic travel. Sure war is good in the sense that it really forces people to think new ideas outside the box (at least in humans) but you need peace also foster those ideas and to improve upon. 
And even if such a race did develop i believe it would be likely to meet its own demise by other races that it encountered.

The only point that is valid if they need planets that have the same atmosphere. But different lifeforms evolved on different worlds needing the same nitrogen/oxigen atmosphere are very slim chances. And it needs to be exact . If we had 10% O2 instead of 21% we had now we would all die. If we had 30% o2 even wet wood would burn so all the planet would be ""on fire"" . 78% Nitrogen that its basically useless for us but who knows what effect it would have on different organisms.

and even this point assumes aliens are advanced to travel beyond light sped but unable to terraform a planet . Even with our current understandings its easier (with unlimited money about 1000 years ) to terraform mars then to break the light barrier , because the latter is impossible(as far as we know)

Hawking may be a brilliant man in his field , and i can understand a lot reticence/fear if some alien race was encountered , but to go as far as say they will massacre us and that we should just stick with our corner of the galaxy and never expand beyond the solar system and hell even prevent signals from leaving out solar system is against everything he should stand as a scientist.

&gt; I do have a relationship with a girl I love. But I know I will never love her as much as that girl . 

Obviously you'll never love your current girl as much as past girl, because past girl is endless possibilities of what ""could have been"", and current girl is reality. And for whatever reason, you'd rather imagine possibilities with someone you don't have, then see the possibilities with someone you do have.


How do you expect to love your current girl IF you keep thinking/are reminded of your past girlfriend and then comparing them. She left you, whether it was your fault or not it doesn't matter; if you don't chase after her, then you move on; you don't tie her as emotional baggage; and you definitely don't make someone else help you carry your baggage unknowingly(I'm assuming you didn't tell your current girlfriend that you will never love her as much as your past girlfriend).

How would your current girl feel if she knew that you will never love her as much as you loved your ex?--Scratch that, how would your current girl feel if she knew that you will never **try** to love her as much as you loved your ex?

How do you expect to move on into the present/future if you keep anchoring yourself to the past? Are you afraid of getting hurt like that again? Is it that you love fantasizing about what ""could have been""? You can't live in the past man. And life isn't a constant state of bliss; you know you have something amazing when you think ""holy shit if this girl left me I'd be crushed"", but in order for that to happen you have to let yourself be vulnerable to experience the hurting again.

It's not even about loving your current girl as much as your past girl, it's about not comparing, it's about loving who you're with for who they are and not as a relative measurement to other people. We love people differently.

True,fuckmatt,,,"I was confined against my will in treatment (wilderness programs/therapeutic boarding schools) for 16 months, beginning right after my 15th birthday. I have seen more than 25 therapists as of my 17th birthday and was medicated from age 7-14. My mother is a psychiatrist specializing in addiction; she is also bipolar, and mental disease/addiction runs in my family. Simply put, I didn't stand much of a chance. My mom has been paying others to parent me for most of my life, residential treatment was the culmination of many years of chaos and dysfunction within my family.

That said, I have no love for treatment. I was kept in clinical isolation for 19 weeks, forced to sit up straight at a desk for 15 hours a day. I wasn't allowed to talk, write, read, draw, or put my head down. Whenever I moved I was escorted by staff, and I was only allowed to leave my desk for bathroom breaks and work. I was made to work 4 hours+ each day doing petty labor, cleaning the dining hall for 160+ people alone every morning while a staff member watched. During this time my therapist refused to see me and I was kept out of school. Because of this I am currently repeating my junior year in highschool. I was depressed, alone, and powerless. For the 19 weeks that I was denied treatment and forced to work without pay, my mother paid $40,000. 

I was put in isolation after I confessed (took accountability) for the rules I had broken during my stay. In my therapeutic boarding school, if you had broken a rule and did not own up to it, you were put into isolation. If you knew that a rule had been broken by someone and did not tell staff, you and that person were both put in isolation. These rules were accompanied by therapeutic propaganda, ""If you do not tell on yourself you are not honest and have no integrity. If you do not tell on your friends you are a bad friend and an immoral person.""

Breaking school rules was equated with immorality; in a controlled and isolated environment, the school was able to brainwash the students. I have many friends who have experienced symptoms of PTSD associated with my school, panic attacks and night terrors and crippling guilt for the way they were forced to sell their friends to advance within the program. If you broke a rule and owned up to it, you were still put in isolation, though usually for less time. Because I had never honestly taken accountability for all the rules I had broken, my honesty did little to mitigate my consequence. My ""reward"" was that I got to stay in the school rather than go back to wilderness program (which would have cost my mother an additional $40,000) to be reevaluated. My stay was extended by 5 months and I was restarted within the program, basically ""back to square 1"". The main rule I had broken:

-My two best friends (boy and girl, aged 17) were secretly engaging in an ""out of standard relationship"". They had sex once, in a supply closet. I knew, I didn't say anything to staff. After they were caught and expelled (to more restrictive programs), I was a mess, I broke down and confided in my therapist. It was extremely emotional, and I began to confess everything I had done, from ripping pictures of girls from magazines during doctors visits to stealing instant coffee from the kitchens. That was the last time I talked to her for 3 consecutive months.

My friends are both legal adults in college now, she moved to Texas to be with him and they have been together for 6 months.

I left treatment 5/27/12, I did not finish within a program, I convinced my family to take me back during a visit. This was not typical, in the treatment center I was then confined, it was basically unheard of. Every place I've been to made a huge effort to dissuade parents from taking their children home before they had finished their program, as well as monitoring any communication the child had with their parents while in the school and completely altering the state of the campus during visits (serving decent food, being less openly oppressive to students etc.) If I had stayed in treatment, I would not have had an opportunity to leave until this coming January at the earliest.

I was one of the children you treat. I was a violent and hyperactive child, diagnosed bipolar, ADHD, Oppositional Defiant Disorder, possibly paranoid schizophrenic and overall too much for most adults in my life to handle. I live medication free, sober, finally able to take back my life after the last of my childhood was stolen from me. My question for you: 

How do you live with yourself? Do you rationalize the methods employed on the children you are paid to care for? They deserve it, they're ""different"", there's no other way etc. How do you interact with teenage boys in the ""real world"" one day, as a person interacts with someone who is afforded the same basic liberties as themselves, and come to work the next? Can you comprehend what it must be like for a person to be abandoned by their family like that, forced into a place that can be more damaging than home ever was.

I'm biased. Obviously. The shit that I saw and was forced to live 24/7 has marked me, probably forever. You might be a good therapist, and I'm sure you have the best intentions. Regardless, you are contributing to a system that currently holds and abuses thousands of teenagers within the ""Land of Freedom and Justice for All"".

True,elight86,,,"Bro, listen. I'm literally a professional egg cook. No, really. I've probably cooked thousands of eggs. Unless your pan is like 4"" in diameter your doing it wrong.

You could fit 8 in there if you  keep flipping the egg and keep the heat low.
 
Here's how you make a boss double set of sunny side up eggs in a tiny little pan. Matter of fact, ignore those dudes telling you to get a big heavy ass pan to retain heat. That's not how pros do it and you're a pro, bro.
 
 1. Get your what I'm assuming is an electric stove because you are poor going. Probably set that baby to medium.
 
 2. Get your non-stick pan out and slap it on that burner. Drop a little fat in there. Be it olive oil, butter, or a dollop of bacon grease like a real man. You want that pan all juiced up.
 
 3. You're going to want a rubber spatula type thing like your mom uses to get ever last bit of cake batter out of a bowl ideally but any jank old spatula will work. NOT METAL though. You wanna fuck up your non-stick surface? Jesus...
 
 4. OK, not you've got a nice shiny grease film coating your pan which is feeling pretty hot. GRAB YOUR EGGS, BRO. Crack'em on the side of that pan and drop them in. It's go time!
 
 5. Immediately pull your pan off the heat. What?! Eggs need heat to cook, you say? Well, yeah but not all at once, bro. You got tease'em a little. So put that pan on a nice cool burner. Now take your spatula and use the corner of it to slice through all the white part that is connected to the yolk. You want to decimate that mother. Make it totally disappear so just nice round, yellow yolks are staring up at you. You're trying to make the four eggs one. Gandhi style if you will.
 
 6. Now you can put the pan back on the heat. Turn it down to a little above low now. Your going to slowly solidify all that white part without burning it. And guess what? It's going to look like one giant egg with four yolks. Slow and low is the key, bro. Say it with me: Slow and low.
 
 7. You want to keep sliding the eggs around in the pan occasionally by picking up the pan and moving it in a circular motion parallel to the floor. That's going to keep the egg from sticking to the pan and make you look like you know what you are doing.
 
 8. OK, now your whites are like 95% solid. The top of the whites make be slightly wet and if that bothers you you can scrape that off the egg into the pan and cook it but it's going to make your egg look all jacked up and non-symmetrical and presentation is half the game with up eggs. You're just going to slide those bad boys carefully onto your plate from the pan and POWIE! You're a pro egg cook.

As a CSR for a gas company, I became aware of an elderly woman who's service had been shut off.  When she called in about it, I could barely converse with her because she was so confused.  I told my supervisor and she said all I could do is give the lady the number to a charity organization.  I gave her the number, but I was not confident that she had understood my instructions to call.  I was not allowed to call the charity on her behalf because of privacy concerns.

I went home that weekend and couldn't sleep.  So I called the charity and told them of this woman, gave them her address and phone number.  They went to her house and got her straightened out.  They got her utilities back on, made sure she had groceries and whatever else she needed.  She died probably six months later, but she died in a warm damn house!

True,davidkh,,,"SearchYourFeelings_ gave a very pithy piece of advice that is probably the best single thing to remember:  ""don't make it a thing that is different from other things.""  However, I think other posters are on to something when they talk about specific flirting behaviors:  smile, touch, use eye contact.  What's the connection between the general principle and these specific behaviors?  When we're relaxed and not repressed by anxiety, our feelings naturally reveal themselves to people around us.  When someone is relaxed and open, you can tell when they're happy and when they're angry, how pleased they are to see you, when they're bored or interested by what's going on, and when they're offended.  Flirting is just a special case of this.  If you're interested in a woman, it should show just like your other feelings show.  If your behavior doesn't indicate that you're interested, but out of the blue you ask the woman out, your invitation will seem confusing and possibly creepy.  The inconsistency screams that something is wrong.

Objective descriptions of flirting can help with this:  smile, touch her arm, lean in and speak low, and so forth.  It may seem awkward and artificial, but at least she knows what's going on:  you're interested, but you're awkward and nervous.  (If she can tell what's going on in your head and feels like you're being open about it, that pretty much erases the creep factor.)  HOWEVER, I think flirting behavior checklists are best studied as a description of how your interest in a woman would naturally express itself if you were open and uninhibited.  If I was attracted to a woman, I would stand closer to her than if I wasn't attracted to her.  If I felt we were making a connection, I might lean in and make a joke in a low voice for just the two of us.  I would naturally feel comfortable with certain kinds of touching.  Flirting behaviors aren't a game plan or a code; they're a natural side-effect of feeling attracted and connected.

Luckily, many people who have trouble expressing their feelings of attraction via flirting are simply repressed across the board and don't express their other emotions any more fluently than they express attraction.  When you say, ""It's not exactly in my nature, and any scenarios I create in my head result in me feeling like I'd be really uncomfortable/self-conscious,"" it sounds like this is your problem.  If that's the case, then you can practice expressing your emotions in many scenarios every day.  That's why I say ""luckily!""  Remember what SearchYourFeelings_ said:  it isn't a thing that's different from other things.  Learning to express happiness, anger, frustration, fear, and relief loosens you up and helps you recognize and work around your repression.  Slowly turn up the volume on your emotions (figuratively, and maybe literally, too.)  When you express annoyance with your cable being out.  When you express ambivalence about your parents coming to see you.  When you express delight at being invited to a party.  (Expressing your feelings openly will require you to confront unpleasant and embarrassing feelings.  Is there some hostility towards the call center employee mixed into your annoyance about the cable not working?  Is there an undertone of craven desperation in your gratitude at being invited to the party?  Any time you feel it isn't appropriate for you to express your feelings, you should figure out why.  Oftentimes we repress ALL of our emotions because we're afraid that some of them may be inappropriate.  Analyzing the social appropriateness and inappropriateness of your feelings will give you the confidence to selectively repress certain emotions instead of repressing your entire personality.  It might also motivate you to do some emotional housekeeping.)

Once you're more comfortable expressing your feelings, you'll be comfortable flirting, too.  Then, when you read about flirting behaviors, you won't think, ""This isn't me,"" you'll think, ""This is how people in my culture act when they feel a certain way about someone.  It's perfectly appropriate for me to feel that way, and when I do, this is how I will act, so that people will know how I feel.""

Seeing flirting as a natural expression of feelings helps you understand that there are situations where it's appropriate to flirt even if a pick-up isn't a socially appropriate outcome.  Women like to be appreciated; there's never any harm in communicating honest admiration and even attraction.  You don't have to worry about being creepy by flirting with women out of your league, or even flirting a little bit with a married woman.  You only have to worry about what feelings you communicate via your flirting.  Never express the feeling that a woman SHOULD go home with you, or that you'll be aggrieved or in any way judgmental if she doesn't.  (Or do if you want.  It's douchey, and like all douchey things, it probably works on some people.)  If you find yourself at a bar sitting next to Natalie Portman, flirt away, but make sure you don't even express the HOPE that she'll go home with you, because dude, she's married.  That would be insulting.  Just allow your admiration for her beauty and accomplishment to shine through.  (And stop if she gets bored.)  If you're flirting with your girlfriend's sister or your buddy's wife, make sure you are A1 super pro all-star at expressing your feeling of the appropriate boundaries in your relationship, and make sure your feelings really do reflect those boundaries.  That's elite level shit right there, and even expressing things perfectly to your flirting partner won't save you if the third party misunderstands.  I don't play with that fire except in very, very limited and impossible to misunderstand ways, but others have more confidence in their skills.  

Personally, I've found this perspective on flirting to be extremely liberating, and it has helped across my entire life.  The ability to express your feelings more flamboyantly is EXTREMELY useful when you find yourself communicating with people who are, shall we say, a bit ""louder"" with their emotions than the family or culture you grew up in.  Also, it's much healthier to habitually express yourself than to habitually repress yourself.  Every time you mute your emotional reaction to something, you are sending a message to yourself that you and your feelings are not socially accepted.  When you express yourself, sometimes people will disagree or even laugh, but at least you respected yourself enough to speak up.  Being open about your feelings might alienate your from some of your habitual acquaintances, but it will also help you find like-minded people. (Remember in American History X when Ed Norton took off his shirt in the prison yard so everyone could see his swastika tats?  ""All the wrong people knew who I was anyway, so I figure I'm just gonna put up a flag and hope a friend sees it.""  I wish I could come up with an equally good non-evil example, but Ed Norton's character understood that it was better to let his freak/Nazi flag fly and hope for allies than to surrender his pride to his detractors by hiding who he really was.)

And, of course, it's very nice to meet someone and know that all you have to do is let your feelings drive your behavior.  There are some toxic feelings that drive women away, but they're the feelings that any nice person can dispense with:  self-hatred, hostility, coldness, fatalism, and so on.  You don't have to radiate world-mastering confidence.  It's okay to be nervous and a little self-conscious.  After you date a few women who are attracted to anxious, self-conscious guys, you might decide that you aren't actually into such women.  In that event, you can examine your feelings and your way of expressing them to figure out what you should change to attract the women you really want.  Or you might enjoy dating those women for a while, have a revolutionary leap in confidence, and suddenly find yourself going out with a different kind of woman, because your way of expressing yourself naturally changed to reflect your increasing confidence.  Awesome how that works, eh?  The way men and women get together will start to seem like an imperfect but somewhat logical system rather than a bizarre cross between mountain sheep mating rituals, the Konami code, and Rube Goldberg's acid dreams.  For you, one part of the system is malfunctioning:  your ability to express yourself openly and accurately.  Fix that and you will get to see the system working as intended.

The statement that has always stuck with me was a pancreatic cancer patient, a 42 year old mother of 4 who had been on and off our unit with infections and other complications for months. She and her family were very religious, lots of praying and Bible reading. 

I worked nights at the time and she was in for anemia of unknown origin. She was very weak and getting lots of blood products. I went in to check on her and she was staring at the wall in the dark. It took me a minute to determine if she was dead or just staring. I checked her fluids and she quietly asked me, ""What if there's nothing?"" 
I stood there, dumbfounded, not knowing what to say. Finally, I said, ""Either way, sounds peaceful."" She nodded quietly and closed her eyes.

She died the next day from a massive hemorrhage.

True,kyraniums,,,"I wasn't a medical professional, but I worked at our local hospital serving drinks and food during my college years. There was this lady in Oncology, she was posh, proud and a little cranky. 

My drink cart served regular coffee, tea and soda. When I first asked her what she wanted to drink, she asked for an espresso. We had those at the doctor's lounge, so I got her one. I did that every night I worked at Oncology, and we always had a little chat. I noticed she never got any visitors, and I felt bad for her. Once I got to know her a little better, I noticed she was really sweet, but just a little lonely. 

After two months or so, her condition got much worse, but she still wanted her espresso - just to smell it, she said. One night, it was close to Christmas and the hospital was almost deserted, I was working at another department when one of my co-workers came looking for me. He said some cranky lady in Oncology had asked for me. I immediately knew who, and made a visit to the doctor’s lounge on my way there. 

When I walked in with my espresso, the room smelled of death. She was a little pile of misery in that big hospital bed. I walked up to her, and put the espresso on the nightstand. She grabbed my hand and said ‘I know you weren’t allowed to bring me those espressos, but you did, and you always took the time to talk to me, unlike many people in this hospital. And by doing that, you gave me more kindness than anyone close to me has in the last couple of years. Don’t forget that it doesn’t take much to make someone’s day.’ I sat with her until she fell asleep. The next time I got there, she was gone. The nurse said she’d passed away that night after I brought her that last espresso. 

I still think about her every now and then, especially around Christmas. It sounds silly, but I really took her advice to heart. Even though it’s pretty obvious, my memory of her always gives me that extra push when I’m hesitant to go out of my way to help others.

True,[deleted],,,"30a: Correct.  
30b: Wrong. To five dp it's 0.81915, you round up the 5 so the answer is 0.8192. Rounding errors, who needs them?

31a: Wait, your calculator isn't allowed now? Correct.  
31b: Is it tan^(-1)(-2/6) or tan^(-1)(-2/5)? 
-2/6: tan^(-1)(-2/6)=-tan^(-1)(2/6)=-18.4°. The two values are thus (360-18.4)° and (180-18.4)°, or {161.6°,341.6°}  
2/5: Correct. Not sure you need so many decimal places, three dp is usually a safe maximum *unless they specify for more*.

32: Is that a minus sign in your equation? tan≠-opp/hyp, tan=opp/hyp. Confusing question and you made some typos but, if your interpretation is correct, then your answer is right.

33: Alright, Eliza, no need to do that. Correct, same as last question.

34: Wrong. You got **b** wrong somehow, despite writing down the right equation. **c** is correct.

∠B=(180-(∠A+C))°=97.1°  
**a**csc(A)=**c**csc(C)=**b**csc(B)  
27.3csc(33.7)=**c**csc(49.2)=**b**csc(97.1)  
**c**=27.3sin(49.2)csc(33.7)=37.2cm  
**b**=27.3sin(97.1)csc(33.7)=48.8cm

A simple check you could do is to ensure that b&gt;c&gt;a... as B&gt;C&gt;A.

35: Probably correct. Cba to check this one, sorry.

36: Correct.

37a: Correct.  
37b: Wrong. cos(ϑ)cos(ϑ)=cos^(2)(ϑ) and sec(ϑ)sec(ϑ)=sec^(2)(ϑ). Not sure how you simplified that

38a: Your third step makes no sense? tan(x)cos(x)+tan(x)=tan(x)(cos(x)+1), that should be your third step.  
38b: Great proof.  
38c: Alright proof. Simpler to multiply everything by sin(x) at the start and then it's a simple sin^(2)(x)+cos^(2)(x)=1 identity.

41a: Right but ambiguous. It's best to refer to the function being plotted and not the axes. You'd either translate the function 60° to the right or the axes 60° to the left. [60°,0]  
41b: Right but not ambiguous (sorry...). Stretch the function by scale factor 2 in the y direction.  
41c: Wrong but again... stretch the x axis horizontally by scale factor 1/2. You're right about the period but it's not really an answer. You just need the correct terminology!  
41d: Stretched by a scale factor of 3 in the y direction, that's right. There is a minus sign, so the whole function is also reflected about the x axis. AFTER THAT you move one unit in the y direction, [0,1]. If you did it before then you'd have a different equation like 3(-(sin(x))+1) or -(3(sin(x)+1)) so order of operations matters.

42,43: Correct.

44: Can't see it?

45: You 'sketched' past the domain. You need to get the operations in the right order.  
3sin(2***(x-60°)***)-1 First the phase is changed.  
3sin(***2***(x-60°))-1 Then the x axis is streched by scale factor 1/2 (or squashed by 2, watevs).  
***3***sin(2(x-60°))-1 Then the y axis is streched by scale factor 3.  
3sin(2(x-60°))***-1*** Then the whole graph is translated one unit down in the y direction.

46a: That doesn't look sinusoidal to me. You wanna draw a full period starting at [0,2.5] peaking at [1,53] and ending at [2,2.5].  
46b: Yeah.  
46c: That's right but... -cos(x)=sin(x-π/2) so the answer could simply be 25.25(1-cos(x))+2.5

True,[deleted],,,"Let me just get the themes straight here.

You got assaulted, and you call your boyfriend to tell him. He barely speaks to you and the call ends after 5 minutes.

You begged him to come see you and he said he couldn't.

Two hours later he was at his cousin's house. He could go there but he couldn't go to your house.

You're on the phone again, the same night you got assaulted, and he tells you to *make it quick* so you don't bother some other fucking people.

Then he booty calls you. You just had a stranger assault you and your boyfriend who couldn't come over to support you, wants you **to go to him** so you can have sex.

Why the fuck did he call you a feminazi? Was it in the context of the assault? 

He doesn't know what to say? Shitting me right now?

Did he ask if you were ok? Did he ask if you needed anything? Did he ask how you felt?

Either he's a sociopath, or he doesn't give a fuck about you. 

This isn't about you, don't internalize this. You are not at fault nor are you responsible for how big of a monstrous inhuman fucking waste of shit this guy is being right now.

Don't blame yourself. Dump his sorry, wasteful, shithead ass and surround yourself with people who care about you and your feelings.

There comes a time in everyone's life when they have a moment to 'man up' as it were. His came and passed. He failed pitifully. Why are you wasting your time with this failure of a man?

He's 25 years old? What the fuck has he been doing for his adult years? What the fuck is this guy thinking?

6 months with his girlfriend and he doesn't know how to say 'Are you ok? Do you need me?'

My fucking dog knows that if I start crying it's the right thing to do to come and lick my face and try to comfort me. A grown adult man doesn't know how to comfort his girlfriend?

I call bullshit. This guy has no empathy. He is a waste of your time. 

Fuck but you are strong for even being able to get out of bed and on to your computer after this. Good for you.

True,sinpatria,male,,"Well, if having sex with others *really* is not a problem, then keep communicating with each other. Be brutally honest about your doubts, fears, and deep feelings. Be honest about your happy feelings too; do not feel like you need to hold back because your SO is elsewhere. Continue to be happy for one another, encourage each other to meet new people and explore new things, don't sit on Skype the whole time and miss out. 

When I transferred universities, I stayed with my girlfriend in a LDR for six months afterward. We talked on skype, the phone, and texted almost 24/7, and that killed the relationship. After a while, you get bored of each other when you make each other all you have. She would get jealous if I went out, or if I had to work. After a while, I got really tired of the whole thing, I preferred working over talking to her. I started to lie about what I was doing because I couldn't handle conversations with her. I would tell her I was busy at work when really I was doing nothing. She got to party with her friends all the time, and since we were not cool with each other seeing others, jealousy arose on both sides. It went from a LDR to a prolonged break up.

My advice broken down.

* Be honest about positive and negative feelings, you are human, if you get jealous, tell him, but work through that jealousy *together*

* Do **NOT** call/text/skype each other all of the time, you guys will have more interesting conversations and you can both grow independently.

* Be happy for the another with what they get to experience.

* You are abroad, experience that, I knew too many girls who just talked to their boyfriends all of the time when they were studying abroad, and not a single one of those relationships nor the abroad experience ended successfully.

True,Ceret,,,"Getting therapy and volunteering at times like this is very old and very good advice. When Serenus, the praetor of the Roman night watch, wrote to his councillor, the philosopher Seneca, in about 50AD seeking advice on a personal crisis, Seneca wrote back suggesting he take time out to quietly reflect on his values (similar to modern therapy) and that he increase his voluntary contributions to and engagement with society. Neat, huh? We now understand the mechanisms of how this works, but this good advice was being given 2000 years ago and it holds up just as well today.

OP, I'm sorry you are being treated like this. It can be hard for a partner of someone who has been assaulted - feelings of powerlessness and emasculation and rage that cannot be expressed because one wants to put ones own issues aside to be of more help. Mutual grieving can be a better option. But, frankly, it is hard for me to read that situation into yours. It sounds like you have simply been abandoned. If your partner cannot be a loving, safe sanctuary for you in a time like this, they're not really the partner you deserve. You will go through hard times again life (though hopefully nothing like this). You want someone who will hold your hand and turn to face them together with you.

True,IntelligentBacteria,fry,,"I have thankfully only met very nice and friendly Americans on my travels.

You just have to know how to talk to them! 

My parents have lived in the US so they adapted to the culture, and when they moved back to Europe they where considered weird because they talked too much. 

Americans are friendly with strangers, with people they don't know, always politely waving or saying Hi to everyone. I love Americans.

On the bus, they talk with strangers. In Sweden, the only time a stranger talked to me on the bus was when I accidentally sat on the side of her jacket. 

Americans come from and ask how your day was. They listen to what you have to say. Probably, they don't give a shit about you but it's still nice to have someone to talk to after a really shitty day. Even for just a short time. 

Here in Europe it's not very socially accepted if you talk to people on public transportation and stuff. They just look at you and think ""What the fuck creep"". 

Eh, I like them Americans. I like your culture too. All the Americans I know/ the American culture my parents experienced was something like my dream culture to live in. 

I know that stuff has changed a ton over the years. 

I one fine day wish to move to America. I moved from Hungary when I was 9, now I live in Sweden. I am not really accepted in the society. I mean that I don't really fit into anywhere. In Sweden, I'm just a Hungarian. In Hungary, I'm just a Swede. 

This depresses me so much. Do you know what it's like to have no nationality? What am I supposed to say when people ask where I'm from? 

My dream as a kid was to have the perfect Christmas. With a big tree, tons of presents, happiness and snow. 

I never got it. Every Christmas was about trying to change. Every Christmas, I take a look at myself and see what parts I can sand off the rough egdes. How can I make myself fit into the society.

It's like an impossible puzzle. When you think you made the piece fit just right, you realize it doesn't fit the other part at all. 

Part of this perfect Christmas obsession comes from the movie Home Alone. I watched so many times when I was younger, constantly saying ""Thats how I wanna live"".

Well of course, being young and naive I never knew what the negatives sides to my dream where. I didn't know that America was too far away to just move there. I didn't know that I was never going to be able to afford living in the US. 

I didn't know that my dream was never going to come true. 


Edit: Thank you guys for the moral support. You have no idea how much better this makes me feel. 
Really, thank you all. I upvoted every single reply.

I cant leave europe for now because I still have to go to university, but after that, I'll move to the US, and hopefully succeed. It's my biggest goal in my life.... And my dream.

True,Gaywallet,,,"&gt;The LSD molecule binds to the serotonin receptors (and many other types of receptors) in your brain like a key in it's own lock. The molecule is slightly different though, which causes a new sort of connection to be made, which in turn creates a whole new door of perception through which you experience all of your senses. 

I don't think you understand pharmacodynamics. 

Yes, it binds to the receptor. Yes, this is *sort of* analogous to a key/lock mechanism in the traditional sense that you learn in intro biology.

It does not, however, cause a new sort of connection to be made. When it binds to the receptor, it causes the receptor to increase its affinity to the particular neurotransmitter that receptor recognizes. This causes additional signals to be sent down this neural track, leading to the brain to interpret this as signals of additional potency. Which receptors it binds to, effects which signals are amplified. The senses, for example, use a fair deal of serotonin (5HT-2a, for example is used a lot in visual perception) and this leads to hallucinations or enhanced perception.

That would be HotKinkyJo (the rectal abyss...I have no idea who the girl in the hat is...probably all the way up to her ankles by now), she regularly does stuff like that, and is a pretty famous name in the more extreme side of porn now, given she's the first girl capable of taking stuff so deep (I say girl, because there's been videos for -years- of fat hairy men taking ladies arms up to the armpit up their shitholes)


It's not a bad idea when done right, as you see in the gif, most porn-stars, unsurprisingly, do what they do right. With practice and stretching. Basically in your normal human anywhere from 6 to 9 inches up your rectum the colon takes a sharp ninety degree turn towards your spine, and then back up again; the sigmoid colon. With practice, you can 'stretch out' the sigmoid, so that it no longer has that bend and your rectum leads straight up into the colon. That's how people like HKJ do what they do, and they take it so very deep because a) your body can to varying extends push the organs out of the way safely, it's how you can eat two 12"" pizzas and a bottle of pop in a single sitting without flattening your heart, people like HKJ can do it especially well, and secondly, the objects bend and follow the curves deeper into the intestines. Armpit deep fisting men have the hand pressing back down into the pelvic reigon, with the forearm stretched horizontally across their belly and the bicep pushing up through the first length of colon. The girl fisting HKJ in the gif is quite small, and later in the video HKJ lies on her back and the girl raises her fist up, making an -enormous- bulge in Jo's stomach (think, chest-burster bulges), because she's small enough and HKJ's organs are shifty enough for her hand to still be pushed right up to the very top of her colon.


It is, of course, a bad idea to do it randomly. Stretching out your sigmoid without plenty of practice and very slowly over lots of time can -wreck- it, giving you pretty much permanent diarrhoea (the sigmoid holds back your shit for the colon to suck the last of the water out.) HKJ and other professionals...or intelligent amateurs, did it slowly enough that even though the bends are straightened out, the ring of muscle is still easily powerful to hold everything in (for example, there's a video where she stuffs a rubber fist all the way up her ass, and uses the sigmoid sphincter to hold it inside by the wrist...it's probably what her body's doing to that girl's forearm as well.)


Don't ask how I know...

True,[deleted],,,"Back story: My mom had decided she wanted to raise me independently, so  my father obeyed her wishes. My mother married my (step) dad when I was 5 and when I was 8 they had a boy. They got divorced last spring. 

A few weeks ago I was sitting in the library writing an essay when I see that I have a friend request and when I saw the name my mom told me was that of my biological father, I screamed at the top of my lungs in front of everyone in the library, and ran out until I gained enough composure to come back. I decided after about an hour, and after calling my mom about it, that I was going to accept his friend request.


The first thing he said to me in a message was, ""I'm sorry. I do think about you a lot."" He also explained how he found it very hard to find me online, but did so through my mom who he also sent a request to. 

I have a feeling he waited because of the fact that my mom was married for 10 years. I have no grudges against him and neither did my mom. After all, it was her decision to take care of me on her own.


So anyways, I saw in his pictures there was a girl who looked just like me and I knew she was my sister. How could it be that a 10 year old sister of mine has been living out there and I never knew it?? It was unbelievable. 

My mom began talking with my bio dad again, and they decided to make the trip up this weekend to see me perform as Gretel in Hansel and Gretel. 

I got to spend the weekend with my bio dad and my new sister (along with my 13 year old brother and other family members) and got to know her. At the end of the show, they had to go back home, but when my sister saw me, she ran to me and gave me the biggest hug and wouldn't let go! She is one of the most adorable little girls on the planet! I bought her a cute owl necklace and gave her the jacket she is wearing in the picture. 

So that is the story of how I united with my biological father and my little sister. 

Oh I forgot to mention.. my mom and bio dad are now currently dating!

2. Trivial though it may be, I'm a line cook and part of working in that culture as a chick is having people fucking hate you just for existing. One such manager came off of a break and picked up a pan of near-boiling oil (it was a dungeon of a kitchen, low visibility) and in the way he picked it up it coated him from his jaw to his wrist. His reaction was to freeze and explain to us all that it was fine and he was fine and everything was fine. He was so far into shock it was eery. I hated the guy (who happily and frequently crowed that I had no place in a kitchen because vagina), but the injury and... the smell. Cooked people don't smell that much different from cooked... any other mammal.

#4 is Charlie Potatoes.

Charlie was a train hobo. The old school sort who would abide by and chide people over hobo law. Charlie lived in the hotel (now a condemned, abandoned space) over my former kitchen of half a decade for a few years in the 1950s, faking paperwork and excuses for being a blatant draft dodger. To quote Charlie, he was a ""Resourceful fuck of a rascal, that flaming faggot no g'damn jail knew what to do with. The VA feeds me the same, even if I only ever earned it on my knees."" I'll say it now, his legend may loom larger because we only heard it from him and a few of the other hobos who stopped nearby (the place I worked was an excellent hobo stop for years. The kitchen door to the outside world was on an exposed sidewalk with no huge businesses in the way of access).

My first interaction with Charlie... I was probably 20 and he had to be around 80-82. He instantly embraced me as a ""dyke"" (though I'm not, I have a mohawk, so fair enough) and started regailing me with tales of being a gentleman to the ladies and a great lay for the ""faggots"". Colorful character, yes, but still full of solid advice: Do not make promises unless you planned to spend a life with the person you made promises to. It didn't matter if the promise was the loan of a nickel or to love somebody forever, promises are a currency you don't take lightly. Charlie talk.

He frequently chastised the boys at work for showing up hungover, unkempt, etc. This is some goddamned hobo who often was just out of a night in the drunk tank (he would frequently fake drunk for a place to sleep overnight) lecturing young strapping boys how to COME CORRECT in behavior and presentation. 

Since our kitchen door led right to the sidewalk, Charlie often brought us gifts like chairs or fans or anything that would stave off the 130+ degree kitchen heat during the summers. We had MANY bums who would come up to our window, we knew many of them by name, none of them would ever be so polite or interesting or charming as Charlie Potatoes.

So here's what it is, really.

One night I was closing with a good friend in the kitchen. Charlie showed up at the kitchen window later than usual, and I asked if he wanted his typical ""bum box"" (a few kinds of meat, red beans and rice, cooked vegetables) and he kind of stared glassy-eyed and said no. I went out to smoke a few minutes later and Charlie was still out there. I realized he was wearing a suit with a skinny tie. It fit oddly but was worn and so... CHARLIE I realized he'd pulled it out of one of his hidey-holes somewhere. He had them in spades all over the city. I say, ""Hey, Charlie, you sure you don't want anything to eat?"" At this point he was standing at the edge of our sidewalk, staring into a street lamp, ""No, girly girl, you know I mean what I say, I don't need food tonight.""

""Charlie, are you okay?"" Silence. ""Charlie?"" I almost walked towards him to shake him (shit, I knew him for years and never really touched him) because I assumed he was drunk and he said ""No, no..."" then turned really slowly and looked me in the eye on the verge of tears and said, ""You just... tell them pretty closeted faggot boys that I'm thankful for everything. And thank you.""

Then stiff-legged, he walked off.

Another local bum, Wingnut, told us the next night that Charlie had died about an hour later.

...here's where I'd get philosophical were I even close to awake. Suffice to say that Charlie dying was really fucking hard for me, and I assume worse for him. He's legendary to numerous people, but never had the stability to write it down. He never had the family support to pass it on. He just had a bunch of punk-asses in a pirate kitchen to listen to his mythos and an alleyway and old suit to die in on an empty stomach.

... Shit. Yeah. There you go.

Edit: So holy cow, I didn't expect this to get seen by many people at all when I wrote it. It was the first time I had really taken the time to put any of my feelings about Charlie into words.

---

The hall is its usual Monday morning chatter, hustle and bustle. The kids are excited to catch up with their friends' weekends, and the usual pinching and hair pulling is causing a ruccus somewhere at the back of the hall.

I'm a little bit nervous. It's rare that I'm asked to speak in front of the entire school and my peers, but the head master insisted that as the English teacher, I was the best person to explain this to the children. I'd spent a good week or so researching it myself, as it was a concept entirely unfamiliar.

In all honesty, it had felt a bit out of place to try and explain this to children aged seven to twelve, but I was going to be professional, if not a little sweaty, in my execution.

The head teacher read out the usual announcements. One of the girls in blue class was in hospital and she thanked them all for the ""get well soon"" card. There was a bake sale coming up.

All while through the morning prayer, the acetate slides were getting slippery in my hands, and I must've looked a wreck. The lovely young lady in the maths department kept giving me worried glances, but I was too far away to properly explain what the situation was. The inevitable ""Forever and ever, amen"" came, and that was my cue to stand up and begin the talk. I walked over and took the mic from the head teacher, and he gave me a nod to start.

I fumbled the mic to my mouth. ""Good morning, Steepleton.""

""Good morning, mister Creedy, good morning everyone."" came the tired response in a jarring mangle of prepubescent voices. 

""Your"" I cast my eyes across the stage to Mike Sanders, the grey-haired man who had put me into this position ""head teacher has asked me to talk to you about something today.""

Perhaps it's just going to be a joke and they'll stop me before I start. I try and draw it out as long as I can by messing with the projector and rearranging my slides. As the hall begins to rumble with whispers, chatter and eventually laughter, I realise I can't delay it any longer.

""Analangus is a term used to describe an act between a man and a woman or a man and a man."" I switched on the projector, showing my hand-traced diagram of the biological models of a man and a woman standing side by side. The projector hums with its dusty fan, its wavering sound like the nervousness in my own voice.

""Angus is a type of beef, known for its quality and meatiness, and some people have decided this makes a good analogy for the man's penis."" I put my biro onto the projector and the ghostly x-ray image of the pen shows up on the amber projection behind me as I point to the penis.

The hall is silent at this point. Not just quiet. It was the sort of silence that allowed you to hear the dinner ladies cooking and shifting pots at the other end of the school. Something which you could only hear when you walked past reception which was only a few doors from the kitchen. I recall thinking that hearing the sound alone without the usual onion-rice smell was odd.

I gulped nervously, the thought that I was going to be rescued leaving my mind entirely, and continued. ""This is the anus. It's where waste comes out."" I slid the biro across the slide and pointed to the female's anus.

Muttering now from the other staff, but I continued unhindered.

""Analangus is when these two come together, when the man puts his penis inside of the anus. It is not for reproduction, but some people find it..uh..."" I'm lost for words. I feel like I could die. Thankfully it wasn't to last much longer. 

I feel a hand on my upper arm grasp me and see a podgy thumb press the switch of the projector as I'm whisked off the stage. It's the head teacher, and he is livid and beetroot red. Between gritted teeth which fleck with spittle he whispers harshly at me, ""*What the hell are you doing?*""

I'm taken aback a little by this. Was I set up this whole time so he could fire me? I'd always thought we were on good terms, but sometimes you never know.

My shock turns to anger, ""You *asked* me to explain analangus.""

A weird set of emotions passed over Mike's face, and for a moment I thought he'd had a stroke. His features finally settled on 'authority of the peace' and he said; ""I *asked* you to explain *analogous*.""

Thankfully I wasn't fired that day, and I left the school a matter of months afterwards. I sometimes hear the story repeated in staff rooms, but each time a different variation. Oh, and it earned me the nickname 'Creepy Creedy'.

True,black_hotel,,,"Edit: I should have posted this earlier, but all of this was in the late 1990s, just before the war kicked off. Most everyone I have talked to says it's gotten better since then. It also only applies to the Marine Corps. We trained with the other services and by pretty much every standard they got better treatment. The post-bootcamp Air Force trainees where I was stationed had carpeted floors in their barracks, for example. Imagine simply vacuuming instead of having to wax and buff every day. Little things like that made a big difference in morale, and we would never have been given a luxury like that, or lamps, or the ability to take a knee in formation if you lock your legs up, and so on... /end edit.

A guy who admitted that he was wetting the bed (rack) every night to get kicked out.

A couple guys who could never get the hang of marching down. They tore those guys apart verbally for days on end, and the rest of us sat there and watched.

One guy got kicked out for jerking off in the shower after a long session of being chewed out for not being able to march right.

One guy who couldn't say ""Aye, sir"" without it sounding stupid. They made him scream it non-stop for hours and hours, day after day. We called him Ernie, after Bert and Ernie, because that's what he sounded like.

If the tone of cruelty that runs through all of this isn't apparent already, it really should be. This wasn't just about training, it was also a lot about humiliating other men.

Does all training count or only basic? Because if we're talking all training I saw more than one guy go completely berserk. One of them assaulted their training staff sergeant with a fluorescent light, the other charged the fence at an armory. The first one flipped out because his marriage was heading south, best I can tell the second flipped out because his parents weren't proud of him for graduating boot camp.

Also every boot camp platoon has at least one person who is called a rock, meaning completely no-brained. That person goes through absolute hell until about halfway through the training, when the staff finally realize they're legitimately half-retarted and not just faking it, at which point they tend to become kind of the platoon mascot (""if recruit Bradley can do it, you can goddamn do it"", that kind of thing).

There was some sketchy shit, too. I saw a guy get tricked into assaulting staff once. What they did was get right in his face screaming, then had another staff member walk to within a few inches of his rear, then the person in front ordered him to perform an about face (turn around). Not knowing the other staff was behind him, and being very new, his clumsy movement knocked him into the staff behind him. 3 or 4 drill instructors took him outside. That was the first time I'd seen someone who was more or less a straight up thug in civilian life break. There were others. 

There was the high-school football star who excelled at everything, mocking everyone else along the way, then completely failed the rifle range. He ended up threatening staff. Staff on the rifle range are all scared; no one has bullet proof vests, just flak jackets. The platoon before mine one of the recruits killed himself on the range because he couldn't qualify. At that time, the range was one of the last things you have to do, so he'd completed 90% of boot camp by that point. Anyway so some of our instructors were there for that and were still in counsceling. I mean, you have to understand a lot of Drill Instructors are things like admin and computer tech guys. Every MOS has to be a Drill Instructor to keep getting promoted anymore.

Post boot camp training I saw a lot of peoples careers end before they began. Adultery got a lot of them (if it was discovered, the woman can claim it was non-consensual, and suddenly you're breaking big rocks up into little rocks for 20 years to life). One dude ""borrowed"" some night vision goggles and ""lost"" them. To be honest it was just very shitty and pretty much everyone was willing to fuck everyone else over for the slightest political gain. There was no ""esprit de corps"" after boot camp, except maybe among the officers. Enlisted marine corps is just a whole lot of hate stuffed into a package far too small for it.

Anyway there was a lot. The whole thing was surreal. I'm sure I've forgotten a lot of things. Probably better that way.

edit: I don't know if this is relevant but I feel compelled to post it. I saw a couple of movies while on my ""vacation"" in between boot camp and Marine Combat Training, and of course one of them was Full Metal Jacket. I was still fully indoctrinated at that point and I watched it back completely straight, legs crossed, arms resting on my legs, fingers together, the way you are taught to always sit in boot camp. I got drunk, but I still *couldn't* sit any other way, couldn't even slouch. My friends found that hilarious. I can't describe how it made me feel, exactly, but unpleasant is an understatement. The indoctrination really gets to you in physical ways that are hard to explain to someone who hasn't been through it. That wore off after a while, for the most part, but never completely. When I take a step, for example, I'm always conscious of what foot I'm leading with. I don't always lead with my left (the proper one for marching) but whether I do or don't I'm actively thinking about it every time the crosswalk light flashes green, even 10 years later.

The second movie was Saving Private Ryan. I sat with my wife and watched the men get blown up, and pick up their arms, and so forth, and realized that was my new job, and we both sat there and just cried. Fireworks shows were very difficult for me to take for a few years after I got out. I was a missile tech and night vision tech, fwiw, so I was on the missile range when they were doing their live fires. Being on a missile range feels like this: ""Please don't misfire, please don't misfire, please at least go 20 yards and sit there and we all wait to see if it blows up"". I never really got used to that part of the job. Or tanks. Anything with hydraulics is scary as hell. You don't want to be in the way when a tank turrets main gun levels, either inside the cockpit or out. You talk about something that will make tough men scream with fear, doing some shit like that when they aren't paying attention will def do it.

True,tgjer,,,"No, it wouldn't. This isn't about social gender roles, or culturally stereotyped ""masculine"" or ""feminine"" behavior. A trans woman is not a man who would have ""body acceptance"" if they didn't have society telling them it's wrong to like ""girly"" things, and a trans man is not a butch woman who decides to live as a man to get social permission to engage in ""masculine"" behavior.

There are trans women who are butch lesbians, who prefer fishing waders to heels and would never be caught dead in makeup. They didn't transition to live as women because they were trying to match social ""gender roles,"" they transitioned because they *are* women and needed to live as such.

There are trans men, men born appearing female who transition to live as men, who are gay queens. Hell I'm a trans man, I'm primarily attracted to men, and I couldn't exactly be described as ""butch."" I have an extensive nailpolish collection and an unholy love of glitter. Hobbies include baking and jewlry making.

One of the most wonderful, life-saving things about the testosterone supplements that finally sent me through male puberty, is that I can indulge in whatever ""feminine"" hobbies or fashion choices I like. I can wear and do absolutely anything I want, and know that I will still always obviously be a ***man*** even if I'm covered in glitter and making cupcakes.

I didn't transition so that I could do ""masculine"" things, I transitioned because I am a man and a life of being constantly mistaken for a woman was a mind-warping hell. And physical dysphoria is far more basic than even that. Were I alone on an island with no human contact, the physical dysphoria remains.

Imagine a character like Robert Paulson, from *Fight Club.* He was a man who lost his genitals to cancer, and the treatment regime caused him to grow massive boobs. His distress at his physical condition is partly the social humiliation of losing the physical attributes of maleness, but it's also the sheer physical horror at a body that *doesn't work like it is supposed to.*

The situation of trans men is not that different; the physical condition causing distress is just congenital rather than acquired after birth. A trans man is not a woman who ""becomes"" a man. A trans man is a man who, by fluke of medical luck, looked female at birth and was assumed to be a girl until he was old enough to correct the mistake.

There's nothing wrong with our brains. All attempts to re-wire brains to make trans women into men and trans men into women, have failed disastrously because they are attempting to ""fix"" something that isn't broken.

True,frodegar,,,"No, but at one time Morpheus thought Cypher was the One and that's why he unplugged Cypher in the first place.

Consider this:

* Cypher is older than the rest of the crew. He looks like he's in his forties or early fifties while the second in command, Trinity, isn't much older than thirty. They made a point that unplugging older people is problematic and they were hesitant to unplug Neo even though he was in his twenties.

* There's clearly some history between Trinity and Cypher, even though he looks like a shaved troll doll and has the personality of a cinder block. The Oracle told Trinity that she would fall in love with the One. She may not have been impressed with Cypher, but trusting the Oracle, so she threw herself at him anyway.

* The Oracle told Morpheus that he would find the One and she told Trinity that she would fall in love with the One. Even the free range humans are excited about Neo. Obviously, Nebuchadnezzar's primary mission is finding and recruiting the One. Why then is Cypher even on board if he's so vocal about the One being a load of bullshit? It's because no one wants him, and since Morpheus popped him, Morpheus has to babysit him.

Now, look at it from Cypher's point of view. He's an aging, forever alone, hacker who is approached by the equivalent of a Jedi master and told that he is destined to become a superhero and save humanity. Meanwhile, a babe like Trinity is practically humping his leg. All he needs to do is take this one little pill...

When the Oracle talked to Neo, she says that he has the gift, but he isn't the One. It's clear that being the One requires both the gift and the attitude, and Morpheus is pretty good ad finding people with the gift. I think it's fair to say that Cypher wouldn't have been unplugged if he wasn't a brilliant hacker who had almost as much latent ability to manipulate the Matrix as Neo. He lacked in other areas.

As for the restaurant scene, Cypher told Neo that when he looks at the operator's displays he doesn't see characters anymore, he just sees the Matrix. My theory is that Cypher wasn't jacked in. I think the restaurant scene takes place at the same time as the conversation with Neo, and Cypher can taste a steak by watching the display in the same way that a conductor can listen to music by reading a score.",0,1355249900,,0,False,1,c7ewkko,t3_14nzc6,t1_c7ewkko,t1_c7evanu,,1430644145,1969,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,1969
True,Heythere-You,,,"I am not sure why this is a confession. You live in a society who openly thinks the exact same as you regarding this issue :)

You need to ask yourself *why* you think it's immoral. Is it because you think these people have an obligation to stay attractive (what *you* consider attractive)? Is it because you assume that their fat means they never cared about health, or are obsessed with greed and food, or made bad choices?

You say 'I know some people have issues' - there are more than just some. We always accept that there are lots of thin people in the world who can [eat *a lot* and love food but still stay slim](http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/13zpu2/i_love_food_so_much_i_actually_have_dreams_about/) and no one bothers about calling them a liar or even caring much about their 'health', yet we call fat people liars and lecture them about health if they tell us that - actually - they eat a moderate amount of food and do moderate exercise. Why? Because it's not just you who has this prejudice. Society has.

And for that reason, I'm going to get a lot of downvotes for this ;)

There are indeed fat people who are obsessed with food, eat thousands of calories a day in junk, and as a result screw their bodies up - but it's not all the fat people you see. Just like there are absolutely skinny people who eat pretty much nothing, have no muscle, and as a result screw their bodies up. Those people we say have eating disorders, and they get sympathy. And we *know* that not all skinny people are anorexic or have problems with food. Again, it's not just you - *everyone* has this prejudice, and it's *nothing* to do with health.. just appearance.. and you could probably talk about it openly with minimal backlash. And the backlash you *do* get, you'd still be defended by the majority.

**Don't be so hard on yourself for feeling the way society feels.** You're conditioned that way. The diet industry makes too many billions of dollars to risk you *not* feeling that way and being free pressure on fat people to buy their product for them. You can either accept it and keep mindlessly following it, or work on yourself and break out of it.

Problem is.. breaking out of it as hard. We're humans.. we love to hate, and judge, no matter how unfair it is.. And we also love to defend our 'right' to do so, and excuse it, because we don't like being reminded that we are irrational and hateful.

True,geojenly,,,"My mom was born in Germany, married an American solider, and moved to the states in 1992 after having my brother and me. We moved to Washington, then to Texas, then to Arkansas where we settled down for a few years. In 1999 my parents' marriage was ultimately destroyed, mostly by my dad. By this time online chat rooms were becoming really popular, so my mom would go on a few times a week and make ""internet friends."" After a few months, she began messaging a man with the username ""DillyBar62"" who lived in Manitoba, Canada. They chatted for almost a year before meeting, and when they did, well... I guess it really was love at first sight. Fast forward another year and they're married. Fast forward ANOTHER year and we're moving to Canada from Arkansas!

I'm no longer in Canada (though most days I wish I was), but my mom and step-dad are still together! They own a business together, my mom is no longer suffering culture-shock from the backwoods of Arkansas, and my brothers and I got a nifty father figure out of the whole deal. After seeing the way my dad treated my mom the rare occasions he was home, it was such a breath of relief when I saw how happy my mom was with this new man. He's always been there for her and to this day he still treats her like a princess. 

Before he met us, we were in poverty. My mom had to donate blood just to put ramen noodles on the table some nights. It was heartbreaking for her, but then this knight in shining armor (sorry for the cheesiness, but I can't place a better word) came along and gave us a better life. I'll never be able to thank him enough.

True,Boredzilla,,,"We 'met' back in 2004. She used to read and comment on my blog, which led to me reading and commenting on hers. We then graduated to emails, IM, long, frequent phone conversations, and finally deciding it was time to meet. The only problem? I was in London, England, she was in Orange County, California.

In November of 2004, I flew out to meet her in person for the first time. I'd never even been to the States before. It was amazing. She was amazing. We had such an awesome week together that we both cried when it was time for me to go home, not knowing when we'd see each other again.

In January, she flew out to England. I proposed, she accepted. In April, we drove from LA to Vegas (and I checked 'Fear And Loathing road trip' off my bucket list), where we were married.

The next year was a tough one. I had to stay in England while I went through the visa application process. We saw each other several times, but not being able to be with my new wife or start my new life drove me crazy. Dealing with the USCIS was a nightmare, and the trail of paperwork and interviews felt as though it was never going to end.

I stuck it out, though. We stuck it out. In February of 2006, I got my visa. Walking out of the American Embassy that day, I remember looking around at the city I'd grown up in, the city I was about to leave behind for good. I loved my wife so damn much, and I couldn't wait for my American adventure to begin.

It was a new life. I was in awe of the woman I'd married and in awe of the country I'd moved to. Sometimes I'd stop what I was doing and just think about where I was and who I was with and I'd feel like the luckiest motherfucker alive.

Domestica set in. We both did well at our jobs, moving onward and upward and improving our home situation. In 2008, we bought a house. In 2010, we renewed our wedding vows on Maui with her family (who hadn't been able to be there for the original quickie ceremony) present. My wife was beautiful that day. She'd always wanted to be a proper bride, and she deserved to be. It was like being back in Vegas again, that same feeling that I'd rolled the dice with no idea what I was doing and somehow won it all.

In December of that same year, she discovered she was pregnant, and on the last day of August, 2011, gave birth to a baby boy. I cut the cord. When they moved him to the incubator to weigh and measure him, I stood beside it and marveled at this tiny creature we had created. I reached for his hand and he grabbed my little finger. I was overwhelmed. My wife's mother took a picture of that moment, and I can't even look it at without tearing up.

2012 was the year things started to go wrong. The house had been a bad idea, and affording it was beginning to stress us both out. My career took a downturn when I took a job that turned out to be a whole lot different than I'd been promised, and ended up doing something I hated for less money than I needed. After six months of this, we decided that I should quit and be a stay-at-home dad to save money on childcare costs. In addition to that, I took a bartending job in the evenings so that I was contributing.

But the money was an issue. Not long after this arrangement began, my wife confessed to me that after I'd left the terrible job, she'd started saving money in a second account, in case I didn't find anything else. She'd given herself the option of taking our son and leaving me if things got too bad.

I was stunned. It was the sheer *practicality* of it. My mind flashed back to who we were when we met, when we were in Vegas, when we were finally able to live together. I started to realize that the girl I'd married had grown and changed in ways I'd been blind to.

Still, we hung on. We managed to sell the house and escape Orange County in July of this year, moving to Oregon, just a little south of Portland. She was able to transfer and I found a half-decent job. Our little boy, no longer an infant, was developing quite the personality.

Then I came home one night and she said she wanted to talk to me, that we should spend some time apart. I understood the reasons. The last few years, with the house and baby and job situations, had been emotionally draining. We'd grown apart and started having petty arguments that were never there before. We both thought some time apart would help. I agreed to move out.

Having written all this, I'm half-tempted to end with a 'tree fiddy', but fuck it, here's the truth. I suspected she was being unfaithful. We were living apart on a trial basis and we still saw plenty of each other because of our son. We even went on dates. But I noticed an obvious change in her behavior and the way she suddenly started taking more care over her appearance and going out with friends from work.

The night my marriage ended, she asked if I could come over and watch our son for a few hours while she went to see a movie. I agreed. The little guy and I hung out for a while, and then I took him upstairs and rocked him to sleep. I sing him these bluesy, lullaby versions of Johnny Cash songs and he does this sleepy grin that just about stops my heart. That night, it was Folsom Prison Blues.

My wife came home a little while later, complaining that she felt sick and just wanted to go to bed. I left.

But I didn't go home. I drove to the adjacent street and I sat in my car and I waited. Sure enough, a car I'd never seen before drove in to the cul-de-sac where we lived and parked. I pulled my hood up over my head and crept up to the end of my street in time to see a man I didn't know going into my house.

I don't have the words to describe the next hour of my life. My first instinct was murderous. I had a key. Walk in there, drag that motherfucker out into the street, and beat the mortal shit out of him. My wife, in my house, while my son slept in the room next door.

My son.

That stopped me dead in my tracks. His sleepy grin. Folsom Prison Blues. I couldn't do it. I couldn't bring the violence that was in my heart to a place where he was innocently sleeping. Being a dad means a lot of things, and one of them is protecting your kid, always.

I did laps of the block, clenching and unclenching my fists, muttering to myself like a crazy person. Finally, I talked myself down and I went home, where I sat and stared at nothing at all until the next morning, when I called her and said I wanted a divorce.

We're building something else now. We're parents. Not quite friends, but we're civil. I'm renting a shitty room in suburbia, but I'm going to get my own place in Portland once the divorce is final. I like the city a lot, and I think I'd stay even if being a dad wasn't keeping me here.

And my boy...you should see him. All he has to do is smile, and it was all worth it. Every minute.

Hope that answers your question.

True,penguindeskjob,,,"During AIT, I had a slight problem that required some investigative procedures. However, the medical facility at Ft. Lee was not sufficient enough, so they shuttled me to Ft. Eustis, where there hospital had the sort of facilities they required. After it was said and done, I was going outside to the smoking gazebo. And there some Master Sergeant saw me and came right up to me.

""Soldier, what the fuck is that on your arm?"" Mind you, most Sergeants on a training facility play a character, not themselves. They are aggressive, demeaning, and harassing. And while the regulations legitimately say you cannot curse at the trainees, it's all up to the commander's discretion. And I was never in a unit, nor encountered a unit, where this regulation was in effect. (Though, in basic, the training company behind us was not allowed to curse at the trainees. It was hilarious hearing what they would come up with in place of curse words.)

""Master Sergeant, it's my student leadership badge."" I was confused at this point. This Master Sergeant, a man built like a brick wall and a head taller than me, was up in my face about this student leadership badge I was wearing. At Ft. Lee, at least when I went there, Platoon Guides and Student First Sergeants would wear badges on our arms that show that we are student leadership. They don't do that at Ft. Eustis, I guess. So to this Master Sergeant, I was definitely out of uniform. And someone out of uniform needs to be corrected.

The alternative is getting a smoking. I was in no position to get smoked. ""You have five seconds to unfuck yourself, private. What unit are you in?"" I rattle off my company and all that. ""Where the fuck is that? Are you even from Ft. Eustis?""

""I'm stationed at Ft. Lee, Master Sergeant.""

""Did you get lost or something?"" I explained to him that Ft. Lee didn't have the medical equipment to perform the procedure. ""What procedure was it, private?""

I stumbled. I couldn't fucking remember the procedure's name. ""Sig... sigmoidoscopy?"" There might have been a few more syllables in there.

""Fucking A, private. I can't even spell that. What did they do to you?"" I explained to him and moved, calmly, from parade rest to use my hands to describe it. ""It's where they take a long, flexible tube with a camera and a flash light,"" and I put my hands out about a meter apart, ""And they shoved in my ass.""

And that's when he broke character. He went from being this pigheaded, unsympathetic asshole back to a human being. ""Holy fuck, private. I'm so sorry. When you get back to Ft. Lee, do some combatives or lift some weights. Something manly."" And he then points to my battle buddy, because trainees can never go anywhere alone, ""You, tell no one what happened.""

I, of course, had to clean up his cum and stop him from eating it. I also had to wipe for him because he would dig into his asshole and eat his own feces. 
I worked with an older gentleman in a wheelchair who would pull out his penis and masturbate in the living room while watching me. It always took several verbal prompts to get him to go to his room. He had an extra wheelchair and we would regularly have wheelchair races in his driveway. He was pervy, but had a wonderful sense of humor and loved to help. Best quote ever from him was when I asked him who he was voting for and he said ""bizmak Alabama"". He would also grope a male co worker and yell out ""I'm a homo!""  
Worked with a non verbal teenager who broke out my window on my car because I bought him the wrong kind of skittles. 
Had an entire group home of 8 teenage boys break out all the windows on my car, including my sun roof, because I caught them huffing cleaning products. 
A girl got upset an literally ate a chunk out of her own arm. She then looked at me with tears in her eyes, blood running down her cheeks and said ""I need to go to the hospital"". She then tore out one of her front teeth. That was an interesting day. 
Had a girl ask for a hug, then proceeded to latch onto my breast and wouldn't let go no matter what holds or protective measures I took. I still have a scar that looks like a bite mark on my bob 3 years later.

Autistic savants, story tellers (one client in particular would tell stories about giants wearing diapers and meeting Sasquatch), singers, great athletes...all of these people have a piece of my heart.

True,arachnophilia,,,"&gt; The ancients weren't aware that the sun rising and setting caused evening and morning? Seriously? That's your claim?

no, my claim is that they didn't consider the sun (and the moon) in the same way that modern science does. to them, it wasn't a giant ball of gas undergoing fusion, many millions of times the size of earth, and the center of our solar system. it was a collection of light, and an inhabitant of the sky.

it is *internally consistent* under those assumptions for them to have the light (raw material) and the sky (the habitation) created before the sun (the inhabitant) in *exactly* the same way the water (the raw material) and the seas (the habitation) are created before the fish or the great dragons, or the sky (habitation) is created before the birds (inhabitants), or the land (habitation) is created before the beasts and mankind (inhabitants). further, the way this is done *fits the formula* the author was using. as another user pointed out here, look at the first few days were all the habitations are created, and then the second set where the inhabitants are created *in the same order*.

no. i would say that i expect you to do *more* research, but i honestly don't. you've arrived at a *convenient* position, and i seriously doubt you'd have the motivation to look at the text beyond this convenient confirmation of your predetermined ideology. the text itself is *not* convenient, or consistent with modern science. and we shouldn't expect it to be: it was written about 2600 years ago, by people who hadn't even devised telescopes, and were just censoring earlier texts.

&gt; I would call them mnemonic devices.

except that they're not. it's word-for-word repetition. the hebrew poetic style is repetition of *similar* sounds and roots, and *synonymous* words in parallel verses. not formulaic repetition of the same phrases, unaltered, over and over and over. in any case, the poetic mnemonic devices (if that's truly what they are) are found in texts that were written to be remembered by illiterate masses, *not* in texts that primarily existed as oral traditions prior to their authorship (see, for instance, the oral torah).

&gt;&gt; there's no good evidence of this.

&gt; Again, why should I trust your word on this? Even if you had the credentials, you're not supplying any evidence.

you want me to supply evidence that your claim has no good evidence? i don't think that's how it works. in any case, i kind of *did anyways:*

&gt;&gt; rather, there is evidence that genesis 1 is a modification of earlier texts from within the hebrew tradition (see psalm 74, for instance, which contains some bits genesis 1 is missing), and that text itself borrows from texts from other cultures.

let me explain this a little more in depth, since you seem to have passed over it entirely. genesis 1 and genesis 2-4 are by different authors. there are myriad good reasons to recognize this fact, not the least of which is their markedly different style (gen 1 is formulaic, gen 2-4 uses language much more fluidly), different scopes, and different conventions for referring to yahweh (gen 1 never uses the name, gen 2-4 uses it throughout).

the interesting bit is that sections are redundant, and contradictory. gen 1 and 2 *both* contain the creation of man and woman, and of beasts. genesis 2 is a much older text, and genesis 1 part of the more recent priestly tradition, so there is good reason to think that genesis 1 duplicated parts of genesis 2 in order to remove those parts from the tradition. in other words, the source text for genesis 1 is genesis 2, in part. sections it seemed intent on removing were the creation of god by trial and error (ie: where the animals don't make a suitable mate for the man), or that god created things as they were needed by man without foreknowledge of man's needs (ie: yahweh was not omniscient). or that woman, in this trial and error creation, is the second (and thus more perfect) version of man. these are obviously challenging themes theologically, and you might understand why the priestly caste would want to do away with them.

the *more* interesting part is what's *missing* from the genesis 2 narrative. there is creation of the earth, for instance, and no creation of the seas, heaven, or life in the waters. if we turn to psalm 74, we find it covers all of that (most of what's in genesis 1) with a curious addition:

&gt;&gt; אַתָּה פוֹרַרְתָּ בְעָזְּךָ יָם  
&gt;&gt; שִׁבַּרְתָּ רָאשֵׁי תַנִּינִים, עַל-הַמָּיִם  
&gt;&gt; אַתָּה רִצַּצְתָּ, רָאשֵׁי לִוְיָתָן  
&gt;&gt; תִּתְּנֶנּוּ מַאֲכָל, לְעָם לְצִיִּים

&gt;&gt; It was You who drove back the seas with your might,  
&gt;&gt; who smashed the heads of the monsters in the waters;  
&gt;&gt; it was You who crushed the heads of Leviathan,  
&gt;&gt; who left him as food for the denizens of the desert;

the rest is mostly pretty similar to gen 1's account. but this indicates a different source mythology, and job mentions the leviathan also in god's rant about his might and glory. genesis 1 also contains the leviathan. verse 21, about the creatures of the sea, begins,

&gt;&gt; וַיִּבְרָא אֱלֹהִים, אֶת-הַתַּנִּינִם הַגְּדֹלִים

&gt;&gt; And God created the giant serpents...

with the ""tan"" (serpent) being the same as the ""tan"" in ""livyatan"" (leviathan). in fact, many modern translations render this as ""whales"" because the modern word for whale in hebrew is *livyatan*. really. we know that genesis 1 is working from J (the author of genesis 2) in this regard because the author of job and psalm 74 (and actually a few other places in the hebrew bible) all had access to J. this story, of course, is neutered on genesis 1 the same way the creation of woman is.

now, this story comes from marduk and tiamat, found in the enuma elish. we know, because it's identical in narrative, and the enuma elish is at least 100 years older than the oldest portion of the torah, J, and probably more like 1000 years older. curiously, the enuma elish is told in seven tablets. genesis 1 in seven days. this is probably not a coincidence -- genesis 1 is retaining the structure laid out in J, who probably told the narrative is seven chapters, approximately three of which are currently presented in the torah.

basically, we know where the story in genesis 1 came from, and at no point in its jewish history was it an oral tradition. it might have been prior to the authorship of the enuma elish, but that story is already so markedly different than the genesis 1 narrative that it's not even worth discussing some hypothetical oral source that came before it. the oral tradition, at that point, wouldn't even have been about yahweh, but marduk, ea, enlil, etc. it wouldn't be monotheistic, and it wouldn't be jewish, because the *written* sources already go back to before monotheism and judaism.

this is why i say that there is no good evidence for an oral tradition antedating genesis 1, and why i say there is every reason to think there wasn't one.

&gt; I agree; however, the point of view that Genesis 1 was written literally does not logically allow for one to adopt this point of view; if it was written to be meant to be taken literally, then it (and Psalm 90) were meant to be attributed to Moses,

no, don't be ridiculous. genesis 1 does not claim to be written by moses. nor does pretty much *most* anything in the torah besides the actual body of the law, the 613 mitzvot. deuteronomy claims to be a record of his words (as written by someone else, presumably joshua). i realize that *tradition* says moses wrote these books, but *the books* do not. it is entirely possible to read the text literally and not come to the conclusion that they are books by moses: you just have to *not add in stuff that isn't there*. further, even if they did claim to be books by moses (as deuteronomy *sort of* does), it's also possible to read a book literally and think it is either mistaken or deceptive. a question of how the author *meant* the book to be understood should not involve *factual* decisions about the content of those claims. it is silly to assume the book must necessarily be correct.",0,1355263978,,0,1355892680,1,c7f1a1p,t3_14mimo,t1_c7f1a1p,t1_c7euu55,,1430646445,1,False,AdviceAnimals,t5_2s7tt,1
True,FrenchFuck,,,"**Prelude:** I've received so many PMs from everyone telling their stories. I've been crying all morning at all the collective pain and suffering. If this post means anything to you or if it reminds you of a boy or a man in your life PLEASE talk to him. PLEASE just tell him how much you care. People have written saying things that wrench my heart and I can't believe this is going on all around us. Ask the boys and men in your lives if they are ok. Help them. 

[**I'm walking down that long road**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYzmVBJWUMk)

----
                        
We can't simply talk about societal pressures, we have to look at what it feels like to be that boy, that man. How you are treated, the psychological progression from ""ok"" to ""frustrated"" to ""anger"" to ""desperate"", how you necessarily have to internalize your problems, how you are set up in life only to fall through the gaping hole that is called ""the male ego"" and then to be ridiculed for being so naive as to want to express yourself

You know how you feel pressure to look good and dress nicely. You feel that everyday, no one tells you but everyone is looking and you feel those eyes on you. You can't help but notice that everyone notices. It's ingrained into society, it's accepted, you don't even realize it's there because it's omnipresent. Like air.

The same thing exists with ""be a man"". No one wants to hear how hard you have it, your problems or your emotions. ""Man up"" echos everywhere, silently, implicitly. At first an innocent term of motivation, now an ironically desperate attempt to demonstrate masculinity. The term is so confused it is now used to claim opposing behaviors as manly. A real man doesn't cry - A real man cries. Can you imagine hearing someone say ""A real woman drinks margaritas""? There is an uneasiness around being a man these days because no one knows what it means anymore. 

The worst part about these struggles is how everyone seems to be ok with it. There is no visible group advocating for a balanced masculinity or an open discussion on male identity. Male problems aren't even on the radar. If you don't ask for help what do you do? You do the only thing you can do, you internalize your pain, you ignore it and it grows silently. Who is going to help you through this? Is there anything more terrifying to society than a man who needs help? Have you ever seen a grown man cry in public? It's unsettling.

You're too ashamed and simultaneously too proud to ask for help. Asking for help means you aren't ""manning up"" like everything in culture silently tells you to do. And so everything that isn't addressed becomes that dark beast inside you, lurking at the edges. You become so out of touch with your emotions it's a surprise when you're actually happy, like it's an accident. A childish glee of a once happy childhood being crushed by your everyday repressed identity. You lose all sense of proportion. Drugs, alcohol, depression, fighting and other self-destructive behavior show up. At least self-erasure makes sense, at *least* you can control the rate of your descent. A joyous self-annihilation, like watching your own car crash in slow motion from far away, simultaneously inside the car and outside it. A symbolic interpretation of reality. This *is* in fact your true position in all this, your emotional self is a 1000 miles away observing this scene with equanimity, your actual self speeding into a brick wall.

Your friends have long since stopped caring, ignoring all the warning signs, some may reach out but you're too far gone for kind words or formal gestures. You're desperate and angry. You become fully desensitized and ignore your emotions, seeing them as obstacles. You are now a man ""at war"" with himself, the motto of this war is ""take no prisoners"". You snuff out feelings, you do this once and it makes things easier and then again, and again, and again, you're on your way down that desolate road. It becomes a comical routine, your patheticness is a joke even to yourself. You've lost all sense of reality, you're walking down that road of *[quiet desperation](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/11mk34/the_emotional_repression_issue_how_many_of_you/c6ntt2w)*. Every man that's been told to ""man up"" knows what I'm talking about. Every man that doesn't get *lucky* or ask for help in time ends up in the same place, in the gutter. Alone, cold and forgotten. Homeless both in reality and spiritually. 

The old male roles are dying if not dead. They continue to subsist in obscurity, as an after-thought or a punch-line to a joke that provokes uneasy laughter. Young men continue on in the empty space left by these non-roles, without guidance or any solid concept or understanding of themselves or their masculine identity. Education doesn't worry about boys, they've always been fine on their own, right? Boys and young men have a *much* different kind of education, a *negative* education. They are not told that their normal selves are good, fine and valuable, that being energetic, spontaneous and loud is a good thing, no, they are simply told what they *can't* do. Sit down, shut up, stop interrupting, if you can't control yourself we're going to see the principal, we'll call your parents, we're going to ridicule you. And so they grow up **literally clueless**, looking to social cues, formal structures and hyper-male caricatures for help. We all know these clueless young men, we all know how bleak a future they have, we ignore it, they ignore it, video games are always fun, right? What a heartbreaking story of normal everyday occurrence. Our sons, our brothers, our fathers pretending everything is fine, no one ever asks them ""Are you Ok?""

**Summary:** Masculinity is a deeply misunderstood concept, almost as if on purpose. Misunderstood by society as a whole, but also by women and, most offensively, by the men themselves. Everyone participates in this ""good man"" myth, completely unaware that there is no concept of a good man today, masculinity is an unknown which we can use and abuse as we see fit. Can you go a day without hearing something in the news about violence or war? Everyone knows those are male things, right? 

The bottom line is everyone has a choice in how they treat boys and men, everyone can decide whether they should be treated as human beings or if they can ""take it like a man"". No one proposes what masculinity *could* be, no one seeks to glorify or worship it, no one speaks of the hidden potential of our young men today, no one dares to give it it's proper place in society. Male identity is a negative today, ridiculed, feared and marginalized. 

What do men do in this climate? They do the only thing they can do, ignore all of it, live their owns lives, try to get by somehow, they ""man up"".

**Update**

I just wanted to write something to all those who've read this or who are reading it. Thank you for taking the time to read it. If you read through that and felt something inside your chest then **you know** there are things you need to talk about. Please reach out and ask for help. Just sit down with someone you care about and let them know how you feel. Emotions don't make a man any weaker they make him more human. 

For those who read this message with scorn and disdain. That's fine too. But now you know that there are men out there who've fallen through the cracks, now you have a better idea of what it's like to live in purgatory. I hope you never have to understand this message fully but I implore you to remember that a man is not an ideal, he's flesh and blood, he's weak and strong, he's bitter and full of love. He's human. 

For women reading this, please ask the boys and men in your lives if they are OK more often.  Don't judge, just listen, they need to talk about this.

**Update2**

3 more reddit Golds since this morning, I'm stunned and honored. Thank you! Thank you everyone for all  the kind messages and responses. I've been overcome with emotion all morning, I've been answering PMs and thanking people for 2 hours now. THANK YOU for sharing your stories and your hearts. Talking about these things will make you feel better, don't ever ignore who you are. Before you can be the man you want to be you have to be a human being. 

**Update3**

More gold, more PMs. I am absolutely inundated with your stories and messages of thanks. I really don't know what to say, you guys are amazing. There are so many boys and men telling me how much they related to this story it is surreal. Don't ever stop talking about these problems, communicate how you feel and if you can't feel anything, ask for help.

**Update6** 

9 hours later. 7 Reddit golds. 4 cups of coffee and 1 bowl of cereal. I'm exhausted mentally and emotionally. I've just finished responding to 95% of people's PMs. If I missed you don't worry, I'll go through every reply again and make sure I respond. People have been asking me for help, I've read so many heartfelt PMs that I have no tears left to shed. I don't know what to tell everyone, I'm not a psychiatrist or a psychologist, I'm not professional in any field, I've never helped anyone through a depression, I only just came out of my worst period a month or so ago. I'm just a regular person that felt like sharing his story. I wish I had the answers, I wish I could give solid advice to everyone but I cant, all I can do is tell you how much easier things get once you open up. Ask for help. Find it. This is your life, nothing else matters except it. 

What got me through this? Skateboarding helped a lot, my favorite hobby, I don't know if I'd be alive today if I didn't have it to rely on. Reading too, kept me sane, kept me thinking and wanting to learn. My parents, when I broke down and finally called them, that was the turning point in my life. I owe them everything and now I can begin to help myself again. 

A book that really helped me was 

[Men's dreams , Men's Healing - Robert H Hopcke](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1344592.Men_s_Dreams_Men_s_Healing). But what I think was the major contributor to my renewed mental health was writing about my experiences. Just typing things up or writing how I felt down. It helped me to rationalize my situation. Once I wrote enough I showed it to someone and I felt free. I felt like everything was now in the open, I couldn't hide anymore. I was liberated.

Shaykh Muhammed Sayyid al-Tantawi, imam of al-Azhar mosque in Cairo, Egypt:
“Attacking innocent people is not courageous, it is stupid and will be punished on the day of judgement. … It’s not courageous to attack innocent children, women and civilians. It is courageous to protect freedom, it is courageous to defend oneself and not to attack.”

Muslim Brotherhood, an opposition Islamist group in Egypt, said it was “horrified” by the attack and expressed “condolences and sadness”:
“[We] strongly condemn such activities that are against all humanist and Islamic morals. … [We] condemn and oppose all aggression on human life, freedom and dignity anywhere in the world.”
Al-Ahram Weekly Online, 13 – 19 September 2001 (via archive.org).

Shaykh Muhammad Hussein Fadlallah, spiritual guide of the Hizbullah movement in Lebanon, said he was “horrified” by these “barbaric … crimes”:
“Beside the fact that they are forbidden by Islam, these acts do not serve those who carried them out but their victims, who will reap the sympathy of the whole world. … Islamists who live according to the human values of Islam could not commit such crimes.”
Agence France Presse, September 14, 2001


President Muhammad Khatami of Iran:
“[T]he September 11 terrorist blasts in America can only be the job of a group that have voluntarily severed their own ears and tongues, so that the only language with which they could communicate would be destroying and spreading death.”
Address to the United Nations General Assembly, November 9, 2001 (via archive.org).

Syed Mumtaz Ali, President of the Canadian Society of Muslims:

Yusuf Islam (formerly Cat Stevens), prominent British Muslim:
“I wish to express my heartfelt horror at the indiscriminate terrorist attacks committed against innocent people of the United States yesterday. While it is still not clear who carried out the attack, it must be stated that no right thinking follower of Islam could possibly condone such an action: the Qur’an equates the murder of one innocent person with the murder of the whole of humanity. We pray for the families of all those who lost their lives in this unthinkable act of violence as well as all those injured; I hope to reflect the feelings of all Muslims and people around the world whose sympathies go out to the victims at this sorrowful moment.”
[On singing an a cappella version of ""Peace Train"" for the Concert for New York City:] “After the tragedy, my heart was heavy with sadness and shock, and I was determined to help in some way. Organizers asked me to take part in a message for tolerance and sing ‘Peace Train.’ Of course, I agreed. … As a Muslim from the West, it is important to me to let people know that these acts of mass murder have nothing to do with Islam and the beliefs of Muslims.”

Abdulaziz Sachedina, professor of religious studies, University of Virginia:
“New York was grieving. Sorrow covered the horizons. The pain of separation and of missing family members, neighbors, citizens, humans could be felt in every corner of the country. That day was my personal day of “jihad” (“struggle”) — jihad with my pride and my identity as a Muslim. This is the true meaning of jihad — “struggle with one’s own ego and false pride.” I don’t ever recall that I had prayed so earnestly to God to spare attribution of such madness that was unleashed upon New York and Washington to the Muslims. I felt the pain and, perhaps for the first time in my entire life, I felt embarrassed at the thought that it could very well be my fellow Muslims who had committed this horrendous act of terrorism. How could these terrorists invoke God’s mercifulness and compassion when they had, through their evil act, put to shame the entire history of this great religion and its culture of toleration?”
“Where Was God on September 11?” (via archive.org).

Shaykh Salih al-Suhaymi, religious scholar, Saudi Arabia:
“Based upon what has preceded, then we say that that which we believe and hold as our religion concerning what happened to the World Trade Centre in America – and in Allaah lies success – that the terrorist attacks that took place and what occurred of general (mass) killing, then it is not permissible and Islaam does not allow it in any form whatsoever.”
“Shaykh Saalih as-Suhaymee speaks about current affairs…,” October 18, 2001, translated by Abu ‘Iyaad.

Fatwa signed by more than 500 British Muslim scholars, clerics, and imams:
“Islam strictly, strongly and severely condemns the use of violence and the destruction of innocent lives. There is neither place nor justification in Islam for extremism, fanaticism or terrorism. Suicide bombings, which killed and injured innocent people in London, are HARAAM – vehemently prohibited in Islam, and those who committed these barbaric acts in London [on July 7, 2005] are criminals not martyrs. Such acts, as perpetrated in London, are crimes against all of humanity and contrary to the teachings of Islam. … The Holy Quran declares: ‘Whoever kills a human being… then it is as though he has killed all mankind; and whoever saves a human life, it is as though he had saved all mankind.’ (Quran, Surah al-Maidah (5), verse 32) Islam’s position is clear and unequivocal: Murder of one soul is the murder of the whole of humanity; he who shows no respect for human life is an enemy of humanity.”

True,[deleted],,,"I understand the point KosherNazi is trying to make, but that doesn't mean that people aren't allowed to think this is an absolutely terrible way to convey a message everyone is already familiar with.  

What is this supposed to convey or impart unto me? Perseverance and determination? This shows me neither. This entire ""art"" form is superficial yet trying to make a deeper point and branding itself as successful in doing so based on the fact that - and I won't deny this - it is unique.  

This is just a fat chick trying to dance in butter, that's it. It's equivalent to me plunking one in the sand on a par 3 and then taking five unsuccessful stabs at it before even getting it out. And did I mention that I'm still 50 away from the green? At this point I could just quit (I'm not a pro, screw it!), but no, I keep going, failing even more as I sail past the green onto the rough, and then have to dredge my way back. I finish by missing a four footer as it clips off the rim, then finally just tapping it in by inches. This doesn't make me special, this doesn't mean anything. I refused to give up and wanted to finish it myself, but that doesn't make it mean anything. Just because you tried doesn't mean it was worth trying. The effort isn't always worth it, and so you just move on. So here she got up and kept dancing in butter even though she kept failing... why? This doesn't work because the thing she's trying to accomplish is stupid and pointless in the first place, so her effort at trying to do it just comes off as foolishness.  

This belongs on r/cringe, absolutely. It is cringe-worthy from the viewpoint of the performance itself, I mean, it's a fat chick repeatedly falling in butter, it's just uncomfortable (or hilarious, as I found it to be). It is cringe-worthy from the viewpoint of the message behind this. It's like those terrible skits that come around to elementary schools to try to teach kids life lessons: the message is conveyed horribly and the skit is always tacky, cliché and just painful to experience. It also makes me cringe because I know there is an audience there watching this in person, just sitting there, unable to do anything about the situation they're in. Yet, I also know that some of these audience members think highly of themselves just for being there, for ""getting it,"" and being oh so edgy.  

This, er, ""thing"" means nothing. Nothing. It simply just doesn't teach us anything or make us consider anything in a different, new or more profound way (I sincerely apologize on behalf of the people and events that helped to shape who you are today if they did so in such a way that a fat woman falling in butter now has a profound impact on you), and the performance itself is not enjoyable to watch *in the traditional sense*. I actually found it enjoyable to watch because it was hilarious, but *it's only hilarious when other people take it seriously*. If they were doing this at a comedy show I'd think it were lame (context, context, context). That's basically the whole premise behind The Office (one of my favorite shows): it's funny *because they* (mainly Michael and Dwight) *are supposed to be completely serious about the ridiculous things they do and say*. So if this is an attempt at some obscure meta ironic (don't worry, I slapped myself in the face for writing those three words consecutively, no need to feel angry, I've been punished for my transgression) humour... holy shit, well done. If you're trying to get a serious message across... uh...

Take what you will from this video, but don't try to pass it off as more than it is. You watched a video of a fat chick dancing in butter. That's it. I come from the hard math/science side of things, but I can appreciate art. This type of performance art though is why I think many who come from my vantage point write off performance art or even art altogether as nonsense. If this were my sole exposure to performance art, I'd agree with them, but thankfully it isn't.

I would like to end with a quote: ""Your ~~music~~ performance is bad and you should feel bad.""

TL;DR Trust me on this one, all dinosaurs were purple.

True,Sofiira,,,"I made everyone write a letter to Santa. If you didn't ""know"" Santa, you could write to him and ask him who he was and what he was all about. If you knew him, you could do the standard, this is what I want please Santa. It was more about teaching letter writing.

That being said, I had a student that celebrated Hanukkah and a student that celebrated Diwali. We did a whole week on Diwali, complete with the parents coming in and answering questions, as well as demonstrating some things from the festivities. For Hanukkah we ""lit"" a candle (I had a paper super-size menorah) every day, and the kids (every kid, even those that didn't celebrate Hanukkah) came up with blessings or positive things to think of over each candle, and we dedicated the day to our positive goal/blessing. We also celebrated one day with the parent coming in and serving ""geld"" (chocolate money), jelly donuts and playing with dreidls, as well as singing some Hanukkah songs.

I guess my point is, you can look at it as, oh how terribly culturally insensitive to ""make"" all kids write letters to Santa, or understand that many teachers are giving kids the full cultural experience, and the kids love it.

edit: Some of you are mentioning that you'd be disappointed if this was a public school. I teach at a public school. I recognize that majority of Redditors are American and that many schools teach from a Christian perspective. To clarify, I'm Canadian and an atheist. Most of the students in my classroom have no concept of God. I don't indoctrinate or teach religious doctrine in any way, shape or form. I just educate and inform, and celebrate (read party) each tradition and holiday that is celebrated by my little group of kiddos. I don't teach that it is right or wrong, I just  . . . teach. I try to impart to my kids, that we all have differences that should be celebrated. You would be shocked how ALL kids will quickly come to realise that they ALL have family traditions and differences from each other. I just help them realise how cool that is, and not how ""weird"" that is.

Also, I'm mandated by government to teach kids about holidays and traditions around the world (Grade 2 curriculum, Ontario). I'm not doing this all on my own. I actually HAVE to teach it WITHOUT religious influence.

True,penguindeskjob,,,"OP delivering.

Alright. Let's talk about McBride. I first saw this character at reception battalion. He was a tall guy, like 6'6, built like a mop with the hair to match. He was squirrelly and spoke with a meek, trembling voice that was perforated with stutters. Had the strength of a wet kitten and about as much wits. When we all to get our hair cuts, his head showed its true nature: It was made for someone a foot shorter than him, and his skull was covered in scratches and scars. The more impressive bit was how he stood. It wasn't his posture, but rather, his feet. They were like feet that would fit a clown shoe exactly, and somehow the US Army had his shoe size in stock. More startling was how his feet were naturally. Were his heels to touch, his feet made a perfect 90 degree angle. They could not go in any further.

He shook uncontrollably whenever any drill sergeant jumped down his throat, which happened quite often. He would just tremble and could not commit to words. In likeness to his social presence, his intelligence was wanting.

When I say that he was mentally disabled, I don't mean that as a hyperbole. It was a sad situation. You have a person here who has a head too small, scars and scratches decorating his skull as a testament to a childhood of abuse for being unable to just comprehend certain things. His ASVAB scores were obviously too low to offer the Army anything other than a position as a cook.

The only logical explanation for why McBride was in the military has to be a bet. He must have went into the recruiters office, told them he wanted to be a soldier, and when he left, one soldier said, ""I bet you 5 bucks you can't get him into the military."" Obviously, the recruiter made 5 bucks that day.

Now, none of us are mean or evil people that dislike or want mentally handicapped people to die or suffer. But there comes a point that when you are required to rely on someone who is a person like McBride, you couldn't help but feel angry. Late for formation because he doesn't know how to tie his own shoes? Or constantly loses his TA-50? Yeah. Of course we were accountable for him, we were supposed to support our weakest link. But at the same time, the weakest link would give a big fuck you to any support given to him.

So we were angry. Maybe not at him, but perhaps at the whole system that let him into the army and be a part of our national defense. We were stuck with him, though, and that was all that we could think about: We were stuck with Private McBride, AKA Happy Feet.

So, what was it like being stuck with McBride in Basic Training?

1). He was frequently late for formation because he either forgot, got confused tying his own shoes, or managed to lose his uniform in his own wall locker. This happened at least once a day. In the field, he'd lose his Kevlar on the range. Hell, one day he lost BOTH plates of his IBA (body armor) at a live fire exercise range.

2). We were waiting for formation to go somewhere. Mess hall, maybe? Our Senior Drill Sergeant was feeling rather relaxed that day, so he  gave him 10 minutes. McBride was difficult to handle not just for the privates. After that, he sent up four privates to check the male barracks for any sign of him. We were standing in formation, waiting. Then we heard a private call from a window, ""Found McBride! He's in the shower,"" followed by everyone screaming, ""Goddamn it McBride!"" as we were ordered into the front leaning rest (the starting position of the push up) until he was dressed and ready. Two privates acme out and reported to the drill sergeant. He was in the shower, they reported. He was masturbating. That's right. He was getting his wank on when he was supposed to be in formation. Goddamn did we have to push.

3). We had this live fire exercise we had to do. You move into cover while another soldier gives you cover fire. Easy stuff. Everyone made it through, even McBride. No one got shot, no one got hurt. So we're getting back to the bleachers to wait for the buses. As soon as the buses arrive, we all notice one thing: McBride is wearing his IBA, but doesn't have the armored plates. See, the IBA is body armor that has two pouches, one in the front and one in the back, that you can replace Kevlar armor plates in. The whole kit weighs about 40 pounds. And here he is completely unhindered without his body armor. Where the hell was it? It was at the range. So we start screaming at him, ""Get your armor on. Goddamn it, McBride!"" And he immediately perks up like a gazelle, remembering that he forgot his fucking armor at the range. So he goes running like a deer that just realized the car isn't going to hit him. Without a battle buddy. And you can't go anywhere in Basic or AIT without a battle buddy. Needless to say that night, the drill sergeant woke us up every hour on the hour.

4). Last one, then it's goodnight. This didn't happen at Basic, but at AIT. Most quartermaster (supply, cooking, whatever) is trained at Ft. Lee, VA. I was in training there in a completely different unit, but someone got everyone on the entire base to say, ""Fucking McBride."" Both at Basic and AIT, you're issued a rifle. You have to carry that rifle everywhere except into latrines, mess, or medical facilities. Normally you can get a buddy to hold your weapon while you piss, or you have a detachment outside watching over the weapons while eating. When you go to a medical facility, you have to sign the weapon back into the arms room. And he was running late for his appointment. So does he go back to his unit to check in his and his buddy's weapon? Hell no. He convinces this guy to hide their weapons. That's right. McBride convinced him to hide their weapons. When McBride got done with his dental appointment, was his weapons where they left them? Hell no. Two teenagers picked them up and were playing with them at the family housing area on Ft. Lee. The whole installation had to be shut down. People couldn't come in, couldn't leave, until those two weapons were accounted for. And this lasted for like half a day before they finally found the weapons.

&gt;Wouldn't it be awesome if we did like we do while watching porn, but she's there, and we're basically watching her but molesting each other, and getting hornier and hornier... She's not nude, but she's wearing one of those super cliche french maid uniforms, [like this](http://images3.backpage.com/imager/u/large/47522670/Maid-at-your-service.2.jpg), except the top doesn't fit quite right so that when she bends over you can see down her blouse, and nothing on under the skirt, so that you get a nice view of her naked ass while she is on all fours scrubbing the floor. We get so turned on from watching her, and just from the general naughtiness of the situation, that we start to fuck, like right there in front of her, maybe on the kitchen table. As we rip our clothes off of each other, she picks them up and neatly folds them and lays them on a chair, and then goes back to cleaning whatever it was that she was cleaning before. We fuck like animals, and you can tell it kind of turns her on, but to really let it show would be unprofessional, so she averts her gaze while she cleans. You can see a blush crawling across her face, betraying her current state of mind. She does the best she can to just carry on doing her job while we are going at it, and you don't hold back at all, you're being as loud as you want to be, moaning and saying filthy things and being a nasty girl. After you've been satisfied I pull out, and like we did that first time we had sex on the mountain, you jack me off, and I am rock hard and it feels amazing, and I'm playing with your tits while you are pumping my cock faster and faster until finally I come, and it shoots a few feet from where we stand, towards her, splattering on the dining room floor. As we hold each other close, sweaty, recovering, catching our breaths, legs still trembling, she silently (never acting insulted or exasperated or anything, as it's her job) gets on her hands and knees and wipes up my semen from the floor. When she's finished with that she wipes down the table where we just fucked. Her blush is even deeper now, but she never forgets her place, or her need for professionalism in this situation.

True,BoldElDavo,redskins,Redskins,"Let me tell you the story of Bo Jackson:

He was a Heisman-winning RB at Auburn as well as a star baseball player. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers took him on a trip to see their facilities, and they promised Jackson that the trip was fine by NCAA rules. Unfortunately that was incorrect, and Bo's eligibility as a player was forfeit for the remainder of his senior year.

Jackson suspected that they did this intentionally to prevent the MLB from seeing him play in his senior year, with the hopes that no baseball team would draft him and he'd have to choose football. Due to these suspicions, he straight-up stated publicly that he would never play for the Buccaneers. They drafted him with the first pick anyway.

So, true to his word, he signed with the Kansas City Royals and played baseball in 1986. When the 1987 draft came along, his name was put back in for anyone to take him. He fell to the 7th round because nobody was sure that he'd even play, and that's where he was taken by the Raiders. He signed with them and played four seasons before and injury ended his career.

So, to answer your question, the team that drafts a player has exclusive rights to sign them for a full year. If the player chooses not to sign with that team, they must wait until the following draft to hopefully be picked up by another team. This always seems to hurt the player's draft stock.

Anytime you drill you have a pretty decent potential to pollute the ground water. This is true if fracking is later used, but it is still true if fracking is not used.

Fracking itself doesn't significantly increase the likelyhood of polluting the ground water unless there is a bad cement job. But if the cement is bad the ground water will be polluted by the hydrocarbons anyways so moot point.

(What I mean by the above statement is that if the ground water is being polluted then Fracking isn't the problem. People use Fracking as a scape goat for larger problems which are much more difficult to address.) 

The only way to completely stop ground water pollution completely is to stop drilling altogether, but no one wants that.

True,nickfury616,male,,"20 years. 20 years that I live with the same woman and god I love her (We have met at the tender age of 20). She is my best friend and I'm hers. But we are not good friends, that would be awful. We are much more than that. We share our lives and we love growing old together. 

I still desire her (but she is working out and has a firm nice body) and she still desire me (I'm working out too. I'm in fact much more muscular and less fat than when I was 20).


So I would say that loving someone for a long time is a reality, but it's rare because the secret of the success is:


- You must still be desirable. If you are not caring of your body anymore, and if you let yourself become fat or stop doing sport or whatever, you will become less and less desirable. And your SO will end drooling on others men/women.


- You must be best friends. That means, you have a lot of hobbies in common. We love watching the same kind of movies, reading the same kind of books, hearing the same kind of music. That doesn't mean we are clones. I have some hobbies she doesn't care about (like video game, RPG, reading comics) and I love some rap music she loathes. But we have a lot in common. We are  laughing when we are together, because we have the same sense of humor. We love to speak about serious subjects (politics, religion, etc...) Basically, we love to spend time together. Like you say, we have our own world but we have a common world. It's a big one common world and we are happy to enter it. We feel safe in this common world. 


- You must have stars in the eyes when you see your SO. You know, one of the best thing in life is watching someone you truly love becoming an adult. She has become someone accomplished in life and that's beautiful. I'm proud of her and she is proud of me. 


- You must manage difficulties of the life in a way satisfying for your SO. I mean, life is not a quiet river. You will have your share of problems. When you share your life with someone, you need to know he/she will have the appropriate (to your opinion anyway) reaction. You will struggle with money, deal with losses etc... If you can react in an appropriate way and if you can rely on your SO, it's really important. You are not always ok with the decision of your SO, but his/her opinion will help you to better yourself. 


That doesn't mean we are living in the Little House on the Prairie show. I have sex fantasies she doesn't want to hear about. She is sometimes pissed because I don't want to wash dishes when it's my turn. Stuff like that. But really, if you have those ingredients, you will enjoy being with your SO as much as when you meet him/her. I would even say, you will enjoy it more. 


I would add that a lot of couples are only based on sex. They have nothing in common. They don't respect each other. That's really the problem.

True,devineman,10,Manchester City,"Manchester. 

United and City started for very, very different reasons.  United were started for a bunch of railway workers, many of which were immigrants and of Irish descent which one of the reasons why they've traditionally been seen as out of towners.  City was started by the Connell family, a Priest and his daughter (I think we're the only league Club to have a woman founder IIRC), as a way to find something else for the local boys to do as they were creating street gangs and thieving in a very tough time to live.

They kind of grew out of this respective heritage though the years.  City still to this very day believe themselves to be intrinsically linked to their community as a way of helping the working classes.  United still to this very day see themselves as the Club built for everybody, completely inclusionary of all people from all races and all corners of the world.  

Immediately you see the different mindsets and ethos of the respective Clubs.  United were the communistic ideal of equality, City were the socialistic idea of community service.  

In the early days, both Clubs moved around the city, not really finding their natural home due to a lack of funds and a lack of facilities.  United bounced from Newton Heath to Clayton then eventually to Old Trafford.  If you think of it like a clock, United went from 1 o'clock in the city, to about 6 o'clock.  All of their sites retained a closeness to major railway sites, including Old Trafford which is a stones throw from the Trafford Park sail line.  Much of Manchester's history is built on our utilisation of rail to trade.  

Just a quick aside here.  Liverpool were actually the port where all trade used to come into and it made the area pretty affluent.  Manchester, which is a little more inland and was the production centre, then built a Ship Canal from the coast directly into the city and built a railway (the first ever and which an old relative of devineman was one of the drivers) which basically bypassed their city entirely.  This is the modern beginnings of the Manchester-Liverpool rivalry as Liverpool accused Manchester of ""tukin der jerbs"", and United being a railway workers club, well, you can see how it gets going.  Old Trafford is next to the docks of the Ship Canal which became an important port too.

Whilst United were trying to find their home around the rails, City was moving too.  They started off on the playing fields of Gorton but their first real ground was just in Ardwick then again moved to Maine Road.  United were moving around the edges and City who started at about four o'clock on the clock geogrphy of Manchester, were moving inwards towards the centre of the city.

For what it's worth, City were the more affluent of the neighbours at this time for a few reasons.  Mainly it's because we moved towards population centres whilst United kept in the industrial centres (again, remembering the ethos upon which both clubs were founded and United's rail ties).  This is good to remember because changes in the UK actually made the population centres of this time into working class areas and the old industrial parts of the city into the suburbs where wealthier people lived about 70 years later.
City had lots of money and bought their ground off of the old owners, a brewery and with their new riches built the Wembley of the North, Maine Road.  Funnily, they were building Wembley at the time and the people who built Maine Road was the Northern division of the company that built Wembley so there was a bit of a competition internally to who could get it finished and in a better quality.  Maine Road gave City a new burst of wealth and it still hold the records for any attendance in England outside of Wembley both in a league game (United/Arsenal) and  any game (City/Stoke).  

Whilst things were going well for the affluent City, United fell into major financial problems.  One of the problems with having lots of fans who are railway workers, is that some of them will eventually get back on their train and go home.  Around the time that City were hosting England internationals at their (Ardwick) stadium, United were declaring bankruptcy.  They were saved because a guy called John Henry Davis bought them up and was determined to make them into a big Club.  You have to remember that there weren't just United and City around at this time, there were a good ten or twenty teams around Manchester, with City being the major Club and the others all having decent sized crowds but struggling once City started hosting glamour matches and transportation links in the city became better then started winning trophies.

John Henry Davis was a wealthy guy, owning a big alcohol based business and marrying into the Tate family fortune (Tate as in Tate &amp; Lyle the sugar merchants and the Tate Modern art gallery).  Together with a group of businessmen, he took over the ailing United and started to rebuild their ground and invest money in the Club.  Actually he didn't really, the class fairy came down and waved her magic wand and Manchester United were now formed and were the biggest Club ever.  Ahem.  

Just as another aside, there seems to be plans on the table at this point for United to move into the centre of Manchester to try and get bigger attendences but this never got off the ground.  The ""Manchester Central"" name that people think was considered is actually a myth as far as anyone can tell but as another marker of their Irish heritage, they did briefly consider Manchester Celtic.  I've always consider Manchester United to be the perfect name for them.  Many of the Clubs in Manchester around this time were going out of business due to City and calling the team Manchester: United gave them a sense that it had been absorbed into United.  Again, United being the inclusive Club, welcoming all comers to share their experience.

At this point in history, City were the dominant Club in the region and due to this were putting everybody else out of business, who couldn't compete with their huge revenues or drawing power.  United were languishing in obscurity somewhat and were funded by a rich investor who did up their stadium, bought them lots of players and made them a real threat to the dominance of City.  History isn't without a sense of irony it seems.

There was a wage cap around this time.  Footballers were not yet millionaire superstars and often had a couple of jobs on the side.  Manchester was still heavily working class area and a production central rather than the cosmopolitan place that London was.  One of the things that City did at the time, was break FA rules by paying their players the wage cap but then also giving them bonuses for performance.  They were caught and spanked by the FA whilst a bunch of their players were banned from playing.  Of course, these players had to be auctioned off and who was the one guy sat in the auction room buying player after player?  Ernest Magnall, manager of Manchester United and backed by Henry Davis.  They bought them all and won their first major trophies.

The first Welsh Wizard that went from City to United and became a legend was Billy Meredith, a supreme player for his time and is probably still adjudged by historians as one of United's best ever players.  He was also the guy who whilst playing for City buggered us up with the FA.  He was caught trying to bribe a Villa player to throw a game, asked City to cover it up which we didn't so he ble the whistle on the bonus payments.  He's still seen as a legend at City too and actually coached both teams in his later years.  The Bryan Kidd of his day, but with more talent (sorry Kiddo).  He even went on later to setup the PFA.

Of course, City being the dominant animals at the time still planning their super stadium, weren't going to allow the fact that we were banned for financial doping and docked points stop them, so they nicked United's manager and a couple of players back including Meredith.  Magnall's last game in charge of United when he'd already agreed to join City?  The Manchester Derby.  At Old Trafford.  Which City won 1-0.  And he celebrated as they scored.

Magnall actually was a major force behind both City's move to Maine Road and United's move to Old Trafford, and he won trophies for both Clubs so he's a legend anyway.

The First World War broke out and the tensions between the Clubs cooled a bit as the British Spirit™ kicked in and it was us taking on those dastardly Krauts.  Even post war when City were building their Wembley of the North, they considered a ground share with United (who by this time had Davies investment in their ground, the above story is supposed to be concurrent), a new spirit of handshakes all around prevailed.

The inter-war years pretty much went how they pre-war years went.  City continued to do well and win trophies including the FA Cup and the league.  United not so much.

City got to the FA Cup final in 33 and won it in 34 whilst maintaining high league positions and winning the league in 37.  As a marker for things to come for City, they scored 100 goals in their title winning season of 37 then became the only reigning champions ever relegated in 38 despite scoring the most goals in the league (F: 80, A:77).  My Grandad points to this moment as the genesis of ""Typical City"" and says that we were actually a great team but were miles behind tactically but then, my Grandad says a lot.  He also says that Kinkladze was half the player of Peter Doherty so fuck him.  Speaking of elderly relatives, my highly religious and a bit nutty Nan (on the other side) tells me that there was a Catholic-Protestant split in the fanbases too, and I've been told this by quite a few people but never found anything to back it up.  This might explain why City and Rangers are close, or we could just both think United and Celtic are twats?",0,1355330557,,0,False,1,c7ffrhi,t3_14pkvq,t1_c7ffrhi,t3_14pkvq,,1430653937,176,False,soccer,t5_2qi58,176

I have checked out the sub in the past but was pretty quickly repulsed. At the time, the top post (and comments on it were almost entirely positive) was filled with hate speech - making sure to call women cunts at least every other paragraph. I say this without hyperbole. That the article (and laudatory comments) were up voted suggest that it is not only a vocal minority that feels like that but a silent majority that approves. As a point of contrast, here's an article I found by accident while looking for information on Farrell: [a list of feminist articles including men in a positive way]( http://brutereason.net/2012/09/20/in-brief-do-feminists-care-about-mens-issues-a-handy-list/). My point is that there are feminists voicing moderation that aren't hard to find. The MRM, by comparison, has much farther to go in terms of inclusivity and respect (as an aside, I suspect this is related to the current construction of masculinity, since anger is more acceptable to express than the ""weakness"" of being sad, etc.) Maybe the sub has goten better since then. I'll look at it tonight.

here is a fun story showing an example of sorts


A toothpaste factory had a problem: they sometimes shipped empty boxes, without the tube inside. This was due to the way the production line was set up, and people with experience in designing production lines will tell you how difficult it is to have everything happen with timings so precise that every single unit coming out of it is perfect 100% of the time. Small variations in the environment (which can’t be controlled in a cost-effective fashion) mean you must have quality assurance checks smartly distributed across the line so that customers all the way down the supermarket don’t get pissed off and buy someone else’s product instead.

Understanding how important that was, the CEO of the toothpaste factory got the top people in the company together and they decided to start a new project, in which they would hire an external engineering company to solve their empty boxes problem, as their engineering department was already too stretched to take on any extra effort.

The project followed the usual process: budget and project sponsor allocated, RFP, third-parties selected, and six months (and $8 million) later they had a fantastic solution — on time, on budget, high quality and everyone in the project had a great time. They solved the problem by using some high-tech precision scales that would sound a bell and flash lights whenever a toothpaste box weighing less than it should. The line would stop, and someone had to walk over and yank the defective box out of it, pressing another button when done.

A while later, the CEO decides to have a look at the ROI of the project: amazing results! No empty boxes ever shipped out of the factory after the scales were put in place. Very few customer complaints, and they were gaining market share. “That’s some money well spent!” – he says, before looking closely at the other statistics in the report.

It turns out, the number of defects picked up by the scales was 0 after three weeks of production use. It should’ve been picking up at least a dozen a day, so maybe there was something wrong with the report. He filed a bug against it, and after some investigation, the engineers come back saying the report was actually correct. The scales really weren’t picking up any defects, because all boxes that got to that point in the conveyor belt were good.

Puzzled, the CEO travels down to the factory, and walks up to the part of the line where the precision scales were installed. A few feet before it, there was a $20 desk fan, blowing the empty boxes out of the belt and into a bin. “Oh, that — one of the guys put it there ’cause he was tired of walking over every time the bell rang”, says one of the workers.

True,ls1z28chris,fbfrog,,"There are several different things going on here.

* Braggarts are usually liars. The kind of guy to talk about all the people he's killed is probably the kind of guy who did nothing. Kind of like how in college or high school, that guy who talks about all the girls he's banged is probably still a virgin.
* People in the military are generally trained to believe that theirs is a reluctant duty. Nobody wants to kill, but someone has to know how. That sort of thing. So it is considered bad form to brag about killing people, because at the end of the day no one really wants to do it aside from sociopaths, who were hopefully screened out at MEPS and denied enlistment.
* Finally, civilians have no fucking clue. Veterans have absolutely zero desire to sit around and commiserate with 21 year old children whose life experience consists of living in mommy and daddy's house, and then going to live in a dorm paid for by mommy and daddy's wages/salaries. There is no familiar frame of reference. There is a saying in a popular book out there on combat (someone will get the pun) that goes something like this:  Learning about killing from civilians is like learning about sex from virgins. They might understand the mechanics and the psychology, they might be able to tell you what chemicals are released in the brain and how that is supposed to feel, but they don't really *know* what they're talking about.

I'd suggest that people just ask something generic such as:  ""What was it like?"" If you do that, you won't come off as an annoying person. Plus, it is an open inquiry. They'll end up telling you whatever they're comfortable with telling you. If they're quick and to the point, don't ask followup questions. If they give a long explanation and seem open to conversation, ask them to elaborate on something.

Generally, these are basic rules of social interaction. I don't know why the fuck people like /u/GamingTheSystem-01 think such a question is appropriate. The civilian equivalent of his question would be like me finding out your mom died in a car accident, then asking, ""Woah, did she, like, die on impact, or was she trapped like that dude's wife in Signs and get to say goodbye and everything?""

True,michael22joseph,,,"I thought about creating a throwaway for this, but screw it.
When I was younger, and even up into college, I battled with my sexuality a lot. There's actually a lot that went into it but I'll just say the main things.

I was raised with all sisters, and no brothers. Because of that, my sense of ""normal"" is *much* more ""feminine"" than what most guys my age thought. I learned how to process emotions, verbalize them, and discuss things much earlier than most guys. So many things about who I am are much less masculine than what the standard model of masculinity says I should be like.

When I moved to college I joined a fraternity. I love the experience I've had and wouldn't trade it for the world, but it was a really weird transition. There were several people who singled me out throughout my experience and consistently told me how ""gay"" I was. At first I just kept shaking it off. I've **always** been attracted to girls, there was no chance I was gay. After a couple years of this though, it planted a seed, and there were times when I'd think ""what if I am? What if they see something about me I don't? I mean, I **am** different, after all?""

Now, couple this gender stereotyping with the fact that I was extremely self-conscious, physically. I came into college 5'11"" and about 190 pounds, but a quite chubby 190--I was not very fit. I wasn't obese, but I always struggled with how I looked physically. So at the same time that I was having all of these worries psychologically, I was also focusing constantly on improving my appearance, losing weight, gaining muscle. I would watch movies and start to notice what guys wore, how they looked, etc. 

These two things created a positive feedback loop where, for about a year, I wondered if maybe I was gay and was just denying it or afraid to admit it. I never had a physical attraction to another male, but I did envy the way other guys looked, and I confused the two things.

So to answer the question, I realized I officially wasn't gay when I realized that your sexuality is not defined by how you conform to various stereotypes.

It was awful. I was the person everyone hopes they never encounter on public transportation. And then I had to explain to the receptionist at the infusion center and ask for scrubs/a shower. The lady couldn't hide her horror. God, that was miserable.

I appreciate the urge to share, too. Yesterday I had a couple hours of really terrible pain and constant bowel movements. I've been pretty consistently bleeding when I go to the bathroom, but not very heavily. Last night, though, I actually worried I may have ruptured something because of how suddenly and freely I was bleeding. It turned out okay, but I sent an email telling my mom all about it because I just HAD to let someone know. I feel bad about it now because she worries about me enough as it is (and I'm 27... I should be able to handle these things without running to mommy) but at the time it really helped me get through the pain.

I explained it and they were understanding, but that doesn't mean they didn't judge me for it.

True,fishing_with_john,,Short North,"Hi, I'm a Franklin CS student and I am graduating next semester, so I can try and offer some insight. 

Overall, I have enjoyed the CS program at Franklin. It is going to be less theory and more practical stuff than some place like OSU. The best classes, in my opinion, were the data structure classes, and the 20* series that were focused on varying levels of abstraction in programming languages starting at assembly.

If you go to Franklin and finish the data structures classes early in your program (as I did) make sure to stay in practice with that kind of stuff. I find myself preparing for data structure/algorithm questions and having to relearn some stuff because I took the second data structures class a year and a half ago. 

There are a number of courses on project management/software development lifecycle type stuff, which is probably good experience to have, but I would have rather had more theory/programming courses.

To answer your question about employment - I don't know. I am literally just starting to apply for entry level jobs. Hopefully in a month or two I'll have some more info there. Related - anyone looking for entry level Java devs? ;)

I decided to go with Franklin because I am working full time and not working full time wasn't really an option. If I had the option I would have gone to OSU.

What you've calculated here is not the probability that everyone could blink at once, but rather the fraction of time that we would expect everyone to be blinking at once. Another way of saying this is, you calculated that probability that everyone is blinking at once *this exact moment* to be about 10^-4.26 ^billion , but how many such moments are there in a day? Infinity, right? So does that make it almost a certainty? Nope.

**Better math:**

Bob is a very important guy—he's going to be the key blinker in this study. Every time bob begins a blink, we're going to check whether or not every other person on earth begins their own blink during the duration of bob's blink. This will give us a per-Bob-blink estimate of the probability that everyone blinks together. First, we need a better estimation of how many people are awake, because population/2 just doesn't do it for me.

[Population by timezone](http://getfile8.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/artscience/Xcb0FEwnIgAQoujEsFlLjJioq6zgmMaSURAm8LwZBD3RuKhquW0Kl0IJmDZN/PastedGraphic-3.png.scaled595.png)

We'll have our best chance of getting a globo-blink by looking at times when both India and eastern China (the two biggest spikes on that graph) are asleep. Assuming an 8-hour span of the world is asleep at any given time, when India has all gone to bed and the Chinese haven't started waking in any great number yet, there are about 3.7 billion people asleep and 3.3 billion awake.

Now, every time Bob blinks, there are 3,299,999,999 other people who also have to blink at the same time. Using el_matt's blink research, that's a probability of 0.06^3,299,999,999, or 10^-4032100972. This is the probability that each of Bob's blinks is actually a globo-blink. If Bob takes 5100 blinks in an average day, that means there's a probability of 5100\*10^-4032100972 , or 10^-4032100968 of a globo-blink happening *today*.

True,spriteking2012,,,"I worked at McD's for my first job. We ended up working the morning of Christmas one year. Not a big deal, it was just from 6 am to 9 with overtime pay each hour. Not a bad deal.  Unfortunately, the manager running the shift was an unkind man we'll call 'A.J. Now, A.J. had never liked me. He openly mocked me, and assigned me awful work like changing fryer oil and doing truck. If he were managing, I was doing the shit work. Every. Time.

This dislike stemmed from a single occasion where he lied to our store manager about some food entered as waste. A.J. had entered an entire box of hamburger meat as waste that past summer and then taken it home for his own use at a cook-out; also known as stealing. When they asked me if I recalled an entire box of meat being tossed, I told them no, because I hadn't and I was working that shift. It turns out I was the 'testimony' that busted him and he nearly lost his job. So, I was now a marked man.

Back to Christmas morning, A.J. is less-than-pleased that he got stuck with the Christmas shift and has very clearly been drinking. He keeps going in and out of the basement and sat in the office and bemoaning that he's 'missing the fucking game.'  On one of his visits to the basement, I checked out the cameras and what do I see? A Christmas miracle; A.J. getting totally trashed by way of a handle of vodka between the stock shelves. I'd had enough. I grabbed the cordless and called our store manager and told her I was having issues with the drive-thru cameras and that A.J. was busy with inventory. She said she would check it out and call back. I knew that she'd pull-up the cameras and check the feeds at home. She never called back. Instead, she came to the store 10 minutes later. A.J. had returned to the office by now. 2 minutes later and he was out the door, fired on the spot. One of my better Christmases.

I KNOW the way some of you interpret baby talk is inflections, intonations higher pitched voice, and lots of happy sounds. These are very critical to the development of language. I meant that parents should not just speak to the baby like the baby talks to them at 3 months.**

My 9 year old is in the top 1% in the state for math and reading. He is being tested for a ""highly gifted program"" in January that would specialize his entire education through 12 grade as long as we stay in the state. We have always spoken to him as if he was on our level. Age appropriate topics, of course. 

We are 100% honest with him. We do not hold back on praise, nor do we tread lightly with punishments either. He is almost always very well behaved, but we all need to get that kids are kids and they do stupid shit sometimes.

Other life hacks: Be consistent. If you budge once, they will throw an even bigger fit next time to see how much further they have to go till you break, now that they know you are breakable. They will always be able to throw a fit longer and harder than you want to be cold and stern. When they figure out they can't break you, they give up and the next time and every successive time just gets easier till they know it is law.

Always be your partner's partner. Unified front so the kids can't think they can manipulate the situation. EVER.

Don't be scared to let them see you fight, cry, get pissed off, etc. If your children grow up seeing you have struggles with your mate and then see you FIX them, they will know a relationship takes work and fixing things is possible. I get angry when I hear teenagers say they never knew their parents weren't happy till they were sat down and told a divorce is eminent. Maybe if arguing wasn't taboo a divorce wouldn't be eminent.

On the opposite side of the spectrum, never be scared to let your kids see you kiss, cuddle, damn near make out with your spouse. It shows them that affection is normal and healthy. It shows them that Mommy and Daddy are happy. It shows them not to be nervous to be loving with their SOs around you when they grow up.

Always explain yourself. If you flip out at your kids because they are being dumbasses- or any other reason. After you come to your senses, sit them down. Explain that your reaction may have been over-the-top and you are sorry but remind them that it will probably happen every time they do stupid shit. It is your job to make them decent humans and when they act like shitheads, they will be told such and face consequences for such. Leveling with them gives them the ability to see the logic behind punishment and they learn more from it. Just punishing makes them resentful and act out more. They can think you don't love them if punishment comes with no real explanation. 

Love them. Love them like there is no tomorrow. Never let them leave without a hug and a kiss and a reminder that they mean the world to you. Never let them think for a second that you are not on their side. 

Explain how life really works so they aren't entitled ass holes when they hit 18 and are on their own. Prove that their hard work pays off by rewarding them. Never give a participation trophy, this is why a lot of teens think they deserve to be rewarded each time they successfully wipe their asses. Make them earn everything they get. Grades and chores are currency. ""I went to school without complaining and you gave birth to me, I didn't ask to be born so because of that I deserve an iPhone at age 13."" Entitlement is a bitch that drags her teeth because it is fun to see you in pain. 

Give them responsibility. They will have a harder time adjusting to adult life if they have never had to self-manage or contribute to a household. 

Once again- LOVE THE SHIT OUT OF THEM and let them know you love them every chance you get. Even if that love comes in the form of a punishment or a uncomfortable life lesson.

WOW- that was ridiculously long.

TL;DR Treat kids like the adults you wish them to grow up to be. Don't be a pushover. Love Love Love. Avoid letting them think they are entitled to anything in life.

True,Not_on_Porpoise,,,"Okay, so I'm not american, but I'm a marine biology student. I looked up common sharks around the New England area and compared them to OP's picture. I assume [the fin in OP's picture](http://i.imgur.com/nfHSO.png) is the front dorsal fin, but I suppose it could also be a pectoral fin if the shark is twisting and thrashing about, in which case this post is worthless and I've spent my last day before my exams doing jack shit and will fail. 

Anyway. Here's [a quick 101](http://www.wildlifeonline.me.uk/images/graphics/fin_anatomy.gif) on dorsal fin morphology. The fin is **low** and has a **low-angled anterior margin** with an **apex that reaches past the base of the posterior margin** and seems to have a **jagged edge** on the posterior margin.

Here's what different shark fins look like:

* [Basking sharks](http://cdn.stripersonline.com/6/63/636a78df_basking_shark_fin.jpeg) has a rounded apex or at least a sloping [posterior margin](http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2007/06_01/Shark1APX1006_600x367.jpg).

* [Blue sharks](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/Prionace_glauca_1.jpg/640px-Prionace_glauca_1.jpg) have wide bases, rounded apex and [an indentation](http://www.sharkmans-world.eu/images/species/prionace_glauca.jpg) in the posterior margin.

* [Mako sharks](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e1/Isurus_paucus.jpg) have a well-rounded apex and a sloping posterior margin, and have no business that close to shore.

* [Porbeagles](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Lamna_nasus_noaa.jpg/640px-Lamna_nasus_noaa.jpg) don't fit at all, dorsal fin is too high and has a well-rounded apex.

* [Sandtiger sharks](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/Carcharias_taurus_newport.jpg/640px-Carcharias_taurus_newport.jpg) and [tiger sharks](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/Tiger_shark.jpg/640px-Tiger_shark.jpg) have a [very wide base](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/The_Sand_Tiger_Shark_with_Sea_Turtle.jpg/640px-The_Sand_Tiger_Shark_with_Sea_Turtle.jpg) (sandtiger shark) on both dorsal fins and a rounded apex.

* [Dusky smoothhounds](http://cdn1.arkive.org/media/33/3364B3A4-40E4-4C6C-9D78-F765DAE66907/Presentation.Large/Dusky-smoothhound.jpg) are also a mismatch, with a wide base, rounded apex and sloping posterior margin.

* [The spiny dogfish](http://cdn2.arkive.org/media/AA/AA81F1AE-E4D2-4C7A-AD44-2C2C2A6F5CE2/Presentation.Large/Spiny-dogfish-swimming-amongst-weed.jpg) also has a wide fin with a somewhat rounded apex.

* [Sandbar sharks](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/Carcharhinus_plumbeus_georgia.jpg/640px-Carcharhinus_plumbeus_georgia.jpg) have a pointed apex, but it doesn't seem to reach [past the base](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Carcharhinus_plumbeus.jpg) of the posterior margin, and the angle of the anterior margin is a bit too high to make a match.

* [Thresher sharks](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/18/Thresher_shark.jpg) has an apex that can reach behind the base of the posterior margin, but it is quite [rounded](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/Pacifica_thresher_shark.jpg/640px-Pacifica_thresher_shark.jpg) and therefor doesn't match.

* [Smooth hammerhead sharks](http://cdn1.arkive.org/media/23/234A0E8A-243E-4431-8EA6-B8ACC32B7D30/Presentation.Large/Smooth-hammerhead-swimming.jpg) do have a pointed apex which reaches behind the base of the posterior margin, but the fins are [much too high](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c0/Sphyrna_zygaena_noaa.jpg). We're looking for a low fin.

* [Great white sharks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Great_white_aqurium.jpg) and [Dusky sharks](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/29/Carcharhinus_obscurus.jpg) both seem to have pointed dorsal apexes reaching behind the base of posterior margin. They both match well. Let's look at some fins closer.

Here's a close-up of a [great white fin](http://cdn.stripersonline.com/e/e0/441x369px-LL-e0d93bc0_carcharodon-carcharias-great-white-shark-picture.jpeg), and [another one](http://www.oceanlight.com/spotlight.php?img=19490). As it turn out, great white sharks can be tracked based on the appearance of their dorsal fin, so quite a lot of charts exist mapping them, both [here](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-aD2Es0XIGQI/TtjNz8t00EI/AAAAAAAAJ9c/sbl-YyG31s8/s1600/shark-fins-for-db.jpg) and [here](http://www.oceans-research.com/images/research-projects/great-white-shark-research02large.jpg). Looking at them and again comparing them to [the fin in OP's picture](http://i.imgur.com/nfHSO.png), I feel confident saying that great whites have too high an angle on the anterior margin and that the apex does not extend over the base of the posterior margin far enough to match. Also, looking at the colours of the fins, I don't think the colouring match particularly well either.

So if it's not a great white shark... That leaves the [dusky shark](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/29/Carcharhinus_obscurus.jpg). It does seem to have a lower angle of the anterior margin, but let's look at some more examples. [Here's one](http://www.oceanwideimages.com/images/8079/large/dusky-shark-24M2638-04.jpg), [here's another one](http://cdn1.arkive.org/media/7D/7D295837-590C-4C36-A1A7-C63D9ACF0179/Presentation.Large/Dusky-shark.jpg) and [a third](http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4041/4646022748_8fa8e183e0.jpg). It does also seem to have a [too high angle](http://www.gooddive.com/diving-photos/photos/4/dusky-shark-side-mexico-andy.jpg) on the anterior margin.

Del salón de clases salió un compañero, más divertido que asustado, y se acercó a donde estaba yo. Le pregunté: -¿Qué pasó? ¿porqué te sacó a ti?. - jajajaja, te cuento. Me dijo. - Después de que te sacara de la clase, empezó a decir que el daría el ejemplo pefecto de un lider, y dijo que Jesús de Nazareth era el mejor lider que ha existido, yo solo le pregunté, ¿cómo es posible que Jesús era un buen lider si solo pudo convencer que lo siguieran 12 personas?, y no le gustó mi respuesta y me corrió de la clase.

True,aedes,med,Protein Folding | Antibiotic Resistance | Emergency Medicine,"You're at a national park and are trying to pick which hiking trail to walk on. They all have stupid names though because a biochemist named them. There's the ""glutathione"" trail - a pleasant meander around a picnic table that then leads to a starbucks, and the ""CYP2E1"" trail - a death march that involves crossing [this bridge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DPP3Ei9X_0), then climbing mount everest (for some reason), then you have to battle a dragon before base jumping off the side of a cliff with an improperly maintained parachute... which then leads to said starbucks.

Normally you, who's parents were also biochemists and gave you the unfortunate name, ""Tylenol,"" would choose the slightly easier trail and head over to the starbucks. But today for some reason, there's a convention for people named Tylenol (who knew there were so many!), and there are thousands and thousands of people taking the easy trail to starbucks. 

You are impatient, so you say to hell with this, I'm taking the other trail. This trail almost kills you, and you are left scarred as a result, and turn into an evil villain. You change your name to NAPQI and burn down the park and kill half the population of the continental united states.

Via analogy, when tylenol is metabolized by the normal pathway via conjugation with glutathione, nothing bad happens. But when you take a tonne of tylenol, this pathway gets saturated, and tylenol overflows into the CYP2E1 pathway where it's metabolized to something called NAPQI, which kills your liver.

Now, same situation... but as well as being a convention for people named Tylenol, there's also another convention for people named Alcohol. These people seem to all be drunk as they're *choosing* to take the ridiculous pathway... so it's super busy as well. So you say to hell with that, I'm staying in the easy line.

This is what happens when you OD on tylenol at the same time as drinking alcohol. Even though the tylenol would normally start to be broken down by the CYP2E1 pathway, all the alcohol in your system is also competing for this pathway... which means that less tylenol is broken down this way, less NAPQI is formed, and you get less liver damage.

Now for chronic alcohol ingestion. Instead of being a one day convention for people named Alcohol... they all actually got banished from the respective towns that they lived in (because they were always drunk and annoying), so they have no choice but to spend all their time at this national park. As a result, the dangerous trail is very well worn. You, Mr/Mrs Tylenol say, ""well, its' so well worn, it can't be bad"" and choose to take it over the easy picnic table route. Even though the picnic table route isn't even that busy.

In chronic alcoholism, the number of CYP2E1 enzymes is increased (because you're always drinking, your body adapts to improve its ability to break alcohol down). As a result though, if you take tylenol, even an amount that normally wouldn't cause huge issues in a healthy person, an unexpectedly larger chunk will get broken down by the CYP2E1 pathway, leading to NAPQI production. As a result, you get NAPQI produced at lower levels of tylenol exposure, and when you do overdose, even *more* NAPQI is produced than if you weren't a drinker.",0,1355425433,,0,False,2,c7g2ad8,t3_14s9bt,t1_c7g2ad8,t1_c7g1zun,,1430664769,1959,False,askscience,t5_2qm4e,1959

True,isleepinahammock,,,"Well if there were truly no limit on how far your magical device could compress the water, you could make it ""just disappear.""

Say you start out with a sphere of water the size of a basketball. If you could somehow magically applying an arbitrarily large compressive force to this sphere, you could compress it to the point of collapsing into a black hole. Such a black hole would have an incredibly small Schwarzschild radius, we're talking sub-atomic size.

Such a black hole would also be very short lived. It would almost instantly decay via Hawking radiation. As soon as you released the field containing the black hole, all the mass energy of the black hole would be released very rapidly as a stream of high energy gamma rays and subatomic particles.

Of course, we need to consider the mass-energy of the original water. A basketball has a volume of about 8.5 liters. Thus, a basketball will hold 8.5 kg of water. Using the classic E=m x c^2, you get a mass energy of 7.65x10^17 Joules, or 183 megatons of TNT.

This is an explosion three times the yield of the Tsar Bomba, the largest nuclear device ever tested. As for what this explosion would look like, here's a description of the Tsar Bomba from Wikipedia:

&gt; The fireball reached nearly as high as the altitude of the release plane and was seen almost 1,000 kilometres (620 mi) from ground zero. The subsequent mushroom cloud was about 64 kilometres (40 mi) high (over seven times the height of Mount Everest), which meant that the cloud was above the stratosphere and well inside the mesosphere when it peaked. The base of the cloud was 40 kilometres (25 mi) wide. All buildings in the village of Severny (both wooden and brick), located 55 kilometres (34 mi) from ground zero within the Sukhoy Nos test range, were destroyed. In districts hundreds of kilometers from ground zero wooden houses were destroyed, stone ones lost their roofs, windows and doors; and radio communications were interrupted for almost one hour. One participant in the test saw a bright flash through dark goggles and felt the effects of a thermal pulse even at a distance of 270 kilometres (170 mi). The heat from the explosion could have caused third-degree burns 100 km (62 mi) away from ground zero. A shock wave was observed in the air at Dikson settlement 700 kilometres (430 mi) away; windowpanes were partially broken to distances of 900 kilometres (560 mi).[10] Atmospheric focusing caused blast damage at even greater distances, breaking windows in Norway and Finland. The seismic shock created by the detonation was measurable even on its third passage around the Earth.

So yes, assuming a magical machine that can compress water to any desired density, water can ""just disappear."" However it ""disappears"" into a nuclear hellstorm that could easily kill millions.

Edit: You gotta think about this kid, this was most likely his first ever party he got invited to. He was all excited when he was asked and he went home to ask his parents to take him to a party Friday night. He didn't know what to expect or what to wear because he's never been to a party before. He puts on all his nice clothes thinking it'd be a fun social talking kinda party. Friday comes and he's really nervous but kind of excited. An hour before the party he's getting ready and he kind of wants to not go anymore but doesn't want to embarrass himself to his parents. He gets to the party and is super nervous but is looking for friends to have someone to talk to. None of his friends are there but there are all the popular kids. This is when he starts to think that they invited him as either a joke or to make fun of him, either way he thinks they didn't actually want him to show up. He has very little social skills and no self esteem so he doesn't go up to meet anyone but he doesn't want to call his parents to pick him up 10 minutes after being there. He decides to tough it out and wait for people to come up to him but even if they did he wouldn't know how to respond. On the inside he's crying but on the outside he's keeping it calm. After about an hour or so he decides to call his parents to pick him up. He didn't socialize at all other than maybe a ""hi"" or ""hello"" to some people. His parents get there and he hasn't moved for 30 minutes so when he starts walking out he can feel his shame in his legs. He knows from this point on that he will never be like the other people at that party, dancing and having a great time. He's a real nice guy if you ever get to meet him but you'd have to come up to him because he likes to keep to himself. At school the next Monday he sinks into his seat lower than normal and keeps a low profile just in case someone from the party recognizes him and makes fun of him. But one day he meets someone, a friend. A friend he'll have for a long time. Someone who likes the same stuff as him and is shy too. Now he's happy. He's finally happy and he can start becoming social and making new friends, the beginning of a new person. That one friend that started it all, he'll never forget. We all have that friend. If you haven't, you will. If you really don't think you will have anyone that will love you, just think of this kid. He'd love you.

All of that combined - mostly the attention - causes Riot to look at champions and say ""Why is this champion popular? Is (s)he too strong? Too weak? How? Why? Should we do something about it?""

Usually, we see this most prominently with champions who receive *too much* attention, especially when people finally learn how to play champions. This is most prominently shown with release Irelia and Orianna. People believed these champions to be trash. Now, especially with Irelia, they're getting tweaked constantly. These are most often in the form of nerfs, which hardly impact the champion much, in Irelia's case, since it's her whole kit that makes her so damn strong. The Season Three items essentially fixed that, though it may have been a *wee bit* too much.

Now, with Cho'Gath, it's a different story! And here is where the awesome kicks in. For a very long time, Hotshot was just about the only Cho'Gath player in the competitive scene worldwide; And anybody else who played him was severely below his level. Just because Hotshot's playstyle meshes with the champion so well. Hotshot is patient, and works slowly and methodically in lane and teamfights. This is why I *still* think Hotshot is among the best - if not, *the* best - Cho'Gath in the world. It's best summed up by a conversation between Saintvicious and Doublelift (Sadly, ""Confirmed on Saint's stream; how droll) right around when Liftlift joined CLG:

""Have you ever seen any Cho play as good as Hotshot?""

""Soaz kinda, I guess. Malunoo.""

""No, they suck. Did they win tournaments with Cho? Did they even win any games or single engagements *because* of Cho?""

""I'd have to go check-""

""Nah, mang. Don't check replays. They ain't as good as Hotshot. Have you seen the Ruptures Hotshot lands? He holds that shit until he knows he can either get a major pickoff or hit more than one person. Just that *threat* of his godlike ruptures means he can walk at the entire enemy team and scare the shit out of him.""

I'll let you guess who's who there.

Essentially, Cho'Gath's kit is also what makes him awesome! Though, it takes a lot more patience than most other champions. You can be quick and rash and aggressive with Cho, but you have potentially the *highest* gain out of *almost* any other champion by just threatening to even land a good Feral Scream, let alone a Rupture that could land onto multiple people. What makes Cho'Gath so amazing is that he's the beefiest, largest, most thick moving wall in the game. He's capable of single-handedly zoning entire teams away from an area or a choke point, granted he's in position first. He's the one champion that synergizes the most with map control - sans those with global potential of course - and *that* is just part of what makes him so threatening.

Singed, Nunu, Blitzcrank and Leona also do this very well *by themselves*. Outside of that, Karthus, Anivia, Orianna and Lulu, as well as potentially Nami can do this with varying levels of team support, though they cannot do this *with their bodies*. They effectively turn choke points into death traps. Anivia can do this by herself, Karthus needs light team support, and Orianna, Lulu and Nami require follow-up.

Of course, there are many other champions that can do this as well, such as Nasus and Trundle and even Rumble and Irelia, etc etc...But they threaten with high damage on the side along with team support. It's not often you get a champion that can wade through the enemy team for ten full seconds, but Cho'Gath is one of them.

If you're skilled with Cho'Gath, it is entirely your skill. You land one rupture on more than one person, and *you* won that teamfight for your team. Be it peeling or diving. Whereas Irelia needs a lot more conditions bent around killing the opposing carry in order to *come out looking good* in a teamfight.

...Take all of this with a grain of salt and assuming *relatively* equal gold between two teams.

There is increasing evidence that marijuana can cause long term damage to young people, namely teens. 

There is truth in both sides of the spectrum. There are limited studies done on Schedule I drugs, because of it's listing it is considered to have no medicinal value. To understand why Marijuana was listed as a Schedule I drug you have to look back through history to the early 1900's. The medical problems with marijuana stem from side effects, short and long term and some that only affect some users and addiction. The societal problems extend far beyond that. It is best to take what information is available, from both sides, and come to conclusions from the facts.

Is a good pro marijuana advocacy groups listing of studies relating to marijuana:

There was a study done on the effects of marijuana use on youth in Canada. They found that smoking marijuana before the brain is fully formed (The medical community agrees that your brain fully forms around the years of 18 to 25) can create long term issues. Here is a quote from the researchers study:

“Teenagers who are exposed to marijuana have decreased serotonin transmission, which leads to mood disorders, as well as increased norepinephrine transmission, which leads to greater long-term susceptibility to stress,” Dr. Gobbi stated.

&gt;Heavy teenage cannabis use linked with anxiety disorders in late 20s

[Here is a CBC Nature of Things documentary that.](http://www.cbc.ca/documentaries/natureofthings/2010/downsideofhigh/)  explores studies on teens who start smoking marijuana before the age of sixteen are four times more likely to become schizophrenic. That's the startling conclusion of some of the world's top schizophrenia experts, whose research is featured in the new documentary The Downside of High

We should legalize it, tax it, and regulate it so teenagers under a certain age aren't legally able to buy it. Drug dealers have no regulated body to manage them, or any formal code of ethics. The major problem, both from the standpoint of marijuana being bad, and it being good, is the absurd declaration of making marijuana a schedule I drug, which means it has no health benefits and thus no studies will be done on it's benefits or dangers. Let us not forget that the marijuana prohibition laws were passed largely due to racism and as a means to keep poor minorities below the white man. This is why there is such a large black and latino population still in jails, many for non violent drug offences. 

The drug policy of the United States and the eagerness of it's allies to adopt it's policies has done nothing to prevent the usage of drugs or prevent it being sold. If anything it has criminalized it, glamorized it, made it taboo, and thus there is no education. 

The drug policies of the future focus on education, health, and science. [Like with Portugals staggering results](http://www.businessinsider.com/portugal-drug-policy-decriminalization-works-2012-7). The drug policies of today are archaic machinations of a predominately racist white power structure that permeates the United States Government and most western nations. 

People who pick a side tend to stick with information that confirms their ideas, instead of reasoning and science. Unbiased facts.

I would also like to state than when quantifying the dangers of a drug you have to look at it from a few different angles, addiction, side effects, long term effects, and how dangerous a lethal dose would be for each drug. Obviously drugs like alcohol, and nicotine via tobacco on an overall scale can cause a lot more damage than marijuana, but marijuana shouldn't be free from the scrutiny of science just because of a previous and currently flawed policy.

There are cases like in this [documentary that explores the](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv82CXDNtHA) potential medicinal value of LSD and psilocybin for people suffering from cluster headaches but can't because it's illegal. It is time to give up our idea that legal drugs are ok and illegal ones have no value, because it isn't rooted in science. We must look at the potential of drugs previously found to have no value, because it has the power to change the way we look at addictions and drugs. 

Watch this documentary about LSD, Albert Hofmann, and it's use in Canadian Psychiatric Institutions in the 50's and 60's, as well as a brief history on LSD. The Doctors from the institutions treated severe alcoholism with LSD, and found it to work quite well. The patients having a psychedelic experience saw how much they were hurting their family, and the harm they were doing to their lives. The Doctors themselves ingest LSD to see what it might be like for a patient suffering from schizophrenia. It is wild watching these old, scientific men, recount their experience of LSD. A beautiful documentary in a sober or non sober state.

I envision marijuana horticulturalists to work closely with scientists and the medical community in the future because they are an untapped resource when it comes to the studies. There is also limited research into CBD and CBC, but studies are slowly being done. 

I have a huge problem with both the culture of misinformation and prohibition, as well as the modern drug culture that fosters no respect for drugs. 

I disagree with the recreational use without the awareness that it is medicine and that you are self medicating, and from the standpoint of media glorifying it to teens in music, movies the internet, and television, without them having proper understanding of what it does.

I approach drug use from an anthropological standpoint, that human beings have been experimenting for thousands of years with them, and previous to this generation of drug use, drug use in almost all areas of the world was regarded as spiritual, a source of knowledge. People who were witch doctors, or medicine men, had intimate knowledge of powerful plants. This knowledge has come and gone in cycles, wiped out only to resurface.

In closing, we know a little about cannabis, and new studies are done all the time. Imagine though, if we started studying this plant during the spiritual awakening of the 60's. How much more we would know about it, it's effects, and what potential uses it could have as medicine.

True,Charwinger21,,,"This is actually a much more complicated question that it would appear to be.

First things first, the question isn't [H.264](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.264/MPEG-4_AVC) versus [35 mm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/35_mm_film). H.264 is a compression format, [4k](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4K_resolution) is a resolution. Resolution is the closest equivalent to film size that we're going to get.

One of the main problems with traditional film is that it suffers wear and tear. A film one week into its run won't look the same as it did on its first day. You also have to be careful with how you handle it. I once saw a Twilight film **catch on fire** while playing because it got caught on the tray and the projector burned right through it (that was a fun night). For the purpose of this comment however, I'm going to assume that the film is in perfect condition.

Right off the bat, we've got the problem that there is more than one type of film. The two main types are [35 mm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/35_mm_film) (normal cinemas) and [15/70](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/70_mm_film#IMAX_.2815.2F70.29) ([IMAX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMAX)).

IMAX film is simply amazing. If you've seen the home media release of [TDKR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Knight_Rises) and compare it to any movie filmed on 35 mm, the difference is **VERY** visible, and that's not even the full IMAX resolution. The cameras are better than 35 mm cameras, and more care is taken all the way through the production line. The problems with IMAX are that the cameras are loud (which is why the dialogue scenes in TDKR aren't filmed in IMAX), the cameras are [gigantic](http://i.imgur.com/ftCGB.jpg), the film is unwieldy for projectionists to handle (as seen above), and it is a lot more expensive to produce all the way through the distribution chain. It is considered to be about equivalent with anywhere from 16k (15360x8640) digital cinema on the high side to [4k](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4K_resolution)-6k on the low side.

Then we have 35 mm. This is **REALLY** old. It's been around since the 1800s, although what you see now isn't the same thing as what was around then. Most noticeably, the cameras have gotten **MUCH** better. The lenses are larger, the glass used in the lenses are better, etc. It results in more light going through, but those techniques can also be applied to digital cameras. People claim that 35 mm is the equivalent of anywhere from 4k (original master vs. digital) on the high end to about [1267x685](http://www.cst.fr/IMG/pdf/35mm_resolution_english.pdf) on the low end.

When it comes to digital, you know what you're getting every time. There's no degradation over time (unless [the HDD fails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk_drive_failure), which usually means that it goes directly from ""full quality"" to [""doesn't play what was on the failed sector""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_corruption), or the bulb is burnt/burning out), and there's no degradation from the master to what you're watching. On top of that, [the cameras are tiny](http://i.imgur.com/Fa2Gn.jpg), which opens up new avenues for how things can be filmed. There are two types of digital cinema projectors in use right now (2k and 4k), and two more around the corner (8k and 16k). The biggest problem with digital, is that it improves too quickly. Movie theatres don't want to replace their projectors every 5 years, they want to replace them every 50. And that is why there are [phones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC_J_Butterfly) coming out that are almost the same resolution [as some cinema projectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_cinema) (1920x1080 vs. 2048x1080 AKA 2K digital cinema). Not to worry though, [8K](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8K_UHDTV) is expected to be in North American homes by 2015-2020, events are already being filmed in UHDTV, we've already got [2560x1600 tablets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexus_10) available for $400, and some 2560x1440 monitors are below $300. If movie theatres want to remain relevant, they'll come around, upgrade to 8k and 16k, and upgrade their sound systems as well.

* **Now, onto frame rate.**

I know you didn't ask this, but it's one of the big differences between traditional film and digital cinema. With traditional film, doubling the frame rate physically doubles the size. With digital cinema, doubling the frame rate doubles the storage media needed (if no compression is used), however the physical size of the storage media will stay the same (they might have to grab a more expensive storage device though).

Most movies are filmed at 24 Hz (23.976 to be precise). That means that each eye sees 24 different frames per second (which in the case of a 2D movie means 24 frames per second). In order to increase the number of frames shown, the reel has to move at a faster speed, and there has to be more film available per second. In order to show a film at 48 Hz, 48 frames per second need to be displayed, resulting in a doubling in costs and print size. In order to show a 3D film at 48 Hz like the Hobbit, the film would have to show **96 FRAMES PER SECOND** (48 per eye per second), resulting in a quadrupling in costs and print size. That's just not reasonable for film. You'd be looking at prints even larger than above, especially if things move up to 120 Hz like they are with gaming and [television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra-high-definition_television).

Unfortunately, 24 Hz, while enough for the image to seem continuous, is not enough for a perfectly fluid image. That's why everything seems to jerky any time the camera moves. It is commonly accepted that [at least 75 Hz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flicker_fusion_threshold#Display_refresh_rate) would be needed for a perfectly fluid image, although there is evidence that it would need to be even higher than that. Thankfully, digital projection can handle this (and more) without too many changes to the existing technology. I wouldn't be surprised if we saw a 120 Hz 3D movie (240 frames per second) in theatres some time in the next decade.",0,1355460473,,0,1355510211,1,c7gchmw,t3_14swqj,t1_c7gchmw,t1_c7g9p28,,1430669648,78,False,movies,t5_2qh3s,78

They would always want partial credit and I would rarely give it because

1. They clearly didn't check their work
2. It meant they didn't understand the concept (could partially my fault, I'll admit) and were not thinking critically. If you multiply x by itself, you should know that I need a x^2 in the answer somewhere
3. It was just flat out wrong (see #1)

They'd say ""well it's close"" to which I would ask if they had a job. If yes I'd ask them ""Well what if work paid you less than you earned? What if they paid you 'close' to the amount they owed you?""  

I always felt bad, but it really hammered in the fact that the kids needed to check their work and think about their answers. I stuck to my guns and within a few weeks it would no longer be an issue and I could start to back off.

-----------------------------------------------

A related story because I feel like procrastinating. I gave a test and I am grading them and everything is as it should be when I get to one kid's test and the last question is just a mess. The question, calculate the parts of a parabola, was at  the top of the page and the rest of the page was blank so they could show their work.  The page is a disaster. Almost every equation is half erased or scratched out. I'm thinking this poor kid is about to get a 0/10 for this question. At the bottom of the page, the only legible thing on it, is the word ""OVER"".

I turn it over and instead of seeing more scribbled equations, I see a paragraph written.  I could tell it was written very quickly. The student had finished the problem and realized that his answer didn't make sense. He checked his work and found out he made a silly mistake (used the wrong variable) in like step 2 of 15 and it skewed his results all the way down. He tried to go back and fix it by modifying the numbers in each equation but it got too confusing and the differences in the equations he had vs what he should have were too great to be changed by simply changing numbers

The equation of a parabola is ax^2 +bx+c. The x-coordinate of the vertex is located at x=-b/(2a). This poor student did x=-c/(2a).

He went on to explain that he knows he messed up finding the first part because he used *c* and he should have used *b* instead. Because of this, his location of the vertex was wrong, which means his location of nearly everything else was wrong (focus, x-intercepts, axis of symmetry). He simply did not have time to recalculate the values.

I gave him a 9/10. Yes, he missed the problem, he didn't find the answer, but he knew what he did wrong. I never wrote or administered tests because I wanted the kids to crunch numbers; I did it so I could test their understanding of the subject matter. This is the same reason why I (for the most part, but not all the time) used numbers that were nice, that resulted in integers vs throwing fractions at the kids. This student's explanation showed me that he understood the material.

He recognized that the solution was not correct, identified the mistake, explained how it skewed his answers, and described how he would have solved the problem had he had more time.

I'd have given him a 10/10 if my co-operating teacher would have let me, but I was overruled.

Do not despair though, you'll go through a phase where you feel like you're a cancer patient.

Followed by a phase where you feel you cannot wear any leather (jacket), in fear of looking like a biker. You also feel slightly like a bouncer to a too fancy nightclub while wearing suits.

My advice is to not go full shave, unless you're extremely lean and got no oily skin. The full shave is very agressive, very absolute. I use a clipper and buzz it down to it's lowest setting, in my case 1.2mm. That way you've got a muuuch mellower look, a much more versatile look that doesn't scream CANCER PATIENT/VOILENT BIKER, yet is neat and makes you look great over all.

Good luck on your journey, [here is me](), feeling long haired (shave day today!) and slightly bearded because fuck shaving when you're sick. Jack&amp;Jones scarf, H&amp;M Button-down, please no fashion critique, I'm down with the flu and I'm just staying warm :(

True,[deleted],,,"I looked through the comments and didn't see anything close to what I do so I'll post mine. 

I'm not going to claim to be any sort of expert but I've had trouble wanting to go to sleep since I was a child (I don't want to call it insomnia because that's serious shit, but I wouldn't be surprised if I ever got diagnosed with it). Some of the earliest memories I have are staring at the ceiling of my room at 5 years old, wiggling my toes at 4am just so I could stay awake for no other reason than I wanted to keep using my brain. Suffice it to say the internet hasn't helped. 

This got so bad that during college I would come full circle in my sleep cycles, meaning I would actually keep staying up a few hours later every night/day until I was going to bed at proper hours again, and this would continue. There was a period of time during my junior year where I was literally on a constant rotating sleep cycle because I just didn't want to go through the agony of trying to fall asleep. I would rather crash in bed every time from exhaustion than be alone with my own thoughts. Growing up I'd be up for entire nights sometimes doing nothing but trying to go to sleep, laying there in silent torture.

Anyways, a combination of 4chan and real medical advice online changed my life 2 years ago. Here are the best ways you can learn to love sleeping and fall asleep without pumping your bloodstream full of sleeping pills and becoming a slave to drugs.

___________________________________________________

**NUMBER 1: LAY THE FUCK STILL** - So simple, yet so hard to do. When I say 'sit still' I don't mean 'lay down and shift your positions occasionally and fiddle with your pillow/blankets', I mean **don't move a fucking fibrous muscle in your body**. This is the number one thing that helped me calm the fuck down and fall asleep faster. Take a minute to get all snuggly and find your perfect position, then freeze (in a relaxed way, of course). In addition to this, **take deep, long, methodical breaths** and listen to the sound of your own breathing.

You'll find that you have to actively think about not fidgeting because it's an automated behavior like breathing or swallowing. You'll also find that you have to devote quite a bit of mental process to not moving, which takes a lot of brain power away from the crazy ass thoughts that run through your head right when you lay down. If you only have mild problems with falling asleep, try this first.

___________________________________________________

**NUMBER 2: TURN OFF EVERYTHING** - I don't care if you just got a message from someone or if you have to fall asleep to the TV: turn. it. the. fuck. off. Primates are diurnal, and we've evolved to sleep at night. I've seen study after study after study about how staring at bright-ass screens right before bed completely fucks up your Circadian rhythm, and it interferes with critical body repair and brain functions while you sleep. [See this excellent exchange for more in-depth info and studies!](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/14tysq/hey_reddit_what_are_some_of_the_tricks_you_use/c7giprt) Don't just put it on silent: **Turn it off. End of discussion.** If you have to look at screens at night, look into programs and apps like f.lux that make them less hard on the eyes. Turn your screen brightness down all the way at 6pm, and allow 30 minutes of time away from screens before you sleep. Going straight from screen to bed is what messes with things, and it's why you feel jacked up right after you lay down. 

This goes for ALL lights too. Invest in a blackout curtain. I cannot properly describe the **magical, intense, deep, ancient, mythical** feeling that comes from sleeping in a pitch black room. No night lights, no lights creeping under the door or peeping through the window. Sweet, nurturing, black velvety darkness. That feeling when you open your eyes and realize it's no different from when they were closed is incredible. The difference this makes in going to sleep and getting *quality* REM sleep is like night and day (no pun intended).

If you're one of those people that wakes up to pee all the time, first of all you need to evaluate your diet and drinking habits, but secondly to combat tripping over shit in the pitch blackness just get a remote controlled light that you can keep by your nightstand. Easy fix.

___________________________________________________

**NUMBER 3: NO FOOD BEFORE BED** - Again, another obvious thing that we don't stop to think about. Don't eat or drink anything before bed other than water. If you get the munchies before bed than you aren't eating enough during the day or during dinnertime, or you're ingesting too much caffeine. Food is fuel. 

Remember that: **food is fuel**. When you eat sugary or carb-filled food before bed, your body is ready to fucking go for round 2. You're essentially telling your body ""hey buddy, we're gonna be in this one for the long haul, get ready."" Ironically, this is why I recommend eating wholesome food (and NOT drinking caffeine) throughout the night as a number one tip to pulling an effective all-nighter. It's much better at keeping you awake than Red Bull or Coffee.

**Edit for clarification:** If you have a really high metabolism and are generally hungry all the time, eating some fruit or grains a few hours before bed can help you get to sleep. What I'm saying here is don't stuff your face with cake and pizza then go try to sleep, because that shit is pure energy and it will keep you up. It's better to eat a big dinner and sleep soundly than keep eating **right** up until you sleep because it causes all sorts of digestive problems and can give you restless sleep.

___________________________________________________

**NUMBER 4: WAKE UP TO LIGHT, NOT SOUND** - I found this in my journeys online time and time again. This has been recommended by neurologists, sleep pathologists, psychologists, you name it. Again, think about our ancestors. When you wake up to screeching, loud noises evolutionary psychology comes into play and your brain goes into stress mode. Now Western humans have adapted to this for the most part, but the stress is still there. You're wreaking havoc on your body and mind waking to jarring sounds rather than to the sunrise like all other diurnal animals on Earth do. 

But dingle_dang, you may ask, how do I wake up to the sunrise if my room is blacked out? Two methods:

1: Make sure your room is pitch black at night but by the time sunrise comes there are little peeps of light breaking through cracks in the door or window. You may think this isn't enough to do the job, but if you start sleeping in total blackness *any* slight change in light will be enough to wake you. Most of you. If you're not that light-sensitive (and you've tried this) I would recommend:

2 - A light alarm. These are nifty little gadgets you can pick up for under $100 on Amazon or someplace online that gradually radiate a natural looking light when you program it to wake you up. They start dim and get brighter  to mimic sunrise, and from personal experience I can tell you they work damn well. There are some that start chirping or making jungle noises if you don't turn it off past the time it's set to also.

Take my word on this one: **Waking up to light will change your life.**

___________________________________________________

**NUMBER 5: BASE YOUR SLEEP OFF OF REM CYCLES** - Forget that ""8 hours a day"" bullshit, because it's bullshit and it's out of date with current neuroscience. The fact is that people are all a little different and require different amounts of sleep. Some people really do need 10-12 hours. Why? They just do, and right now we really don't know exactly why.

*However*, there is one thing about sleeping that is pretty consistent for all humans: **Our REM cycles are about 90 minutes.** Have you ever had those mornings where you got a lot of sleep but still felt like absolute shit waking up, like you were fighting to get out of bed with every fiber of your being? It's because you woke up in the middle of REM sleep. Your body does all kinds of mysterious shit during this process that we don't yet fully understand, and when you're interrupted in the middle of a cycle it fucks with you royally.

Use this tool to help you understand when you should be going to bed (or waking up if you're a NEET) to get full REM cycles: www.sleepyti.me Although this is anecdotal evidence, I can personally vouch for this. If you want to wake up feeling like a Disney Princess, base your sleep off of 90-minute intervals and get however much sleep you need. It's different for everyone. If you're extra pro you can experiment and fine-tune how long your REM cycles are by recording times. When you get on a schedule your body gets surprisingly efficient at doing the same thing every night.

Here's a great overview of REM sleep: http://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/excessive-sleepiness-10/sleep-101

___________________________________________________

**NUMBER 6: BE CONSISTENT** - Last but not least, the key to success is consistency. **If your day schedule is consistent, your sleep should be consistent** You know that one friend that you had, who never liked to hang out late and made excuses for going to bed early *every* night you and your friends had a get together? Turns out he knew what the fuck was up: You can follow all of this advice and still get shitty sleep because you're not sleeping at the same times every night.

We've gotten so busy in our society that we've started thinking 'any sleep is good sleep, no matter when you get it'. While there is considerable evidence to suggest that humans really all need a 90 minute nap around 1 or 2pm ('that 2pm feeling' anyone?) based off of primate studies and observation, you can still train yourself to get great sleep over one period of time by consistently sleeping at the same, exact time every. single. night. 

When you rob yourself of consistency, you start to accumulate a sleep debt (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_debt) that must be made up for. You need to get consistent sleep for 1-2 weeks to start reaping the benefits, but trust me when I say that this step is vital.

**ADDITIONAL TIPS:**

* Treat your bed as yourself. Don't keep your shit on it. Wash your sheets every week. Make your bed every morning. It has a real psychological effect when you have to move shit off your nasty, smelly bed every night and you wake up to getting poked by pens and shit while getting tangled up in your unmade covers and blankets. **You spend 1/3 of your life sleeping.** Think about quality of life.

* Exercise (Thanks QuOS): Mow the lawn, ride a bike, run around, do something every day. Exhaust yourself physically and sleep will come much easier. We have a lot of energy from sitting around all the time, and it carries over into when we try to sleep. 

* Couples: Consider sleeping in separate beds. I know this is blasphemous, but there's no rule that couples *have* to sleep in the same bed. In fact, one of the world's leading sleep researchers sleeps in a separate bed than his wife. http://www.salon.com/2012/08/14/separate_beds_are_liberating/ . Sleeping in separate beds doesn't mean you don't love each other, it means you're concerned about getting a good night's rest.

* Invest in a nice mattress. There are some passionate debates about this one, but once I went to a memory foam mattress I never looked back. Mattresses are not luxury items, they are right up there with food and water. Act accordingly.

* Meditation/Silent Time. There are actual brain scans to prove that daily meditation (just a fancy term for be still and collect your thoughts in silence) lowers stress and has positive physiological effects on the body. Before sleeping is the perfect time to do it. If you've never meditated before, start by thinking about what's bothering you and visualize letting it go. Make sure there are no noises or distractions. Breathe in and out heavily and relax. Works wonders.

* Keep a journal. Just like meditating, self-reflection helps organize your life and de-stress. Writing a little bit can help calm you down before sleeping.

* Temperature and Noise (Credit to Ill_be): Don't suffer in your own house sweating or freezing during the night. Purchase low-noise fans or bundle up to achieve your perfect temperature. Also, minimize noise. I figured this is a given but some like to have noises when they fall asleep.

* Yank the Crank: If you have a high sex drive, you may need to unwind by getting off. A lot of guys kind of figure this out instinctively, but ladies should also consider masturbation or sex to deal with night time anxiety and stress. In the Middle Ages and Renaissance the majority of people slept for about 4 hours at night, woke up and had sex, smoked or talked for a bit then went back to ""second sleep"". We can learn much from them.

**TL;DR Don't move a muscle, turn everything that has electricity in it off, sleep in total darkness, only water before bed, wake up to light not sound, base your sleep off of REM cycles and be consistent in your sleep.**

**To all the night shift workers:** I'm sorry but the best advice I could give is to find a job where you're asleep at night. I know, not something you can just go and do, but there's not much you can do to substitute getting sunlight. I would suggest making your sleeping area as dark as possible. Wear ear plugs, get blackout curtains and sleep masks, do whatever you have to. ",0,1355471416,,0,1355503187,1,c7gembh,t3_14tysq,t1_c7gembh,t3_14tysq,,1430670649,636,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,636

True,Stingerc,,,"Not in a gang or was ever initiated into one.  However I witnessed a very interesting interaction that involved a gang.  

This happened in the early 90's when gangsta rap was at it's peak.  I attended a rather posh private catholic school.  About 90% of the kids there were the sons of wealthy professionals and business people.   The other 10% was kids on athletic and academic scholarships.  

A group of freshmen &amp;amp; sophomores decided they would form a gang.  It was freaking hilarious.  They actually jump each other in (somebody in their class told us this), rode around tagging, and throwing gang signs, and sporting all Raiders hats and buttoned up flannel shirts (in fucking South Texas heath).   Keep in mind all these guys were little rich kid, one was the son of my dentist, another the son of a lawyer, etc.  

For some god damn reason everyone in their grade was scared of them, despite the fact they really had no reason to.  Apparently the rumor was that one of them had a knife and one had a gun.  So they would walk around and try to intimidate people.  

One day I was having lunch with my best friend and his girlfriend when these dudes passed by, shot us their gang sign (a generic east side sign as they were the East Street Forks) and one said ""yo, you wanna get with a real man"" to my friends gf.  

My friend got up pretty pissed off.  Just a little background, my friend was there on a football scholarship.  He wasn't a rich kid like me or the gang.   His dad was a mailman and he lived in a pretty shitty neighborhood, the kind where real gangs hung out.  The kind you actually heard drive by shootings at night.  So he wasn't really impressed by these guys.  

He sprang up and went up to the guy and told him ""the fuck did you say?"".  The leader of the ""gang"" told my friend to chill, that he needed to watch himself because he was stepping to the East street Forks.  He the lifted his flannel shirt and showed him a gun handle.  

My friend just snapped.  He grabbed the kid by the shirt and started to slap the shit out of him.  No punching just slapping him silly.  He started screaming he wasn't gonna punch him, because you punch men, and that you slap bitches.  After about 20 slaps the gun fell out of his waistband and it turned out to be a starter pistol.  The rest of his gang stood there frozen shitless as my friend continued to slap their leader.  The kid eventually started to wail and my friend stopped.  They all stood there quietly just watching their boy cry.   

From then on they would avoid us whenever they saw us.  Years later I found out one of my current gf's best friends dated this kid on and off for years.  He had seen me with my gf talking to her.  He proceeded to tell her I was one of the bullies who made his life hell in high school.  I told my the friend who beat him this and we had a laugh.  My friend is an incredibly mellow and dedicated social worker now.  ",0,1355476504,,0,False,1,c7gf9ds,t3_14trt2,t1_c7gf9ds,t3_14trt2,,1430670950,2055,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,2055

Shoplift some nail polish while you're at it. Eat at McDonalds. Cry.

Go to the drive-thru of the Taco Bell on Old Seward at night. Tell them you want your nachos crushed up in a tortilla. The tortilla should be free. Ask for a drink consisting of half a mango fruitista and half of a tropicana lemonade. It will taste reminiscent of Sunny D. Sunny D tastes like shit. Drive in the middle of the group of douchebags with pimped out trucks. Take your shitty Sunny D and throw it at the alpha Dodge Caravan. Drive away fast. Those fuckers won't know what hit them. 

Get really high. High enough that his face starts reminding you of certain genuses of the animal kingdom. Have a sober friend drive you two to China Lights. Talk to the waitress to butter her up and get you to a booth seat instead of one in the middle of the restaurant. Go to the buffet tables. Eat foods starting from the bottom of the food pyramid. Watch him laugh as you attempt to eat a plate of just white rice. Eat because you are high and everything will be delicious. Eat until you can feel your insides trying to eat its way out of you. Eat until you are crying and on the floor. It will hurt like a motherfucker.

I'm very hard working but I want to get in, work, and get out. Large, top companies try to make the company your home which they try to sell by advertising it as *""fun""*. That for me is always a red flag.

EDIT: adding some more

I personally have come to believe computer nerds are being taken advantage of by smart and savvy business men.

We have created a culture where you are *by default* expected to have no life. People take it for granted, that you are a hacker, you have no life and interest other than sitting there and writing code. This way they discount everything on you, *hey! he's having fun! he does the same shit at home as well, let's pay him 10 peanuts per hour and he'll be more than happy*.

Our *open source* culture has created multi-billion-dollar industries and half of the computing systems of the world is running on the shoulders of the code that a bunch of nerds started writing for fun.

Don't you think we deserve to be treated better than we are currently? Don't you think we also need to take the economic structure of our society into account? *[If you are good at something, never do it for free!](http://i.imgur.com/ji8pi.jpg)*

We have created this expectation, you see it everywhere, *ramen-noodle-eating, caffeine-addicted, couch-sleeping hacker*.

Contrast this with another very different group in the society, lawyers. Have you ever heard of a *ramen-noodle-eating, caffeine-addicted, couch-sleeping lawyer?* No because lawyers don't let you call their profession *fun*.

Who knows? they may even have more fun than we do. But they have strategy. They make you believe that they hate their jobs and their job is the most difficult thing in the world.

That's why they can charge $300/hour and no one questions it. They are lawyers after all, they are supposed to make that much money. Right?

But if you are a software engineer, *you greedy bastard! how dare you want money? isn't the fun enough for you?*

That's why we've ended up selling software for 99 cents which people still are too tight to pay for.

After all, we've built decent operating systems for free, who pays for an app?

This is our fault, we've raised expectations so high that people just wont be satisfied.

It's all about perception, once you agree to sell something for cheap, be it your skills or an app, people see that thing as cheap and worthless no matter how good it really is. This is what lawyers and politicians get right, they collectively maintain this attitude and sense of status that we have long forgiven.

That's why as soon as I say lawyer, you imagine some rich guy in a suit, and as soon as I say hacker, you imagine some poor bastard sitting in a dark basement.

But it doesn't have to be this way. We've changed the world. And we can change this too.

Most professionals don't do jack shit for free. And they still get more respect than half of us put together.

Have you heard of financial analysts pulling all-nighters and *hackathons*? Or accountants?

EDIT: clarification for the above sentence. I know that many other professionals do have to work for long hours. By pulling all-nighters and hackathons what I'm referring to is the culture and expectation that you mix your profession with your personal time and life. Which simply doesn't exist in other professions.

For example an accountant isn't really expected to have invented new accounting methods in his spare time as ""fun side project"". He is not expected to write a blog about accounting techniques. He is not expected to have pulled all-nighters with his peers to invent some new accounting method. If they do pull all-nighters it's simply because of the volume of the work that they need to get done during busy periods not because of cultural expectations. These two are different and not comparable.

Let's not let other people use our passion for technology to take advantage of us. If you're passionate, that's great, enjoy it for yourself and with those who are also truly passionate but don't sell your knowledge for cheap to the guy who wants to buy your brain.

Edit: Folks I've a fair bit more to add and say about this whole thing. I've written the above pretty lazily in bed. If you think it's good and valuable let me know we can improve it together and turn it into a manifesto that we can refer people to. What do you think?

True,ThinkEL,,,"A fair number of people think along the lines of ""I would never join a group that beats me as part of the initiation"" or ""Why would I want to join a gang and needlessly endanger myself?"" or other variations of ""Gangs are silly."" Well I really don't disagree, but it's just a whole different world when you're on the other side of the neighbourhood where gangs are integrated into your life weather you want them to be or not. I'll give an example that I watched take place every day and still today. You're in a fairly poor family in a crappy area and are surrounded by gangs. At first you are like every other child there, you hate the gangs and think they are really stupid, any child that see's people shooting and fighting for no apparent reason will think it's silly. But then your parents all of a sudden need some help to feed you and your siblings, so what do you do? You go to a gang and ask if you can do a job for some money, you don't want to join, you just want to take a job, and they will give it to you. You get the money and food stays on the table, but hey, that worked really well, maybe you can take on a couple more jobs just to save up a little. Woah, now you're making small deliveries of crack in buildings that are considered the bad part of an already bad neighbourhood. But it's okay, you're helping out your family and you still aren't really part of the gang, even though they now know you by name. Hey at this rate you might even be able to get out of this hell hole and go to a community college! Holy crap this is your opportunity, you can make a difference, you can change the way things are! Then all of a sudden a rival gang sees you working for this gang and decides to beat you up, or maybe throw a brick through your parents window. Now you need help, now you need the protection of a gang or you're screwed. So you end up joining the gang to protect yourself, but more importantly your family who you know shouldn't be involved at all.

There is the protection aspect of it, but there is also the community of it. While gangs have a pretty negative rep, inside the gang really is like a family. In a place where family values are scarce to come by, you see a group who is serving them out by the truckload. So you get in on that affection that you know you could never get from you're parents as a child and then you can't leave your new family. Or maybe your actual father is in the gang, then you are pretty much required to join and any friends u make are then going to be dragged in. Really there are a ton of aspects and conditions that lead perfectly good people to join gangs and frankly it bothers me how much others think that they understand what that person may be going through just because they are in a gang. I'm not saying gangs are good, infact I would say they are among the worst things a person can go through, but everyone should understand over half of those gang members never wanted to be there, it just happened that way and there is no real way out.

True,SproutandtheBean,,,"You're completely ignoring my point. I'm choosing not to do it because I've worked somewhere that (correctly) taught me that unless I can dedicate an isolated space to GF prep, that the food will NEVER, EVER, FOR ANY REASON WHATSOEVER be 100% gluten free. I can't control what gets put into the air. That those 8 parts per million, an amount so tiny I'd need a microscope to detect it, would get someone sick. An amount so small that it can stick into the cracks/knife scores on a cutting board that's been wiped down, or in the seam of a door.

Guess what, you're kitchen isn't gluten-free. The food you serve as gluten-free, isn't gluten-free. There are parts per million getting into things. Maybe only 1% of things. But that can make people sick. I worked for a year for a woman that would get sick at those parts per million. Don't try to act like I don't know what I'm doing or that I'm lazy. I know how to maintain a 100% gluten-free kitchen. You're dense if you think that gloves and sanitizer can magically erase flour from every inch of your kitchen. Especially if you make pasta, pizzas, bread, etc. It's everywhere. It's in the air. You can't sanitize the air. 

So cut the ""holier than thou"" bullshit and realize that 1. your attitude is dangerous and has and will get people sick and 2. that maybe, just maybe I've made this decision with my kitchen because I know that I will make someone sick and that is unacceptable unless I warn them and and INFORM them of how my kitchen is maintained. Let them make the decision based off the information that I am providing them. Real celiacs often have terrible experiences being lied to about what is and isn't GF. Acting like your kitchen and their food is magically GF is disservice to them and to yourself.

True,[deleted],,,"**FUCK THROWAWAYS.** When I was a younger sort of Goatsplosion, I had a stuffed clown named Bobo. He was pretty big, maybe about 3 1/2 feet tall. I never measured him, but I do remember that he wasn't too much shorter than I was at this point. I'd had him for a very long time, even though I didn't have him set up or anything like that. He spent most of his time stuffed into my closet with all my other shit... until I discovered masturbation. I am ashamed by what I'm about to write, but not really.

Around this time, the only ""porn"" I'd seen was ""Real Sex"" on HBO on demand. I'd watch it whenever my stepmom would go out to the bars on the weekends. Heart racing, volume down, having -no- idea what the fuck I was looking at... those were the days. Anyway, after discovering masturbation, I decided that I wanted to try some of the things I saw on that show. But how? I didn't have a willing girl to experiment with! I was discouraged until I was made to clean my room. I opened my closet, spotted Bobo, and was struck with inspiration. At the next available opportunity, I cut a hole in Bobo's crotch and from then on he was my little fuck toy. He eventually got so gross that I threw him away. 

About 4 months after I tossed Bobo, my uncle and I were going yard sale hopping in an entirely different state. In a giant pile of stuffed toys, what do I happen to find? Another clown exactly like Bobo. I bought it... cut a hole in it's crotch, and used it until THAT clown had to be thrown away. I was merciless. 

I guess that may be why I've never really been afraid of clowns. 

**EDIT** After much Googling, I actually found the exact kind of clown Bobo was! This photo is not of me, so please excuse the creepy looking dude and focus primarily on the [long-lost clown cousin](http://fc02.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2010/176/6/0/Emo_Mime_with_Clown_Doll_by_AlphamanXD1.jpg) of my poor little sex toy.

True,greekish,,,"You're being attacked, but let me share a personal story with you.

I have the most amazing / caring / level headed wife, and I can tell you that when she was pregnant she was fucking insane and irrational.  Every pregnant woman is different, and mine was a monster...it was a challenge every day to keep my cool, and remind myself that eventually things would return back to ""normal"".

Then we had our first child and things got HARDER.  She had a tremendous case of post pardom depression - it got so bad I felt like I needed to commit her to the hospital.  It was the hardest time in my life, and to top it all off there is a helpless newborn in the equation.

I made all the right moves, never lost my temper (patience yes, there were some long walks with the dog ha), stayed at home from work to take care of her and the baby.  You name it - when I replay the events in my mind I regret nothing and wouldn't do anything different.  The pregnancy was even planned...we both were just expecting the whole ordeal to be gumdrops and rainbows.

**SHE STILL FUCKING HATED ME**

Eventually the hormone levels returned to normal (took about 6 weeks after having the baby), and I'm happier now than ever.  Life has it's new challenges with the baby, but I have my partner back and everything feels manageable again.  My wife is a fucking awesome person, and the cornerstone of our family...but for about 7 months I had to endure insanity and complete chaos.  It wasn't her ""fault"", she just wasn't in control of her emotions.  I have a penis, I will never be able to relate - but I can have **sympathy**.

The point of this story is I want to let you know how large of an effect pregnancy alone can have on a marriage.  A lot of couples don't talk about it because for some dumbass reason women have it in their head that ""pregnancy is where you feel the best, like you are glowing...with radiant skin while you nurture the miracle of life"".  And if you don't feel that way then something is *wrong*.  Well let me tell you, that is bullshit.  Some might feel that way, but the reality is her hormones are wacked, she is having major body image issues, and the discomfort she is experiencing is something that no man will ever understand.

And you fucking CHEATED on her?

Look, you are lucky she didn't fucking stab you.  That wasn't a joke.  The fact that she hasn't actually tried to take your life (or to court) is proof enough that she wants to work things out with you.  It sounds like you have an amazing woman - **don't fuck this up**.

I'm serious.  You have been given a second chance by this woman whether you want to believe it or not.  Actions have consequence.  That consequence doesn't mean saying you're sorry - or giving her a million gifts.  It means you have to endure the awkwardness and distance.  How long?  However long it takes for her to get over the extreme hurt that you caused her.  You could be looking at a year, it could be 2.  This is the kind of shit that never COMPLETELY goes away.  You may pay for this for the rest of your life - and you know what?

If you really love her and your child - deal with it.

You want a chance to prove you are a man and can handle hard times?  This is it.  Fuck it up, and you're going to lose a woman that loves you - the rights to your child, and half your salary for 18 years.  I hate to be so blunt, but it really is that simple.

Actions have consequence.  You fucked up big.  I want to tell you, as a fellow man *STOP TREATING YOURSELF LIKE THE VICTIM*.  Grow some fucking balls and go through hell for a year.  You'll either surprise yourself with the adversity that you and your wife can overcome, or you'll split up.  

When things got really hard for me, I'd watch this clip until I wanted to vomit.  This clip will give you extreme perspective on how hard life can really be.  Please give it a watch.

More edit:  After rereading my comment, I sound like I was a really strong guy who handled adversity like some sort of stoic warrior.  I did not.  I held it together in front of my wife / child, but when I got some time alone I bawled like a baby.  I thought about leaving my wife.  I thought about how much I'd miss seeing my daughter all the time.  I thought about killing myself.  I feel like this is important to add because for anybody out there that is really dealing with a similar struggle, it's important to remember that you will feel immense emotional pain...and that even tho everything tells you what you are feeling isn't normal, it is.",0,1355489413,,0,1355501025,1,c7ggknc,t3_14swrj,t1_c7ggknc,t1_c7g5p9s,,1430671586,643,False,relationships,t5_2qjvn,643

Every time something like this happens, people of certain political persuasions pre-empt the gun control discussion by saying stuff like ""Don't politicize this tragedy!"" and ""Guns don't kill people, people kill people!""

Frankly, however, I've had enough of that. It's impossible to end the perverse, unnatural gun culture that has pervaded this country since its very birth, but it's not hard to finally say enough is enough and legislate. There needs to be the tightest regulations possible on gun purchases, particularly assault weapons.

The gun lobby will fight anything and everything done in reaction to this, if any action is undertaken federally. But if there is one sector of our society that I feel entirely comfortable saying needs to be regulated to high heaven, this must be it, because people are dying. And now kids are. There are common sense laws on gun ownership in most westernized countries. When will we join them? How many people have to die all for a guy's right to act macho?

Now's about the time that someone in the back of the room shouts about their right to defend themselves. And while that sounds nice in a text box in a comment section, let's get real here. You're not trying to protect your family by claiming the right to lug around your AR-15. You're taking pictures of yourself wearing camo, holding a completely unnecessarily powerful weapon for a civilian to have, and putting them on Facebook to get some precious Likes. You're not protecting yourself. You're compensating for something.

True,xrelaht,physics,PhD|Solid State Condensed Matter|Magnetism,"Yes, but I'll need to go into a little more detail about quantum mechanics. Special relativity says information can't be transmitted faster than c (the speed of light in a vacuum). Quantum mechanics says that there are ways to put two particles in a state where some property of the two particles is linked. The usual example is some particle decay which emits an electron-positron pair in opposite directions. You can then say with 100% certainty that if you measure the electron to be in the 'up' spin state then the positron must be in the 'down' spin state, and it doesn't matter how far the two particles are separated. They could travel a hundred billion light years and you'd still instantly know that the positron was in the opposite state from what you measured for the electron.

This doesn't sound weird yet. The electron was either spin up or down and the positron was either spin down or up. You haven't really transmitted any information from point A to point B at the time of measurement because it was all transmitted from the time of the initial decay to the time you measured it and it was carried by the electron. This is an idea called 'hidden variables': you may not know the state, but it's been determined. The problem is that that's wrong. You have to apply the hidden variables idea all over in quantum mechanics and things don't work right when you do. What's really happening is that the electron is in *both* the up and down states until you measure it, and the positron is in a similar 'superposition' of the two states. The definite up or down state doesn't get determined until I measure it. But I still instantly know that the positron is in the other state and that someone would see that state if they measured it, so I've gained knowledge of a property of an object faster than I should be able to according to relativity.

The trouble is that it's not useful for data transmission. Once I measure the one of the particles, they become disentangled and I can no longer affect one by anything I do to the other.

True,Boomscake,,,"sorry buddy,  taking guns out of law abiding citizens hands, does not take them out of the hands of criminals, or those that choose to obtain them criminally.

More specifically, your knee jerk reaction is not based on information, or facts, its solely based on bias.  Which is not a good method of thinking.  

There is plenty of information out there that has shown that open carry of registered firearms has reduced crime, and prevented crimes.  With an extremely low incident of people using registered firearms in a violent and criminal fashion.  They dont let just anyone have guns.  

The problem is in the fact that firearms are obtained illegally, and we have no way of taking or stopping those firearms from criminals.  If somone snaps and wants to kill people, they cant just walk into a gun store and immediately buy it.  There is a process.  So what do those people wanting to commit a crime do, they go obtain them illegally because there is no process, just buying a gun.

So please ewest, tell us how they are going to put the tightest restrictions on illegally possessed firearms?  How is the government suppose to know you bought a gun from another criminal when no one was around.  Your idea, simply takes the guns away from people who could have possibly ended this tragedy early.

There's the big, whirling pain of life upending all of your plans and expectations. There's the sharp little pains of failure, and the more obscure aches of successes that didn't give you what you thought they would. There are the vicious, stabbing pains of hopes being torn up. The sweet little pains of finding others, giving them your love, and taking joy in their life as they grow and learn. There's the steady pain of empathy that you shrug off so you can stand beside a wounded friend and help them bear their burdens. 
&gt;
&gt;And if you are very, very lucky, there are a few blazing hot little pains you feel when you realize that you are standing in a moment of utter perfection, an instant of triumph, or happiness, or mirth which at the same time cannot possibly last ‒ and yet will remain with you for life.

True,Noggin01,,,"I'm a guy, so I don't have my own vag to put things in.  However, I do have a story to tell.

In my final semester of college I was in need of a place to stay.  I found a website for the town where rooms were listed for rent.  I saw one that was near the college and within my price range, so I made contact and moved in with some girl.  We decided on simply splitting water, electric and rent bills 50/50.  All utilities were in her name, so I'd just give her the cash.

About a month or two into the semester, she just basically disappeared.  She left a note on the fridge that said something like, ""going home for the weekend.""  After 2 weeks, she still hadn't come back and wasn't answering her phone.  She finally called me and said that a family emergency came up and that I needed to mail her my half of the bills... and I did.  A week later, I received a notice on the door that our electricity hadn't been paid and that it was going to be shut off in two days.

The bitch never paid a single bill as it turned out.  She just took my money and left.

I did some internet sleuthing and tracked her down.  I got her mother's and her grandmother's phone number as well as her place of employment.  I called all three and gave them the story.  Shortly after, the girl paid all utilities and rent so we were ""good.""  However, she refused to honor our agreement to pay her half of the bills so I had to pay them out of pocket 100% until she returned for the following semester.

She forgot one thing though.  It was *her* name, and her name only that was on all of the bills.  I paid for a couple months of bills, basically half of my remaining stay in the apartment.  Then I stopped, that was her half to pay.  I told her that I wasn't paying them, but I doubt she got the message.  I did continue to pay rent though.

Just before the end of the semester, the water and electricity was shut off.  I had to stay with a friend for 3 nights.  I walked at graduation and went back to the apartment to get my stuff.  And I found it.  I found her dildo.  Her big, green dildo.

I took a bottle of jabanero hot sauce from Buffalo Wild Wings, a paper towel, and wiped it down.  All of it.  And I put it back where I found it.

Preferably get American Spirits so you can smoke them for a long time, and people will start noticing. When approached to bum a smoke, inform them that you are looking for some crack and would be delighted to share with the person who can obtain access to aforementioned crack, do not indicate just how much at this point, you will just get stabbed. After going through a couple people, you will find someone who will take you up on the offer. Get them to contact their guy, at this point the car will come in handy. 

Pack yourself and your new buddy in the vehicle as you are 85% chance going to go meet up with the local south american cartel business men. And you will need a vehicle to meet up with them. Your compatriot will attempt to have you give him the money, do not fall for this trick! Where ever you meet up with guy, get out of your vehicle and enter the dealers car, and ask for $200 worth of hard, or white. They may only have soft cocaine at the time, your new buddy will come in handy on how to convert it into premium crack rock. 

Scamper back to your vehicle clutching your precious stash of balloons. Ask your compatriot to direct you to a smoke shop that carries straight rose tubes, better known as ""crack pipes"". Upon obtaining one &amp;amp; some brillo ask your new best bud to demonstrate how exactly to smoke the crack. After a few good rips, go buy another pack of cigarettes, even if you don't smoke, it will be awesome on crack. 

Continue driving around and smoking crack until you are high out of your mind. Drive in front of a police station and set up shop just smoking your crack. Your assistant will no doubt bail at this time, being a paranoid crack head. Pay him no mind and keep hitting that pipe, alternatively, take him hostage with your firearm. When you notice some cops, stick your head out the window and take a giant crack rip and yell ""Fuck the police!"" and then leave, quickly. 

They will follow you, naturally, so I hope you have a fast car because we're going for the maximum amount of trouble here. You're already carrying a felony amount of crack cocaine, have paraphernalia, and are committing a DWI/possibly with a hostage. Out last the cops for as long as you can, building a good trail of cops following you.

If you chose a shopping mall, instantly try and find a bunch of kids and hold them hostage. Try and find a way out of the building through the back and continue on foot, but more than likely this will end here.

True,Maladius,,,"If your phone charger was always drawing 750ma, (5ah *12v)/(0.75a *5v) would give you the correct answer of 16 hrs (watt-hours of batt / watts drawn). However as your phone battery approaches a fully charged state the current will drop over time. If you knew the equation of this current over time you could calculate the time for which the battery will last. I'm thinking you're probably more interested in how much you can charge your phone on this battery. To determine that, take out the battery on your phone and look at the voltage and mah rating. 

For example my phone battery is 3.7v and 1750mah. Now 3.7v * 1.75ah means my battery has 6.475wh of energy in it. Your battery has 12v *5ah= 60wh of energy. 

60wh/6.475wh means I could charge my battery about 9.2 times.

Now this calculation isn't exact for a number of reasons. Normally it takes more energy back into a battery to recharge it fully, you could approximate that by saying it takes 110% of the energy. 60wh /(6.475 wh*1.1) = 8.4 charges. 

You also have to take into account the inefficiencies introduced by converting from the dc of your battery to ac for your charger and back to DC for the phone. That's beyond my ability to do without some research.

IMPORTANT: I'm assuming this is a camping style battery with an AC plug outlet. Under no circumstances should you directly connect your phone battery to a 12v battery, this would cause lots of sparking and the likely explosion of the phone battery.

Does a teenaged girl who becomes pregnant deserve to have her hopes and dreams crushed when she is denied an abortion?  She made a choice.  Does a politician deserve to have their nudes broadcasted all over the internet, and to be shoved in front of an audience of thousands to apologize?  They made a choice.

We should strive to live in a society where people can make mistakes.  In a world where people are held responsible for everything, there can be no risks, no innovation, no humanity.  I'm sure a lot of these girls have their own personal struggles, interests, hobbies, and favourite bands.  If you spoke to them, I'm sure they'd say something you could relate to.

Why do followers of the BDSM culture have 'safewords'?  After all, once you consent, haven't you made up your mind?  There are a variety of factors - maybe they didn't know how large their partner would be, maybe they needed more lube, maybe they had done too many shoots and were tired, etc.  There are a plethora of variables that could make this job unpredictable and difficult.

People's reactions are also hard to predict.  Just today I got an assignment back from my school - I had gotten a significantly lower mark than why I expected.  I felt my face flush and tears start to swell up.  I didn't think I'd care that much, but I did.  I was on the verge of crying - especially when people who considered me ""the smart kid"" asked me if I had gotten a perfect score.  These girls might have felt that they could do porn, and then found out that the play abuse and physical strain was way more than they could handle.

Finally, these women are workers.  They are in their workplace.  Imagine if you were in a physically exhausting - and for some people emotionally distressful - job.  I knew a guy that worked as a paramedic - he saw some kids brains dragged all over the street and the next day while helping an older woman who had fallen he lost his cool and yelled at her.  Later, he was diagnosed with PTSD.

How would we react if after my friend had his 'meltdown' his coworkers and employers laughed at him, fired him, docked his pay, or posted video footage of it on the internet?  Would that not be a failure of workplace regulation?  This is why I hate the porn industry - it's completely unprofessional and puts it's all of it's employees at profound risk.

I'm not sure how I feel about this video being labelled 'darkly comic'.  On one hand, we might laugh because of how sad and morbid this is.  Laughing might be the only thing we can do.  On the other hand, I'm convinced there are people laughing at this video because they are sick fucks who think that any woman in the porn industry is not a human being and therefore a subject of ridicule.

Here's what Roger Ebert says about it --[link](http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20031107/REVIEWS/311070301/1023):
 
Let me tell you a story. The day after Columbine, I was interviewed for the Tom Brokaw news program. The reporter had been assigned a theory and was seeking sound bites to support it. ""Wouldn't you say,"" she asked, ""that killings like this are influenced by violent movies?"" No, I said, I wouldn't say that. ""But what about 'Basketball Diaries'?"" she asked. ""Doesn't that have a scene of a boy walking into a school with a machine gun?"" The obscure 1995 Leonardo Di Caprio movie did indeed have a brief fantasy scene of that nature, I said, but the movie failed at the box office (it grossed only $2.5 million), and it's unlikely the Columbine killers saw it.

The reporter looked disappointed, so I offered her my theory. ""Events like this,"" I said, ""if they are influenced by anything, are influenced by news programs like your own. When an unbalanced kid walks into a school and starts shooting, it becomes a major media event. Cable news drops ordinary programming and goes around the clock with it. The story is assigned a logo and a theme song; these two kids were packaged as the Trench Coat Mafia. The message is clear to other disturbed kids around the country: If I shoot up my school, I can be famous. The TV will talk about nothing else but me. Experts will try to figure out what I was thinking. The kids and teachers at school will see they shouldn't have messed with me. I'll go out in a blaze of glory.""

In short, I said, events like Columbine are influenced far less by violent movies than by CNN, the NBC Nightly News and all the other news media, who glorify the killers in the guise of ""explaining"" them. I commended the policy at the Sun-Times, where our editor said the paper would no longer feature school killings on Page 1. The reporter thanked me and turned off the camera. Of course the interview was never used. They found plenty of talking heads to condemn violent movies, and everybody was happy.",0,1355519971,,0,False,1,c7gogay,t3_14uoel,t1_c7gogay,t1_c7gnnxy,,1430675357,946,False,politics,t5_2cneq,946

True,dikdiklikesick,all,Damn GIIIIIRRRL,"There is something called the [Invisibility of Privilege](http://thehathorlegacy.com/invisible-privilege-a-handy-snappy-definition-2/). It is basically that people who do not experience the pain from an oppressive system do not see themselves as privileged, they see themselves as peers to the people who experience the pain. Because they are peers, they assume that they have the same experience. 

The good news is that your boyfriend sees you as a peer (I hope). 

It has been my experience, when you try to explain these things to people who do not experience them that you need to start from the bottom and build up. It will be frustrating, but stay calm, stay empathetic. When you throw a bunch of facts at someone they tend to shut down or start cherry picking. Try starting with leading questions. 

* Do you think women are treated differently than men?
* Do you think that you have control over the culture around you?
* Do you think words have power? 

Those are all good starting points because they will help you understand his position and then you can begin to explain your position. 

But this is most important, pick your battles. You can't fight them all and you will have to let some go. Making little dents in culture is the most effective thing you can do. Don't stew over losses, don't stew over your boyfriend's lack of empathy, don't stew over insults. Educate yourself and act with empathy and you will always come out on top.

EDIT: Thank you whoever for a month of Reddit gold, although I would have preferred to have received it for something else than quoting a brilliant man commenting on tragedy.",0,1355520468,,0,1355525299,1,c7golw4,t3_14ut4p,t1_c7golw4,t3_14ut4p,,1430675431,2842,False,videos,t5_2qh1e,2842
True,grammatarium,,,"It begins one night when you're drifting off to sleep, thinking about the morning and the man pissing in your face that comes with it.  ""What do they do with my old sheets and pillow and mattress while I'm in the shower?"" you think.  ""After all, it's *my* property.""  And so, an idea.

You start small.  You buy two more pillows and another set of sheets.  And in the morning, after you have been awoken by the man pissing on your face but before you go into the shower, you turn to him and say ""Put the old stuff in the corner there.  I want to keep it.""

After all, it was brand-new.  What's a little piss on the sheets?  Children piss the bed all the time.  There's an entire industry devoted to cleaning piss out of the sheets.  You throw the old sheets into the wash, fold them up, and begin to make a stockpile.  A year later, you've got a good inventory and with the $100k you've been paid, you open your first store selling bedsheets, pillows and pillowcases, and mattresses.  All just like new, all far cheaper than any other store could ever afford.

Soon you open a second and a third store.  Your bed is unrecognizable beneath all the sheet sets and pillows stuffed on top of it.  With the launch of your tenth store, demand begins to outstrip the physical constraints of your bed.  So you have a special bed be build, a box spring the size of a football field and covered in mattresses.  Linens n' Things goes bankrupt.  Bed Bath and Beyond crumbles.  The $300 a day you get from the man pissing on you is a pittance now.  You make more in the time it takes him to unzip his fly.

Then you get a call.

""I understand you have been taking certain liberties with our agreement,"" the voice at the other end of the line says.  ""Ones that I have been willing to overlook until now.  But starting today, I will only replace what has a reasonable chance of being pissed on.  No more warehouses of sheets and pillows being turned over that never even got a whiff of piss.  Only what is needed.""

Business begins to turn south.  You have generous inventories in warehouses scattered worldwide by now, but the pipeline is drying up.  Prices begin to rise and the population, weaned on cheap bedsheets and pillows, begins to look elsewhere.  Until a night, when you lie on your monstrosity of a bed surrounded by stacks of Egyptian cotton, you have another idea.

That morning, when you wake up to the man and his piss, you don't go to the shower.  You don't get out of your bed at all.  Instead, you take off running, bouncing across the mattresses, smearing your piss-soaked face on everything you can find.  The man, after a moment of shock, dutifully follows, doing his best to aim for your face (and he *will* aim for your face) as you lead him in a giant circle through the warehouse.  And with that, you're back in business.

Years pass.  You fall into a routine.  Wake up, run through as much of your inventory as you can, and hop into a waiting bus to take a shower while you are driven to the next warehouse.  You've mastered the art of power napping, after another call with your mysterious billionaire clarified that you needed to hit REM sleep in order for it to be considered ""waking up.""  The linen industry is yours, after you lobbied to relax the regulations on monopolies.  You branched out into other realms, using the profit from your bedsheet empire to bankroll them.  Wal-Mart, Target, even K-Mart.  They all have fallen.  

But your days are no longer your own.  They are not even days anymore.  They are hours in a bus, heading towards the next warehouse where a man will piss on your face and you will run through as many piles of sheets and pillows as you can.  Perhaps that is why, after all of this, your mysterious billionaire has never tried to call off the deal.  Amend it, yes, but never call it off.  Perhaps you have given him exactly what he wanted to know.",0,1355520835,,0,False,1,c7gopvk,t3_14uee5,t1_c7gopvk,t1_c7gm6rf,,1430675483,1934,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,1934
True,[deleted],,,"Was driving home from buying Christmas presents for my family when I heard the news. I just arrived back in America for Christmas a week ago and the news hit me really hard. I had to pull over on the interstate where I got out of my car and just stood a few yards away from my car shaking and crying.

No more than 3 minutes later a car pulls in behind me an puts on its flashers... A cop I assumed asking me to move on or see if I need assistance. Instead I find myself wrapped in a giant hug by Deb... A retired bus driver who saw me on the side of the road and instantly knew what was up.

I dont know how long she just stood there hugging me... The whole time telling me we had to think of the kids who were lucky to make it out safe and that thins would get better.

She asked me if I wanted to pray with her and  for the first time in nearly 10 years I prayed.

Deb asked if I could drive and even offered to drive me home if I felt to upset to drive. I told her this wasn't necessary and thanked her for stopping. Just having a person to make a connection with helped me calm down. She went back to her car and came back with a ziplock bag of cookies and another massive hug before driving off.

I'm home now and still shifting between sadness and amazement... I hope all the parents, children, and community members affected by the tragedy have a Deb to be with them.

True,meowymeowy,,,"I work at a homeless shelter and the amount of mental illness I see astounds me every single day. I see so many people discharged from the hospital to the streets with zero idea of the homeless system and nowhere and no one to turn to for any help. 
There are men in my shelter who sit alone, carrying on lively conversations with themselves all night. Men who seem to be all there and functioning ""normally"" until you strike up a conversation and they tell you about how they're late because they're just getting back from Cairo, Egypt. Women diagnosed with a long laundry list of severe, life-altering diagnosis, ranging from schizophrenia, to bipolar, to borderline personality, sometimes all occuring comorbidly with each other. 

There are some programs that cater to these individuals, but for the grant funding to go through, there are so many specific qualities and requirements these people need to meet in order to get a subsidy, some just get frustrated and resign themselves to what they believe has to be their inevitable fate of homelessness and death on the streets. 

I don't have a solution for their problems, or the overlying problem of a country that lacks affordable housing and lacks a sufficient support system for the mentally ill. I can't imagine ever being homeless, especially in our Minnesota winters, and trying to imagine homelessness on top of SPMI diagnosis is even more impossible for me. The man who committed the massacre today at the elementary school wasn't homeless or anything, but because I see the failures of our country's system of treating mental illness every single day, I just had to comment. 

I'd love to live in a time where there was a simple solution to questions of treating and managing mental illness, but I honestly don't believe that's possible now with the system we have. ",0,1355523872,,0,False,1,c7gpmst,t3_14uvqi,t1_c7gpmst,t3_14uvqi,,1430675991,42,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,42

True,ayyrabmoney93,,,"I used to be just like you. I also started at 16 and a pack used to last me weeks. I remember that I would only want a cig every few days. But it's not worth it man... You know that awesome rush you get every time you light one up? Ya that goes away pretty quickly and you find yourself smoking more and more just to try and get that rush again... And it comes back every now and then. But then one day you wake up and the first thing you reach for is your pack, maybe after a night of drinking, maybe to get rid of your headache or even just for something to do. Before long you start to develop the habit and you start to justify your need for a cigarette by creating a routine... You discover that cigarettes can be used both as a reward system and also as a way to make the mundane more enjoyable. It starts out when you realize that a cigarette after a meal feels great, but and slowly that progresses into a ritual. I everytime you eat you need a cig, and then comes the after shower bouge, and the after gym bouge, and the pre meal bouge, and the bedtime bouge, and and don't even get me started on the after shut bouge. But you no longer get that beloved rush as often. But you figure out that smoking 2 in a row brings the rush back. Unfortunately even that is shortlived and it's not very cost-effective or healthy to smoke three in a row. 

At this point the rush is rare, and and when it does come its short-lived. Also at this point you begin to notice that cigarettes are not just a fun way to kill ten minutes anymore. Now you need them just to feel normal, to get your brain flowing in the morning, and to help you digest your meal, and and to help you get to sleep. This is when you realize your addicted to cigarettes. Your bank account is empty and you can't afford the $8 packs anymore, but you scrounge all the change you can find in cars, and couch cushions, and other people's drawers. 

It doesn't matter anymore, your addicted. you don't care about the fact that your roommates are getting suspicious that they can't find any of their change and that the 10 dollar bill on their desk just went missing. All you need is a cigarette. You don't care that it's embarrassing to ask a stranger for a cigarette, and on the contrary you keep all your senses focused. You can smell a cigarette a mile away and the scent drives you insane. Your addicted. you no longer care about the sanitary or germs. If you find a good looking half smoked cigarette on the ground it yours now. You burn the filter a little just to make sure there's no aids on the butt. And despite how disgusting and humiliating it is to sink so low that half smoked cigarette tasted amazing, it was one of the best bouges you've ever had. 

All these are personal experiences my friend. I've gone weeks without food to feed my addiction and I can already tell that all this has definitely had an adverse effect on my health. I've been smoking for about 3 years. I remember in high school I could run a 6 minute mile like it was nothing. 7 mile soccer runs at 6am were a breeze... Now going up stairs leaves me gasping for breath... My professionally whitened teeth are now yellow and my gums are black. Every morning I cough up something vile that looks like phelgm mixed with dirt and tar. I can't even smoke weed like I used to man... I just don't have the lung capacity anymore. Also cigarettes are an immune depressant... The suppress your immune system... I'm always sick or have the sniffles even in 80 degree weather. I and it's not just me all my heavy smoker friends are the same. 

If I could go back in time and kick 16 year old me in the nuts I would. If someone had told me that rush goes away and that eventually cigarettes would become more important to me than eating I never would have started. 
And don't even get me started on how awful quitting is, not to mention that most females don't like it when a guy comes up to them reeking of smoke. 

So I leave you with this my good sir. I'm not going to tell you not to smoke cigarettes but I will say this. Do you really wanna experience any of the shit I just told you about... I swear man all of that is entirely true. I wish more than anything I could quit but smoking has become as vital to me as breathing. As I write this I realize that I need a cigarette now and I hate myself for it but I need it. 

so my advice to you is this all things in moderation friend. Smoke only when you drink for example.. Nothing is better than a drunk bouge and if you find yourself starting to lose the rush and needing a cigarette when you just had one an hour ago then get out while you still can. The longer you smoke the harder it is to quit. I just be careful man. Good luck to you and I hope I didn't just write all this on my shitty ass phone for nothing


TL;DR 

This novel is entirely true about my descent into nicotine addiction and the horrible experiences cigarettes have caused me.. Enjoy the occasional bouge but be careful not to develop a habit and remember that all things in moderation

True,aedes,med,Protein Folding | Antibiotic Resistance | Emergency Medicine,"Aspirin is sneaky. It's toxic by a number of ways, and arguably much more toxic than tylenol.

At a basic level, the problem is that in overdose, aspirin is a cellular poison. Let's go with an analogy since everyone seems to love that. 

Your body is made up of cells - imagine each cell is an individual city. Every city needs a power plant to survive, and your cells are no exception. They don't use solar power, or nuclear power though... they use something called mitochondrial power. 

Billions of years ago, some of your ancestors (or whatever they'd be called at that point), found some bacteria that had the ability to produce energy using carbohydrates as an energy source. They ate and then enslaved these bacteria, and their remnants live inside all of our cells to this day as something called mitochondria.

Basically, all your cells use enslaved, emasculated bacteria as a source for all your energy. 

Now, how does aspirin fuck this all up? Well, we don't entirely understand for sure, but it likely happens something like this... Aspirin in overdose becomes something that your body doesn't really want anymore as it's toxic, so pretend it's an enemy German spy during WW2. It sneaks it's way through an immigration port in New York and quickly takes to the interstate system, spreading from city to city. 

However, dressed as a German, it can never sneak into a city, it's too obvious. It needs to put on a disguise first. So it does this, and sneaks into a city - say Pitsburgh. It then goes straight to Pitsburgh's only powerplant... which happens to be a dam and hydro plant. It then blows up the dam, making the generators useless, as no water is stored anymore. All this water then rushes out from behind the destroyed damn and floods the city.

By analogy, aspirin is ingested and absorbed from your gut where it enters your bloodstream (the interstate). However, aspirin normally has a negative charge at the pH of you cells/blood. And molecules with a negative charge have a hard time entering cells (As they're repelled by other charges on the outside of the cell). So to enter a cell, it first needs to pick up a disguise - a hydrogen cation will do the job. This hides the charge on the aspirin molecule so it can enter the cell. 

Once in the cell, it goes straight to the mitochondria - those enslaved bacteria - the power plants of your cells.

How do these mitochondria normally make energy for your cells? Well they break down sugars that your body absorbed, and use the energy from this to pump hydrogen ions across a barrier and store them on the other side - just like storing water behind a damn. Mitochondria then funnel these hydrogen ions through a generator to create an energy source (that can be used by your cells).

When aspirin enters your cells, it attacks the mitochondria and causes holes to form in those barriers in the mitochondria. Just like blowing holes in a damn, the mitochondria lose the ability to create energy for your cells as a result. And without energy, your cells die. The consequences of all these hydrogen ions flowing freely through these holes is that tonnes of heat is generated (the flood in the example with the city).

So what does this cause? You get a fever, and your cells stop working properly and start dying. Certain cells are more susceptible to these effects that others - especially the cells that help you hear - so hearing loss or changes is one of the first signs of aspirin toxicity.

Ultimately, in severe overdoses, your brain is the most important organ that is affected, and if not treated properly, you will end up brain dead.

How do you treat aspirin overdoses? Well remember that in order to enter cells, aspirin needs to wear the disguise of a hydrogen ion. So to treat it, we simply make less disguises available to aspirin. Increasing the pH of your blood by giving you a base through an IV decreases the number of hydrogen ions available for aspiring, making it harder for it to sneak into cells. You can also dialyze people, which just physically removes all of the aspirin from their blood - treatment of aspirin toxicity usually involves some combination of both.

Hope that made sense; it glosses over a lot of the fine details, and some of the other mechanisms of toxicity, but it's the jist of it.",0,1355534236,,0,False,1,c7gsaqf,t3_14s9bt,t1_c7gsaqf,t1_c7ggr7f,,1430677245,11,False,askscience,t5_2qm4e,11

True,kmeisthax,,,"Well, trackers used to be gray-area. There's a bit of the DMCA which says that there is safe-harbor provisions for intermediaries. So as an intermediary you aren't liable for copyright infringement committed by your customers so long as you comply with a fairly reasonable (for intermediaries at least) notice-and-takedown procedure.

However, a few things changed. Between the Supreme Court creating the notion of ""inducement"" for copyright infringement, YouTube's willingness to go above and beyond what even the most ardent copyright maximalist would have asked for a few years ago, and the US flexing it's diplomatic muscle to get MegaUpload taken down, the legal climate has shifted away from the more intermediary-friendly terms of the DMCA's safe harbor provisions. While the safe harbor does protect you from individual allegations of copyright infringement committed by your users through your service, it's become increasingly less safe for intermediaries who have a user base prone to copyright infringement.

A big part of this is the fact that judges aren't bureaucrats and they generally don't take to kindly to obvious technicalities. Hence the Supreme Court's decision to invent the concept of ""inducement"" - the idea that an entity's conduct towards promoting copyright infringement carries infringement liability. Selling people software designed and marketed with the purpose of committing copyright infringement doesn't necessarily carry vicarious or contributory copyright infringement liability, but the inducement doctrine basically says that having the conduct of a copyright infringing service is the same as actually being a copyright infringing service. This kills the grey-area.

Inducement of copyright infringement basically comes down to this: If you create a search engine and call it ""The Pirate Bay"", market it as a service for finding infringing content, don't license any content at all, and fire off strongly-worded refusals to people asking you to take down infringing content, your conduct as an intermediary is itself criminal. On the flipside, an intermediary that wants to maintain non-inducing conduct must market only it's non-infringing uses, should legally license content from copyright owners, and go above and beyond in removing infringing content the moment it's pointed out.

Sound familiar? This is essentially the drastic change YouTube's slowly undergone after it's acquisition by Google. They started as a fairly new video sharing site where you could upload videos and share them with your friends. And, of course, people would obviously be trying to use the site to upload infringing content. However, YouTube's actions to prevent infringement have gone above and beyond what other tech companies even though possible. First, they restricted the default upload time to 10 minutes, mainly because anything longer than 10 minutes tended to be infringing material. Second, they begun work on a content identification system. And it's really this that's got me worried.

You see, one of the biggest legal arguments that intermediaries in the technology industry have used is that filtering isn't possible. And for a while this was pretty much true. Filtering out infringing content was tried several times during Napster's slow downward spiral, and people got past it by renaming filenames or adding a few seconds onto tracks to defeat hash-based filters. But YouTube's Content ID is pretty damn close to effective, and while it's not perfect, that's not what matters. Google has essentially destroyed the ""you can't filter content"" argument by spending loads of it's own money designing imperfect but decently effective filters. If you *aren't* filtering, that looks suspicious; and more importantly it can make it harder to license content.

Google themselves felt this when they tried to create a music store only to find every single licensor demanding similar filtering be placed on their search engine. They decided to go the unlicensed route and be a music locker; which to be honest was *incredibly risky* as music storage hadn't yet been proven non-infringing *and* if it was determined infringing (it wasn't) they could easily prove inducement as the whole locker route was to avoid licensing the content directly.

MegaUpload is an example of an intermediary that didn't take enough steps to get on the right side of the inducement regime. They never really promoted their site in an inducing way, but their DMCA tools weren't up to snuff and they didn't proactively filter content. And thus they got their site domain seized and their servers raided. It's very hard to get yourself *out* of the grey area if you manage to get in it.

So in a sense, your average tracker is going to be liable of an inducement charge even if it technically complies with the DMCA perfectly every time they recieve a notice. Of course, because inducement is a conduct-based rule, this also means other intermediaries feel pressure to self-censor. What this post didn't mention is that PayPal has extremely strict rules for companies that want to take payments for filesharing related services; so much so that several Usenet providers have had to shut down because Paypal wouldn't process payments for them. PayPal's rules basically require giving them complete access to your service so they can verify that you have content filtering and are proactively removing infringing content. Again, because intermediaries have liability for encouraging infringement, so everyone feels pressured to proactively monitor for infringement to avoid accusations of inducement. Even if they didn't have to obfuscate their information torrent trackers wouldn't be eligible for payment processing, or they'd be dropped the moment a DMCA request came in. If you think about it, SOPA was essentially a way to legally require payment processors and ad networks to do what they already do voluntarily.

True,carpe-jvgvlvm,,,"Did you see Piers whoever tonight on CNN, pissing his pants about gun control? Actually, it was a decent group of guests, but he was yelling over them so loudly that, by the end, who could hear a thing?!

And CNN has apparently banned the name ""Adam Lanza"", because they only want to remember the victims.

Of course CNN is trying to get ratings and ""be responsible"". They haven't questioned why the school buzzed a 20 year old ""problem child"" dressed like Rambo into a building full of 5-to-10 year olds. THAT'S a problem. *I wonder if the person who buzzed Rambo Adam in* didn't want to look like she was *discriminating* against him. I WANT to hear about good old Adam and why the fuck this happened, but CNN wants its ratings and to look ""responsible.""

/and I suspect that's why we won't EVER figure this shit out, LOL: CNN!/

What I'm thinking is, maybe Adam Lanza is a victim, too! Maybe our country victimizes and stigmatizes ""autistics"" or ""the mentally ill"" to where they're left with no resources: can't get a job, can't pay bills, can't afford help; and their caretakers (if any) are too exhausted to do more than get through another day, much less try to find some help. I have a feeling that one day, we'll look back on this day and feel as sorry for the victims as we do for Adam and his mom. And future generations (if any) will blame US for terrorizing the mentally ill and turning their issue into political BS like gun control.

Enforcing gun laws ...shit. It was THE MOM, **the kindergarten teacher**, who was **packing heat!** And from a personal experience, MY MOM (paranoid schizophrenic who apparently got brain damage in a car accident) had procured weapons when she was ""sane"" and fun-loving. I was in college when she started trying to kill people with her car (her lawyers got her off, and in one case actually tried to sue the victims!). As time and incidents built up, I spoke with the police about her stash of weaponry, but they couldn't do anything unless I had her committed (which I eventually had to do). So **I** had to ""break the law"" to keep people alive: Daddy and I field-stripped her guns and removed bits out of her home so they wouldn't work if she got suddenly ""frazzled"". (Maybe a mistake: it made her MORE paranoid.) Later, we switched ammo boxes so the ammo she had wouldn't fit her weapons (I've seen her frothing at the mouth, trying to get .45s into her Special); I carried the correct ammo out and stashed it in my car's trunk (for years; what do you DO with that shit?). That worked for a few weeks at a time; she'd drive to the store and buy more. (They're *mentally ill*, not STUPID.) We pulled every trick in the book, living in fear that, well, basically that WE'D be on CNN having to say why we couldn't stop whatever massacre might have happened.

*We warned the neighbors*, but they didn't want to hear it — Mom's so nice-seeming, and maybe I wanted her money! (Seriously. SMDH.) The worst thing for us, I think, was when people (including the police) finally realized how dangerous she truly was. The look of fear on their faces ...but they couldn't do much legally. (I think they *wanted* us to be wrong?) She's permanently institutionalized now; and finally (and maybe sadly), they're terrified of her. AFTER THE FACT. It's always AFTER THE FACT. I told a cop once, in tears, that we'd all end up on CNN (like THIS group) if they didn't get off their asses and DO something.

So you know, I'm not feeling too sorry for this community. All this ""*it could never happen here*"" bullshit ...oh, I feel bad for the individual victims, but this whole ""community"" shit, where they refuse to recognize that Adam and his mom were PART of their precious ""community"", is a joke. No, people: YOU ALL were responsible for thinking your community had no ""mentally ill"" people in it. THE SCHOOL was responsible (Soooooo responsible!) for buzzing in a gun-toting Rambo.

Here's a hint: USE THE FUCK out of your Community Services Board (the people who have as much power as a judge to institutionalize people). TALK to the mentally ill; they're in your back yards, and it will be for better or for worse eventually. Bust out of your dumb bubble that ""your community is perfect""; no, hell no, and if you think that, YOU'RE the problem. The people who ignored Adam's problems (if that happened), or ignored the teacher's gun collecting habit, etc ...hell, Adam wouldn't be legally responsible for shit! If you don't HELP (or REPORT) people who aren't legally responsible when you see them doing weird shit, YOU are responsible.

Adam was ill or psycho (too many varying reports for me to get a good bead on it; his brother is the only one who's said ""autistic""), and that community let him walk their streets, LOL walk up to the school with guns and armor and **buzzed him in.** YES, tragedy — and every resident there owes the victims' families an apology for not supporting the teacher and Adam.

Indeed, my mom? Adam? Aurora guy? They're not the only ones who are a little ""off"", paranoid, schizo, psycho, whatever you want to call them. There are plenty of seriously ill people in this world (I saw some getting discharged from Mom's facilities over the years... turned out onto the street, even if they didn't want to go, because of funding problems). Nah, don't worry about the psychopaths — they're running businesses and not the ones we could help much anyway. It's the people who COULD be helped, but people look away, who need the helping hand.

And as for choice of weapon? No, you're not understanding some shit. Mom, and God I love her, Mom could come up with a shit ton of ways to break a person. (I mean, break a bone). My husband witnessed her battle four police officers and almost escape the ER one night. She went to a nice institution, padded walls and everything, and ONE TIME she slipped out with a Styrofoam food tray? She got it to her room, snapped it into triangular pieces, and made a mighty good weapon. NOT BECAUSE SHE'S ""EVIL""; it's because she scared. Or sometimes, angry. But usually scared.

True,GSpotAssassin,,,"It's because it matters sometimes, to some people. There are ""size queens"", but most women don't seem to give much of a shit. It seems like it's a nice-to-have, to them, unless you are very undersized. Guess what, they're more interested in your face, your confidence, your broad shoulders, the depth of your laugh, your thoughtfulness, reliability, intelligence and trustworthiness. The good ones, anyway. They are not going to take a mental ruler out and measure your dick- instead they will remember how many times you were late, or whether you helped their ailing father to do yardwork instead of playing Assassin's Creed 3, or whether you try to make sure they ""get off"" whenever you do... or whether you simply answer the phone every time they call.

The #1 complaint I had when I was single, and which I keep hearing from my single friends, is ""how flaky"" people are. Well, guess what, one day, someone is going to come along, and you won't be flaky to each other, and will thus acquire tremendous combined value. Any big-dick involvement there is going to be a footnote.

Physically, what I've seen is that women will often like weird stuff about you (at least from a simpleton ""tits&amp;ass&amp;legs"" man's perspective). I think it's wonderful, frankly. The broad shoulders thing always strikes me as funny. I don't ever remember my shoulders getting broad, but apparently that's some sort of manly marker for them. Warm hands? They like that too. Some like chest hair (usually the older ones), some don't (usually the younger ones). Don't worry so much about the things you can't control. I used to dream about Dimples of Venus (butt dimples) on women. My girlfriend has them, the first one I've ever dated who does. I love them, she had no idea they were a thing. She told her friends, now they're all jealous lol... Where do notions of ""beauty"" come from, anyway? Who knows.

I did date a woman I couldn't continue to date because I kept injuring her cervix. It's arguable she wasn't that into me either, though. She had a super small vagina (even the gyno said so). She was Irish and needed an Irish man, I am more of the Hessian variety of male /lol.

I normally like boobs, but I'm dating a smallish-boobed woman currently. Her ass makes up for it. And her humor, kindness, thoughtfulness, trustworthiness/honesty... the way she cooks, jeez... Do you know she's giving me a different little gift for every December day leading up to Xmas? It's insane, how good she is at picking gifts. Puts me to shame. Anyway... oh yeah, her physical properties... They do the job well. That's what I will say.

Similarly, you might be a small-dicked man, but your tongue, or hands, or hell even your brain (did you know most women are turned on by hot talk? Underrated.) might make up for it.

Maybe I don't understand it because I'm very well equipped, but I falter in other areas. The truth is that your mind is your best sex organ, by far. Your body? It's just a catalyst. The real show happens between 2 minds, not 2 bodies. Those bodies you're so fond of obsessing over? Those are not *you*. At *best*, they merely *start* the process.

True,yishan,,,"Here is some interesting information ""from the inside"" about some of the assumptions that led to this:

(I'm not mean-spiritedly criticizing this post, more like replying somewhat generally to this thread)

It turns out that default subreddits are already pretty family-friendly.  There is the occasional technically NSFW post, but it rarely veers out of PG-13 territory.  The natural crowdsourcing forces have, for whatever reason, brought the default subreddit moderation standards to approximately in line with the rest of the internet.

It turns out that advertisers don't really care about porn on reddit.  The reason here is that what advertisers actually don't want is their ads accidentally appearing *next to* offensive content.  Read that carefully, because it implies something rather interesting: it's not that they care about what's on the rest of the site, they care about what's on the rest of the *page*.  And reddit is unique in that ads are targeted (roughly speaking) by subreddit.  This means that an ad targeted to a mostly PG-13 subreddit will ever only appear next to PG-13 content.  reddit actually doesn't have the problem that other companies like Facebook or Twitter sometimes have, which is that the ads might appear next to offensive material posted by your friends in a News Feed.  Instead, every subreddit of any appreciable size is already moderated fairly strictly if not for SFW-ness, then at least for relevance.  The quote near the end of OP is actually presented misleadingly: if you read the linked article, the advertiser is *not* concerned about the ""darker corners"" of reddit - he's actually just blasé about them.

Advertisers literally don't care.  Some of this is because they don't know, but the ones who do have figured out that when you advertise on reddit, your ads never appear in a subreddit you don't want, so it never appears next to content you don't like.  Sure, there is a sort of ""bohemian"" freewheelingness in the comments, but because inlined images aren't allowed, even NSFW images only show up as an imgur.com link.  So pics of someone's anus just don't ever show up next to ads.

If anything, we've been seeing increased interest from mainstream advertisers due to reddit's heightened press profile.  I think one issue is that ToR readership is very bound up with the meta-community, and thus is susceptible to the drama-originated notion that horrible content on reddit is somehow ""pushed at"" you, when in reality it's often languishing in some obscure corner and you have to be specifically searching for it.  It's [part of] my job to be aware of what mainstream PR is saying about reddit, and while your regular journalist will do a bit of background-checking when they write their story and if it's a ""controversy"" one they will dutifully mention creepshots or jailbait, it's just not how reddit is really defined anymore because it is very hard to drive that point when the President of the United States has also dropped by the site... *twice.*  I mean, presidential candidates don't stop by strip clubs to stump for votes, you know?  So everyone is sort of forced to admit that yeah, reddit may have its red light district, but mostly it is legit.  

In fact - during the most recent VA/gawker PR incident, guess how many pings from ""concerned advertisers"" we got?  

*EXACTLY ZERO.*

Zero.  Yeah, we were kind of surprised too, but eh.

All of the pressure that I and the team feel around objectionable (or rather, odious) content has nothing to do with advertisers.  It has to do with how we feel it affects the community.  Like, is it really good for subreddits to exist where echo chambers can develop where it is okay for people to marginalize and exploit others?  Because then people read it, it normalizes it a bit for them, and then take that mindset to other communities, and standards of interaction degrade in a gradual way.  And we think maybe that is bad, in the long-term, for the community - for community reasons, not advertising ones.  You know, it's better for people to treat each other well.

The challenge with advertising is really just finding advertisers that we like, and getting them set up with the matching subreddits.  We're getting better at this, and we'll probably keep improving.  The issue is not that advertisers don't want to advertise on reddit - they very much do - it's that (1) we only want really good ones and (2) I don't like business models that are overly dependent on advertising, hence experiments with things like reddit gold **PLEASE BUY REDDIT GOLD** and redditgifts Marketplace.

Also, incidentally, it's more or less true that people wouldn't pay for NSFW subreddits.  It's a well-known ""secret"" in the porn industry that people on the internet don't pay for porn.  There's so much freely available porn that no one pays for it.  What's more, with the exception of the original amateur porn in e.g. /r/gonewild, most of the porn on reddit is not only not hosted on reddit, it *is* the aforementioned freely available porn - it's not like the mods or submitters of those subreddits are producing it.  At best, NSFW subreddits are a porn-curation engine, but you can also find that via Tumblr.

(Incidentally, the real business model that most porn sites use now is to use the porn they host as a loss leader to induce people to pay for live streaming cams)

Anyhow, just thought I'd drop by and contribute some information, hopefully it enhances the discussion.  This is my first major reply in ToR; long-time lurker.

True,yishan,,,"Hi.  I am the CEO and I also sit on the board.  I will make that promise right now: we will not sell reddit.

I'm a long-time user, and I saw what happened to digg.  I'm also someone who worked for a startup that was sold to a big company, and experienced how awful that was, both for life at the small company and what happened to the product (PayPal).

Further, reddit was already *extremely lucky* to have been bought once in its lifetime by a large company that somehow, miraculously, didn't fuck it up.  That is exceedingly rare in the corporate world.  Now reddit has been spun off because Advance feels that by transitioning from whole owner to partial investor, it can allow an independent reddit to grow into something really great in the long-term, and they just want to own a chunk of that.  So, having been lucky once, I'm not about to try my luck, our luck, the community's luck - again with another acquisition.  So this is make or break - reddit has to find a way to be profitable and stand on its own.  If we do, reddit will never need to sell, and it will be driven by the needs of its users.

That said, we don't want people to buy reddit gold out of guilt.  It's really nice that people did (I did, when it was launched) but we want to make gold better and better by adding features over time so that people will want to buy it out of self-interest.  Guilt isn't a business model.

**Point of interest:** we recently did launch a small persistent ad for reddit gold on the front page.  It only shows up if you don't have reddit gold - log out and see.  Look on the right sidebar, underneath the 300x250.  It's supposed to be small and classy - we call it the goldvertisement.  *After* you buy gold, if you don't disable ads, the ad turns into a little daily affirmation, and say something like ""Who's awesome? / You're awesome"" or ""reddit is made of people / people like you.""

True,[deleted],,,"Just gonna throw this out there... Our per capita homicide is greatly skewed by tiny minority that has been destroyed through three decades of bad gang &amp; drug policy. If you don't live in a gang-infested ghetto, your ""experienced"" homicide rate is on par with western Europe.

I'm going to copy-pasta a post I made from another thread to explain:

begin

2010 FBI Uniform Crime Report, it's online and breaks down crime by type, race, gender and other factors.

Black men account for ~55% of homicides according to the UCR but make up only 6% of the US population according to Wikipedia.

Globally, our per capita homicide rate is 4.2 per 100K (wiki again). If you do the math and scale down the number of homicides to be in line with the percent of the population they represent, you get a per capita homicide rate of 2.2 per 100K, which is the same as Finland.

Hopefully that walks you through my analysis enough for you to be able to retrace by steps and sources.

(Aside, black men also make up the majority of victims - it's easy conjecture to attribute the bulk of those homicides to gang and drug related crime given the situation society's created for them)

6% is probably an over-estimate btw since it includes black men of all ages, when the homicides are disproportionately committed by the young. If you included age as a variable as well, our per capita homicide rate of 2.2 would be even lower. Alas, I could not find an exact number so I went with the less generous 6% figure.

end

Take a moment and absorb that...a minority making up less than 6% of the population of the US is responsible for over 55% of homicides. They murder at such high rates that they move the US per capita homicide rate from western european levels to tin pot dictatorship levels. Three decades of bad government policy turned a group that lead a peaceful civil rights revolution into a group that murders more than any other group on the planet.

American society as a whole isn't more violent than other societies...instead we've got a tiny minority that's been so abused by the larger society that it's committing murder at absolutely astounding levels.

True,Taniwha_NZ,,,"People have been making the same arguments for decades; you know that.

Back in the days of the Ancient Greeks, they truly believed that anything worth knowing was able to be figured out by reasoning through it with logic. They never did any actual experiments to see if observation coincided with reality, the very idea was deeply strange, and the few people who *did* suggest something like that were completely rejected.

We know better now. The scientific process of using carefully-controlled experimentation to test a hypothesis has been our greatest breakthrough.

In the case of gun control, all the arguments against are things that seem logical and make sense in your head, but the actual evidence just doesn't match up. What actual evidence? You need large databases of events to be able to draw conclusions that stand up to scrutiny. You can always find one case to support just about any argument - Anders Breivik got a semi-auto in Norway so banning guns obviously doesn't help, some teacher with concealed carry managed to stop a shooting with his own weapon before anyone was killed, etc - but those single-data-point explanations only convince idiots.

What about the overwhelming number of cases that show gun control does work? You just ignore them.

The fact is, we have 200 countries around the world that have had a huge variety of gun laws and cultural influences over the last century. There have been millions of violent crimes, millions of attempted murders, we have had people commit mass shootings in dozens of countries around the world.

The fact is, countries with strict gun control laws have far fewer violent murders than those that do not. A man entered a chinese school just yesterday, but only armed with a knife. He still managed the hideous act of stabbing 22 children, but only 2 of them died. Do you get that? He tried to kill 22 children, and mostly failed.

The comparison with today's events are bleak. A mentall ill kid was able to load up with four modern weapons, walk into a room, and execute 18 children in cold blood. Every single one was dead as soon as he entered the room.

Go ask the emergency ward at Newton if they would rather have faced 20 bullet wounds or 20 stab wounds.

There comes a time when your own principles about your libertarianism have to be put aside in the face of overwhelming evidence. If there *is* a libertarian answer to mass shootings, the libertarian elites haven't produced it yet so I think it's time to step out of the way and let people protect the innocent.

Gun control works. Moreover, a country without guns gradually loses the attachment to them, until, like Japan or New Zealand, 99% of citizens wouldn't want a pistol if you were giving them out for free.

All that bullshit about having a dozen guns pulled on you in response is just noise. How many times in recorded history has that actually happened, and in each case were there any accidental shootings because someone with a gun thought another citizen with a gun was actually the crazy shooter? The chance of that scene playing out safely and ending with the bad guy in cuffs and everyone else enjoying their movie again are near to zero. Just ask a few cops if they want to see a dozen people in a movie theatre trying to play cop.

That scenario is a perfect example of thinking something through with logic and not actually testing any assumptions. If you actually did an experiment with a few hundreds registered carriers, and putting them in mock theatres unprepared, and having an actor run in and try and start shooting the place up... do that a hundred times with different groups, different times of day, different shooter strategies... and just see how many happy endings there are. I bet it would be near-zero.

Even with professional cops or military, situations like that usually go at least a little bad. With civilians it would be a nightmare, and if you pretend it wouldn't you are willfully ignoring what you know is true.

True,gasche,,,"I'm not sure we're talking at the same level. If something ""perfectly"" models sum types, I want to use them as I use sum types today. This means I want a pattern-matching constructs that allows to handle each case of the sum type in a single place, instead of having the code logic scattered across various definition sites in my program.

You can use a visitor pattern and have a reasonable products-to-sum dualization, but in practice this is just not as convenient as pattern matching constructs ML-derived languages have over sum types. Consider for example:

True,ktkatq,,,"High school teacher here:

Whenever there is a mass shooting in a school, I'm sure every teacher begins re-contemplating what she (or he, but usually she) would do. 

My classroom has no exterior window, and no glass window down the side of the door. There is a small window set inside the door. Should shooting begin in the school, I would lock the door and direct the children to the far side of the classroom, behind their desks, hopefully putting them out of the line of fire should someone shoot through the door. I would crouch next to the door, in case someone tried to open it. I am prepared to be the last line of defense between an attacker and my students, to give my life if it saves theirs. I'm not saying this because I want praise for a hypothetical and unlikely sacrifice I'd make (and hope to never have to, duh) - I'm only saying it because it's true. I'd never be able to live with myself otherwise.

I'm not armed. I'm not afraid of guns, but I don't have much experience with pistols. I have enjoyed target shooting using a variety of rifles, up to semi-auto Uzis and AK-47s (I have cool friends), however I only own one gun and have no immediate plans to purchase more.

But I do have a lot of experience with teenagers and adults. If we had guns in school, I strongly suspect that we would have far more deaths as the result of accident or impulse, than the deaths we endure every few years when a lunatic shoots up a school.  A few years ago, I thought arming teachers was a splendid idea. Now that I have a few years of teaching under my belt, I think it's a terrible idea. This country has *universal* education - that means we teach *everyone*. The dim, the strange, the mentally ill, the emotionally disturbed, the kids with a total inability to restrain their impulses or draw a connection between cause and effect, action and consequence. It would take a mere second for a student to unholster a teacher's gun, creating an entirely new and unpleasant problem. We'd have a dead teacher or student per day. And the teacher who allowed her (or his, but usually her) gun to be taken? She'd go to prison, or be sued into oblivion, probably both.

Teachers are only human. And yet we are castigated by administrators, parents, and the public, for every human failing we display. We are respectable, without being respected, and that demands that we at least appear - 24/7 - virtuous, benevolent, and wise. Because our job is considered humble, we too must be humble - accept low wages as if we we had taken religious orders, accept humiliating treatment from both students and their parents, and consider the spiritual rewards of teaching children to be the be-all-end-all of our existence. 

We try. I try. We, most of us, hold ourselves to a high standard of professionalism. We consider our careers a vocation. But we are only human, and we become frustrated, angry, frightened, just like anyone else. I don't know any teachers who have not said in anger and frustration something that they have regretted. How much worse if a gun were easily to hand? I'm not saying I would draw on my students, but the potential would be there.

I'm not a large woman, either. Many of my high school students are larger and heavier than I am. I rely on the authority of my voice, my position, to make students back down. But if a kid ever took a swing at me (it happens to teachers, sometimes), I'd go down. If I had a gun and were afraid? Who knows?

Arming people because we're afraid only gives us more people to fear. School shootings are comparatively rare. I am a supporter of the right for citizens to bear arms - and I believe that right extends to all kinds of scary semi-automatic weapons. I know too many sane, responsible gun aficionados to advocate taking away their collections. 

The solution, whatever it is (I teach English, not history), must include better access to mental health care in this country. 

And, when your local government considers raising the school tax, could you please remember - even if you don't have children - that you benefit, society benefits, from an educated citizenry. Everyone says the public schools need more money, but no one wants to supply it. We dedicate our lives to society's children, and make sacrifices on a daily basis. Sometimes, too, we are called upon to make the ultimate sacrifice.

So one night, I'm already in bed and she turns out the light to make it harder for me to realize their trick, and makes up some last second excuse to leave the room. A minute or two later I hear (what I assumed was her) coming back in to the room, and climbing in bed beside me.

I'm horny as hell, and slide over next to my bed-mate and we start making out. We ended up having some mind-blowing sex. It was incredible. I've never gotten such passion from my girlfriend.

At some point in the night they'd switched back, so when I woke up my girlfriend smiled at me and asked me if I'd enjoyed ""our"" sex. I explained to her I'd been on to them the whole time, and that I knew it wasn't her from the very start.

I said something funny, and my sister laughs. Moby hears her laugh and looks in her direction, sees her sitting on the loveseat, and does a CLASSIC double take. You can just see his cat thought balloon say, ""WAIT!!! IF SHE'S OVER THERE...WHOSE LEGS AM I SITTING ON?!?!!""

100% entirely false. [And there is actual data from the plant's process computer to prove it.](http://warp.da.ndl.go.jp/info:ndljp/pid/3856371/naiic.go.jp/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/NAIIC_Eng_Chapter2_web.pdf).

&gt;Chapter 2. Discussion on the Damage to the Major Systems and Facilities at Unit 1 Section 1. Reactor Pressure Vessel ( RPV) The possibility that in the period after the earthquake until the tsunami arrival damage that would impair the containment function  occurred to the RPV or penetration lines including instrument lines, their connections with the RPV, the flange gaskets of the main steam safety relief valves (hereinafter referred to as the “SRVs *2”), or other peripheral boundary arts of the RPV (hereinafter referred to as the “RPV or its Peripherals”) has been repudiated according to the following discussions.

If you read chapter 2 section one, you will see evidence of the following: Data from the transient data system on RPV water level, pressure, and temperature, drywell pressure and temperature, radiation levels, start up signals, and changes in main steam flow, all of which clearly show that there was no damage to the containment function or RPV function. Without these, water could not lower below top of active fuel and damage could not occur.

Additionally, if a LOCA would have occured, fuel damage would have happened and the RPV would have been breached within an hour of loss of power at the site. This is very well known, and the damage from LOCA occurs so quickly that ECCS systems are required to start within minutes of a LOCA occurring. Because all evidence points to RPV failure greater than 12 hours after the event started, there is no way a LOCA could have been in progress at the start of the accident.

Please read material and cite sources. People keep making claims based off of things they ""heard"" over a year ago that are just wrong, or are coming from sources which actually have no actual plant data on the accident. I also highly recommend reading my linked source, it is not only official from an independent group in Japan, but it is extremely thorough and detailed and justifies all claims made using actual plant data.

Edit: [Also a good link](http://icanps.go.jp/eng/final-report.html)

Second edit: Starting with the first official report I've read in november 2011, through today, I have not once seen an official report using official data that suggest any meltdown was in effect OR any loss of coolant accident at any of the Fukushima Daiichi units. I am a nuclear engineer and have been following this closely using both publicly available sources and industry information. 

Third edit: [Go to page 71 here](http://warp.da.ndl.go.jp/info:ndljp/pid/3856371/naiic.go.jp/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/NAIIC_Eng_Chapter2_web.pdf)

&gt;The only thing almost certain is that neither an LB-LOCA nor an MB-LOCA occurred at Units 1 through 3 as a result of the earthquake motions of the Great East Japan earthquake. If an LB or MB-LOCA had occurred, the water level and pressure in the reactor would have fallen rapidly in a short period of time, but this was not observed in the time between the earthquake and the time of the total station blackout SBO in the data released by TEPCO. An SB-LOCA, however, can occur without a drastic decrease in water level or pressure in the reactor; therefore no one can decisively conclude, based only on the published plant operation data, that an SB-LOCA never occurred.

It is not possible to even know if an SB-LOCA occurred because the water drawdown rate would have been very low compared to the loss of water from boiling (&gt;600 gpm). There's no way a meltdown would have occurred under those conditions due to just the earthquake.

True,heiferly,,,"I'm not saying I approve of them, but I don't find them shocking, per se. Natural consequences are viewed differently than punishments imposed by humans. Look at a much simpler example taken from the children's playground: the child who hasn't yet learned to give a wide clearance when walking past a swingset where other children are playing. Some parents and teachers, seeing a toddler walking too close to the swingset, will eventually cease to intervene if verbal warnings and physical prompts have not worked to teach the child not to do this. The child gets kicked by another child (a natural consequence), cries, and is much more likely not to repeat this behavior in the future. You would be hard pressed, however, to find one of those parents or teachers who would themselves intentionally kick that child to teach the same lesson. The end result might be the same, but the means is viewed as morally quite different. 

Clearly, death as a natural consequence is of a different nature than anything else because of its finality; even so, the idea that a *natural* consequence is more morally acceptable than one imposed by humans may still have appeal.

I would give anything to be able to have stopped what happened yesterday.  I am deeply disturbed every time I hear about these massive shooting rampages, but this one was too close to home for me.  Children in kindergarten are angels. They are just starting to really experience life and they remind you every day that life really is exciting and wonderful.  They're also just starting to experience school.  The love it and look forward to it every day.  They haven't been jaded and they haven't experienced it long enough to be bored by it.  Literally every day they are lining up with huge grins on their faces and the same level of excitement to see their teacher as the first day of school.

True,KneeCo,,,"So I actually wrote a research paper on this topic, and the truth of the matter is that the Irish were not bigger drunkards then or now than other parts of Europe or America. The stereotype came from a couple big factors. (I'm listing them in no particular order as I remember them)

1. The potato famine forced many extremely poor Irish into Britain and America. In many areas of Britain and America if you were caught being excessively drunk in the streets, you would have to pay a fine. If you couldn't pay the fine, you'd be taken to jail for the night. Since the Irish were so poor, they could rarely pay the fine and were often brought into jail as opposed to the British or Americans who were more likely to pay the fine on the spot and head home. Therefore, it seemed as if the jails were always overflowing with ""drunk Irishmen"" but not other nationalities.

2. The Irish were seen as lesser people by Americans and especially British. For example, in the late 19th century in the north of America, it was easier for a black man to get a job than an Irishmen. There was an extreme amount of racism directed in their direction which brought on negative stereotypes to justify the racism. There were the typical ""lazy"" and ""stupid"" stereotypes, but also the ""drunken"" stereotype. This stereotype was constantly embellished in order to justify British and American ""superiority"" so that they could continue to treat the Irish as second class citizens.

2a. This stereotype became cited more and more when Social Darwinism became vogue. The British looked to the poor Irish and had to come up with a justification as to why the Irish were not as successful as them (which of course could not have anything to do with the historical British oppression of the Irish or the incredibly destructive potato famine) and latched onto the vice of drunkenness.

*Just pulled up my paper, let's get statistics-y*

3. When the Temperance Movement (if you're unfamiliar with this, think of it as essentially a prohibition-type movement for the sake of simplicity) spread through Europe and America, it managed to catch particular stock in Ireland. By 1843, Father Mathew had received contracts from 6 million Irishmen abstaining from alcohol out of the total population of 8 million.

4. The Irish drank less than most surrounding peoples. The British for example would take just about any excuse to drink, including at elections and even in jail. In the mid-1970s a study was conducted which ranked Ireland as 15th on the list of pure alcohol consumed per capita of those aged over 15, placing them behind the UK and at less than half the amount of the leader (Portugal). In 1989 another study compared France, Spain, Italy, the UK, and Ireland. Ireland ranked dead last in consumption per capita.

5. The Irish have bought into this stereotype in many ways. One of the reasons the Temperance Movement caught on so much was because many people believed that this was a rampant problem in their country and still do. In 1978, a survey of Irish mothers found that 30% of them thought youth drinking was a serious problem as opposed to only 10% of British mothers. However, Irish youth actually had a higher proportion of non-drinkers and a lower average alcohol intake than British youth.

6. Until recently, research seemed to back up the fact that the Irish put more importance on alcohol since they appeared to spend a much larger percentage of their income on alcohol than other European countries. However, this research has been debunked once it came to light that the categorization of alcohol consumed in a bar or restaurant was listed as ""entertainment"" for other countries but as ""alcohol consumption"" in Ireland. Once the study was reviewed with this in mind, Ireland fell back into the middle of the pack.

There's a few more points but I figure this is getting fairly long, and this hits on all the main points.

TL;DR: The Irish did not in the past nor do they now drink more than other nearby peoples. Racism and social status played into the stereotype at the time, and some poorly designed studies reinforced the idea until recently.

EDIT: To answer some of the common questions in the comments-

1. Yes, I am about half Irish (my family's been in America for generations so we're completely Americanized) but I did not write this paper as a defense of the Irish, I actually set out to just write a paper to answer the question of why the Irish drank so much, only to find this a more interesting topic as I researched.

2. I won't post a link to my paper because I'm not comfortable with my paper being out on the internet where anyone could grab it and claim it as their own in their classes. But I'll post the info for some of the nice sources if you're looking for some base knowledge on the subject. If you want more in depth sources any university library database will have plenty, they're not hard to find (arguing both for and against my thesis).

Now, on Xbox, movement in the Nether is amplified 3x in the x and z axis (altitude is normal I think). Now, if the portal you just came through, which we will call portal C, is at portal A's coordinates, divided by 3, then we are good to go. If not, DESTROY portal C, and rebuilt it at portal A's coordinates (again, divide by 3!) and activate it

Now, divide portal B's coordinates by 3, and go to this point in the nether and build another portal. Activate it.

Go back to the overworld THROUGH PORTAL C, and then activate portal B.

Now portals a and c should be linked, and b and d should be linked.

I hope this helps

True,[deleted],,,"There are plenty of places to get statistics on drug use. Surveys, for one. I pasted a clip from this report here that reinforces the point I was making about disporportionate enforcement and conviction that has a vague explanation where some of the numbers come from. You have to go through the report to find the ultimate sources, which you are free to do. It's linked at the bottom.

&gt;Our research shows that blacks comprise 62.7 percent and whites 36.7 percent of all drug offenders admitted to state prison, even though federal surveys and other data detailed in this report show clearly that this racial disparity bears scant relation to racial differences in drug offending. There are, for example, five times more white drug users than black. Relative to population, black men are admitted to state prison on drug charges at a rate that is 13.4 times greater than that of white men. In large part because of the extraordinary racial disparities in incarceration for drug offenses, blacks are incarcerated for all offenses at 8.2 times the rate of whites. One in every 20 black men over the age of 18 in the United States is in state or federal prison, compared to one in 180 white men.

&gt;Shocking as such national statistics are, they mask even worse racial disparities in individual states. In seven states, for example, blacks constitute between 80 and 90 percent of all drug offenders sent to prison. In at least fifteen states, black men are admitted to prison on drug charges at rates that are from 20 to 57 times greater than those of white men. These racial disparities in drug offenders admitted to prison skew the racial balance of state prison populations. In two states, one in every 13 black men is in prison. In seven states, blacks are incarcerated at more than 13 times the rate of whites.

As for whether or not they were arrested for being drug dealers or not, that's pretty easy to determine actually.

&gt;Whether convicted on possession or sales charges, relatively few of the drug offender prison admissions over the past two decades have been high-profile drug traffickers, ""king pins,"" or persons occupying high level positions within sophisticated drug dealing enterprises. 58 Available research indicates that most incarcerated drug offenders are bit players in the drug trade, such as small-time dealers selling to customers on the streets, addicts trying to support their habit,59 ""mules"" or couriers trying to earn some extra cash, and women pressed into occasional service by drug dealing boyfriends. Most of the men and women incarcerated in New York prisons on drug offenses, for example, whether first or repeat offenders, were convicted of low level drug offenses involving minute drug quantities.60 Even federal drug defendants, who would be expected to have higher level profiles than state drug defendants, are primarily low level offenders.61 According to the United States Sentencing Commission, only 11 percent of federal drug defendants were high level dealers; more than half were street level dealers or mules. 62 Another federal analysis indicated that over one-third of the drug felons in federal prisons were low level nonviolent offenders.

The ""South"" had half the people and got one balloon each. We actually spent weeks developing different plans of attack/defense and kids tried out to be the general and were voted on by their peers.

The generals were supposed to sit back and direct but directing 5th graders is like directing cats, so it basically meant he just stood there. About 40 minutes into the war, which lasted 2ish hours, he realized that the North's strategy was dependent on supply lines. They actually had everyone deposit their balloons in large bins and then only carry one at a time. If they tossed it, they ran back to the bin and got a new one. This way, taking out a single Northern soldier didn't take out more than one balloon. 

Our general eventually got bored and so made a suicide sprint straight for a supply depo.

True,LovinItsWhatIGot,,,"Here are some quick thoughts

Generally: Wow, pretty good! This is definitely a well written song. Your voice is very pleasant, there's good melodic phrasing, good changes in dynamic, and a nice sense of development to a nice payoff in to the last chorus.

Now for a more specific ""Critique"":

* The First verse is very solid. The guitar line is interesting enough and works well with the melody. The drums then coming in is a nice touch.
* I definitely like the idea of changing the guitar rhythm for the chorus, but maybe you could find a rhythm that sounds a little more natural(?). It's not a bad by any means but the feel isn't ""quite"" right I think. But it does contribute to the rising excitement (which is good!).

* The melody of the chorus I feel is really close to being really good and catchy.  Overall it's good, but not quite ""memorable"" enough for a great pop/folk song. The part that sticks out most to me is the ""in the galaxies"" phrase because it has a nice rhythm and is separated from the rest of the melody. my suggestion is to try to make the rhythm of your melody more interesting/catchy to make certain phrases pop out more. 

* the guitar instrumental does it's job but is a little underwhelming I suppose. It's a little ""oh this type of thing again."" This is probably my least favorite part of the song. My suggestion is to either change the part to something more melodic or just add an additional melody over that part to make it more distinctive, instead of just like, ""i need to kill 8 bars before I can get back to the verse""

* The last chorus really feels cool! the changed harmony is really nice and it feels inspirational. I think you should extend this part! Keep the feel going in a Snow Patrol/Coldplay-esque power ballad and repeat the chorus...something like that.  I felt wanting more! (sometimes leaving people feeling that is a good thing, but sometimes you wanna give people just what they want. So your call i guess)

Again...I think this is quite a good song. Put this on record with a bunch of other good songs and people would really like it. Keep up the good work.

True,outshyn,,,"Very true.  I'm 41, and one of the biggest problems at this age is that there is no location where I can expect to find people my age.  If you're a teen, you can expect that school will have people your age.  Early 20s, need drinking buddies?  College has thousands of people like you.  Late 20s, early 30s?  Lots of people like you are working up the corporate ladder, finding husbands/wives, starting families.  Join a big company and go to company parties, or head to your local bar!  ...But 40s?  Uh... most people are now married off, or in LTR.  And there is no ""here is where you'd expect 40-year-olds to be"" place.  They've finally settled into life and are off with their loved ones, no longer looking to hang out with groups of friends (for the most part).  Even if they are looking to be social, they're doing it by socializing with other couples, in quiet ways (like a movie night).  So there is no ""here are 1000 people your age, go make friends"" thing anymore.

And if you do find people in your 40s (or 50s!) to hang out with, good luck arranging it.  You'll have to wait for them to ""get permission"" from their spouses to have a night with friends, and when they can get time to hang out, they'll have curfews.  If you want to plan entire vacations together or find people your own age to be roommates and have LAN parties or game nights or whatever, well... you're really kidding yourself.  That stuff is nearly impossible to organize anymore at this age, and those who can pull it off fill me with envy.

I've returned to running D&amp;D games via meetup.com in the last few years, as a way to make friends.  It has truly worked -- I have dozens of people who want in.  However, only 6 or 7 are around my age.  Everyone else is younger, sometimes half my age.  It feels weird to run four 20-something guys through a game and at the end of the night hear them say to each other, ""That was fun.  You guys up for drinking?""  And then they take off, forming a good bond that doesn't include the odd-man-out -- me, the 40-something old dude.  Still, at least it's something, and at least when I can get a few of the older people to come out &amp; play, it is a very great time.  So I'm thankful for that.

My point is, JimPick is right.  If you're able to put together a bunch of friends and they enjoy spending time with you, be thankful.  Be thankful every day.  That shit is awesome.

True,T3HN3RDY1,izzet,,"So, I noticed you didn't manage to get any actual constructive criticism. I'm gonna go ahead and try to change that for you. Unfortunately, Touch of Red is pretty much right. Most of the deck doesn't seem to mesh together. If you want Nicol Bolas to be a win condition, you're gonna need to GET to 8 mana alive. That being said, Gem of Becoming is horrible.

There is good news, though! You're playing some darned good control colors. If you want to get to 8 CMC you're going to have to deal with quite a few hurdles. First is the fact that Thragtusk is rampant. As was mentioned before, Rakdos Keyrune is definitely a good answer to Thragtusk, and also serves to accelerate you to the 8 mana mark that you need to hit. I'd cut all three gems of becoming and add 3 Rakdos Keyrunes, for sure.

Next, I'm not sure why you run Blasphemous Act. It is a decent sideboard card against tokens, but otherwise is just a REALLY expensive board wipe. We also need to talk about some of your other Sorceries. Index is AWFUL, and there are lots of good alternatives to Divination as well. Think Twice can handily take up four of those spots, and since you're running red, consider Faithless Looting as well.

Now onto your control, because you still have to SURVIVE for 10 turns or so, then PROTECT Nicol. Ultimate price is a good answer to a lot of the threats in Standard now, like Thundermaw Hellkite, Angel of Serenity/Revelation, Thragtusk (if you have to), Hellrider, etc. Since you're in red and black I'd recommend a couple of copies of Dreadbore, since it deals with planeswalkers. It's at sorcery speed though, so maybe not four of them. As far as your counterspells go, you've got a pretty decent selection. You might think of including a couple of Essence Scatters along with your Negates, maybe 2 and 2? Most of the threats in the current Meta come in the form of Creatures.

Unsummon is interesting, but I'm not sure it's helpful enough for you, considering your rather lofty ambitions. It buys you a turn if you're lucky. The real problem is that it nets your opponent extra value out of Thragtusk or Restoration Angel. I'd replace it with something more useful. Maybe more card draw. Forbidden Alchemy can be nice.


I'm no pro deckbuilder by any stretch of the imagination, but I'm always willing to help someone brew, because that's what I find most fun about this game.

True,[deleted],,,"Okay so, try the following:

-Most Important Step Of All: Do NOT do anything you have seen in pornos. That's a bunch of utter nonsensical bullshit. Pron has no place in reality and in having a fun, mutually rewarding sexual encounter with a woman who is not a porn actress.

-Do tell her that you're nervous. It's not a turn-off. Do tell her that you find her really beautiful. And also ask her to tell you what she likes, what feels good to her and what doesn't feel good. Tell her that her pleasure is very important to you. And that you really appreciate being with a girl as amazing as her for your first time. It's important for you to say these things to her because it's good for you to get used to seriously prioritizing a woman's pleasure. And secondly, it's important for her to hear these things because she needs to know that you see her as a person instead of someone to fuck.

-Don't worry if you climax quickly. It's your first time. Don't worry if you don't get her off with your tongue. It's your first time.

-Don't be in a hurry. Unless she asks you to do anything faster. Ask her to let you know if she wants you to use faster strokes or lick her clit faster.

-Spend a lot of time on her neck, breasts, thighs and the area right above her vulva. Also spend time kissing her. 

-Listen and feel your way through this. Her movements, breathing and moans will tell you a lot. Also where she places her hands and how she positions her thighs and moves her hips will also tell you a lot. Which is why it's very useful and important to go slow. This gives you time to take in information and interpret it. Also hopefully, you'll have asked her to tell you what she likes and doesn't like. So you'll be getting open communication from her.

-Be sure to tell her what YOU like. This is your experience too. Most men neglect and ignore their sexuality unless it's right from their penis. The fact is that men too have erogenous zones all over their bodies. If you like her touching your neck, chest, thighs, hips, let her know. 

-When you're actually inside her, feel free to pause and get used to the sensation. She will probably be really nice and sweet to you at this point. Be sure to remember how nice she is being at this vulnerable and intimate time of your life. 

-When you feel ready and comfortable with moving inside her, do NOT pound her like the pornos depict. You'll find that you can actually use your hands to maneuver your penis to rub against different places inside her vagina. Try doing that if you like and if you find it feasible. 

-Do NOT pull her hair or slap her ass or choke her or any of that porno crap. 

-When you're moving inside her, think in terms of rhythm. 

-Even if you climax within 5 seconds of being inside her, don't beat yourself up. It's your first time. She will probably be really nice to you. Make it up to her and ask her what she wants.

-When you're giving her oral sex, don't do that letters of the alphabet crap. Don't stick your tongue inside her vagina. Don't pound her vagina with your fingers harshly. Simply flick your tongue gently against her clitoris in a rhythmic way. Don't do that harder and faster nonsense. It's a clitoris, not a vegetable you're chopping with your tongue.

-You may find it difficult to have an erection because of tension and anxiety. No problem. Doesn't make you less of a man. Simply cuddle with her and sensually explore her body and caress and kiss her in ways that she enjoys. You'll find yourself getting turned on as well.

True,UndergroundLurker,,,"From my own experience, it's all about giving yourself the right habits:

* Stop drinking caffeine.  Cut it out entirely.  Take aspirin for the couple days of headaches.  Then when you need it once a month, it will actually be a boost instead of ""reset to not drowsy"".  Even then, take it (small quantities: tea not soda) in the morning, never in the evening (it has a **half** life of around 5 hours).
* Stop making up lost sleep on the weekends, by getting more sleep on the weekdays.  Make a schedule and stick to it.  Do you need 8 hours of sleep to function?  Do you take an hour to fall asleep?  Do you need to be up at 7AM?  Aim to go to bed at 10PM, every single night of the week.  Are you an insomniac who needs 2 hours to fall asleep but only 4 hours of actual sleep to function?  Fine!  Plan for six (but seriously consider meditation classes for while you're waiting to fall asleep).  You can adjust this as you go but force yourself to lie in bed at that time for a couple weeks until you're used to it.  If your schedule won't allow this much time set aside for sleep, re-evaluate your life (I used to be an MMORPG addict and now regularly go weeks without playing a game).
* Stop snoozing / setting multiple alarms.  Snooze sleep is not worthy sleep.  Set your alarm for the last possible time you can get up (I don't mean like ""not even time to shower"" but the last possible time to do your entire morning routine with a little urgency).  Then train yourself to get up as soon as it goes off.
* Regular exercise (any kind of exertion; walking a few miles a day totally counts) is really important, you're not going to sleep well after an all-day movie/gaming marathon.
* Light can be more powerful (but shorter lasting) at keeping you awake than caffeine.  In the morning get that awakeness you lost giving up caffeine by opening the windows and letting the sun shine in.  But you also need to give yourself a sense when it's getting dark so your body can wind down.  Dimmers are cheap and easy to install.  Make sure your alarm clock isn't a beacon of light.  Put sticky notes over it if you have to dim it, you shouldn't be able to read it well in daytime.  I use a projection clock because I sleep with my head facing up and I don't have to move (or mentally wake up) much to read the time from the ceiling at night (it's unreadable with the bedroom light on).
* Oh it's an hour before bed-time and it takes 45 to 90 minutes to play a round of a video game?  NO.  BAD.  Even at 45 minutes that's a lot of light in your face right before bed.  Honestly you're better off spending that last hour with some human contact (in a low light area) or (at least for me with some self control) on reddit with the enhancement suite's dark background on.
* When you do wake up in the middle of the night, keep it simple so you don't ""rev up"" your brain to full awakeness.  A bathroom nightlight is good, depending on your vision you may need to tape it darker.
* The bed is for sleeping and sex, nothing else.  Pull the reading light and TV out of the bedroom.  For that matter, I try to get my sex done in the mornings or day time so she's not pining for it when I'm trying to sleep.  Back to the light thing, I bought blackout curtains and keep mine as dark as possible.
* Dunno about diet though I generally don't worry about mine.  Do you wake up hungry and then can't fall back asleep?  Eat more non-sugary foods before bed (okay maybe not *right* before bed but soon enough).  Capping the night with a small sugary food can be a digestive aid, but I mean like **one** cookie.
* I found myself futily waking up many nights because I was too warm.  I then read somewhere that your body temperature naturally goes up at a certain point in your sleep.  I bought a programmable thermostat for my central A/C in the summer (apologies if you don't have this option), and set it to go down two degrees at approximately 2.5 hours before I planned on waking up.  It makes a huge difference.
* Establish boundaries with your bed-mates.  If they are disruptive, you can tell pets what to do by locking them out.  Humans require a little more negotiation.  Let your partner know when you are getting ready for bed ""I'm brushing my teeth now"" and encourage them to get their pajamas out of the bedroom because you're going to sleep soon and don't want them to have to turn on the light.  Over time if you're consistent, your partner will probably end up in bed 5 minutes after you most nights anyway.  Noisy neighbors?  Get a pack of earplugs and learn how to properly insert them.
* Don't ever use any kind of drug to help yourself sleep.  Count your alcoholic drinks and switch to water at the appropriate amount of time before your planned bed time.  Think of it like planning to have your hangover as you're falling asleep, and then it never comes.  ""Passed out"" is never the same as ""asleep"".

Do most of this and you'll find yourself calmly waking up just before your alarm, consistently.  It's what works for me, I'm not trying to be demanding I just try to consider them absolute rules *to myself*.

True,pageboysam,,,"Any good Bears fan worth his salt would know dat Ditka signs so forcefully that even with a felt-tip marker it's very likely that his name is now permanently engraved into da glass of da wine bottle. But da ink itself can still get rubbed off.

So here's whatcha do:

1. Set up your gas or coal-powered BBQ.
2. Open up your favorite brand of bratwurst or sausage, or if you have heart problems like our Superfan in da sky Todd O'Connor, perhaps you may want to try I-Can't-Believe-It's-Not-Polish-Sausage.
3. While da sausages ar' cookin', have your wife or husband get out da camera in front of your BBQ and take a picture. Make sure to have da signature turned outward toward da camera and have proper lighting. When your significant says da words ""Da Bears,"" imagine Super Bowl XX where da Bears humiliated da Patriots.
4. Wrap da wine bottle tightly in waxed butcher paper as to preserve da signature without rubbing off da ink. Print da picture and put a copy in da box with wine, and mail da package.

I assure you that every time your loved has a sip of dat wine dat he or she will be able to taste da divine flavor that are da sweat and tears of da living god himself: Mike Ditka.

Enjoy.

Let's be honest, the only way to pass the gun control laws that a lot of people are asking for is with another Constitutional amendment.  Taking today's political atmosphere into consideration, I think we all can agree this would be impossible right now.

I'm an ""old fart"" in Reddit years and have seen this same conversation play out time and again after every act of gun violence.  I see the ""ban/restrict guns!"" solutions like I do the FBI warnings in movies.  

The only people these warnings effect are the ones playing by the rules.  The ones the warnings are aimed at never see them because they bypassed the entire system with a click of a torrent link.

We have gun control laws and yet things like this still happen.  Aside from an outright ban (see 2nd Amendment), more laws are not going to make a difference.

I'm normally considered a ""bleeding heart"" liberal, but this is one area I side with the Right.  Guns are a tool.  Instead of wasting time/money/political clout on restricting/banning the tool (only to have it thrown out in court) we need to focus on the human being that used it.

/rant.  Carry on with your knee-jerk.

**Edit:**  Guys I really wish you would take the time to read and comprehend my words without bias.  Your arguments for gun control are not new.  Your ideas, thoughts, feelings have been said and acted on before - multiple times.  You are a generation reinventing the wheel of those who came before you.

Until such a time that the 2nd Amendment is changed, all you are doing is wasting resources that could go towards having an actual effect.

**Edit 2 - the final edit:**  First, thanks for the Gold.  Second I want to say that I understand a lot of the arguments being made for gun control.  I made the exact same arguments, with the same passion, back in 1999 after Columbine.  Because I was so passionate about it, I failed to take into consideration the biggest road block - the 2nd amendment.

I've seen a lot of hard work, money, and political clout used to get gun control laws passed; only to be tossed out in the courts because they are deemed unconstitutional.  While there have been some small successes, ultimately a lot of the energy behind gun control has been wasted.

If I could go back in time and talk with that 20 year old, I'd do my best to direct his passion and energy towards something that would be more beneficial in the long run - the mental health of the shooters and how the media reacts to mass murders.  As difficult as this may be, try and take a step back and compare the gun control movement to the drug control, the piracy control, and the terror control.  You'll see a lot of similarities.

This post was my attempt to talk with that younger me (aka you) and try and redirect that passion.

True,push_pop,,,"I'm currently writing a paper somewhat on this topic and I have been thinking about it a lot. ""The crippling fear of mediocrity."" It's a paradoxical state where you do absolutely nothing because you are afraid of it not being the best or the most unique, etc... I think it is a relatively new problem, like post-industrialist. Working a blue collar job doesn't hold the same nobility it once did. Now you need to be a vegan, white collar, world traveler, who can make anyone laugh. Basically, the most interesting man (or woman) in the world. 

But of course pressure can only be a motivator to a certain extent. Start thinking about too many of these things at once, and you realize you are coming up short on a lot of them. (caveat: I don't think this changes even if you do get ""successful"") Having these realizations all at once can lead to anxiety, depression, etc... and everything compounds.

From what I can tell, the most important thing to get over this confession is just to act. It doesn't matter what you do, but do something out of the ordinary. This can be something as simple as going for a walk at 1am, or going to a book store and ask for a recommendation. Getting even slightly out of your comfort zone makes you realize that the world doesn't care who you are. There is no judgment panel that will say, ""Well he really shouldn't have even tried."" Then use this momentum, not to become who you think you should become (that is an uphill battle always) but use it to realize who you ARE becoming, because that's right, every little thing you do adds a new spin to your momentum. It will turn, spin, and sometimes bounce, but it is important to keep chasing yourself always.

True,shakedown_st,,,"Hearing, ""Be confident"" and ""Just be yourself"" is very frustrating. And I've written about [what it really means to ""be yourself""](http://www.shakedownlab.com/2012/11/26/what-it-actually-means-to-be-yourself/). But as unhelpful as those statements are, people say them because it is true. If you are confident and just being yourself, you are more attractive than the version of yourself that isn't confident. Just a fact of life. 

But that's the goal, isn't it? To be able to walk into any room and be completely comfortable and at ease. To walk into a room and instead of having anxiety about all of these new people, you are actually excited about the prospects of meeting them. It's a total mental shift. And again, I can't just tell you, ""Don't be anxious, be excited instead."" That's not helpful, either. But that's the goal, isn't it?

You need to get out of the mindset of ""if I do X, then Y will happen."" ""If I join two bands and work out, I won't be alone."" This is a fallacy, as you've obviously discovered. When people say ""Get hobbies and work out"", I don't actually believe that they think that is the solution. They just don't know how to word it any differently.

So I will word it differently for them. ""You need to foster a lifestyle that puts you out into the world and makes you feel good for you."" Don't get hobbies and work out because you think it will solve your girl problems. You get hobbies and work out because it is something that you love doing. If you are doing it to get girls, then you are doing it for the wrong reasons. If you are doing it to get girls, ironically, you are actually doing yourself a disservice. The idea is that confident men have things that they are passionate about. And they do them regardless of what anyone else thinks. Confident and strong men have obligations. They are busy. They have shit they need to get done and they do not forfeit those obligations. 

Let's take a hypothetical situation: It's 3:52pm. You have plans to lift in the gym from 4pm to 5pm. All of a sudden your crush calls you up on the phone crying. She got into another fight with her boyfriend and instinctively called you because you've always been there for her during those times. You're a sensitive guy, and girls like that, right? So you think, I need to be there for her right now. Maybe now she'll realize I'm the guy she's supposed to be with. You think you can skip this one workout and make it up on an off-day or something. You tell her everything is going to be okay and that you'll be over to her place in 10 minutes.

Cue cycle of Forever Alone.

Let's rewind to 3:52pm. You've been working on self improvement for two or three weeks now. You've read [No More Mr. Nice Guy](http://www.shakedownlab.com/shakedown-method/fundamentals/step-1-no-more-mr-nice-guy/) and the posts in the sidebar. You've started to see things a little differently -- recognizing patterns in your own behavior that needs to change for the better. You're about to tell her that you'll be over there in 10 minutes, when you suddenly catch yourself. No, not this time. ""That's tough Jessica. I understand you're going through a difficult time right now, but I'm running late to the gym. Afterwards, I'm headed out with Ryan and Chris for a jam session. I'm sure you and your boyfriend will get through this, but unfortunately I gotta go."" As a classic forever alone nice guy, it is almost impossible to wrap your head around this...But you are a better and more attractive man in this second scenario, than you are the first. And you are not being an asshole either. You are just a busy man with obligations, hobbies, interests that you love doing and that take precedence over some girl's emotional distress. 

So that was long-winded, but this is what this subreddit is about. It's about changing your lifestyle, attitude, and just perspective on life, all the while learning the fundamentals of social interaction, body language, etc.. It's a powerful combination.

So in conclusion, all those statements, while unhelpful, need to be deconstructed. When someone says ""hello is the best opening line"", what they are really saying is when you are a confident and awesome man, saying hello is all you need to do, because the rest will come naturally to you. When someone says, ""Just ask her out, what have you got to lose?""...what they are really saying is that instead of being fearful that a rejection will just ""push you down further into the low self-esteem spiral"", you should feel so awesome about yourself that by asking a girl out, you are giving her the privilege of getting to know you. That no rejection can possibly hurt your ego because the girl is the one that is being socially awkward, not you. Do you see how this total shift in mentality is attractive?

You need to set specific goals for yourself, like ""Next Friday night I will approach 5 people and not give a fuck about what happens."" It's a learning experience.

True,p7r,,,"I discovered some years ago that the point of most advertising at a certain marque level was not to acquire new customers, but to retain them or even stop ""buyer's regret"".

For example, BMW pretty much never expect somebody to see one of their adverts and think ""Oh, that car looks good, I'll buy one of those!"", because who the hell makes a purchasing decision of that size based on advertising? Most of their advertising is actually focused on people who *recently bought* one of their cars and is sat there thinking how much of a Ford or GM they could have got for 40% less. It prevents buyer's regret, and pushes them from just a buyer into a brand-loyal fan. It also enhances brand value in general, which is critical when establishing how much your brand is worth financially.

Brand value is where Coca-Cola come in. Frequently in the UK people will say ""it feels like Christmas now"", once the ""Christmas is coming"" Coke ad with santa on lorries going through town is aired. Think about how powerful that is: people associate the celebration of the Messiah's birth, or perhaps the most intense emotional experience of the year that you can point to on a calendar, with a can of *sugar water*.

When you hear ""Coke"", you immediately think of the colours of the can, the taste of the drink, and have an emotional response which is probably very happy, positive and affirming. That's what a lifetime of Coca-Cola telling you what they stand for has done to you.

Recipe-wise, it's almost identical to Pepsi, but think about how you feel when you think of Pepsi, and how you feel when you think of Coca-Cola. That difference? That's the advertising. And it kicks in when you're stood in front of a fridge about to make a purchasing decision.

Most of the Coca-Cola sold around the World is produced under license, it doesn't come from a magic well, and is relatively easy to synthesise. So how much would the company be worth if it weren't anything special? Their entire advertising strategy is to increase brand value which also helps them whenever a customer hesitates about buying their product.

**EDIT:** I strongly recommend if you're interested in how advertising really works, that you check out the counter-argument to all advertising, Ad Busters magazine. [Their website is good](http://www.adbusters.org), but not nearly as awesome or eye-opening as their magazine.

**EDIT 2:** Some people are saying the difference between Coke and Pepsi is ""obviously"" different. Science says different. You might want to read [this paper that says mental association with brand values is more important than taste](http://www.librimedia.com/website/content/research/papers/neural_correlates_of_behavioral_preference_for_culturally_familiar_drinks.pdf), so your brain is tricking you somewhat.

True,[deleted],,,"No, okay, here's the thing. You and many other redditors try to paint these shy guys as victims of unforgiving society pressuring them to take initiative with girls but then they are cruelly and needlessly struck down by heartless women. Consider that women have feelings too. Consider that some women are also shy or socially anxious. Consider that they are constantly flirted with by these victim-complex guys who sometimes get uppity, angry or even verbally or physically aggressive when she tries to politely turn them down or make up white lies to get away, *let alone* when she is clear that she is not interested. Get poked in the face 3044 times in a row and see if you are still sympathetic the 30045th time someone tries to poke you -- especially if you are trying to, I don't know, read a book, or enjoy some alone-time without harassment from strangers. Now try repeating that experiment, except if you try to defend yourself from a poke there is a small *but not negligible* risk the person will yell at you or try to physically harm or humiliate you. 

Getting constantly harassed by Shy Guys Who Just Want To Talk *is* more annoying when you sum it all up, than the occasional guy who grabs me inappropriately in a club, because I know he's an asshole, he knows he's an asshole, and I can just never go to clubs again to avoid it (which I do, because they all seem to think they are entitled to molest any woman in their line of sight because she's dancing).

True,UWillAlwaysBALoser,,,"The thing to remember about contemporary art is that it doesn't exist in a vacuum. Rothko wasn't just saying ""isn't this pretty?"" any more than Hemingway was just writing about an old man and the sea. Contemporary art is in a conversation with every painting that came before it. But since that conversation is long, entirely visual and not well-publicized (articles that mention how much a piece was sold for never talk about why), it can be really difficult to understand what an artist is saying just from looking at it.

I'll try to give a brief overview of the narrative leading up to Rothko. This well be over-simplified and contain errors:

Painting for a long time after the Renaissance was about the rules of positing. How too paint people. How to use color, shadow, and contrast. Composition. You worked really hard to learn these rules, then tried to improve the art. This produced a bunch of beautiful paintings that approached photorealism. 

Then people started to question these rules. They started to intentionally break them to see what would happen. Impressionists started painting everyday scenes instead of royal portraits. They made things blurry, top capture emotions rather than detail. They used visible brush strokes, at once reminding the viewer that they were looking at a positing, not a real landscape, and making the painters presence, and personality, an important party of the aesthetic experience. 

Then you have a bunch of movements that continue along this trajectory, breaking long-established rules about how one should paint. Post-impressionism distorted forms to express a mood, used color wildly, abstracted real objects into geometric shapes. Surrealism, cubism, art nouveau, and a ton of other movements played with these themes and tried new things.

By the time the mid-20th century rolls around, it seems like every taboo had been broken. How many ways can you paint a still-life? One solution was to not paint anything. As in any thing. A painting didn't have to be anything but an expression of the artist's creativity, or a commentary on painting itself, without having to use a subject (a landscape, a nude) as a vector for the ideas. Painting could just be about painting, our the process of painting, or the experience of looking at a painting. 

Rothko's journey followed a similar trajectory to the one I've described for all modern art. He stayed painting as an impressionist, doing landscapes, city scenes, etc. with influence from the Surrealists, he became interested in myth and mythology, and the compares turned him onto primitive art and children's art. All this was in an attempt to hack into something deep inside the viewer, to express an idea in a visual language that was more direct and pure than painting a seaside scene. He would use simple symbols that were meant to hit the viewer deep. Unfortunately, these works weren't well-received, so he figured his theories weren't right. He broke with surrealism and went full abstract.

This was the beginning of his ""multiforms"", the paintings he is most famous for (including the one above). The theory was, as best as I can understand it:

When you look at a painting of a tiger, you are not just looking at the tiger. You are relating it top every other time you've seen a tiger, which lets you pull back from the experience, view it from above, not from within, experience the tiger only from a distance. But when you look at his paintings, they aren't ""of""anything. You're not allowed to reduce it and categorize it. You have to dive into it, experience it, let it seep into you. He recommended that you get as close to 18 inches from the canvas so as to really immerse yourself and confront the unknown.

This discussion is definitely flawed and very incomplete, but I hope it helps illustrate why this want just a hack saying ""ain't these colors purdy"", and why some people may think it's quite valuable.

TL;DR: trying to figure out why people go nuts over contemporary art is a lot like trying to understand why people care if Han Shot First if you've never seen or read about Star Wars.

True,MentalOverload,american,Chef,"Due to your restrictions, I'd actually suggest the reverse sear method if you have the time.  It's one of the best methods, anyway, and it'll make things much easier for you.

So of course, you start with your seasoning, either right before the searing step, or, as I'd recommend, 45+ minutes before you start cooking at all.

Anyway, set your oven pretty damn low, around 200F or as high as 250, but lower is better.  Throw the steaks in the oven and bring your steak between probably 10-25 degrees (F) below what temp you want to end at, depending on how hard of a sear you'd like.  When it gets close, get your pan hot so that by the time your steaks come out, you're ready to sear.

The best part is it'll actually take less than half the time to sear, and your pan will stay fairly hot.  That means you won't be smoking up your kitchen (at least not as much), and you'll get a better sear with more evenly cooked meat - win/win/win!

I want to thank you, sincerely, from the bottom of my heart. I recently learned of a young man named Jason. Jason attends a university that you picketed. During your picket, Jason set up a fundraiser right across the street from you, at which he collected hundreds of dollars in donations. 

He then donated that money to all of the groups that you protest; gay rights groups, israeli support groups, LGBTQ groups, etc.

If it weren't for your presence, he would not have been able to raise all of that money, which he then donated in your honor.

This movement is growing. People don't hate the WBC anymore! In fact, we love you. We appreciate your hatred, your bigotry, and your unintelligence, because as a result, society as a WHOLE is rising above you. 

There are only 100 of you.

There are millions of us.

Wherever you go, there will be a counter movement.

We will raise money, wherever you are, for human beings, for the ones that you so despicably discriminate against.

I will continue this movement.

I will donate this money in your honor, because if it weren't for you, raising these donations wouldn't be possible.

So, thank you, Westboro Baptist Church! Your presence, your words, and your demonstrations are raising beautiful awareness, and substantial amounts of money for gays, lesbians, jews, and many many others.

And for that, I love you.

Please continue your work, so we can continue to outnumber you. 

So your hatefulness, and your arrogance, can continue to inspire a nation of millions to help and care for their fellow man.

You really are making a difference :)

The ""just being friendly"" is what pisses me off. No you aren't just being friendly. Friendly is an old lady talking to me at the bus stop just because, or a man holding the door open for me as I walk by. You know why this is being friendly? Because their motivation to talk to me or be courteous isn't because I'm a young, attractive girl, it's because they're nice people.

When these men approach us, it isn't just to have a conversation. It's to flirt and maybe get a number. Maybe get a date. Maybe get laid. Maybe have a relationship. The fact is they don't want to get to know me or have someone to talk to, they want to get their foot in the door for some sort of relationship.

You should take everything in this post with a few grains of salt.**

I can't speak to a specific anime-related origin for the notion of ""he wouldn't die even if we killed him"", but I can say a few things about the reason that this notion exists in Japanese and why it's less absurd/unrealistic in Japanese than it is in English.

A typical Japanese rendering of the relevant parts of this quote would go something like 「殺しても死なない奴だ」 _koroshite mo shinanai yatsu da_ ""he doesn't die even when killed"". The key insight here is that the verb 「殺す」 _korosu_ ""to kill"" lacks as strong a _completive_ aspect as its English analogue. In other words, when somebody says 「彼を殺した」 _kare wo koroshita_ ""I killed him"", what it _really_ means in Japanese is ""I took actions that ought to have resulted in him being killed"". 

In most cases, this distinction is not terribly important. However, there are a few contexts in which we see other seemingly-bizarre Japanese constructions that arise due to the not-so-completive nature of some Japanese verbs. For example: 「パンを焼いたのに、焼けなかった」 _pan wo yaita no ni, yakenakatta_ lit. ""I baked the bread, but it didn't bake."" This is valid Japanese, and expresses the notion that ""I took actions that _should have_ resulted in the bread becoming baked, but it turns out that the bread did not end up becoming baked [for some reason]"". 

This suggests a plausible linguistic basis for the ""he wouldn't die even if we killed him"" trope: the speaker took actions that _should have_ resulted in the subject being dead, yet the subject was not dead; we infer that the subject did not die because he is stronger than we would think, or perhaps stronger than the average human, or something like that.

Of course, I'm sure that the Japanese have taken this trope and run with it far enough by now that ""he wouldn't die even if you killed him"" is taken very literally in many contexts (i.e. ""I killed him, and he actually did die, and yet he's still moving because he's immortal or some shit like that""), and bears little resemblance to its origins in the incompletive aspect of the verb 殺す.

Aside: no, it did not originate in Fate/stay night, which postdates Rurouni Kenshin, among other things. My explanation here does, however, explain why Shirou's statement that 「人は殺されれば死ぬ」 _hito wa korosarereba shinu_ ""People die when they're killed"" is not as absurd as it seems in English - in Japanese, it is possible to ""kill"" people, and yet for them not to die. 

EDIT: There's definitely no canonical ""origin"" for this quote, because it's a legitimate thing you can say (albeit probably only for the sake of drama) in ordinary Japanese speech to describe somebody who's really tough.

True,[deleted],,,"Warchief Garrosh Encounter, Patch 5.2, December 12 2013 – September 17 2015.

 Warchief Garrosh Hellscream is the only boss but has an attunement requirement of the Pandaren Ambassador, as well as Exalted with Nat Pagle, Operation Shieldwall, the Brawler’s guild and completing the criteria of Insane in the Membrane. You are not forced.

There is no trash, except for a short even where you must fight Twilight dragons by taunting them, and kill Nerubians and Vykrul once the drakes are dead. On the way to the throne room is C’thun trash, however. All trash respawns after each attempt.

Garrosh enters. He yells, “Very well, I suppose it must be this way. If only you’d seen what I’ve seen, THEN you’d understand. There is no good. No light. There is only PAAH. I am the world’s TRUE Warchief, and as long as I reign over these pitiful, mortal insects, this will be the hour of their demise. Garrosh holds up a vial.

GARROSH. STAHP. VAT IS IN THAT VIAL? WAT R U DOING. 

*What my Father could not.*

He drinks demon blood, making him extremely large and red, and actually becomes encased in Elementium armour. 
His new armour makes his voice deeper, and he yells out things like “Break yourselves upon my body. FEEEL the strrrength of the eaarrth. 

We fight him on four platforms, each time we kill parts of his armour, and deal with the blood.  After defeating his four shoulder pads, he falls down, and begins spewing demon blood everywhere. The bloods slowly make their way towards Garrosh and heal him.  There is also Attenuation, Shadow Traps, Defile and Dreadflame, because Blizzard hates you.

Once Garrosh's blood is dead, it turns out it was actually Mannoroth controlling him, so he is not responsible for his actions. Players now begin fighting Mannoroth. 

 An orc yells out GO'EL!

Thrall comes running through the gates of Orgrimmar, but is very slow, as he is roleplay walking, and doesn’t have ghost wolf, a mount, and frequently stops to point out obvious things to people in the trade district, often telling them to enchant and gem their gear. He manages to aggro Alliance guards, and spends several minutes auto attacking them. 
Thrall manages to arrive, and fights the pit lord, but is trapped in a block of ice. Players are meant to break him out of the ice, but there is already the 30% Power of the Aspects and Strength of Wrynn buff in effect, so this mechanic is ignored. Once he is freed, adds spawn, and he takes every single killing blow. When Mannoroth is at 10% health, he one shots the raid, and a 17 minute Roleplay event happens.

Garrosh then kills Mannoroth, and redeems himself, at 1% hp, while spamming emotes on Mannoroth's body. He equips his new Uncorrupted Ashbringer  and is bathed in holy light and starts wearing paladin tier two.

Jaina Proudmoore resurrects the raid, tearfully hugging Garrosh, ""I'm so proud of you Garrosh, my king.""

 Vol'jin then shoots Garrosh in the heart, and kills him.

 The floor falls away, dropping the players into Ragefire Chasm, with water walking cast on every player in the raid, resulting in a requirement to stack shadow priests and mages. Nefarian and Onyxia fight the players, and upon their death, raise lava.

 Three platforms are all that is not submerged by Ragefire Chasm's fiery lava, and the elemental lord of fire, Ragnaros bursts forth, proclaiming that the Firelands was TOO SOON, and this is the TRUE hour of his triumph. 

Once he is dead, it seems that all is well, until-

I am the lucid dream. The monster in your nightmares. The Fiend of a Thousand Faces. BOW DOWN BEFORE THE WARCHIEF OF DEATH!

Garrosh Hellscream, risen from the dead by THE OLD GODS jumps down, stunning every player in the raid for 45 seconds, requiring every member to have a PvP trinket on. The following fight consists of tentacles, insanity, shadow crashes, and has an incredibly high nature resistance requirement. At 1% health, Garrosh sees the error of his ways, and makes a speech.

 Yet all throughout my reign as Warchief, my own heart, devoid of emotion of empathy, I have felt.... NOTHING. A million, million lives wasted. Had they all held within them your tenacity, had they all loved life as you do? Lok'tar ogar. 

Garrosh then slits his wrists out of shame and dies, dropping PvP gear, several pets ideal for battling, and a level 90 version of Stunherald, off DR, with a class requirement; it is only equippable by warriors, since they are not represented in arena enough.

 Bolvar Fordragon appears, looks every player directly in the eye, and proclaims. 

THERE MUST ALWAYS BE A WARCHIEF. 

He dons the mighty Skull-Bone Shoulders of Garrosh, and sits on the throne. He is encased in a block of orcs, and his eyes turn glowing red. He tells the players to “pls go”.

 Stormwind is turned into a giant memorial of lightforged steel as a remembrance of Garrosh's bravery, ushering in a new era, and making player versus player combat mandatory, or players' accounts are suspended.
 
 There is no new content produced until every player beats Warchief Garrosh on LFR 10 man, which is the only mode available. 

Ghostcrawler gets promoted.

True,Material_Defender,,,"Thats because its not really ""Anonymous"". This is an identifiable group of people who are keeping their identities secret. Which is, uh, yeah, anonymous, but it's not the same kind you seem to referring to.

The internet's anonymous is a concept, not a group or people, originating from imageboards like 4chan. You'd do stupid and sometimes offensive stuff because you were Anonymous, unknown, unidentifable, untrackable. and it was funny. You could say bad words, do questionable content with other people on the internet, and go to work/school the next day with a smile on your face. That was the motivation behind being Anonymous.

Collecting people's interest in a ""raid"" or something was a simple idea, something easy you can do that would end in a hilarious result. Raid a children's flash game MMO, go on a super-conservative forum and argue with folks, call in a talk-show and say naughty things, stuff like that you'd do alone would be a drop in the bucket. But doing it with an unknown vast amount of people from /b/ or something.. you would be an ocean. (of piss) That was the power behind Anonymous.

Flash game MMO raids, to trolling forums/website comments, to HACKING or DDoSing sites is what gained Anonymous infamy. People got scared for some reason? I don't know why. Everybody was Anonymous, nobody was anonymous. You could ""join"" them by simply doing what everybody's eyes were on. That was the rise of Anonymous.

Then the Scientology raids came around and that was a big fucking leg up for it's reputation. It first started as a joke because Scientology and it's believers were so ridiculous and over-reactive about their religion that you couldn't help but take part in threads that involved trolling them. Then some image started floating around about doing a protest in front of their buildings across the world on Nov 5th. This got around everywhere, using the guise of Anonymous. That was the evolution of Anonymous

So now everybody is getting in on this protest, but it quickly turned from ""lulz"" to an appeal for humanity against Scientology (they were not only stupid, but they had a ridiculous entrance fee, brain washing, and even questionable espionage such as suspected kidnapping). That was all fine and dandy but Anonymous was now a ""hero of the internet"" instead of a bunch of bored morons who wanted to entertain themselves before bed. This reached into the REAL world and people actually dressed up and got in their cars/buses/bikes/whatever and spent a portion of their day doing something beneficial for the world. Despite all this good, it was still considered the fall of Anonymous.

After that, the concept Anonymous turned into a identity and people would start calling themselves ""Anonymous"" and make videos and go to protests, then this group I keep hearing about comes along and starts hacking websites of those with evil/stupid intentions. Places that once thrived with Anonymous pride now shamed it (ANOON EES LEGIUN!! xDD), looking at videos of Anon IRL ""raids"" were cringe-worthy to watch at most and people just forgot about it's original idea. That was the death of Anonymous.

Now, I'm not shitting on whoever these guys are, good on them, they're lettin' god sort em out. But I'll see comments like this saying ""Wow these dudes use to be so bad!"" and I'm just like, ""ECH."" No offense to you.

True,Shubzeh,,,"Its a long story, but if you're really curious here it is.

When I was 17, a senior in high school, I found out my mom had cancer. I was devastated. She told me that she'd found a lump on her breast a couple years ago. I can't describe the emotions that I felt when I found out she'd kept that from me. We were both scared, but I finally convinced her to go see a doctor. She stayed in the hospital for two weeks, until her insurance coverage ran up. It turns out it was stage 4. The doctors urged her to get a mastectomy right away. She was terrified, she thought that it was already too late. She didn't even want to try.

I finished high school and her health really deteriorated. I tried to be as supportive as I could. About 6 months after her doctors visit, she started having trouble standing on her own. That was fine, I didn't want her to have any more stress so I started cooking and cleaning. Then it got to the point where she couldn't stand without assistance, after another 6 months her legs got so weak she couldn't stand on her own. It wasn't long before she was completely bedridden. 

That was the beginning of the the last year, the hardest. I moved the couch into her room so I could be there for her 24/7. I did *everything* for her. I begged her to go see a doctor but she would get angry with me and tell me to leave her alone. Besides when she napped, this was my only chance to be alone, but I was constantly on edge listening for her calling my name, or worse, the sound of her falling out of bed  because she wanted to get up and go to the bathroom on her own. My mother wasn't a small woman, about 5'10 and 200lbs. I was the same height and about 140, so when I had to move her, it wasn't an easy task. I could never get her up without hurting her, and sometimes it would take up to 30 minutes. 

Then her mind began to go. It started with little things. She'd ask me for a glass of milk and when I brought it to her she'd be upset because she had *clearly* said coke. And then she began to think she was back in the hospital. For the last 6 months she would usually call for a nurse, not me. She thought I was either Patrick or Sam, the male nurses who she had in the hospital. She loved Patrick and would sometimes talk about me to him, it was really sweet. But if she thought I was Sam she 
would yell at me and resist when I tried to move her. It was rough never knowing if your mom is going to curse you out, or be nice, or even recognize you.

I remember the night that I finally had enough. It was 3am and i'd spent the last 3 hours doing crazy assorted task to appease her, and I decided fuck it. For the first time in the last four months I went and laid down in my own bed and slept for seven hours. I woke up when I heard the physical therapist knocking on the door. I took her into my mom's room and told her to call me if she needed anything. She came back to my room a few minutes later and told me she was dead.

The paramedics came and took her away. I just remember crying hysterically until I fell asleep on the floor in the living room. I woke up and felt the most alone I ever had in my life. I didn't know who to call. The only relatives I had lived out of state. I'd spent the last year of my life doing nothing, talking to no one and now I had nothing. 

Looking back on it all (happened 2 years ago), I'm not angry at her, I never was. I'm hurt. I can't help but feel it was selfish of her. To refuse the treatment, and end up putting me through that, and to not be around for me.

This is my closest guarded secret, I won't even say it out loud, but my life is my own now, and i'm finally feeling ""normal"".

True,wutyonameis,,,"I did something similar to a former roommate of mine. He had once kicked my dog which generated quite a bit of animosity between them.  One time he left his bedroom door open which turned into a golden opportunity for my dog to shit in his bed.  After this happened I apologized for what she did and washed his bedding for him but told him that it was his responsibility to keep his door closed, not mine.  About a week later, he left the door open again, and as you can guess, she shat in his bed again. This time, he threw the shit at my dog and wiped it all over my bed. This all happened while I was working an 8 hour shift. When I came home, I found my dog cowering in my room, in the dark with shit all over the place. I then kicked his door in, and wanted to beat the living shit out of him and told him if he touched my dog again I'd kill him. But I was beyond furious. The rage inside me stewed for days until about a week later, while I was in the shower. I was trying to think of some way to get back at him and then it hit me. I looked up at this shelf in the corner of the shower. I thought, hey I should piss in his shampoo, but no, that wasn't enough. It had to be worse. Then I saw it. His toothbrush sitting with the rest of his things. It was then that I knew what I had to do. I proceeded to scrub my asshole with his toothbrush each and every time I took a shower until he moved out a year later. Sometimes I'd even shower twice a day just to get a little extra cleaning time in. 

Edit: He was routinely a dick to my dog which eventually led to her shitting on his bed. She had a rescue from a local shelter for neglected and abused pitbulls and is very timid as a result. As I mentioned, he had once kicked her which caused her to be frightened by him, though this was the only time he touched her(to my knowledge). But he would scream at her whenever she barked at something outside because it would ""scare his cat"" and would often come home to find my dog locked in my room with the blinds shut and the lights off. I'm not saying what I did was right, but I did it and looking back I don't really care because I love my dog. Also I didn't beat the shit out of him, though I wanted to. I'm writing all of this on my phone and it likes to skip words and such sometimes.

True,[deleted],,,"I have a little brother that farted bare-assed into my face 8 years ago.  His asshole puckered and I felt the bubbles of stench roll around my nose and fumigate my sinuses.  It was the worst way I've ever woken up.  Since that day, I've vowed to return the shame.

I recently was on reddit looking at ""the worst prank ever"" where you melt butter, poop in a butter tub, pour the melted butter on top, let it coagulate, and then it looks like butter and hides your poop.

I did that.

It took about two weeks for anyone to find out about it.  We were sitting at dinner and it started to smell a little.  The butter had been left out for a few hours and had started to get soft, which for whatever reason was allowing the smell of the poop to be revealed.  I tried to put it back in the fridge in my embarrassment because I realized how fucked up a prank it was, and how my family was all eating the butter, not just my brother.

I am not a smart man.

My mother is the one that found the poop.  She took a large knife-full out of the tub and the tip of the knife was brown.  Breaking the airtight butter seal of the two week old poop allowed for the most horrid stench I could have imagined.  The poop had been decomposing for a bit.  Nobody knew I did it, because it literally makes no sense.  My mother tried to sue the ""I can't believe it's not butter"" folks until I had to admit I pooped in the butter.

I looked around the table after it was said.  My father stared blankly into the kitchen.  My mother stared at me, a scowl on her face, quickly dropping the knife.  My brother exclaimed ""what the fuck?!"" and quickly left the table.  Nobody yelled at me.  Nobody even looked at me.  They just slowly went outside, the three of them, and got ice cream.  When they were gone, I quickly cleaned up the mess, the table, washed the dishes, and went back into my room.

We need to take the emotional charge out of this debate, if we're going to come up with a resolution to this problem. 

What everyone seems to agree on is the need for emergency mental health care for people in trouble, finances aside. We do a piss poor job of looking out for the communities we live in. A school gets shot up and we start screaming about inanimate objects as if they have agency and will of their own. And we do this every time, never talking about why these incidents have skyrocketed in recent years despite more gun control laws being passed. We talk about why this particular person snapped, examining what video games they played, how screwed up their mother was but never how we could have helped them walk away from their path of destruction. We never talk about how we can help a person who's having a mental breakdown, who is broken enough to pull a weapon on children and kill them. How we could have healed a broken mind before someone died. No, we'd rather repeat a screaming argument that is now decades old. And then act shocked when it happens again.

I'm 5'11"" and 350 lbs.  Admittedly, I know next to nothing when it comes to male fashion.  My work accepts that I wear a tshirt/polo and jeans with sneakers.  I'm not graded on my appearance but my ability to do my work.

That being said, I've been reading MFA more and more lately.  I've been trying to make an effort to dress myself better.  My wardrobe consists mainly of dark jeans, polos, and some OTR button downs from places like Mens Warehouse or Casual Male.  The button downs I do have, tend to be a bit baggy on me.  I have what you may refer to as body image issues.  I buy clothes a little bigger than I should, and that just makes me look worse.

There isn't a lot of content geared towards the bigger men of this world.  And you're exactly right.  Most of the posts that come from bigger guys are usually met with comments about hitting /r/fitness, /r/keto, or /r/loseit just to name a few.

Listen, MFA.

People come here for fashion advice.  Not to be told how to lose weight.  I know those sub-reddits exist and if its something I wanted to utilize, I know how to get there.  Instead, I'm here in MFA.  Reading up on what I can and for the most part, not asking many questions.  The last one I asked wasn't well received (and for good reason.  They were terrible shoes, which are now in the trash).  If I ultimately decide to post something I'm wearing I almost expect to be met with comments about hitting the gym.  I've only been reading MFA for a couple weeks now, and I am trying to put some decent stuff together.  Its not easy given the expense of having to buy basically a new wardrobe and right around the christmas season.  However, when I'm good and ready, I'll post something, and I hope for the sake of this subreddit not coming across as a bunch of elitist cunts, that its not met with high criticism about my weight and that I should be hitting the gym.

About the same time, I realized that it was suddenly going away from me - and there I was, running at about 300 miles per hour. I tracked it for a little way, and then all of a sudden the damn thing just took off. It pulled about a 45 degree climbing turn and accelerated and just flat disappeared.""

&gt;""It followed us during half of our orbit. We observed it on the light side, and when we entered the shadow side, it disappeared completely. It was an engineered structure, made from some type of metal, approximately 40 meters long with inner hulls. The object was narrow here and wider here, and inside there were openings. Some places had projections like small wings. The object stayed very close to us. We photographed it, and our photos showed it to be 23 to 28 meters away.

&gt;[...] Many cosmonauts have seen phenomena which are far beyond the experiences of earthmen. For ten years I never spoke on such things. [...] It only flew straight, but then a kind of explosion happened, very beautiful to watch, of golden light. This was the first part. Then, one or two seconds later, a second explosion followed somewhere else and two spheres appeared, golden and very beautiful.

&gt;""The evidence that there are objects which have been seen in our atmosphere, and even on terra firma, that cannot be accounted for either as man-made objects or as any physical force or effect known to our scientists, seems to me to be overwhelming. A very large number of sightings have been vouched for by persons whose credentials seem to me unimpeachable.

&gt;It is striking that so many have been trained observers, such as police officers and airline or military pilots.

&gt;The Director noted on the referenced memorandum, ""I would do it but before agreeing to it we must insist upon full access to discs recovered. For instance in the La. {Los Alamos...?} case the Army grabbed it and would not let us have it for cursory examination""

True,myparentsarerussian,,,"&gt;Am I overreacting, or is there a genuine cause for concern here?

Are you kidding? Let me give you a healthy dose of ""wake-the-fuck-up.""

Firstly, your boyfriend is **not in any way, shape or form over his ex.** Secondly, he is a fucking pathetic, cowardly excuse for a human being. He isn't even *trying* to cover up the fact that he's not over his ex. He talks about her, talks to her, checks up on her, gives her money, and **LOOKS AT NAKED PICTURES OF HER.** I don't know why he's even with you. 

Wait, actually I do know why he's with you. Brace yourself for this. You are as much of a loser as he is. You seem to have absolutely no self esteem! I was in serious disbelief the whole time I was reading this, that someone would actually put up with this for more than a second, let alone **2 YEARS!** 

&gt;All I want is the truth, and I don't feel as if I've got it yet.

Really? No, really? You don't feel like you're clear on what's going on here quite yet? He is absolutely obsessed with this girl. He is **not** over her, and he clearly will not be over her any time soon. He is using you as a rebound, backup, on-call girlfriend. If this girl even so much as *hinted* at wanting to give their relationship another try, he would drop you in half a fucking heartbeat. 

&gt;He even used to accidentally call me her name quite regularly, something which became very annoying after about a year.

I don't even have the words to talk about this right now. I just want you to read it back to yourself and really let it sink in. Just... let it sink in for a minute. 

Now, listen to me. You are a human being. You deserve to be treated with common fucking decency. Something this guy hasn't given you the tiniest shred of. Because I cannot find a single logical reason why you'd (still) be with him at this point, or why he would be with you, for that matter; I'm at a bit of a loss for words or advice. But hear me this. Your boyfriend is a coward. He is with you because he doesn't have the balls to break up with you in love, and figure his pathetic little obsession out. He is with you because this other girl dumped him and he needed validation. He is with you, **because you are still with him.** You do not need to ""talk to him one more time."" He doesn't deserve a second chance. If you have *any* amount of respect for yourself, you will walk away from this relationship immediately. This is clearly beyond fixing, or working it out. I realize I will be downvoted for the harshness of this comment. But I will not take it down, because if even for a second it causes you to open your fucking eyes and see the harsh reality of this situation, it will be worth every precious internet point I lose. Please for the love of God, respect yourself enough to walk away. Love yourself enough to leave him. Realize that you are worth more than that. Because you are setting yourself up for the biggest fall of your life. You are setting yourself up to be slowly deprived of every last bit of self-worth you ever had. It makes me so sad to read this post, written in a rational tone. It makes me sad to see all the excuses you've given him for this absolutely horrid behavior. It makes me sick to my stomach to think that there is a beautiful woman out there dealing with a piece of shit of like him, thinking she can't do any better. Thinking that he has some sort of a right to treat a woman like this. Calling her the wrong name. Comparing her to someone else. Making her feel inferior and insecure. He makes me sick. And he should make you sick too.

  Opening track is Dark Fantasy. There's a choral emphasis (think chorus in Greek tragedy). Opening lyrics (skipping a couple lines):
&gt;The watered down one, the one you know

&gt;Was made up centuries ago

&gt;It may just sound all whack and corny

&gt;Yes, it's awful, blasted boring

&gt;Twisted fiction, sick addiction

&gt;Well, gather 'round, children, zip it, listen

From this, we get a little background. We're going to hear a story, a story that's very old. This is also a direct appeal to the stories audience: take your seat, grab some popcorn, and watch the show. Kind of analogous to muse invocation. From here we get chorus:

&gt;Can we get much higher? So high

Our story is about someone at their peak (or very near a peak to be achieved sometime during the story's telling). The rest of the song is Kanye giving us a little pseudo-autobiographical stuff, to set the stage. But there is this line:

&gt;Hey, teacher, teacher, tell me how do you respond to students

&gt;And refresh the page and restart the memory?

&gt;Respark the soul and rebuild the energy?

This hints at future transformation, a renewal as it were. Our character is at his peak (not really sure how to define that, but I suppose it is an artistic peak), but something is missing. The story is about finding that missing bit.

This is already very long and I'm bad at formatting. I'll split this up into separate posts. Tackling up through All of the Lights next.

True,Eldilia,,,"Hokay, so next up is Gorgeous. This is my least favorite song on the album, which is to say I still listen to it an inordinate amount. This, along with Power, form the ""Look at my Big, Swinging Balls"" portion of the album. In the last track, it's fleshed out a little that Kanye's character (I'll call him Fantasy, since he really should be distinct from Kanye the person) is someone at their peak. These songs really hammer that home. I don't want to spend to much time on Gorgeous, since he really is spending the whole album explaining why he's the best (being the top dog in hip hop at a time when hip hop is king).

&gt;Choke a ""South Park"" writer with a fish dick

He's placed himself on Mount Olympus. A bit telling, no? Plus, Fantasy recognizes the fame is reaching absurdity, with the acknowledgment of South Park's (pretty amazing) parody episode. But while recognizing, he dismisses. That's the thing that needs to change in our story.

  There's a slight racial subtext with this bit:

&gt;And what's black beatle anyway? A fuckin' roach

Not quite sure what to make of it. Maybe just commenting on how race may play a role in his ascent compared to other pop stars (i.e. The Beatles).

True,Eldilia,,,"Power is more ""Look at my Big, Swinging Balls"". Really important song, the arrogance comes across hard here. Note there's a really heavy choral emphasis again, lot's of bragging, but bragging that's backed up. He really is the best there is (I'm speaking of both Kanye and Fantasy). Not much to say, as the song's pretty straightforward, and everyone's seen the Lebron clip when the Heat won. It's a song about dominance. 

Things get interesting at the end, with this bit:

&gt;This'll be a beautiful death

&gt;I'm jumpin' out the window

&gt;I'm lettin' everything go

&gt;I'm lettin' everything go

That's a pretty big thematic break. Suggests problems. Same problems that'll get hashed out later. 

All of the Lights (Interlude) and All of the Lights are crucial. In the interlude, you really need to pay attention to the melody. It shows up again repeatedly throughout the rest of the album. My idea is simple: we're supposed to associate the melody with a person, the person in the album analogous to the Phoenix in the music video. It's the catalyst that leads to Fantasy's reevaluation, and I suppose descent.

All of the Lights (Proper), is essentially a love song. It's a weird love song, insomuch as it involves Fantasy recounting all the problems bubbling under the surface he presents, and the only explicit overture to another individual is a willingness to have sex with the lights on. Trust me, though. Fantasy admitting he has problems to someone else, and having sex with the lights on, is true nakedness. He is completely exposing himself to another person, and he's doing it because he cares about them in a new way. Not going to go through the lyrics here, but if you read I think it confirms what I wrote.

They had failed the country. The country she held so dear to her heart. For Elizabeth was not merely the queen of this one realm. But the government of this, her home nation had disappointed her so. It was time for a change she thought.

She licked her lips, and took a deep nasal breath, remembering the day when she last smelled the blood of her victims. So long ago in Zimbabwe. Her second breath brought a different memory though. What was that odour? Gunpowder? No, more subtle that that. Liquorice? Nearly... Elizabeth surveyed the room, slowly taking in the mental panoramic of the glorious dead, then there it was. The lone survivor.

""Fear."" Elizabeth mouthed. That was the smell. The lone politician cowered. Hiding behind the bodies of so many fallen. he sobbed slightly. Elizabeth was not amused. ""Arise, whelp."" the monarch said. ""Is this how you wish to die? Clutching the bloated corpse of Kenneth Clarke? Arise, and accept your fate.""

The politician pushed the body aside and slowly stood up. Still sobbing. She had not seen sobbing like this since Charles announced his divorce. A young, clean faced man stood before her. Awaiting his fate. ""What is your name?"" Elizabeth hissed. 

""Clegg ma'am. Nick Clegg""

""So, Nicholas. Did you really think you could escape? Are you not aware who I am? Are you not aware of my power? I, Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of your God, of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas, Queen, Defender of the Faith! Did YOU believe you could escape ME?"" Clegg fell to his knees. His fearful sobbing turned to pathetic begging for his life.

""Mercy!"" He pleaded

""NO."" Stated the monarch. ""Your words are nothing to me. I will show you my Mercy."" She lifted her sword high. The small square blade slowly extending in the dim Downing Street lights, as if by a darker power. The stub became a blade. The blade became an edge, then she struck the blow.

Cleggs head slumped from his neck. Blood sprayed across the room. Elizabeth could literally taste Cleggs life draining from his useless flesh. She sheathed the Sword of Mercy. Lifted the head of the final politician and headed for the door.  

Hordes of people were in Downing Street. Cameras, reporters, from every possible news outlet. The Queen held the head of Clegg aloft, triumphantly.

True,Eldilia,,,"Almost more fun than the All of the Lights-&gt;Monster transition is the Monster-&gt;So Appalled transition. However, I'm listening while I write, so I missed an important bit on Monster. Song ends with these lines, delivered by the always introspective Bon Iver:
&gt;I-I crossed the line-line

&gt;and I’ll-I’ll let God decide-cide

&gt;I-I wouldn’t last these shows

&gt;so I-I am headed home

This comes across as almost contrite. Fantasy sees the monster, and is trying to come to terms. What is the reaction? Dare I say, Fantasy is ""So Appalled""? One of my favorite tracks, in no small part because Jay-Z's verse here is miles ahead of his verse in Monster. The most important bit here is the chorus (not really a Greek-chorus emphasis in this one, unfortunately):

&gt;Champagne wishes, thirty white bitches

&gt;I mean this shit is fucking ridiculous

&gt;Five star dishes, different exotic fishes

&gt;Man this shit is fucking ridiculous

So now we have an open acknowledgement of the absurdity that is Fantasy's life, and one that is not so dismissive as earlier (think South Park). It's a self-examination that, unlike Monster (which embraced), seeks to rectify the problems Fantasy discovers. It's not met without resistance, as we see in Jay's verse which is double-plus great and posted in full because of how important it becomes:

&gt;How should I begin this? I'm just so offended

&gt;How am I even mentioned by all these fucking beginners?

&gt;I'm so appalled, I might buy the mall

&gt;Just to show niggas how much more I have in store

&gt;I'm fresher than you all, so I don't have to pause

&gt;All of y'all can suck my balls through my drawers

&gt;Dark Knight feeling, die and be a hero

&gt;Or live long enough to see yourself become a villain

&gt;I went from the favorite to the most hated

&gt;But would you rather be underpaid or overrated?

&gt;Moral victories is for minor league coaches

&gt;And 'Ye already told you we major, you cockroaches

&gt;Show me where the boats is, Ferrari Testarossas

&gt;And Hammer went broke so you know I'm more focused

&gt;I lost 30 mil, so I spent another 30

&gt;Cause unlike Hammer, thirty million can't hurt me

&gt;Fucking insane, the fuck am I saying?

&gt;Not only am I fly, I'm fucking not playing

&gt;All these little bitches too big for they britches

&gt;Burning they little bridges, fucking ridiculous

Jay spends the whole verse bragging, and rejecting the moral objections to his (and implied Fantasy's) life. I mean, hell, he even adopts the Batman ""live long enough to see yourself become the villain"" mantra. Also, ""Moral victories is for minor league coaches"" should be the name of every album he makes for the rest of his life. But he ends recognizing the absurdity!!! This is key. He says ""Fucking insane, the fuck am I saying?"", before finishing on the absurdity of smaller rappers being like him. But everything before is now rendered gibberish, stuff he just says because he can, not because it has any real meaning. This is no way for Fantasy to live. It's the change that needs to happen.

True,anchises868,,,"Like zaery said, the purpose of a histogram is to show the distribution of data, and that requires that the bins (the range of data each bar describes) to be the same size. Improperly sized bins (and there are algorithms to size them that it's beyond the scope of this lowly comment to go into) create ""binning artifacts"" that distort the distribution of the data.

However, I understand that you want to point out the spikes at $0 and the median of $5. A properly formatted histogram would blend those spikes into the overall distribution, depending on the size of the bins (obviously larger bins more so than smaller bins). A simple plot of price paid vs. percentage shipped at that price would show the overall distribution and still show the spikes. However, that would create an overly complicated image compared to the rest of your design. The best bet would be a histogram with relatively small bins, but again that's a design issue.

True,Eldilia,,,"These are getting long, so I skipped a lot of So Appalled, but I think needless to say much more can be written. Devil in a New Dress is the next track and it should really be listened to in the context of All of the Lights. Song opens with hook:

&gt;Put your hands to the constellations

&gt;The way you look should be a sin, you my sensation

&gt;I know I’m preaching to the congregation

&gt;We love Jesus but you done learned a lot from Satan

&gt;I mean a nigga did a lot of waiting

&gt;We ain't married but tonight I need some consummation

So sex under the stars, one of many potential lights. The song is incredibly intimate, whatever the vulgarity that I know detracts from the experience for some. This is difficult to interpret though. I initially thought it was reconciliation with Phoenix, which it could be. But I almost suspect it's Fantasy doing what hurt and confused people do: returning to someone familiar, who he's been with before. Like I said, not sure, but it helps explain the next couple tracks where he is more actively seeking reconciliation. And lines such as:

&gt;You see I always loved that sense of humor

&gt;But tonight you should have seen how quiet the room was

which implies he is familiar with this person (whereas the melody in interlude made me suspect Phoenix was someone new). Of course, this muddies everything. I'm not sure if stuff like:

&gt;Text message break ups, the casualty of tour

&gt;How she gon' wake up and not love me no more?

&gt;I thought I was the asshole, I guess it’s rubbing off

refers to Phoenix or our new character, although I suspect the later. In either event, it's a reconciliation. Fantasy is reaching out to someone, to deal with something he's discovered. My money is on someone in his past, but it could be Phoenix. Another alternative, the whole song is reminiscing about a past relationship, that marked a time where Fantasy was more stable. This is definitely the most difficult song to work through.

So he does what monsters do. He hurts people. He can't control it. All he can do is tell them to get away from him. He has no one to love because he chases them away, and he chases them away because he knows he will always be the worst thing in their life.

True,la_pluie,,,"My boyfriend and I spent NYE at Disneyland Paris last year.. We arrived in the morning and left around nightfall so we could be at the Eiffel Tower for the midnight countdown. In retrospect, we should have stayed at Disneyland for more of a proper celebration. The Eiffel Tower was anticlimactic - no countdown, no fireworks, just a bunch of drunk people all celebrating at different times.

Disregard what dk58 said.. I'm such a proponent of Disneyland that I must insist that spending the day at the park CAN be romantic.. With a little bit of preparation :) 

I had gone to Disneyland Paris 3 other times that year and New Year's Eve was the least crowded day. Usually the park is filled with tour groups but that day it was just families and couples. You will need as much energy to last until midnight so you should sleep in that morning, have lunch at home or nearby, and arrive around 12 PM. If you're getting a park hopper pass, start off with Studio Park first because there's really only a handful of fun rides, so you might as well get them out of the way 

Between 3-4 is a good time to head over to Disneyland Park. Last year when I was there, they had a live band performance at the Hyperion Auditorium around that time. It was really relaxing to grab a hot snack (burgers are the fare there) and just listen to Christmas music.

An important tip is that as the evening stretches on, less and less people start to go on rides. (The kids start getting cranky while the parents begin to drop like flies). By 7-8PM, most lines aren't more than half an hour. Around 10, you can basically walk straight to the front.

However, by 11 you and your girlfriend should scout out a good place for fireworks viewing - if you can - get to the front of the castle! BRING A BIG THICK BLANKET! You two will be waiting outside in the cold for a while so this will be make your experience all the more pleasant (.. snuggling!). If you don't want to lug it around, just rent a locker in the beginning. It might be a bit expensive, but it's a worthy investment. And on that note... 4 of the 6 times I have gone to Disneyland Paris - it has rained (and these were all at different months). Bring an umbrella, wear rain boots or thick shoes, bring extra socks (waiting in lines all day in rain will have that effect), and a nice waterproof or well-insulated coat.

Finally.. I noticed last year that the Blue Bayou (restaurant in Pirate's of the Caribbean) offered a special NYE dinner. I don't remember the price but it was definitely over 50 euros per person. You need to reserve ahead of time though.

True,Eldilia,,,"Hell of a Life is a glimpse into old Fantasy. Ball-Swinging fantasy. It's almost a relapse. Throwing himself at the world, watching as the world around him throws back. Not much here for me personally, but could be read as a memory or a relapse. This bit is fun though:

&gt;La Renta, they wouldn’t rent her they couldn’t take the shame

&gt;Snatched the dress off her back and told her, “Get away”

&gt;How could you say they live they life wrong?

&gt;When you never fuck with the lights on

This line is what lead me to read so much into All of the Lights. In the logic of the album, fucking with the lights on is an act of intimacy, a literal and complete exposure of the self to all externalities. When he berates someone for not doing so, he's really berating them for being fake. So we should look at All of the Lights with new meaning.

True,Eldilia,,,"Running out of steam, but Blame Game is the real apology. It's an apology with caveats, and internal struggle, but it's definitely an apology. Take this:

&gt;On a bathroom wall I wrote

&gt;I'd rather argue with you than to be with someone else

&gt;I took a piss and dismiss it, like fuck it

&gt;And I went and found somebody else

&gt;Yo, I'd rather be by my fucking self

&gt;'TIl about two am and I call back and I hang up

&gt;And I start to blame myself, somebody help

Fantasy found someone in Phoenix, and they fell out. He realizes he was the problem (in part). He's trying to explain what happened, and in so doing ask forgiveness. The most interesting bit is the internal dialogue Fantasy has, which Kanye simulates with a voice modulator between two sides of his personality:

&gt;And you ain't fixin' to see a mogul get emotional

&gt;Every time I hear about other nigga's stroking you

&gt;Lie and say I hit you, he sitting there consoling you

&gt;Running my name through the mud, who's provoking you?

&gt;Now you noticeable and can't nobody get control of you

&gt;1 a.m. and can't nobody get a hold of you

&gt;I'm calling your brother's phone, like what was I supposed to do?

There's some real anger, and struggle here. It's not clear if the anger is justified, although I guess some of it is. But what is certainly clear, is that whatever was there is gone. As Fantasy says:

&gt;Disguising ourselves as secret lovers

&gt;We've become public enemies

&gt;We walk away like strangers in the street

&gt;Gone for eternity, we erased one another

True,Eldilia,,,"Lost in the World/Who Will Survive in America is our postscript. The world goes on. Fantasy's around, but humbled. He saw who he is, he saw what he could have had with Phoenix, and he's irrevocably lost it. That's the tragedy. He lives with that now, and he can't go back. Lost in the World lets us know this, but that the story continues even as the album ends. He still lives and learns and hopefully gets better. Not gonna reference this one, just listen to the song.

After reading, Greek tragedy explicitly is probably a stretch. But a clear tragic arc is there, and there is definitely an interesting interplay between choral and pure instrumental, of exposition and introspection. It helps that Lost in the World is completely choral, and that Who will Survive in America abandons Fantasy's voice completely for our narrator, who tells us the world is as it always was. And it's a damn good ending.

True,Agent00funk,,,"Well, by keeping SK secure we are also keeping ourselves secure. 

As yep45 pointed out, if American military hegemony would diminish, you would see the rise of regional actors. These regional actors usually don't see eye-to-eye with us. Take Asia for example, if America left, China would likely become the dominating regional power. Forget the hate we get from there now, the hate that would be leveled at China would make Psy's anti-American comments seem quaint. Not only would many countries in Asia suddenly find themselves feeling less secure, but China would have enough power to rival America.

There are different school of thought on the topic, but in simple terms you have two camps. One camp says that international stability necessitates a uni-polar global state (not as in one world government, but as in one state that has global hegemony), while the other camp says that a multi-polar global state ensures regional stability, which they see as the foundation for global stability. Put another way, one camp says we need a giant to protect the village, and the others says if all the villagers have equal(ish) power, then we don't need that giant. Both camps make valid points, and both camps can point to various times in history where their philosophy makes perfect sense. 

But consider WW1 and WW2. Both of these wars occurred during multi-polar global states and were pretty much terrible for everyone involved, however, in times of unipolarity, there are less casualties of war (there is debate about this, but the debate is about who is considered a causality of war). People, and states, will always seek power, and in times where the power is multipolar you will get arms races, this is especially true in bi-polar situations (US/USSR Cold War for example). Whenever your neighbor gets powerful, you will try to match it, which continues the cycle. Have you ever played Risk? You know how sometimes there will be border wars...there will be an unspoken truce where two players won't attack each other, but will still build up armies on their border *just in case*. Eventually, those armies will fight, and the very act of them being there causes as much instability as it does stability. But, if there is one single hegemonic power whose capabilities are so far in excess of anyone else, then catching up to that hegemon is impractical, and any attempt at doing so could be seen as aggressive. 

Its tough to say if the world would benefit from a multi-polar power structure as opposed to the unipolar structure we have now. Although frankly, I believe that if American hegemony were to diminish it could be bad not just for America, but the whole world. Love it or hate it, the American military is performing a global service (the degree to which this is warranted is debatable), and that global service keeps America safe. 

Now, is it America's duty to do so? That is debatable. Certainly keeping countries like China and Iran pushed into a corner is infinitely better for America than letting those countries get control of a region, especially if that region contains American allies. But maybe it would also bring about some positive change. If Iran controlled the ME, then maybe that would spur America, and the rest of the world, to get off oil faster. If China controlled Asia, there might be a move to stop giving them all our business and actually rein in our debt owed to them. 

In most cases, having American hegemony is a win-win for client nations, while its a win-win-win for America. Take Europe for example. The American military presence means that Europeans can underfund their military since America is essentially picking up the slack. Europe stays safe, and doesn't pay much for that luxury. America meanwhile also benefits, although in a less concrete way than our European citizenry counterparts. America pays a tremendous amount of money, but in exchange they get political leverage, strategic location, and a guarantee of safety for doing business in this region. If we pull out of Europe, and lets say Russia steps in to fill the void (somebody would fill the void), now we lose leverage in Europe, business becomes more troublesome, and we would have to rely on the Russians for a guarantee of safety.

American hegemony benefits almost everyone because American hegemony means the Chinese don't have to worry about keeping the Strait of Hormuz open, the US navy does that, it means Taiwan doesn't have to worry about a Chinese invasion, it means other countries need not invest in regional stability (at the cost of not being able to expand regionally) because America is already doing that. If American military hegemony dropped off, you would see a meteoric rise in military expenditures from regional powerhouses like China, Russia, Brazil, and South Africa. Similarly, if merely the confidence in American hegemony diminished, you would see regional actors testing our response and strengths. Would that be good for America? No. And with all the hate we have generated over generations we would also be less safe. Although it is a bit of a vicious cycle in that we generate hate by keeping ourselves safe. 

Again, you could make the debate that a multi-polar state would be safer for everyone because everyone has some semblance of power, but I disagree, I believe the more people you have in a room, the more likely there will be a fist fight, especially when no two people in that room share a common culture. Do I think America should be the hegemon? No. America clearly pays an extreme cost (*EDIT*: smeaglelovesmaster correctly pointed out that this includes hidden costs like under investment in American healthcare and infrastructre) and reaps only tangential rewards. But the United Nations is too ineffective and prone to doing stupid stuff (although the same could easily be said about America). Ultimately though, I believe that the task of maintaining international stability should be an international effort, but as long as nations have standing armies, that will never happen. 

As it is right now, it is in American interests to remain the hegemon because it allows American policy to be executed at a grander scale...of course this is precisely the reason why other nations will blast American hegemony. America's hegemonic powers have made the world a more peaceful place...there hasn't been a third world war after all. As a matter of fact, I would wager that WW3 would kick off precisely as American military hegemony begins to wane. There is a lot of pent-up regional aggression that is just waiting to come out, but as long as America can interrupt any would-be invasions, they'll never be attempted. 

So in all, its my opinion that American military hegemony is a necessary evil. It is what allows American interests to be carried out abroad, and it gives great confidence to private businesses if they know the American military is keeping the region safe. After all, say what you will about the atrocities committed by the American military, they have made the world much safer than it was 100 years ago. Would the world have been safe if both America and Russia had been equals through today? I don't know, but I would be willing to say no. What if every continent had a hegemonic power? Again I don't know, but I do believe things would have been less peaceful and less beneficial to America.  

It is a tough question, but I do believe that the world is a safer place with only one hegemon rather than a few hegemons (like it was before American hegemony). But is it America's place to be that hegemon? That is debatable. I don't trust that the job America's military does could be performed as effectively by an international coalition, but I also don't like that we as Americans have such a massive military expenditure. So what to do? I don't know. America shouldn't be the only player in international stability (although, from a policy perspective I understand why we would want to be), but I am distrustful of how stable things would remain if we ceded power to countries like China and Russia, or even France and Israel for that matter. I don't trust other militaries to do a good job compared to America mostly because the American military has decades of experience, has infrastructure in place, and is highly advanced. We paid all this money to have the best military on Earth, and we use that military to keep others out of power (and us in power), which in turn creates international stability strong enough for there to be a McDonalds almost everywhere. Is it good? Is it right? That depends on who you ask, but I for one would much rather see American hegemony that at least advocates for democracy and human rights (hypocritically in some cases), than say global hegemony by the Chinese or Russians who laugh at ideas like democracy and human rights. Is it worth the price? I don't know, but I do believe we would see more global conflicts without the giant guarding the village.

**EDIT:**What incredibly great responses I am getting from you. I'm glad that the student loans I took out to pay for a degree in International Relations are finally paying off, and in the form of (Reddit) gold nonetheless! Big thanks to grinr for my first Reddit Gold! Also thank you to two others (I'm sorry I don't know who you are) who sent me additional gold. Never thought this comment would get this much attention--I would have given it more forethought had I known it would get this big. Also, I would also just like to quickly make a note since I am getting a lot of comments about this. This comment is explaining American military hegemony through a Realist's prism, I am not advocating for American military expansionism. It is hard to discuss American military hegemony without coming across as jingoistic, and if you believe this comment is jingoistic, I apologize, that was never my intention--I'm just trying to explain my view, not advocate a course of action.

True,hiddenlakes,,,"I have been in your same situation before, more than once. This is my advice/Zombieland-style checklist.

You are about to enter a battleground. Upon successful completion of your assignment, you will have reassured his parents that you are not a threat to them, and *you* will be assured a continued place to live. To achieve this goal you must put aside your everyday self and tap into something new - a being capable of infinite patience and control, someone who is totally unfazed by her surroundings. You have to become a master of disguise, hiding your true feelings and allowing these people to think you are one of them. You didn't ask for it to be this way, but it has to be done. 

First thing you do is tell them you're recovering from the flu. This is majorly important. It will explain a) frequent trips to the bathroom to cry/rage into a towel, b) red and puffy eyes, c) any reluctance to enter any conversation [explained away as fatigue or sore throat], d) early bedtimes in case you need to escape, and best of all, it will instantly put them in a position to feel bad for you and not expect too much from your company. Good hosts don't pick on a sick guest.

When they start up with the bullshit, and they will, that is like the ""ding ding"" that signals round 1. Your goal is to document them, David Attenborough-like, and remove yourself from the emotional landscape they inhabit. The earth of which they speak is not your earth, where empathy and compassion are of some measurable importance. Remember that.

As they push, and push, and push, you must steel yourself to fake it harder than you've ever faked it. Make laughter your secret code for ""fuck you"" and every acquiescing smile your way of saying ""I'd rather not be here."" Get really into the part. Go for the I'm Dealing With This Oscar. 

If you can't manage Meryl Streep, go for Keanu and just rock the blank expression for a while. 

Warn your SO beforehand that you plan to grin and bear it. If he's a good partner he'll support you in making it as easy as possible. Try to occupy yourself with all the ways *his* existence improves on his family tree. Don't look to him to stand up to his parents, don't feel betrayed if he doesn't. In my experience, kids of shitlords (and I am one myself) are constantly playing a very sick, very painful game with their families. He's at their mercy same as you. 

Stay out of political conversation at all costs. Warm up with a bunch of neutral topics - even things you may disagree on - that no one will be too emotionally invested in. Be super prepared to pull them out. THAT SLUR YOU JUST USED REMINDS ME OF THIS ONE TIME I WENT CANOEING...what do you think of canoeing, Mr. Shitlord? Mrs. Shitlord?

Find out what they want to hear from you, specifically. In a case like mine, it was humility. They interpreted my liberal leanings as a young person thinking she knows everything, so I made sure to be very obvious about my tendency to learn from/admit my mistakes, acknowledge their superior age and experience, and show them I respected their intellect. Whether or not I did, they got what they wanted, and were satisfied that I was not a threat.

Find common ground in familiar entertainment. A discussion of Alfred Hitchcock films can give you enough material for an entire evening. Anticipate which issues are hot-button issues for his parents, and avoid any movies that may have thematic references to them. 

Be unfailingly positive and cheerful, even if you're pretending to be ill. This is the hardest part, and may require frequent trips to the bathroom to meditate and/or take a swig from a covert flask. Just do not let them see you crack, or *you* will be the one who created the bad time. 

Bring a gift. Bring TWO gifts. If you can, make one of the gifts candied pecans. Oven to 300 F, mix 2 egg whites with a cup of white and brown sugar and a tablespoon of cinnamon, mix in pecans, bake for 13 minutes, wrap in saran wrap and a ribbon, BOOM. Delicious. Everyone loves that shit. (Except probably people with nut allergies.)

Remind yourself that everyone has to do stuff like this to survive, and it doesn't make you a bad feminist to tune out a holiday's worth of bigotry if it means you and your SO can keep your living situation.

The only thing you can do about your nerves is remind yourself that it probably won't be as bad as you're imagining, and in any case, you're going to be prepared and you'll have your SO with you.",0,1355782869,,0,False,1,c7i5zzw,t3_150byo,t1_c7i5zzw,t3_150byo,,1430701159,38,False,SRSWomen,t5_2tdoc,38

True,littlegreenalien,,,"I noticed that issue with my late 2008 macbook pro. It actually never became a real issue except with USD devices who worked very closely to the maximum power capacity. In the perfect world, each port should have its own USB controller and you wouldn't encounter that problem. However, especially in laptops, it's not uncommon for controllers being shared. This isn't only an apple thing.. I've seen it happen on many PC's as well (well basically on most of them.). You could easily have 1 controller working several ports (that's a hub) and no one would even notice till you run into power issues or.. well do the following.:

so a quick check reveals this (with the LAcie plugged in in port 1)

        USB bus
            Apple intern keyboard/trackpad

True,Piemonkey,,,"&gt;To take that to its extreme, exaggerating those tropes is how you reveal them. The exaggeration of that trope is what happens in Far Cry 3.

&gt;In one of the game’s trailers, Jason is seen having sex with Citra, a shamanistic princess figure and sister to Vaas. Jason stands triumphantly after he’s finished, and declares to the tribe, “We are the warriors of the Rakyat, and I will lead you to glory!” Yohalem explained the scene as another instance of tropes being intentionally exaggerated. “When you’re with Citra in front of the warriors, that’s Jason’s fantasy, you know the white guy from LA has sex with this beautiful woman, it’s very gratuitous, and it’s in front of the whole tribe. It’s a fantasy that we’ve seen in pop culture cinema.

Now that could actually work, and I must confess that I did see some of the cliched stereotype of white guy suddenly becoming the chosen one and banging the hot tribe priestess leader. But that's where it stopped, and the effort of pushing a trope beyond its limits was left unfulfilled. Why? Because due the way this is presented in the game, it feels like everything is *forced* on Jason. He didn't ask for the tattoos or to join the Rakyat, Dennis just tattood him while he was passed out and basically condemned him to joining the Rakyat since those tattoos bound Jason much like a blue bandanna in the back left pocket makes it so that you can't walk into certain parts of LA. He didn't ask for or want to have sex with Citra, he was drugged and--basically--raped by her. He didn't try to take over the Rakyat or lead the tribe, he just ended up in that position while going after and working to his real goal the entire time: saving his friends. 

And it should be mentioned that sex or romance of any kind isn't even hinted at beforehand. This led the graphic POV sex scene to feel like it came from completely out of left field. To that end, Citra is the only instance of nudity in the entire game. Even the prostitutes and rape victims around the islands are just as clothed as anyone else on the islands. There's nothing wrong with this by itself but when you're trying to make a story with depth and meaning with allegories and allusions, you can't just shove the square blocks into the circular holes you've made and call it done.

&gt;“Why do games treat females this way? Why is there a princess in a castle? Citra doesn’t need to be saved, it’s all Jason’s idea! Jason conjures up this whole idea that Citra needs saving and he’s gonna save her, when in reality it was all a ritual she created to find a sperm donor, and she kills him.”

When was this notion of saving Citra ever presented in the game? She never even experienced so much as a threat of catching a cold, letalone being close to death at any point. She has a huge, powerful tribe of apparently supernatural warriors at her disposal. She's so powerful that the faction that has completely dominated the islands cannot even go near her temple. What the hell hacked version of Mario did Yohalem play? 

In Jason's conversation with his friends at the end of the game, his entire motive for staying is because he believes he has found his calling in life in helping the Rakyat fight off any aggressors. Aggressors that he was never a part of--something that is necessary for the ""Avatar trope"" to work. There's nothing about Citra anywhere.

The only real rumblings of a choice between Jason's friends and the Rakyat are at the very end of the game when you find out they're all kidnapped (again) by Citra. Before this, it was clearly established that Jason planned to stay with the Rakyat and see his friends off. That was it. No alternate inclinations beforehand. The only time to start weighing the pros and cons of either decision come after Citra has kidnapped all your friends, lined them up for sacrifice, and killed off the only person on the entire islands who lives with any sort of good intentions after you've done nothing but cooperate and help her throughout.

Who wouldn't realize that choosing her would end badly? In a story that has had problems with things coming out of nowhere, this was the one time where something was supposed to come out of nowhere and ended up being totally predictable.

&gt;“Sex, violence, and the player is killed. Here are the things that satisfy our animal side as men, but they’re subverted because it’s a female doing it. Here you’re thinking of the princess in the castle. It’s like if Princess Peach stabbed Mario.” Yohalem laughed. “Now that I’m thinking about it, that final scene should have been Citra castrating Jason. Seriously, that’s the point! It is like, ‘You win, motherfucker!’ It’s totally like, ‘Fuck you, you misogynist idiot!’”

She literally had *just* kidnapped all your friends and forced you into killing them--after you spent all your time and effort saving them--and got you to kill dozens of people, and raped you. I really have to question who would choose to side with Citra and graphically slit your girlfriend's throat for her, all in the hopes of living a nice and happy life with her after everything she put you through because they think she's still just a damsel in distress. Better yet, is that really misogyny? That sounds more like a sort of Stockholm Syndrome to me.

&gt;“It’s up to players to decide. If the work is good, if there’s not one interpretation where people can explore what it is, it becomes their narrative. It’s like Alice’s journey: is Alice’s journey a dream or not? That’s what I love about Alice in Wonderland and Through The Looking Glass, that he doesn’t have to say it was all a dream,” Yohalem said. “My goal was to create something that people could analyze. Analysis is fun because there are many interpretations. If there’s just one interpretation then it’s not worth analyzing.”

This just reminds me of those awful X-Factor and American Idol auditions where someone thinks they're just as good as Madonna or the Spice Girls but sing like a cat in a washing machine. The reason why Carroll's work is deep is because everything flows together and interacts with everything else well. That's why it's a literary classic. Far Cry 3 is not close to this at all. Things are hackneyed, shoved in, and never expounded well. I can see what they were trying to do but the execution failed miserably (e.g. at one point late in the game, Jason randomly asks ""How do I know the ground is even real?"" with no apparent reason). 

So in the end, I have to give credit to Yohalem for trying to do something above and beyond phoning in a simple script for a paycheque but he has to understand that his art is not very good, even if he is a competent artist. It's completely unreasonable to blame your audience for not reading your mindset behind the art if you give them absolutely nothing to work with. Did George Orwell just write a story for his daughter that just so happened to correspond perfectly with an allegory for communism and decided to say that was the intent of his work because that interpretation made it sound better than a dark version of Charlotte's Web? No, Animal Farm is full of clear allusions and references presented in a subtle way to tip the audience off that there is more to it than what's on the surface. Far Cry 3 just does not do that.

True,rscott89,,,"I was playing hockey when I was about 15 or 16 years old and I took a shot directly to the nuts. Now I was wearing a cup but during play one of my nuts (the right one) moved outside of the confines of the jock and became wedged between the edge of the cup and my leg, so that when the puck hit my nut it got pinched between the hard plastic and thigh. I went down immediately, my head was spinning and I couldn't catch my breath. I couldn't quite grasp what had happened, I just knew pain was coursing through my body. Sharp pain at first, like being cut by a razor. After a few seconds this pain gave way to a dull throbbing, like my whole body was stuck in a vice grip and being slowly squeezed. The pain radiated out of my testicle with each heart beat and made its way through my stomach and consolidated in my kidneys before continuing and dissipating through the rest of my body.

Anyway one thing they always teach you in hockey is no mater how bad you are hurt try to get to the bench, if you can get to the bench then the play can still go on and your team can still score.

True,Foxbatt,,,"**Best date to shoot:**

Anywhere between Feb 10th - 20th, with a bit of leeway on each side. The weekends are the busiest and good luck getting a lodge room or heated cabin at a reasonable price. I suspect somewhere around the 15th would be best.

**Weather conditions:**

Call off any plans to shoot if its very overcast. Without sun it won't work. The whole effect relies on sun running down the valley and hitting the waterfall - one cloud can screw that up. If its mixed clouds and clear go if you are prepared to gamble. One of the days this year was a let down. We had water flow, the sun was just setting and the falls lighting when NOPE one cloud decided to block everything.

**Location:**

A lot of people use the El Cap Picnic area, also called the Horsetail Falls picnic/parking area. It fills up real fast and gets very crowded. I don't like it at all. You look up at a sharp angle and all the good spots are taken hours in advance. If you don't have a lens that is 200mm or longer you may want to consider this shooting area.

I however prefer the area on the banks of the Merced river, where most of the ""pro"" photos are taken. You need a good long telephoto lens and tripod but the angle is almost flat and the crowds not as bad.

[Location of shooting areas](http://i.imgur.com/a3O4K.jpg)

[Closer shot of river area](http://i.imgur.com/6NM4G.jpg)

This area fills up slower as you have more room to spread out. Parking is a pain as you need to park off of the road or you win a free $100+ fine or towing courtesy of the NPS. Get here early or expect a bit of a walk.

The best shooting area for me was near the bend in the river on the grassy bank. A little closer round the bend at river level is a rocky area of riverbed preferred by a lot of people - you have to get there hours in advance to get a good spot. If you want to really shine and have a good spot get some waders on and shoot mid river (Foxbat is not responsible for any drownings related to this post).

Get a hot drink and chat with the photogs around you to pass the time.

More to come regarding zoom, exposure, lodging etc. Probably later tonight or early tomorrow when I dig stuff up in google.

**Shooting the fall:**

This one is really up to you - I can't tell you how to shoot. I tended to go for around 200-300mm on a full frame to get the shot. Iso set at 100 and a decentish Fstop as I was using a pretty weak lens. I switched between M and P so even if I screwed up badly during manual I had something left. I recommend just shooting in manual or av and seeing how it turns out. You normally get a few minutes of light to play with so experiment.

**What to bring:**

A few things I took or regretted not taking:

* Tripod - take it along, you will most likely be in one spot for quite a while.
* Warm clothes, gloves you can work your camera with - common sense items, I had the former but not the gloves. Big mistake - I chilled my hands working the camera pretty badly as the gloves I had were the thick ski type.
* Flask of coffee/tea/alcohol - oh what I would have given for one or all three.
* Some sort of camera cover - may be worth it if you set up and then spend a long time waiting.
* Some sort of chair or pad to keep your backside off of the cold dirt - why stand around when you can sit around instead.
* If in doubt take it - the walk to your parked vehicle isn't that far.


**Lodging:**

Lots of options, some cheap some not at all cheap:

* Expensive: Yosemite Lodge (nearby and very comfy), Ahwahnee (if you have lots of cash to burn), Curry Village rooms (only weekends, almost fully booked now).
* Medium: Wawona Lodge and hotels - shortish drive, definitely cheaper than the above, well worth the drive if you value creature comforts.
* Budget: Curry Village tent cabins (weekend only, heated are ok, avoid the unheated as they are colder than if you camped in your own compact tent), Upper Pines Campground - I was nice and fine in sub zero (c) temps in a small tent and sleeping bag - a lot warmer than the tent cabins as there was less area to heat.

I'll be staying at the campground this year, the tent cabins are way to cold, Wawona too far and the Lodge too expensive. If anyone wants to split a campsite shoot me a PM.

True,upinflames,,,"From a literary standpoint the Bible is has been very influential. The books of proverbs and psalms contain some of the earliest forms of poetry known to man. And whether or not you are a Christian, much of the writing is quite beautiful. I would also say that the bible is alluded to in works of literature more than any other book in history, so if you have any interest at all in literature than it is of importance. Just read Shakespeare, usually after the first act he has alluded to a biblical story at least once. 

This book contains teachings that have literally changed the face of the earth. Nations have been conquered and dynasties have fallen because of the words written in the Bible. The Gutenberg Bible was the first book ever put into print, and the Bible continues to be the most widely published and distributed book in the world. Learning about history goes much deeper than simply learning dates and names, most historians care deeply about the ideologies that influenced people in different time periods. 

Basically you are asking ""why should I bother to learn about other people's beliefs if I don't share them."" This is a very close minded attitude. Whether you are an atheist, theist, polytheist, agnostic, or whatever you should at least make some effort to understand the beliefs of you peers. If you don't bother to learn even the basic principles of a person's belief system than it is unlikely that they will give you much respect in return for your ignorance.

Although I am an atheist now I grew up Catholic and have read through the Bible several times. I have also read the entire Book of Mormon, the Quran, and many exerts from the Hindu Vedas. Obviously I don't take all of these religious texts as fact, but I have gained a large amount of cultural understanding from them.

True,ZeroFish860,,,"Agent,

I was reading over your essay (Very well written) and I want to add a few things to this. I have a major in Political Science with a minor in International Studies (Just finished a senior thesis on Darfur) and I noticed a few things about your report. I'm going to comment on one paragraph at a time to avoid confusion.

1. Yes and No. In the Asian region, our power there is pretty minimal compared to others. While we are allies with many of the countries there, our biggest military force is actually in Japan. (http://siadapp.dmdc.osd.mil/personnel/MILITARY/history/hst1012.pdf) Now we do have forces in South Korea, but we have mostly left them to hold the 38th Parallel with most of their forces, and a few US soldiers there as ""Advisers."" So in reality, if we were to leave East Asia alone, we would really not be affecting the region much at all. China would not go on a retaliatory emergence of power against us, because we share the same interests, making money (Capitalism baby!)

2. Yes you are correct on the camps. One very valid option which will never be made into an actual practice, is giving the United Nations the military power it needs to enforce the world right now. The United Nations is the ""Camp 2"" where everybody has equal-ish rights (The security council has more, but let's not get too deep into that.) Right now, the UN is almost useless. It's sad for me to say that, but because how they are organized, they are slow to react to any given situation, and are covered in red tape from head to toe. That's because of how their system works. A philosophy that is going around is basically giving the UN military power from all the ""Industrial Nations"" (The term ""more advanced"" states seems to be misleading) and giving the security council less power than it has. The United Nations can't act when the Security Council can't make a decision, look at Darfur. One the primary reasons that the UN has not gone into Darfur is because of China and Russia always refusing to work on the subject. China fears that their main supply of oil will dissipate and worries that if the UN goes into the Sudan, they will go into Tibet next, while Russia fears that the UN will go to Chechnya after Darfur. So the idea of having one global power run the world is a smart idea, but it needs to be done properly. The United States is so small compared to the rest of the world, we can't worry about everybody else. We as a state are still practicing Post WWII military philosophies in an era where that is beyond archaic, and it's biting us in the butt right now. An example of this is actually Afghanistan. In Afghanistan, we used the rebel forces there to fight against Russia during the Cold War. We supplied them with weapons, and gave them advice. After their war with Russia ended, we bailed on them, and created a vacuum of power with either dictators or tribes in control. Obviously that didn't work out well for everybody else in the region, and eventually they all became angry at us for using them in the first place. It's kind of cryptic because I don't want to delve into a 10,000 word essay on it (I will if you want to keep talking though). 

3. American Hegemony has already begun to wane, and the only threats we have right now are North Korea, Pakistan, and a few others in the middle east area. China isn't going to engage us in war, we are actually helping each other right now with this pseudo-capitalist state that they are running over there (Take communism control, throw in some capitalist economic practices, and boom). Israel is a hotspot for discussion, considering that the whole region is pissed off at them for one reason or another.

Let me actually get into Israel because it's one of the key factors of American Hegemony. We have supported Israel after World War II, which actually started out as Jewish sympathy after Hitler killed a few million Jews (http://www.trumanlibrary.org/israel/palestin.htm). This was stupid. Our hearts were in the right spot, but we barged into a territory that had been under Palestinian control for hundreds of years and blatantly said ""Oh by the way guys, this belongs to them now. Have fun."" So obviously this caused issues. Right here we see the folly of American Hegemony, we act without understanding the consequences. That was almost the mantra of American International Relations after World War II. Israel, Korea, Vietnam, the Middle East, we constantly acted without thinking what would happen in the future, and sadly we have paid the price for it multiple times (Please nobody get angry and flame me here. It's just a statement and I mean no disrespect to any individuals who may have died due to our past mistakes.) Now, back to Israel. So we have a State here in which it is contested by two warring factions, who have deep religious hate towards each other (Religious/Historical hatred) and both want the same territory. How do we solve this? Well, during the Egyptian Nasser militaristic expansion issues, we gave Israel food aid and eventually military support. This led to Israel becoming a powerhouse and attacking essentially everybody around them for one reason or another. This made the entire Middle East very angry and they retaliated against Israel. After Six days, the war was over, and Israel was still in turmoil in their own sphere of existence.

I guess my point with all of this is simple: American Hegemony needs to wane. We spent a lot of time after World War II trying to fix the rest of the world (Or really fight communism). The Berlin Wall has fallen, the USSR is dead, and we need to evolve. This Cold-War era of thought is going to be the downfall of the US International Relations. We are a small minority of the planet, 3% actually, what gives us the right to police the world? The UN should have the capability to do this, and not as a ""Big Brother"" kind of deal. No, in fact, the UN should only be used as a force against Acts of Violence against Humanity, and against those countries that wish for only bloodshed and destruction of others.

True,jacksontripper,,,"A week or so ago, a co-worker brought me a crate of records he picked from the attic (on the up and up), with three to follow.

True,thunnus,,,"Cory,

In the course of our lives, we live in two worlds.  Two worlds only.  The first is the world we are born into.  We are at the center of it.  Those who brought us into the world center all of their energy on us.  They pour their loss of sleep into caring for us.  Their money, their future, their dreams.  All become property of ours.  We think we're pretty important in this world.  With good reason.  Everything around us confirms this.  For some of us, Cory, this illusion lasts much longer than it does for others.  

The second world we live (and die) in, is the real one.  It's the world where you have the absolute knowledge that you've seen your parent(s) (or worse yet, children) for the last time.  They're not on vacation.  They're not too busy to answer your calls, send you birthday wishes (or receive them), lend you money, hear your woes, celebrate your accomplishments, or share the simplest pleasure with you.  They are dead.  Dead.  Gone.  

When you cross into that second world, Cory, it will be the most vulnerable you have ever felt in your life.  No skinned knee, rejected application, broken heart, divorce, or - insert life-crushing disappointment of your choice - will compare to it.  No words I can type will ever capture it.  You won't know until you know.  Even if Digital Cory thinks he can imagine it today (and the ""karma whoring"" posts Digital Corey won't make when it happens), Real Cory has no idea what he's talking about.  Real Cory can't know.  Real Cory will know when he he lives it.

True,[deleted],,,"Resident of Topeka, KS here. Let me clarify a few things about the Westboro Baptist Church for everyone, and tell you how you should (and should not) deal with the Westboro Baptist Church. Being from Topeka, I've had lots of experience with them. If they have to travel to Connecticut to protest a bunch of childrens' funerals, that takes time and resources. If they want to picket something in town, it takes about ten minutes of planning and about five members. They picketed my high school graduation. They picketed my neighboring schools' plays, musicals, concerts, ceremonies, football games-- you name it, they were there. They picket any traveling groups, such as artists that come to our convention center or concert halls. I think the most ironic thing I ever heard was them picketing a Gallagher show, even though Gallagher got in trouble a few years back for making extremely homophobic remarks. 

Topeka is a normal American city. Sure, there's a LOT of bad areas, a decently high crime rate, lots of poverty, etc., but I wouldn't say that it is a city of squalor by any means. It is a very conservative, religious city. Lots of churches and things. Strongly Republican. It has a very high respect for the military, as there is an air base on the south side of the city and a very large Army base (Ft. Riley) about 25 minutes west of town. LOTS of kids from Topeka go into the military. Hell, I'm from Topeka and I ship for Army basic in six weeks. 

The Westboro neighborhood (hence the name of the church) is actually really nice. Don't think that just because they're from Kansas that they're out in the country. Westboro is a quiet little neighborhood near some good shopping centers and the historic Gage Park, which is a large, open park in the city. The park also has a really nice (albeit very small) zoo. It is in a middle class area a few blocks from Washburn University, which is a pretty good little college in Topeka. I would raise a family in Westboro (if, you know, I had kids or anything like that). 

The church itself, on the other hand, sticks out like a sore thumb. It looks like a fortress. The complex has ten-foot high walls that run right up to the sidewalk, with only a few entrances through said walls. On each corner of the walls, there are security cameras facing the sidewalk and street (12th street). All you can see over the walls is a flagpole and part of the building. The building has a giant, 3x30 foot banner that just says ""www.godhatesfags.com"". The flag pole has an upside-down American flag and (if memory serves correctly) an upside down rainbow flag. There have been a few times when I was just driving down the street, thinking ""Man, this is a nice neighborhood"", and then here I am, staring at the Westboro Baptist Church.

On more than one occasion, I have seen counter-protests against the church. The most notable was on Memorial Day last year. My friend (who is from California, going to school in Kansas at the time) wanted to see the church, so I agreed to take him. As we were driving by, there were about 50 of the biggest, nastiest, meanest-looking bikers waving giant American flags across the street. We pulled over to talk to them. It was the Patriot Guard (or some similar group) counter-protesting them to celebrate Memorial Day. He was super excited because he comes from a military family. We had a nice chat with them about their protest, but a few minutes after we showed up, they said they had to pack up. I'll explain why later.

The state of Kansas HAS determined that the WBC is abusing its tax-exempt status as a church, and has ordered the back payment on some of their taxes-- specifically, taxes on vehicles used to transport members to protest sites. Here's where the problem lies: The entire Phelps family is PACKED with lawyers... And very, *very* good ones at that.  Say what you want about the WBC, but they are not stupid people. That's why no lawsuit ever sticks to the church. They appeal it, they use their legal resources, and they eventually get everything overturned.

In addition to using the law to their defense, they also use the law to quell opposition. If you can see a WBC member, there's a VERY good chance you are on video. Their members record every protest, because they expect people to pull shit like trying to fight them or vandalize their property. The church gives their members rigorous legal training so that the they 1.) Can protest as long as legally allowed, 2.) Can protect the church's legal liability, and 3.) Can protect the individual members.  Remember how I was talking about the Patriot Guard members having to pack up their protests? That's because (in the state of Kansas) it is illegal to picket a church or other religious facility within two hours of their service. The Guard members said that if they didn't leave by a certain time, church members with cameras would be out there, filming the Guard, and would make every attempt to identify and sue the counter-protesters. 

Church members are extremely stubborn, and have zero qualms about speaking their opinions on the subject. That being said, they still are (somewhat) normal people. Fred Phelps actually used to be a very, very well-respected lawyer. He ran for congress, and even for governor. Fred Phelps was the attorney in some major civil rights cases throughout Kansas during his prime. He actually holds a few commendation awards from groups such as the NAACP. My brother went to Washburn and now works for the Topeka school district. He says he's taken classes with one of the Phelps girls and said she was actually really nice. Of course, he never did bring up the subject of homosexuality with her. Additionally, he has met some of the young church members (i.e. elementary school age) and says they're some of the nicest kids he knows. Basically, they're your normal ""church family""... except their church is fucking nuts. For every ""God hates fags"" sermon they have, I imagine there's also a little bit of ""love thy neighbor"" peppered in there. This means two things: First, you won't get them to stop, because they are so stubborn. They are *absolutely convinced* that they are right, and that they are doing God's work. They also have the backing of, you know, the Constitution... Which they know forwards and backwards. Second, they *are* human beings. Sure, they're shitty human beings, but this is America, son. You can't just go around killing and beating people who annoy you.

In summary, before you make any plans to try to pester them, understand that they WILL sue your ass off if you pull something funny. If you want to stick it to the Westboro Baptist Church, you need to do it by using the law. Hire the BEST lawyers and pay off as many legislators as you can to get laws passed against them. You won't get them to go under-- they WILL NOT give up. You need to use the law to cap their reach. Of course, with great power comes great responsibility-- is it really OK to set the legal precedent that highly offensive free speech shouldn't be allowed? That could lead to a lot worse things if you're not careful. 

And of course, keep supporting groups such as the Patriot Guard. That, or invest heavily in the ""ski masks and billy clubs"" section of the economy. 

TL;DR The Westboro Baptist Church is terrible, but they're not stupid-- they are packed with lawyers, and they record every protest on video. You have to fight them with the law.

True,WiserGuy,,,"You're an industrialist, trying to modernize a backward planet and raise up standards of living through the use of technology, for the common good. One day, some of your industrial robots are blown up by a sentient, supersonic blue hedgehog. That's scary as fuck. Now, said hedgehog has it in his head that you're a monster who's turning animals into robots and wants to take over the world and oppress it, in large part because of all the steroids, speed, colloidal silver, and other assorted shit he's been taking in massive quantities for the past decade. You decide to see if you can't reason with the guy, but for your troubles you get assaulted, and your ride gets trashed beyond recognition.

So you decide to deal with this like you would with any other pest problems: You put out some traps, like spike pits, modify a couple of your robots with .22 rifles, etc. The way you'd deal with any rodent, really. Soon enough, the hedgehog gets himself impaled, and you're done. Or so you think. Soon after, despite having quite clearly been drained of his precious bodily fluids, he's back and trashing your robots again. Maybe the other one was some sort of decoy? No matter, you're taking this into your own hands. You modify your ride, mad max style, adding a couple of guns, some spikes, missile, slowly swinging giant balls, that kind of stuff. Then you roll. You meet the hedgehog and after a brief struggle where he manages to make one or two lucky hits on spots you haven't really bothered armoring, you make him into thin gruel. This time you're sure he's done for.

How wrong you are. Soon after, he's back. You can't believe it. You try to kill him yourself once more, but this time he seems to know where to strike. He seems to know when to strike. He seems to know when you'll strike. Once you realize that, you try to change your attack patterns, but it's too late, he's done enough damage to blow up your vehicle, and you barely escape with your life. For the next few days, he follows you, destroying everything you throw at him, and it's obvious he won't stop until he gets you. You can't sleep. You watch as he destroys everything you've done to help people: one after another, chemical plants, oil refineries, amusement parks, all you've built, gets blown up by this satanic, unholy, immortal demon from the deepest pits of hell. When you do manage to take him out, he's back within hours.

Eventually, as you're trying to escape to the one place where you think you're safe, space, he defeats one of your latest creations, and for the first time, you're face to face with him. There's no steel plate protecting you. There's no vertical distance. He's there, staring at you with those empty, demonic eyes.

You run like you've never run before. **You just fucking run.**

Okay, let's start this off by saying that I am FUMING right now and I am sorry if this is the wrong place to vent. I have been putting up with hateful rape culture promoting stereotypes and rape myths on this site while attempting to only respond politely since I joined. As a survivor of rape, it has just become too much.


I am a rape survivor. I am Jane Doe. I am the girl who withdrew her police report because the emotional trauma and victim blaming was too much for me to handle. 

I was 13. I had never kissed a boy. My best friend was a male and we will call him Jon. We were best friends. I loved him like a brother and always looked to him for advice. Jon was 17, at this time in my life, I had no idea that that kind of age gap between friends might be strange. To be honest, I thought he may be gay and in the closet. We spent every moment we could together. One night, we were watching a movie in his room. This was not an irregular occurrence. He put his arm around me and I let him and snuggled up. It wasn't long later that his other hand started to travel to my breast. I swatted it away and asked what he was doing. He did know that I had just started seeing someone, that I was a virgin and that we were strictly friends. It was at this time that Jon pinned me down on the bed and forced himself on me. I said no, I fought back, but mostly I just hid inside of myself, crying, wishing for it to end. 

When he finally let me go, I went outside, found a payphone and called the police. They questioned what I was wearing, why I would have let myself be in a room alone with him, did I let him touch me at first? Did I like it? I should certainly have known this was going to happen, I'm a large breasted girl who developed early and my top may have been a bit revealing. I went to the hospital where doctors prodded me, looked for signs of bruising and resistance. Later my boyfriend asked me if I had enjoyed it. Did I orgasm? I didn't even know what an orgasm felt like. 

I was questioned so much and doubted so much that I began to doubt myself. Maybe I had asked for it? Had I said no enough? Did a part of me like it? But how could they explain how violently ill I felt just looking at my body in a mirror? How I couldn't get out of bed, how every man that looked at me felt like a violation. 

By the account of the last [comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/150rj0/an_interesting_analogy/c7ib7nm) I was at fault.

This has turned in to a blubbering mess.. I'm posting it anyway, but clearly the subject is still hard to talk about. I am preparing myself for the victim-blaming brigade. I just do not understand how people can play in to these. How, can you believe things that are so hurtful to your mothers, sisters, wives, girlfriends... 


Edit: I would like to thank everyone who has showed me so much kindness. It truly means a lot, especially after reading so many hateful comments before posting which made me feel such sadness. You guys are the reason why I fight evil in this world and why I have centered my life's focus around helping people. Thank you so much. And thank you to whoever gifted me Reddit gold, I truly did not expect this.

To all the women out there who have experienced sexual assault please know that there are resources for you and kindness out there. When you are strong enough, tell your story. Everyday rapists are winning the battle through the silence that they have forced us in to through the systems of hate and rape culture we live in. Tell your story and don't let rape apologists or victim blamers get in your way. I have been in far too many feminist class rooms with uncomfortable silence surrounding the topic of sexual assault, women who even in this environment are ashamed of what has happened to them, are worried they will be judged or considered liars. We can add humanity to these stories, experiences to the ""Rape"" word. We can let these people know that we are their mothers, their sisters and their wives. That this happens to real women and we can shed light against rape myths. Let's turn our pain in to part of the solution.

True,icedtia,,"F/23/5'8"" | SW: 295 | CW: 265 | GW: 199","First of all, I believe in you! You can do this! 

I also realized that I needed to make a change or I wouldn't be able to live the happy and healthy life that I want to live. Something that really motivated me was the thought of having a family some day! I want to live a long life with my husband and future kids. I wanted to have the energy to run and play with them, go on adventures, and not get tired. That thought really keeps me going when I get down.

I've been on Keto for almost 3 months now and I'm telling you now, it gets easier! There are definitely days where I feel weak and just want to go buy a sheet cake, but the weight just falling off is so much more rewarding! At this point, I have so much more energy, I no longer have stomach or indigestion issues, and I generally just feel less ""yucky."" 

My advice? 

Be strict with yourself. You can go on and on telling yourself ""Ah, I'll just have this piece of cake and start tomorrow."" but more than likely, that will just keep happening. It's just perpetuating bad habits and a poor lifestyle choice. My first week on Keto was one of the hardest things I've done.

Really focus on your body and learning when you're actually hungry versus just bored and wanting to snack. That was a huge game changer for me. Now when I get fidgety, I just chew on some gum and/or find something to occupy my hands (games, crafts, painting, etc). Food is fuel! If you had a full tank of gas, you wouldn't keep pumping more into it! Train your mind to think of it as something you need only when necessary.

Savor food and eat slowly! As I'm cooking more and more, I'm really taking pride in the delicious meals I make for my husband and I. It's so rewarding to work hard on something and have it turn out delicious! 

Keep yourself accountable! Track your carbs/calories/fat. Really get a good understanding of how much nutrients are in certain foods and what make good combinations for meeting your daily numbers. Set a daily goal and stick to it! Yes, it will be rough for the first week or two but I PROMISE YOU it gets so so easy!

Get a scale and track your weight. I weigh myself in the morning and in the evening just to monitor my body and how it's fluctuating. I always weigh less in the morning. I only record weight loss if I see that number on the scale two days in a row. Seeing that number drop each day is honestly one of the best feelings ever.

Don't let food become a reward! I feel that it is completely acceptable to cheat every once in a while (I cheated on Thanksgiving and am planning to cheat on Christmas) but that is more so about giving myself a break and not making family/hosts worry about what they'll be serving. Don't tell yourself ""Alright! I lost 10lbs. I have a couple of donuts because they look good!""

Reward yourself in some other way! For me, one of the rewards has been fitting into old, smaller clothes! Once I lose some more weight, that reward will turn into buying myself some *new* clothes. But this could be anything! 

If you need help, advice, or motivation don't hesitate to ask! I, along with many other amazing people on this sub are around to help! &lt;3

True,Kordesii,,,"Reddit's default subreddits have become duller and duller. Browsing /r/funny has become a search for that one picture which makes you smile. I mean, half of the submissions aren't even remotely funny at all. Same goes for /r/wtf, a lot of the submissions that get upvoted aren't WTF material at all. /r/atheism is just another place to post memes and facebook screens. /r/gaming is just sad. /r/politics and /r/worldnews are liberal circlejerks where stating an unpopular opinion doesn't lead to a thoughtful discussion, but downvotes.

This is acceptable as long as we have other subreddits where we can still have proper discussions and avoid the endless amounts of pictures, memes and dull reposts. However, as some of the larger non-default subreddits can already see, the more users, less insipring content becomes the new norm. 

Some sort of guy said that for any given game, there are 90% who never browse any forums related to the game they're playing, 9% who actually do browse them, and 1% who frequently post.

While the same principle can't be directly applied to reddit, we can assume that maybe 10% of registered users are responsbile for over 90% of the content submitted. The 90% who never contribute remain as long as the 10% keep them entertained. Reddit heavily relies on that 10% to keep the majority of its users.

Then it becomes a matter of convinience, community and entertainment value. If another site uses the same basic design principle as reddit, but improves on it, people will feel compelled to check the site out. Since the community will be relatively small in the beginning, we can only assume that it will be appealing to those who are already active members of reddit. They don't care about how large the site is, or, as a matter of fact, they probably prefer a smaller community as long as it is active. That brings me on to the last point: entertainment value. If this new site can provide the equivelant entertainment value as reddit does, and still provide convinience and community, there is absolutely no reason to remain here.

The change won't be sudden, but slow. People won't leave overnight. Most people will probably be active on both sites until one of them proves sufficient to provide all of the formerly mentioned qualities. Reddit will probably remain for several years, but it is in its own nature to gradually destroy itself.

True,Platypuskeeper,,,"So basically you buy into the revisionist history and theology of fundamentalist Christians, lock stock and barrel?

For starters, there's not _one_ ""Bible"" which was put together at one point in time, and even when they were creating the various canons, they weren't complete literalists. The early church father Origen (who created his own canon) was excommunicated outright for taking Matthew 19:12 literally and castrating himself. Another church father, Saint Augustine was quite clear on the fact that Genesis was _not_ a literally true story, and the same sentiment was repeated by later theological heavyweights like Thomas Aquinas. 

The Catholic Church _never_ held the Bible to be the verbatim literal truth. On the contrary, it was something that took a lot of education and insight to interpret 'correctly' - the correct interpretation being that of the Church, of course. The Church got into a fight with Galileo not because his cosmology was at odds with that of the Old Testament (which holds that the Earth is flat and rests on four pillars), but because it was at odds with that of _Aristotle_, whose ideas they'd embraced during the Middle Ages.

It was _Martin Luther_ who rejected church authority and replaced that with the word of the Bible (while having his own ideas about which books were canonical and not). But since there's simply no such thing as a single 'literal' interpretation in the first place, Protestantism immediately splintered in a whole bunch of schisms, some being more literal than others. And even then, Christian Fundamentalism didn't come about until the 19th century, as a counter-reaction of sorts to the Enlightenment. 

On the scientific side, the idea that the world was 6000 years old was discredited during the 18th century, well before Darwin was even born. It was the fact that there was an open contemporary debate on the age of the Earth where people argued the possibility of the Earth being millions or billions of years old, which allowed Darwin to come up with his Theory of Evolution. It wasn't evolution that convinced people how old the Earth was, but the age of the Earth that convinced Darwin that evolution-by-natural-selection was a viable explanation.

Whether you're a fundie or not, you're definitely echoing their fictional version of history here: Fundamentalism is the true and original form of Christianity, and everyone would 'still' be following it, if it hadn't been for that evil Darwin guy and all those evil atheist scientists. Millions of people _claim_ to be fundamentalists, few of them actually _do_ believe everything in the Bible literally. More importantly, they're not the majority of Christians and _never have been_.

True,baristahipster,,,"Mine may be the worst in the history of men. 

Let's rewind to 2007, the year of my senior prom. I couldn't decide which girl I wanted to take to the dance (read: I had a group of girl friends and couldn't ask one of them without offending the others), and so I did the only logical thing that my 17 year old brain could think of - [I asked them all.](http://imgur.com/QIeh4)

As you can see, it went much better than expected. My vice principal at the time stared at me in disbelief when I asked him if I could buy 6 tickets to prom because I had 5 dates. He thought it was some sort of illogical high school ruse to sneak in friends from another school until I showed him a picture of the 5 girls I was taking. After that he would look at me in the halls and be all [like](http://therapup.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Obama-not-bad.jpg). For the only time in my life that it will happen for a good reason, everyone in the building stopped and stared when I walked into prom with 5 girls on my arm.

Anyways, these girls all happened to live out of town, and 17 year old me wasn't about to pay for a hotel for them, so, ""Mom, obviously they need to stay at our house."" AND SHE BOUGHT IT.

Prom went pretty swell, and I had girls dancing around me all night. I even started a loaner service where I would rent out some of my girls to friends who either came alone or got ditched at the dance. Oddly enough, I had gotten ditched real hard the year before so maybe this was some sort of karmic repayment for that hardship. At any rate, we had a great time, hit an after party and went back home 2am-ish. We had a guest room at the time that was connected to my room, and so the girls had a sort of suite in the back to sleep in. being the gentleman that I was, I took the couch on the other side of the house. I figured everyone would be pretty tired after partying with such an outrageous p-i-m-p, so we called it a night pretty soon after getting back to my place.

Well, about 30 minutes later as I'm getting settled down on the couch and kind of semi-dozing as I relive the most glorious moment in my life up to that point, two of the girls legitimately pop out of nowhere and leap onto the couch on either side of me (since you're obviously curious - it was the two on the left in the picture. YOU'RE WELCOME, YOU ANIMALS) and tell me they can't sleep so they wanted to do something.

I sleepily half sit up and point them to the computer, the tv, the kitchen and hell, even to the fire pit outside. In my most courteous manner, I ask them if they think that'll keep them occupied. They apparently think I'm playing coy with them, and dissolve into laughter on my chest (think about how close 3 people laying on a couch actually are) and one of them actually says, ""you're so silly"". WTF 17-year-old-baristahipster?! I legitimately didn't catch on and 15 minutes later they went to bed in a dejected manner that I didn't understand. 

Fast forward 3 months and I had gone to visit the town they lived in. Ol' girl in the red dress (far left, ya monsters) had me spend an afternoon with her. We went swimming in her pool and watched a movie upstairs in her room afterwards. We were in her bed and I kind of reached over to pull her in, but she countered with, ""wait, my best friend is obsessed with you, she'd be really upset if anything happened. we can cuddle though ;)"". That winky face literally happened, I'm not just being super hip like you think I am ;)

Anyways, I was all like, ""meh, what the hell, better than nothing"". She even said she was bored at one point and rolled in to nuzzle my oblivious as fuck neck. Still didn't do anything, because OBVIOUSLY GIRLS ALWAYS MEAN WHAT THEY SAY. Venture a guess as to what happened? Aha! Then you'd be wrong, *mon frere*, because **nothing** happened. Showed you. Double. Fracking. Fail.

So that's the story about how I failed real hard, and twice with the same girl. I still think back to that time, and if I had any contact with her I would absolutely make up for lost time. Be kind of weird to be like, ""say girl, remember that time I should have made a move? Wanna come over and I'll make that move *all over you*?""

True,[deleted],,,"I feel I need to say that I think it's a shame that people like that are given leadership positions in the Church, they're the sort that need more instruction in the ways of faith. At the very least seminaries need more involved courses on sexuality. Jesus Himself implies that marriage is a concession when He states that in the Kingdom we'll be like the angels in heaven, not being given in marriage. Paul follows up his little diatribe against homosexuality by saying ""you have no right to judge because you too do the same"" (and Romans very heavily implies that, come judgement, believers will be judged by a harsher standard -- which is why grace is a bit of an important thing for Christians).

As a Christian who attended a Christian university somewhat notorious for its liberal politics, I've met plenty of Christians that are loving and supporting of our homosexual neighbours; my own brother is gay and engaged to be married this summer (in theory, he and his SO are a bit disorganized -- they don't have a more solid date planned than ""summer""). I think idolatry is alive and well and I think North America has made idols of sex and politics. Our leaders are more concerned about who we're having sex with and how, in the process reducing the concepts of sexuality and intimacy to merely physical acts with no real emotional connection outside of those acts. We'll never understand love if we refuse to understand sexuality and intimacy. It's more complex than we think. Some suggest that Paul's and Jesus' both suggest that singleness is an ideal (I think this is a reading made too far in opposition to the cult of marriage we've established -- singleness isn't particularly important, fidelity and faithfulness is), Jesus makes it clear that sexuality in the age to come will be different to what we know today (us not being given in marriage is ambiguous, could mean we're asexual, could mean that we're faithful despite the lack of marriage: the end of Revelation suggests that life will continue on earth with the coming of the Kingdom -- we'll still farm, we'll still live in cities, it'll just be as it should be; without sin), and for Paul I think it's clear that faithfulness to one's gifts mattered more than sexuality (marriage wasn't an impediment to one's faithfulness to ministry, per se; the catch is that for some it would be. Acts and Romans calls out some married women for their role in Church leadership).

All of this is to say that anyone in Church leadership, or indeed in the Church itself, that makes such a simplistic (and hateful) comment is in danger of worshiping at the altar of Sex (of course, sex only when it's done the good ol' fashioned, American way) instead of at the Table, in Communion with the same Christ that ate with the prostitutes while the ""faithful"" of His time avoided and condemned them.",0,1355854203,,0,False,1,c7ilhzn,t3_151zs6,t1_c7ilhzn,t1_c7ikdtv,,1430708776,807,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,807

True,jackrabbitslimz,,,"As someone who's worked in the construction industry for a number of years I've often wondered this myself. 

Countless times I've been putting those plates on and had the screwdriver slide out and nearly insert itself in the socket. Why on earth would they do this? Well, the only logical explanation I can come up with is for aesthetic purposes. No one really wants to see exposed screw, it makes something look unfinished. While you could easily make it a Robertson or Phillips which would in turn make the installers life a whole 3 seconds easier, no one really wants to look at a screwhead. Additionally, those screws are painted to match the plate. A Robbie or Phillips would be more prone to having paint fill up inside the head. This would mean the screwdriver wouldn't sit nicely inside making it susceptible to stripping. The stripping would likely chip the paint and voila, ugly chipped screwheads everywhere. 

Electrical work is largely unseen in any context. The light fixtures, sockets and switches you see are obviously only a fraction of the work that went into making everything function in your home. That being said, many electricians who pay attention to detail will always turn those flat head screws until they are completely vertical or horizontal thus bringing us back to my point on aesthetics.

So I checked our databases for 1991 Cadillac Broughams that are gray.  Found one that was listed as stolen during the time of my investigation and was dumped behind some abandoned house the day AFTER.  I went to check on the car at the victim's house to compare damage but it wasn't there and it was 2:30 am so I wasn't waking some old lady up. 

I'm 90% sure this is the same car.  I sent a link of my findings (thanks to you guys) to the Auto Theft unit.  So you guys know, on the original accident the suspect was identified after he was seen yelling out the window that the car was stolen, but we could never find the car.  So not only will he go down for several traffic crimes but it looks like Auto Theft as well, assuming the damage matches.  You guys ROCK!

Some of them may inspire you to learn new things, to add new items to your routine (even if it's only because they're taking up your favorite equipment), and some of them will be looking to you as inspiration. 

If you no longer are in the position that your Resolution is to 'start working out', I think resolving to 'be more patient and understanding' is always a good one. If you like pithy quotes, perhaps ""Be an inspiration, not an intimidation."" would work.

True,Seefor,danmark,,"Unfortunately I didn't find an English translation. I will try to provide a translation in modern English here. Since the original poem is written in an old Danish, this might also be helpful for Swedes and Norwegians - and even Danes ;)

We are one people, we are called Scandinavians,  
In three realms our homeland is divided;  
But between the great heavenly gifts  
It lies: our heart grows into one  
Let it be forgotten, if wrong was done unto us;  
The spirit of time, like a cleansed Margarethe,   
Unites us, it gives thrice the power,  
Even the language unites us  
On mountains, in woods and by the night-blue sea,  
I shout with joy: I am a Scandinavian!  


Come with me to the Dovre-mountain, where the glacier lies,  
Hear the thunder of the waterfall, the song of the herding girl;  
The fresh lake and mountain air I drink in,  
I walk where Gods of the North once walked,  
And of powerful men I want to hear,  
About Olaf, Hakon, Harald tales are told;  
To the mountains! to the mountains! with strong castles of rock  
You stand tall, my old Norway,  
Bathed in the Northern lights, by a stormful sea;  
I love you! I am a Scandinavian! 


Come with me on the quick boat, let the steam work,  
See rivers, great lakes on our way!  
Sail over the mountain, where the tall birches  
Exhale air! Oh, Sweden I love!  
From here Gustaf Adolf's name sounded on Earth,  
He was the last knight here in the North.  
A piece of bark-bread, and the Swedish farmer sings,  
His dilligence makes him young;  
He sings the songs the skalds gave him;  
And we sing with him: I am a Scandinavian!  

A fresh bouquet of clover, grain and hop  
Is Denmark! come and see our beech forest!  
On the plains here the sons of the Spirit frisk,  
It rumbles cheerfully under the hoof of the horse;  
Of science and art we quickly learn,  
From Thorvaldsen its name resounds from stone,  
Tycho gave it wings.  
A rose Denmark is! sing, Scandinavian,  
Of the flower of the Spirit amidst the rough sea!  
And we with him: I am a Scandinavian!  

Let not this joyous unity disappear,  
Norwegian, Swedish and Danish stretch out for each other's hand,  
The old folk songs join us,  
In melody a strong bond exists.  
Of unity's seeds only good can be harvested,  
We scout eagerly towards West and East  
In joy and sorrow! Oh, it's good to live here!  
Here our loved ones live!  
From spruce to birch and beech, across seas,  
Resound song of joy: I am a Scandinavian!

True,macktastick,,,"**Category director** – most publishers break their sales coverage up by
industry, so they will have a “CPG group”, a “Finance and insurance
goup”, a “Travel group” …. you get the idea.  Whomever leads this group
may swing by for the occasional meeting/call.  THEY ARE THE BEST PEOPLE
TO TAKE IFFY IDEAS TO.  Just trust me.  



There may be a couple more assistants/technicians on your account
depending on what services you’re currently utilizing (maybe a
retargeting expert for example).  YOU HAVE CONTROL OVER WHO IS ON YOUR
TEAM.  If you for whatever reason do not like your support team,
maturely tell your sales lead.  They won’t be fired (and if you want to
emphasize that, do it, “Please just move them”).  It happens.  

On YOUR side of the fence: 



There’s you, planning this approach.  



There’s the **creative team** making the ads (sometimes the publishers
will make ads FOR you… seriously – creatives hate it with good reason
but it’s an awesome perk in times of need).  



There’s YOUR **trafficking manager** (this may just be a technically
inclined person on your side… an online analyst of some kind, a
developer, etc. that doesn’t fear diving into the ad server and moving
things around/exporting tags).  It could also be you… don’t let it be
you.  It’s not that bad, it’s just not what you should be spending your
time on.  



You might have a **media buyer** (probably will) who, once you’ve
identified a target publisher or network will go toe-to-toe with their
corresponding representative on price and other terms.  If you DON’T
have this… and they want YOU to do it – get FORMAL negotiation training
(your employer should pay… you’ll make it back in your first few
deals).  I’m normally a big do-it-yourself person, but I found it very
beneficial to get the same training the other negotiators would. 
IDEALLY, get training for a couple of you and go into negotiations as a
team (there’s a reason ideas like “good cop / bad cop” are still around
– they work, but they require more than one person).  



You’ll have a **reporting lead** (analyst) who will provide you the
performance data on your campaigns.  You can be creative here… if your
person is busy or struggling with some issue – the publishers can often
do some of the reporting for you (their willingness will depend on your
spend level!).  



**Compliance** – you probably interact with this group for PPC ads
already (what goes out the door must be blessed by a lawyer!).  I know a
lot of people think these guys are a pain, but they’re there to save the
company’s ass (and by extension yours) from potential disaster.  Be nice
to them.  Gifts go a long way!



And of course… you’re going to interact with many of the other online
groups for the purposes of merging reporting or supporting a niche
campaign (the social team, the email marketing team, etc. – these will
all want some of your time).  


**Misc**

**Get to know the IAB **

****

I’ve tried to give you as much info as I can that *isn’t* organized this
way somewhere else, but there’s still a good bit about display already
online.  For example, the [IAB best practices](http://www.iab.net/guidelines) are followed by many
advertisers (and many more work toward doing so).  


****

**“Make-goods” are your best friend**



Things go wrong at an alarming rate in display… at least it did a couple
years ago.  Either a buy *tanks* or some tag gets implemented
incorrectly… the “make good” can save you – and depending on how much
money you’re spending you can request/demand them (if it isn’t already
clear, you have more power as the buyer in display relationships than
you do in PPC… generally).  

**You’d better clear some of your evenings**

****

The dollars thrown around in display buys mean the
publisher-takes-you-out-on-the-town things still happen (and you better
believe if you’re the strategist, you’re #2 on their target list… the
media buyer being #1).  It was difficult for me not to just say no to
all of them (I’m not righteous or anything, my team was just young and
had families to get to – and I’d rather have been doing other things),
but there IS a way to get a ton of benefit from these.  



My rule was: Let them take you to dinner, don’t let them take you to the
strip club (not that they all would suggest such a thing, of course!).  
 



Why? 



Dinner or the bar is where you’re going to gain the most ground on your
competition (my opinion).  It’s where it’s easiest to hear from the
publisher (and easiest for them to say), “Hey, we’re trying this beta
program…. Do you want in [ALMOST ALWAYS YES].”



And other things of that nature.  It’s good to do – terrible to take
advantage of (like… possibly career-ending-conflict-of-interest type
terrible).  



Just be careful.  

****

**Rate cards are for suckers**



Well, this isn’t true if you’re working with one of the new auction-like
systems (DSPs, Content Networks), but it is if you’re making an endemic
buy.  There is no market rate for the ad placement you’re considering. 
Just tell yourself that.  



One of my favorite quotes from a co-worker: 



**Me:**Why did you suggest $120K? 

**Him:**Because $200K sounded fair. 



Simple, Negotiation 101 – but all of those ideas/tactics/skills are in
action in a display buy. 

****

I could keep going… and I’m sure I’ll edit/add a few things… but I’m at
10 pages here… so I’m going to give it a rest for now and see if this is
actually helping you!

However the auctions are MASSIVE here in California where I work. So I will be handed a stack of papers that represent each vehicle the dealership bought. Then I have to go find them. But the auctions are always unorganized so I have to walk through rows and rows of cars looking for each one they bought. Have you ever parked your car at a large shopping mall and then forgot what entrance you entered the mall through and can't find your car? Well imagine that, but instead of your own personal car it some random car you have never seen before and you didn't park it. So I have gotten really good at being able to spot a car from a long distance away just by being able to see a small amount of the vehicle. Like sometimes its a light, or a roof line, or a door is all that is visible from where ever I am standing. After years and years of this you become good at it.

True,spundred,,,"I'm from New Zealand. I'll preface by saying all nations have their unfortunate problems, like here we have a higher rate of child abuse and youth suicide than the global average. There's no easy solution to things like that.

Certainly the prevailing media coverage here is of solemn sympathy for the families effected.

In regards to Sandy Hook, my personal perspective as a foreign observer is that the US holds two values unusually sacred, personal responsibility, and the right to firearms. These two points are cultural, they're not legislative, they're not religious, they're inherited values from generations past. You've been taught that they're worth holding, so you do.

Unfortunately, the consequence of these values is a lack of available care for mental illness, and a supply of readily available firearms. In fringe cases, this nurtures a few dangerously unstable people, who have access to deadly weapons.

What I see in people's responses to this tragedy, is that these values are too important to change, so blame is being diverted to various straw-men, like religion and violent video games. Nobody wants to embrace social responsibility, despite the fact it would create safer, healthier communities by providing care to the mentally ill, and nobody wants to limit the availability of firearms, because they feel they have a near sacred right to own them.

My perspective is from a nation where psychiatric care is available from both public and private institutions, and where it's virtually impossible to get handguns or assault weapons. I could buy a bolt-action rifle with a small magazine, or a break-action shotgun, if I payed a hefty fee and passed a license test, but realistically the mayhem a person could cause with a weapon of that style is very low. When shooting events happen here, there is seldom more than one casualty, because of the nature of weapons available.

My perspective is that America is not willing to make compromise to it's values, because psychiatric care is expensive and ""not my responsibility"", and gun ownership is sacred, but that is the price of lowering the likelihood of freak shooting events.

There are other issues, like the duality of a nation mourning these children dying, while being utterly accepting of the US Army murdering dozens of children with drone strikes in Pakistan and Yemen. The value American citizens give to the lives of their own people over the lives of foreigners is troubling. Ideas like that have lead to very unfortunate periods in history.",0,1355883560,,0,1355884682,1,c7iu469,t3_152ny9,t1_c7iu469,t3_152ny9,,1430713288,557,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,557

-Visit them in person, every other month is often enough to keep tabs on them, without disrupting their routine at their residential home. I would bring them home for all major holidays. When you visit with them at their residence, observe them both alone and interacting with staff or other clients. If you notice something that seems off, ask about it. If a staff's explanation for something seems off, go above their head. 

-Call on the phone. Write letters, email if possible. If a client feels like people care about their well-being they are far more likely to speak up (in their own way) when something is going wrong. 

-Talk to their house managers, coordinators, QSP's, doctors, everything. Ask how they are doing.  Be proactive. Come to their meetings, either physically or by phone or by skype.

True,steyr911,,,"Ugh... I think at the end of the day, part of the reason guys ""miss"" so many hints is because we've been burned so many times....

That girl that you really liked as a friend, for instance. That time when you were feeling kinda lonely, and she was being flirty and you went in for a kiss because you you were A. Lonely and B. Thinking she was interested but never told you.... and then you got shot down and she made everything so awkward from there on out that the friendship was ruined...

Or that girl who you thought you were really hitting it off with at the bar... you were dishing out your best jokes, you both really connected, she let you buy her like 5 drinks... then you asked for her number and you find out the next day that she gave you the rejection hotline.

Or that one chick in high school who started grinding on you on the dance floor, and when you popped a stiffy (like ANY guy would), she turned around and smacked you so hard your ear was ringing for like an hour. Any guy who struck you like that would get sucker punched in return, but you can't hit a girl, so you just walk away in shame and frustration... ""what did I do wrong?!""

Or the chick who decided to be your beer pong partner all night, kept hanging off you and grabbing your ass from time to time and giggling. Later, she heads up to your room ""because I want to sleep where you sleep"". So you head up there with her after a minute and when you jump in bed and try to steal a kiss? ""Dude, why are you being a creeper? I gotta go. I'll have my friends drive me home.""

Etc. etc..... etc... for years. And so when a girl is being genuinely flirtatious, can you really blame us for not taking you up on it? 

So, to most guys, the penalty for overstepping your bounds is far greater than the reward of acting on a suspected ""hint"". So we don't do it. So, I think we just start tuning that shit out.

It's not an excuse, because hey, hints and flirting is fun! But when it comes to ""game time""... hints just usually aren't as effective.",0,1355886566,,0,1355886891,2,c7iuxpd,t3_152w0f,t1_c7iuxpd,t3_152w0f,,1430713775,2387,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,2387

I met a guy when I was 20 and he was 23. We had just started hanging out and getting to know each other, nothing serious. I really, really liked him. He was very shy and I found it adorable. One day, he invited me over to watch a few movies with him. We were sitting on his bed watching them and all I could think was ""he really needs to make a move already"" (I'm really impatient). I thought for sure he didn't like me. I mean, I always made him laugh and I never considered myself *ugly* or anything, so I figured maybe he would go for it. Anyway, his bed was up against the wall and I was kinda propped up against the wall. I started to slowly slide my back down the wall until I was lower than him, hoping he would get the hint and kiss me. Nope. 30 minutes or so went by and I was getting aggravated, so I got out my phone and texted him and said, ""So, are you gonna kiss me or what?"" I was so nervous once I sent it. My heart was beating like crazy. His phone beeped and he reached for it. He saw my message and I thought I was going to *die*. You know what he did? He fucking started texting me back. SERIOUSLY? I just knew he didn't want me then. I checked my phone and it said ""Look up."" I smiled, looked up and he kissed me. ;)

Our sex life slowed so gradually.... I honestly can't say at what point the slowdown started to occur.  All I knew is that at some point around our 8th or 9th year, I came to the realization that OMG... we only have sex once every couple of months; sometimes even longer.  

We'd gone through some tough issues.  She had prolonged gall bladder illness that eventually led to a severe vitamin b deficiency; usually only suffered by anorexics and alcoholics, called Woernickes encephalopathy.  The result was severe loss of balance.  She was disabled for a few months, so I had to take care of her and everything at home.  We also work together in very parallel positions... (she's the rehab director, and I am the rehab coordinator in a therapy dept; so basically we are the only two that run the joint) so I also had to take care of everything at work too. She was too sick for sex, and I was way too stressed and tired.

Then her mother, at the very young age of 52 had a debilitating brain stem stroke.  She can no longer walk, talk eat or use the right side of her body at all.  Had she not been so young and fit when it happened... well it was the kind of stroke that very few people actually live through.  She's lived in the nursing home where my wife and I work for over six years now.  That's the silver lining if you can call it that.  We can see her every day and know that she is very well cared for. 

Anyway... all of that, plus just the usual pressures of everyday life, crushed our libidos like a brick wall falling on china doll.  We never lost that loving feeling.  There's never been a time in our 13 years together when we weren't holding and touching each other any time we were within arms reach (and outside of work lol.). It just wasn't sexual anymore.  

Then one day I realized that we just weren't kissing anymore...and dammit I missed kissing.  I told her so, and we began having deep passionate good night kisses every night.  As an unintended benefit... Those kisses very frequently lead to love making.  It was such a simple, yet very effective cure for our LBD.

**TL;DR** Fake it until you make it.  Just start kissing and making out... Force it if you have to. Just like when you were teens, one thing will lead to another.  Kissing is like jumping off the dead battery in your car... sometimes a little spark is all you need to make that motor purr.",0,1355887469,,0,False,1,c7iv6qa,t3_1535wl,t1_c7iv6qa,t3_1535wl,,1430713886,18,False,olderlesbians,t5_2vtpm,18

True,wisewhiz,,,"Hmm, well while I've told this story dozens of times, I've never written it down before.  Here goes:

Freshman year of college, two of my friends, Josh and Aaron, were sitting in the hallway of their dorm just hanging out.  Now, there was a guy on their floor that everyone called Joe Cool because he was always wearing sunglasses and a leather jacket.  He would always come in late at night, usually pretty drunk.

Well, on that night, Joe Cool came in around 3 in the morning.  He stumbled over to Josh and Aaron and said, ""Guys...guys, you've got to help me.  The hangover's going to kill me.  You got anything to help take the edge off this?""

Josh just kind of shrugged and said, ""Nah man, can't help you, sorry.""  Aaron sat there for a second...then said, ""Yeah, I think I've got something.""  He left, leaving Josh to wonder what the hell he had in mind.  Aaron came back a few minutes later with something in his hands.

In his hands were three small pills.  One was hot pink.  The other was neon green.  Another was some kind of purple.  He handed them over to Joe Cool, who was really appreciative.  ""Dude, you're a saint, man, I really appreciate it, I really do.""

Aaron started cracking up and went back to looking at his computer.  A few minutes later, he sat up.  ""Wait, did Joe walk away with those?""  ""Yeah dude, why?"" Josh says.

""Oh shit..""

Aaron runs after Joe, and Josh follows him.  ""What the hell did you give him, man?!?!""

""I can't tell you...but we need to stop him!""

They find Joe Cool in the bathroom.  He's walking away from the sink, having just guzzled the pills down.  ""Gee man, thanks again, you're a real lifesaver, you hear?""

Aaron's face turned blue.  Josh was really starting to freak out now.  ""AARON.  Is he going to be okay?!?!?!""

""Dude, I don't know.  But we need to watch him tonight.""  So the two guys found Joe in his room already out cold.  They decided to take turns watching him at night, one person sleeping while the other person watches him.  A few hours in, though, they screw up and both fall asleep.

Fast forward to the morning and Joe's gone when they wake up.  Immediately, Josh and Aaron start freaking out.  ""Oh shit, where the hell's Joe Cool?!?!""

They start looking around, and they eventually find him in the bathroom.  He comes walking out of the stall and his face is beet red.  He's obviously been crying.  His hair is completely sweaty.  And he just nervously cries, ""Guys...did you see me come in last night?""

""Umm...yeah, I guess,"" the guys said.

""Well...did I eat anything...weird?""

""Uhh, I'm not sure Joe.  Why?""

""I don't know what I ate.  But I just POOPED A T-REX!!  AND A PTERODACTYL...AND I THINK A STEGOSAURUS!!!!

At this point, Aaron just hits the ground laughing.  Josh is just sitting there shouting, ""WHAAAAAAAT?!?!?!  AARON...*what did you give him?*

Eventually, Aaron is able to stop laughing enough to speak.  And he finally reveals what was in those pills:  ""Dude...dude...you know how at the toy store, you can buy those sponge capsules that you put in the water and they expand into dinosaurs?  **HE JUST TOOK THREE OF THEM!!!**

True,dahngrest,,,"You need a total of 180 units to graduate. You can transfer a total of 105 credits from community college and this total will change depending on whether your CC was quarter or semester based. So whatever you have left after your major credits can be in whatever you want. Including more anthro classes.

UCSC is in the process of hiring a new bioanth/osteo professor after losing their forensic god to NCSU so hopefully they'll be on staff come the 2013-2014 year. In the mean time our bio side is very primatology/paleo focused.

I'm currently taking additional anthro classes and I have a history minor so my extra units are being filled with that.

Upper div classes honestly depend on the field and professor. I just finished up a class with no tests and had 3 2-3 page papers and a 5-7 page final paper. But attendance and participation were 30% of our final grade. It honestly just depends on the class and professor. I've had everything from in-class blue book exams, to take home exams, to in-class quizzes, to multiple choice finals. It really just depends.

Depending on my classes, my studying varies. Theory and seminar classes are writing/reading intensive. Cultural classes are reading heavy but you can occasionally get away with doing no reading at all. I spent about 15-20 hours a week studying for Forensic Anthropology last quarter. This quarter I spent maybe ... an hour a week studying for all my classes. Total. It really just depends.

I take anywhere from 12 to 20 units per quarter. Classes are worth five units and are ten weeks long. 12 is considered full time, 15 is average, 20 is for crazy people.

True,etre-libre,,,"i'm in australia. i'm 22. i was diagnosed this year with bipolar and adhd inattentive. i knew i was bipolar, but thought my attention problems were because of my moods. it took all year to stabilise my moods and my pdoc refused to medicate my ADHD until I was stable as stimulates would cause manic episodes.

anyway, two months ago, my pdoc told me it was a requirement that two different pdoc had to make a diagnosis for adult ADHD. So he referred me to another whom also diagnosed me. I still didn't believe and went myself to a third pdoc and he also agreed that I had ADHD.

I still wasn't completely stable so my original/normal pdoc put that on the back burner. Last week I finished school and also because I hadn't had an episode in over two months, he decided to fax off the application for stimulants to the nsw government agency that authorises the prescription. i had to also get a drug test which was sent to them. A week later they approved my application and I received my prescription for dexamphetamine sulphate.

I have been told by many people that ADHD is only an illness in children and everyone outgrows it by adulthood, or they stop medicating after 18 or whatever. I never thought I had it because I wasn't hyperactive (I thought you had to be to be ADHD). So I never thought to get help. My pdoc picked it up and also said he believes that 1) there is such a thing as ADHD in adults and 2) you can diagnose and medicate someone who is bipolar and ADHD. That tells me that some doctors don't believe in the diagnosis or this dual diagnosis. But, I was approved for the meds so you can get them.

I've also had to deal with my psychiatrists telling me that the stress and mood issue is the cause of my attention issues, despite my protests. Like you, my intelligence got me trough school, but adult life has made seeking help a necessity. I know too many people in America self diagnose themselves, and it took me a long time to come to terms with knowing I'd be getting lumped in with lazy-people-looking-for-an-excuse, so it was disillusioning to be treated for depression after finally decision to get help with ADHD.

True,FACE_Ghost,,,"You can't ""drill"" ADC into people. Mechanics aren't very important ADC and Support roles are to be shared. They should understand exactly the thought process before starting the game and they should both understand each others strength and weaknesses.


Your friend should first find a similar skilled friend, who also has a passion to be better. They should not be rivals in any way, rivals are good for things like mid lane - top lane but there needs to be synergy bottom lane.

Teach your friend these very important things about ADC.

Poke - Using basic attacks to poke and prod enemy ADC and support away from getting too close or making mistakes.

Trading - Using Abilities to trade mana for HP (basically you deal damage and use up mana)

CS - Obviously CSing is the most important thing an ADC can do

FB - First blood should never happen bottom lane, unless it is pre-meditated and planned, this most commonly means you are a kill lane and have gotten level 2 before your opponents.


Your friend should understand that as a bot lane you want to learn how to ""win the poke"" this is most common with stun supports. Where your support will run up, stun and you must INSTANTLY react. If you successfully deal damage without taking much to any damage at all in return you have ""won the poke"" the first ADC to go back in a lane, almost always loses the lane UNLESS their jungle camps and assuming both ADC and support follow this next common practice.

Push - This is when you have sent the other ADC back to their fountain or out of lane. This most commonly happens when you have ""won the poke"" a few times and they have run out of mana to heal or health all together. You want to capitalize on them not being there. You want to deal as much damage to the creeps as possible without missing any CS (you and your support, support should take zero cs at this time) and push the lane to tower. You must INSTANTLY go back and buy as fast as possible and get back to lane. Depending on what time the game is at, you usually can get back to lane when lane is about half pushed or the next term:

Reset - This is where you reset the lane, the best way of going around this is to last last hit minions, waiting for the bear minimum so that your minions also die. You can control how fast your minion wave dies by how fast you kill their minion wave. To reset properly you must also be able to do this next task:

Freeze - To freeze a lane means your support stands at the point of freeze (best places to freeze are right out of range of their tower, middle of the lane, right outside range of your tower). Minions will aggro on the support and stand there until your minions have arrived. Inevitably if their minions have taken damage from previous waves you will push. You can't really avoid this no matter how well you last hit.

Dragon - This is the most important thing that most lower ELO ADCs don't do. It is very very dumb to get back to lane, do a poke and force their ADC back to fountain and go back yourself if you are full health support ditto. Your support should have eyes and timer on dragon. If it hasn't been taken yet, make sure that you have it warded properly. Best place to ward is between dragon and blue. If you know that you will send their ADC back as soon as you get back to lane, call your jungler over and you can get a very easy dragon. Even if their jungle is there it will be a 4v3 and you should pick up the easy kills or free dragon. Be wary of top lane teleports or Shen. They can easily make a 4v3 into a 4v4 and have a better position than you.

Leashing - This is important now in S3 than it ever has been. Leashing blue for your jungle is extremely important to how well they play. Ideally you want all 5 people there and you want to roam a bit afterwards (like they do professionally) BUT this is normal games brohan! So you will have to suffice leashing blue (don't worry about red, that is top and mid's problem) with just mid and support. You should take ZERO damage from blue, you should also stay and do enough damage so that the jungler shouldn't even need to smite. Depending on your jungler you can have a very easy time getting first blood by having your lane pushed early. Talk with your jungler before hand to let him know what's up. If this is the case, let your support tank the blue and have jungler and adc both at full health, bring mid as well for a very easy double kill or first blood, or at least 1 or 2 flashes down. Do not waste flash for kills, it almost never works. (USE your own decision making though!)

Run the best synergy for your lane. lolking has a synergy database based on the current statistics of the game. Have your support take the best support that they can given the current bans and picks (assuming you are doing ranked). Usually support and ADC are easy picks.

Team synergy - This is by far the most important aspect of your ADC support combo. A fed ADC means nothing if your entire team lets you die. So you must be able to communicate with your team. There should be ZERO fighting and ZERO arguing and ABSOLUTE sportsmanship coming from ADC and Support. The rest of the team is there to make sure you don't die and you are there to make sure the other team dies. No matter how bad your mid is, or jungle, or top, it is ALWAYS your fault if you lose. It might not be your fault that you got a defeat, but there is ALWAYS something better you can work on. Get a lolreplay recorder and re-watch games. The best way to figure out what you did wrong is to re-watch the game from your opponents PoV and see what they did to abuse your mistakes. Then fix those mistakes with more practice games, ask a friend to try to do the same things and talk with your support on how you would better deal with that situation.

Baron - Baron is the dumbest thing in this game, it is also the best thing to happen to an ADC you suddenly become God. So your best option when you just get an ace and your entire team is up? It definitely isn't for baron. When you are ahead, never use resources that bring you back into the game. This is a fundamental rule that people break all the time, if you just got an ace, why do you need to have the buff? All the other team is going to do is defend and wait for it to go away and CS a great deal while waiting, the game will only become more close and you will lose most of your opportunity to win. Of course most teams win straight after baron, but if you are already that far ahead you could of easily won the game sooner. If the game is that close where baron would of made a difference, better team positioning and teamwork would of won. Don't substitute getting better with in-game buffs.

Towers - THIS is what you get after an ace and your team is not dead. You push every lane to the closest tower you can REGARDLESS of position on the map. Top lane kill top lane etc, blue kill mid and top or bot, red kill mid and top or bot, dragon kill bot and mid, baron kill top and mid. Because MID is the most common out of these, most games end up with mid being taken. Towers don't come back, they give global gold, and they allow you to more easily move around the map. Destroying these is also very important for winning.

Focusing - This is important as well. Your opponents will most likely be going after you as you deal the most damage - WRONG this is a common misconception. It would be very foolish for a team to disregard the entire team to target one player. Although in some circumstances this is the correct decision, almost always there is a rule to follow. Attack the CLOSEST THING TO YOU. This means tanks, this means junglers, this means bruisers, this means the guy with thornmail. I cannot stress this enough, you are not tanky you probably don't have a lot of health and a full rotation on any champ should do a great number on you especially if it involves some sort of stun, taunt, slow, or debuff of any kind. Your team should keep these guys off of you so you can focus the more important people. That is why it is the most closest to you, within reason, if an APC or ADC is in range of auto attacks and alistar is closer, you should still hit the APC or ADC, hitting alistar doesn't change the fact that he is still there and your damage will be better off hitting the ADC or APC. You however should be in the same place as them, in the back hitting who you can. If you are somehow in the middle, you are doing something wrong and should review positioning with your support.

Carrying - This is the hardest thing about being a carry, is actually carrying. There has been countless games where you will feel fed, but don't get cocky, at least not yet. There is a fine line in this game between being unkillable and throwing the game. It is so fine, that you can't define it until you've had it happen. It doesn't matter how many kills you have, or how good your CS is, if their team works better as a team than your team they will just focus you and easily sweep your team. So how do you avoid this?

Item builds - Your goal as an ADC should be to output the most damage always - WRONG - your goal as the ad carry is to make sure you are doing damage, not necessarily the most damage. If you are going 5-0 in your lane, but mid is getting fed. Grab a negatron, you should always build defensive items when you are winning. Grab a chain mail if the top lane is AD and doing well. You don't need to be a glass cannon if you are already wrecking face, it makes you harder to kill and you can last longer in a fight. If you are losing you should build glass cannon, it doesn't matter how long you last in the fight because you are going to die anyhow to their superior power, mine as well do as much damage as you can. 

I hope you took the most info you could from this bible of text... Hope your friend does well also!

EDIT:

I just wanted to edit some stuff to clarify. (I'll just add it here to leave the original up)

When I regard to poking, think of it as real life poking, you don't mean harm you are just simply prodding someone to go somewhere; that could be away from you, to a specific place or to get their attention.

When I regard trading, ideally you trade mana for HP in the sense that one player did damage without taking any damage in return usually you do the most damage if you land a skill, skills cost mana. However realistically both players generally trade (most trades result in a kill if neither knows when to back off) when you trade realistically, you are trading HP for HP and mana for mana, assuming both players used a skill to trade.

Mechanics are important as some people pointed out. However I will say this, even if you had 300 CS at the end of laning phase and you never pushed your tower and you just farmed there forever, you never missed a last hit. You are useless to your team if you don't otherwise know how to work with the team. The idea that your only job as an ADC is to CS is very blind. Although CSing is your top priority, knowing when to do things and what things are and how to make better decisions will be what wins you games.

EDIT EDIT:

Oh yea I forgot about baron:

Let me clarify, if you are BEHIND and you get a lucky ace (they were dicking around or throwing) GET BARON! You will most likely never come back from towers and lane pushing alone (unless of course you are 50 minutes in and have 60 seconds to do as you please but even then baron might be your best option).

If you are AHEAD, the time you take to get baron buff just adds to the time it takes you to win the game, I am not saying ""don't"" get baron buff, I am just saying that it doesn't help your chances of winning, it just serves to delay the end.

If you are EQUAL, you are just giving your opponents the opportunity to get a lucky engage on your, or to simply just defend until baron is done, you've gained no towers and unless they get caught out of position their team fight with a tower will be equal to baron.

Also about building defensively when you are ahead. This doesn't mean if you get first blood go start a warmogs. This simply means you can go from building the typical BT IE LW PD boots GA and go something a bit better for your survivability (you basically want to get yourself closer to being able to 1v5) and go for something like BT BT IE BC Boots GA. The Negatron was about if one of their team is getting fed and you are getting fed, you should try to build to counter that person as they are the only threat.",0,1355914972,,0,1355983803,1,c7j0649,t3_153pwz,t1_c7j0649,t3_153pwz,,1430716356,54,False,summonerschool,t5_2t9x3,54

I had slightly thicker legs and arms than the other girls in my school despite being a very active kid. I was in swim squad every morning and rode my bike everywhere. 

Despite being as active as I was, I was always a little heavier than most kids my age. I wasn't fat, just not thin. As I got older I got a little heavier, even though I was still very active. 

Then we moved interstate and I started school in a remote town with 12 kids in the entire school. There was no swim squad, no football oval to run around on, kids didn't include me in games...

I felt like an outcast, but the one thing I was good at was schoolwork. So I did the best I could at that. I wasn't riding my bike around after school because there was nowhere to go, nothing to do and no-one to go and see. I would spend my time reading or eating to curb boredom. After a while I would snack on whatever was around to make me feel better after another day of being shunned. One day my parent's tone changed from: ""You're not fat sweetie!"" to ""Why are you eating that? No wonder you're getting fat.""

I packed on about 25 kilo's in my last 2 years of primary school and then high school started. They didn't give a crap about physical activity, it was about studying. And the pressure to do well or end up 'stuck in this hole of a town' was phenomenal. So I turned all my attention to study. And while I made friends early on, once they all got into things like alcohol, drugs, wagging school and misbehaving I stopped being friends with them. I was then branded a loser outcast and a fat cow as well. It didn't seem to matter what I ate, I developed early on and packed on kilo's constantly. The more I was stressed and depressed and lonely, the more I isolated myself and ate to calm me down and alleviate boredom. All the kids around me were eating junk but they didn't seem to gain weight like I was. 

High school finished and I weighed 120 kilos. I was definitely into: ""I'm a fat disgusting whale"" territory by then. But I had dismissed it and didn't want to think about it. I had university to worry about. 

Needless to say I didn't cope well and my weight gain kept steadily increasing and increasing. 

I dropped out after a breakdown and started work. I was too old to do hospitality work (reserved for people under 18 where I live) and did an administration course. Completing that I started work at a call centre. Long periods of time sitting on my ass. 

I have had 4 different jobs in the last 5-6 years. All of them have been administrative. 

I have gained weight since I was about 13, at the rate of 20 kilos a year. 

I weighed 167 kilos the last time I weighed myself. At my heaviest I was 178 kilos (392.4 pounds).

I go through stages of trying to get some of this weight off, but working 9 and a half hours a day in a high stress job makes it hard. I barely have time to have any kind of social life and sleep. 

I tried not to let it, but because the weight gain was so steady, I let it define me. I now think of myself as ""the fat girl"". I can't imagine life being any different. I have to size up a chair before I can sit in it and worry that I'm cutting off circulation. Clothes cost a fortune. And now that I've gotten as big as I am, if I do lose any weight I am going to need surgery for the excess skin. 

I am a master of denial and most of the time I don't think about it. But when I do examine myself in the mirror it leads to me wishing I was dead. I hate being trapped in this heavy, exhausting, inconvenient, disgusting meatsack and I gaurantee you no-one despises the sight of me more than myself. I honestly consider myself the ugliest person on the planet. 

This ruins any chance I have at a relationship because I don't want the other person to have to 'settle' for me. I feel like I would be holding them back. So I sabotage any chance I have at happiness or play dumb. The last time I gave it a try, the person backed out saying they didn't love me enough. 

I try really hard to believe that it's not because I'm grotesque, but deep down I feel that if I were thin, this wouldn't be an issue. 

I work constantly to prove myself to people, to make them dismiss any ideas they get the second they look at me. I feel like people will hate me on appearance. I'm always shocked when they don't. I basically feel like I'm in a psychological and physical hell of my own making and there is no way to make it better. For the most part I have everyone fooled, they have no idea that I question how anyone could love someone who looks the way I do. Even my parents. 

I know this is more information that you asked for, but once I started writing this it was hard to stop. 

**Edit:** Woah. I wrote this last night and at the time I was tired and it sort of flowed out of me, I have never said out loud the things I wrote here. And now it's my top rated comment and thank-you to whoever gave me Reddit gold (now I just have to figure out what it is and how to use it!)

I have read all of your messages and comments. There were a lot but I will try to respond to everyone I can. Some of your stories and messages have brought me to tears. I'm starting to realise that I need to address the psychological issues that I have related to my weight, as well as changing my exercise and eating habits. I'm more determined than ever to lose weight and stop identifying myself by it and let it stop me from enjoying life and feeling like I deserve to be happy. I do avoid feeling negative things and deal with stress by eating rather than bother anyone with my emotional crap. And I have to stop that. Thank-you all so much.

**Edit 2:** Your responses continue to amaze me. I have just finished my chicken salad and water bottle for lunch instead of my usual steak burger and fizzy energy drink, I am purchasing a set of scales after work and I'm gonna start a progress blog. I want you all to know that the words I use to inspire me when I hit a wall or feel like I can't do it, will be all of your words. ""Tackle weightloss like it's a second job"", ""You CAN do this, you DESERVE this.""

As I posted in reply to user finder90 below: ""These people here have changed my life as well. If I had written that and it had remained buried, I could probably have continued on as I was, hating myself, eating whatever and not pushing myself to exercise. But I can't do that now. I've held back for so long at saying what I did because I knew that if I did it would be real. And I would have to deal with it.
But instead of that being a burden, I feel kind of liberated. Like I'm not alone and that I have it within me to do this. I'm hopeful for the first time in a very long time. And determined not to let myself down.""",0,1355915542,,0,1355972336,1,c7j081d,t3_153qc8,t1_c7j081d,t3_153qc8,,1435656468,1952,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,1952
True,VishousOne,,,"Ummm moved from sunny California to very rainy Oregon. Gained 20 pounds. Then I got pregnant w/my second child and gained 30 pounds. Then got pregnant again really really soon after my second and gained 30 pounds with the 3rd. Went a year an a half got pregnant again but  miscarried the baby at 4 1/2 months, while my mother-in-law was dying from pancreatic cancer. Raising a ton of kiddos and dealing with loss put me at 245. I've lost almost all that I've gained except that I've got Rheumatoid Arthritis and fibo now and the drugs they give me make it very hard to drop the last 25-30 pounds. Can't walk without a cane or a walker most of the time so exercise is very hard to do. Then I lost my oldest child last year in a hit and run and now I could give a shit about losing the last of it.

True,gurlat,,,"Generally the [IAU (International Astronomical Union)](http://www.iau.org/) is responsible for naming celestial bodies. 

Most recently they named the dwarf planet Eris after a Greek goddess, , the dwarf planet Makemake after a god of fertility from Easter Island, and the dwarf planet Haumea after the Hawaiian goddess of childbirth. 

So odds are it would be named after some sort of fertility goddess, likely from the area around the telescope that found the planet.

It doesn't matter what they name it though, as soon as the colonists set up their own government and society they'll rename the planet themselves, likely based on some planetary phenomenon or shared common experience.

True,[deleted],,,"Thanks for your post. I have always been fairly slim-average so when I see larger people I tend to wonder 'how?' .. I appreciate the length you went to in order to explain. I hope that doesn't sound condescending. I'm aware that I have been a judgemental fuck in the past and I realise it's not fair or reasonable so I'm working on that. Your post helps immensely.

I realise that one random person on the internet can't change deep seated issues, but honestly, it's not for you to decide if someone else would be 'settling'. If someone is interested in you, and you like them back, take the risk. You are worthy of love and men's tastes are pretty varied. You might not have as much interest as the 120lb model but that doesn't mean 'none'.

The fact that it went badly *once* means little. Most of us have been rejected or dumped at one time or another, even the most beautiful models.

I understand these feelings to some degree, I can relate and have had similar.. but I am not fat... my point is just that you can't blame being fat for everything wrong. I think that things like being outcasted at school will have a deep impact on you and maybe you are just depressed in general. Focusing on the weight as the source of all of your problems and then deciding you *can't* fix it is just .. it's frustrating to see. You can fix it, if you want to badly enough. Losing weight isn't easy but it's possible. And I can see why you would hate your body but again, I think that will get in the way of being motivated to look after it properly. I think your body still provides much to appreciate - you can think, walk, talk, go to work, still enjoy lots of things.

True,EvanRWT,,,"&gt;the fastest manned vehicular speed is just under 25,000mph, achieved by a lunar module using the moon's gravity as a slingshot effect (which obviously could not be sustained for any length of time worth being mentionned

The moon's slingshot effect might not be sustainable, but the velocity you gain from it is yours forever, all the way to Tau Ceti if you want.

The reason why 25,000 mph for the lunar module is the fastest manned vehicle speed is because manned spacecraft have **only** been to the moon. What else is there to compare to?

However, using planets or moons as a gravitational boost is a tried and tested technique, which we use all the time on unmanned spacecraft. There is no magical difference between manned and unmanned spacecraft, the same principles apply. Using gravitation boosts, the fastest speeds we have reached are about 70,000 mph, with [Helios 2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helios_probes). This isn't the limit, either. This is just what was needed for the mission profile of those probes. You could get a lot more if you specifically designed an interstellar mission. There's a lot of stuff on the way out the solar system - imagine the boost you could get from slingshotting Jupiter or the other gas giants. Or just head towards the Sun, get a couple slingshots off that before heading out. Use Jupiter on the way out for an extra boost.

Nobody is going to the stars with Apollo technology, that's for sure. However, in principle, there's no physical law preventing us from traveling to the stars with more reasonable travel times. If you want to reduce travel times by a large factor, you have to go with nuclear drives. [Project Orion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Orion_%28nuclear_propulsion%29) studied [nuclear pulse propulsion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_pulse_propulsion) before it was stopped by the Test Ban Treaty. Basically you drive the spacecraft by a sequence of controlled nuclear explosions behind it. Freeman Dyson calculated that you could reach 8-10% of light speed with this method.

At 8% of light speed, you could reach the nearest stars in about 100 years, spending half that time accelerating to the midway point and the other half decelerating from midway to destination. That's not too many generations. By the time we contemplate something like that, we may well have some sort of hibernation technology that allows astronauts to sleep for most of the voyage, so it could even be done in a single generation.

The point is, none of this goes against any laws of physics that we know of. None of it requires inventing a whole new kind of technology that we can't even imagine yet (except maybe the hibernation part). A bunch of people in Project Orion or the later [Project Daedalus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Daedalus) did the calculations and showed it was quite possible to do it even using the materials available at the time, 50+ years ago. We've come a lot farther since then, and no doubt will advance more before we contemplate such voyages. The chief problem, of course, was cost.

So when I read stuff about finding possibly habitable planets at 4 LY or 12 LY, I don't necessarily think ""can't possibly happen, 13,000 generations is inane"". Yes, 13,000 generations is silly, but that's for Apollo, and we already know we're not going there on Apollo. I think the technology to get to our closer stars is certainly possible, and even within reach. If not now, then in a hundred years. The bigger problem is the cost and the will to go there. There's a hell of a lot more exploration we could have done of our own solar system since Apollo in these past 50 years, but it hasn't been a priority. NASA's budget is about $17 billion annually right now. Meanwhile, we spent about $3.2 - $4.0 trillion dollars in direct and indirect costs on the Iraq/Afghanistan wars, about 200-250x more than on NASA. We could have had several manned Mars missions and probably a small base on Mars for less. Heck, we spend over $7 billion a year just on buying potato chips.

True,JorusC,,,"The Silmarillion is a pretty cool book. It reads like the Bible, with huge eons being spanned in a paragraph, then sudden zoom-ins to watch the life of a single character play out.

In short, though, Eru (God) sang a song with his choir of angels (Ainur) which described the nature of reality through its time stream. At some point one of the angels, Melkor (Lucifer), decides that he wants to sing his own song, and some of the other Ainur follow him. Eru works the dissonance into his song, creating even greater beauty out of the conflicting melodies.

When the song ends, Eru says, ""Nice work, gang. Now here's what that looks like!"" and creates the universe, using the song as a template. Then he says, ""Why don't some of you Ainur head on down to Earth and make sure everything goes according to plan? It'll be fun!""

So a bunch of Ainur go down to Earth and become Valar, basically manifested gods who are still answerable to Eru the Almighty. These are the Middle Earth pantheon, like Mount Olympus's cast or the Norse gods. They help guide the first Elves and then direct the Elves to help the first humans. (One of the Valar creates the Dwarves because he wants to be all creative like his daddy, and when he screws them up, Eru reprimands him for getting above his station but grants the Dwarves life because he was doing it with good intentions.)

Meanwhile, Melkor goes down to Earth to crap all over everything because he's become a giant jerky jerkface. His physical manifestation is called Morgoth, and he's basically Satan with a giant flail that opens lava pits. He takes his evil Valar and causes all sorts of havoc, messing with the Elves and trying to destroy the humans because screw everything.

So the Ainur are angels, and the Valar are Ainur who came down to Earth. Among those Valar are another tier of dudes called the Maiar. They're basically the bottom rung of angels, the least powerful of them. They tend to be about as powerful as the most powerful Elves. (In fact, one of the Elven kings gets super-pissed and challenges Morgoth to a one-on-one, and he damn near wins. The Elves used to hulk out and rock faces.) Among the Maiar are the Wizards (Gandalf, Saruman, Radagast, and the Blue Twins), Sauron, and the Balrogs.

Sauron was actually one of the dagnasty evil Maiar that followed Melkor down. That's right, the great evil of Lord of the Rings was actually a lackey for the big guy.

The big guy fought with the Elves who, at the time, were actually so hard-core that they could challenge him. Eventually the good Valar were like, ""Screw it,"" and beat the piss out of Melkor and his armies of Balrogs. That's right. Armies. Of. Balrogs.

Once that was done, they kinda retired back and let humanity and Elfanity and Dwarfanity take care of themselves. They sent in a handful of Maiar, though, as special agents to make sure everything runs smoothly. Those Maiar became the Wizards (or Istari if your'e a filthy Elf). Once again, Gandalf, Saruman, Radagast, and the two Blue Wizards are immortal lesser angels.

So the Valar retire back to Valinor (their little paradise that only Elves can find) and let everything play out. Yadda yadda, the Elves start waning in power until they're the flaky little wisps we see in the movies, humanity waxes and wanes, OMG Sauron!, One Ring crap, Hobbit is Super Effective!, hooray the world is saved, Elves get bored being not-awesome and go back home to Valinor where they originally lived among the Valar.

There's a lot more to it than that, and it's really worth a read. But that's a quick brief, and I think that knowing the spiritual side really helps you understand where everything stands in the world.

True,alaskamiller,,,"You will only see this if you've been around enough to see the datapoints and connect them into a pattern or story like a star constellation. So here goes.

Old Reddit had more discussions with occasional jokes, it was home to nerds that relished truth and pedantry. A social refuge because something they don't warn you is how isolating truth is, being smart is an isolating experience in a world full of the opposite of smart. 

But I believe people then figured out jokes played better, pithy and witty are easier to understand while hard, complex thoughts requires more energy and creativity. Adulation and acceptance is perhaps one of the driving motivation we now value karma points, hell, of any metric or badging. A fake illusion of something, anything that we wish it to be.

The crowds now changed as Reddit mainstreamed and gained popularity. So in theory, what was once a place full of smart keeps getting dragged down to dumb. We are now in the pop period of nerd/geek/dorkdom. Jokes play more to the mainstream and younger kids who never experienced the extreme isolation of yonder, where consumption and buying is confused as an identity, essentially this place has turned into an episode of Big Bang Theory. But media is a lifestyle for sale and Reddit is very much life, as much as how Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, or even 4chan streams feed other groups of kids every day, noon, night like television to my generation. It didn't start out that way, at first it felt like a glitch but that glitch has now infested the system as a whole. 

I grew up and have less time to play on here and am re-experiencing culture shock. The popular opinions have changed, the culture has changed, the customs have changed. But the biggest culture shock is how inevitably it all becomes reposts, again and again and again. Once you've exhausted your curiosity and optimism, there's only harsh cynicism left. It's like a junkie maxing out from mainlining and no longer maintaining.

Heck, you questioning it now is a repost of something I've saw again and again of over the past six years. And in turn my answer has been the same answer given over the past six years. In 4chan culture they called you cancer. 

It's very human to try to make things last, ordered, and stable in midst of being surrounded by so much chaos and disorder. For us internet people, look at it as a context that the internet as a big open sea. You start a waterworld somewhere, see it grow into a metropolis, realize the lights and noise created by others isn't to your liking so you push on. Or accept. But in accepting realize you're going to be marginalized and the majority will always do what it's best for them, not you.

Sometimes, though rarely, those that push on manage to survive and create something new and edgy. And then that grows to replace the incumbent. Just like how reddit replaced forums, the usenets, the bbs, the telephone. It happens again, and again, and again. In startup culture it's adapt or die. In hipster culture it's just death.

All in all, it's a combination of othering, mainstreaming, maturing. Or in other words and ultimately the reason why anything sucks: it's all the kids' fault. One day you will blame the next generation for everything that is wrong. That's when you know you've turned old, because remember, remember, new is everything old.

True,LueyCharles,,,"I'm in Sydney, and initially I assumed I would have had a rough time with  diagnosis but surprisingly, no problems. 

Best thing I ever did was get a second opinion. I honest to god had no idea it could have been ADHD, and genuinely thought I was lazy, encourage bad habits etc so the first person I saw was a hypnotherapist.

He suggested ADHD and that I see a psychologist. I then went to a ADHD clinic in Sydney, where they diagnosed me. They recommended CBT. I was a bit doubtful, so I sought a second opinion from a local psychologist in my area who did not specialise in adult ADHD. She confirmed the diagnosis of the first but recommended medication followed by CBT. 

Finally, 3 weeks later had a psychiatrists appointment to discuss medication. This woman was lovely and did her own diagnosis, and without a doubt confirmed ADHD. All this transpired over 4 months - 4 hypnotherapist appointments, 1 ADHD clinic, 2 local psychologist appointments and a psychiatrist appointment. 

The only resistance I had was my first GP appointment to get a mental health care plan filled for medicare. I don't like going to the GPs in my area for anything more than medication prescriptions or a physical problem because I haven't been long enough to develop a good relationship, I have always felt like a number. So this appointment was in between the 2 second opinion appointments. He said it was just depression and that I should have confirmed depression with a psychiatrist because psychologists are not doctors. Yeah, no. Thankfully my psychiatrist treats me full time.

True,rex8499,,2015 Subaru STI,"**Which feels faster, torque or horsepower?**

People love to talk about ""feeling"" torque or ""feeling"" horsepower. There’s no denying that with a lot of torque, when you put your foot down, you feel an immediate response at low RPM. There are tons of analogies, most of which fall short. What you really FEEL is the pressure of your back against the seat behind you, as well as the balance of your inner ear which helps detect acceleration. This pressure on your back is from the car accelerating. YOU cannot accelerate with the car until the car pushes on you, via the seat. So that's what you FEEL. And then once you are accelerating, your inner ear also notes this and tells your brain that you’re accelerating.

Torque at the wheels is the real operator that causes the forces for acceleration, but you have to have high enough horsepower to weight ratio to feel that work being done and feel acceleration. 
If you increase engine power at any given speed, you increase acceleration (regardless of engine torque). That's why downshifting to increase power results in greater acceleration (even if you make less engine torque after the downshift). By downshifting, you're doing two things. A) increasing your RPM, which leads to greater horsepower as the engine is making torque more times per second, and B) increasing your torque at the wheels (even though engine torque may have decreased at that higher RPM) by adding more leverage through the gearbox.

Think about a freight train. HUGE torque in those massive turbo diesel engines powering electric motors. Even a lot of horsepower, but IMMENSE mass. You barely feel the acceleration because the horsepower to weight ratio is not very good. 

 Or if you took a very small engine, with low torque, but it was (for arguments sake) a screamer that could spin to 100,000,000 RPM. The amount of horsepower that it would create by making that torque so many times per minute would rocket you down the road. You'd FEEL plenty of acceleration even though the torque was low.  Taking our horsepower equation, if that little engine made only 5 ft-lbs of torque, the big V8 muscle car guys will laugh at that figure. But how much horsepower do you have? Lets see….around 95,000 Horsepower.  Once you get your engine RPM’s up, I think you’ll be winning that drag race. The high torque car will pull away quickly at the line and you’ll start off at snails pace (assuming you could even move at all with only 5ft-lbs of torque to start off with), but eventually you’d rocket past them like a blur.

A motorcycle doesn’t have high torque with that small engine, and it doesn’t make a whole lot of horsepower either. But it’s weight is minimal so the horsepower to weight ratio is excellent, allowing it to accelerate very quickly.  Strangely enough, if you’ve ever ridden a motorcycle, the FEEL of the seat pressing against your back that you equate in a car with fast acceleration isn’t present. You have no seat back. Instead, that pressure is all in your fingers or friction under your butt. So even though you make be accelerating faster than most cars, it can FEEL slower because you’re missing your typical gauge.

Also with motorcycles, comparing the 2 liter Harley with lots of torque, it feels like it has great power and throttle response from the git go. But it only revs to 9k RPM. In a race against a Yamaha R1, which has only a 1 liter engine and less torque, but it revs to 16k RPM, which makes a lot more torque per second (horsepower) later on in the race than the Harley and will probably win the drag race if the length is not super short.
So that nearly concludes my lesson, but there are other factors of interest too for those that want to read on.


**So when looking at a dyno graph, why does torque vary with RPM?** 

Usually, the torque starts off pretty high at lower RPM’s and then gradually decreases as an engine speeds up. Why does this happen?  If the torque of an engine stayed constant throughout the RPM speed, we could achieve much higher Horsepower figures, but we live in an imperfect world.

Well, there are many factors at play here, but I’ll address what I suspect are two of the big ones. I’m a civil engineer, not a mechanical engineer, so maybe there are other big factors that others can chime in on as well.

#1: Engines are designed to be most efficient at certain speeds. Air and explosions can only move so fast. When you design the timing, lift, and duration of the valves opening into each cylinder, there are many factors to balance.  Car manufacturers want their best efficiency where the car will be cruising the most, at lower RPM’s. So as the RPM’s go higher out of that cruising range, the efficiency of moving all that air through the engine starts to decrease, which leads to decreased torque.  When you think about how fast air is going in, being compressed, and ignited in an engine, it’ll make your head spin. Nine Thousand RPM’s doesn’t sound all that much, right? But how many times is an explosion happening in each cylinder every second at that speed?  The spark plug fires every other revolution, or 4500 times per minute per cylinder, or 75 times per second.  Wait…what?  Really? Are there really 75 explosions PER SECOND in each cylinder???  Holy S#!* !!! Your eyes can only register about 60 images per second, so if you could look inside a cylinder, you’d only see constant fireball rather than individual explosions. No wonder a small engine making low torque can make so much power at high RPM’s. That’s a lot of explosions per second, and a lot of power!

Some manufacturers address the efficiency at high RPM by adjusting the timing, lift, and duration of the valve openings. Systems like VTEC or VVTi are doing just that. Trying to move more air through the engine more efficiently at high RPM to preserve that torque at high RPM’s.

#2: Explosions can only happen so fast. In fact, the expanding fireball speed it pretty much constant no matter how fast the engine is revolving. As such, by the time the fireball is fully developed and exerting maximum pressure against the piston, the piston will be in different positions depending on engine speed.  

The piston position which exerts the most torque on the crankshaft is when the crankshaft arm is as 90 degrees (horizontal) to the vertical motion of the piston, as shown in that very first image. Let’s look at it again. 

[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/qrUOU)

But, as the engine rotates, that torque arm length starts to decrease.  The only length that counts is the horizontal length which is perpendicular to the motion of the piston.

[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/opDlC)

When the crankshaft arm is at the 12 O’Clock position, the piston has no leverage arm at all (but other pistons down the line do at this time to keep things spinning). D3 shows the lack of torque arm at the 6 O’Clock position, which is also the same lack of torque arm at the 12 O’Clock position.  This is approximately when the spark plug will fire and start the explosion.

When the crankshaft reaches the 9 O’Clock Position, the torque arm is shown as D1. The explosion should be near it’s maximum force at this point, as it’s still trying violently to expand and all of the fuel is ignited by now. And it just so happens that at this point, it’s torque arm is at it’s best possible length. So the maximum force, combined with the maximum torque arm length = the maximum torque created.

As the crankshaft continues to rotate and reaches the 7:30 O’Clock position, there is still a lot of force pressing down on the piston, but the torque arm (D2) is now decreasing in length again, giving less torque.

As the crankshaft continues to rotate and reaches the 6 O’Clock position, the force of the explosion is nearly exhausted, and the torque arm (D3) of the crankshaft is now back to zero length, giving zero torque.

So when the engine is spinning at low speeds, all of that works out pretty well.  But, as the RPM speeds increase, the speed of the expanding fireball stays constant.  So at high RPM’s, maximum force downward on the piston may not occur until later in the cycle. If the engine was rotating fast enough, and the fireball wasn’t fully ignited until the D2 postion, we’ve lost out on some potential torque as we missed the maximum force combined with the maximum torque arm length.  And that’s another factor why I think an engines torque starts to decrease as rotational speeds increase.

**Let’s briefly mention another important factor: Gearing.**

Gears are torque multipliers. Each set of gears in a transmission are essentially a funny shaped circular wrench that gives you a longer wrench to increase your torque that you can apply to that bolt (the wheel in a car’s case). Gearing can have a huge affect on how much acceleration you feel. You can make a big high torque-low horsepower engine and a small high revving low torque-high horsepower engine accelerate the same with the right gearing. It’s like a big strong man twisting a bolt with a short wrench, vs a 5 year old girl twisting that same bolt with a much longer wrench.  Both people are going to twist that bolt, and do the same amount of work on that bolt. One is going to twist it with strength, the other with leverage, but the amount of work being done is the same.  And that’s one reason a 4-cylinder car and a V8 car can both accelerate equally fast if things are set up right on the 4-cylinder. With the right gearing, a small engine could pull a freight train. It would just take a many revolutions of the engine before the train noticeably moved. You reach a point where the limiting factor is not the torque or horsepower of the engines, but the grip of the tires, which is the same if both cars are using the same tires.

Yes, most V8’s are faster than most 4-cylinders. And most 5 year old girls don’t have 8ft long wrenches in their toolbox either. There are other factors (like gas mileage) that come into play when deciding on gearing design. 

**In Summary**

Torque - A twisting force

Horsepower - Power, A measurement for work, dependent on torque and RPM.

Acceleration - Dependent on horsepower to weight ratio.

Gearing - A torque multiplier.

He took the reigns from an un-elected president who had been appointed after the resignation of, not just Nixon, but also Agnew, a twisted fuck who resigned and pled no contest to bribery charges.  So, the eyes of the American public were severely jaundiced at this point.
    Also, one needs to look at the national hang-over caused by the division hanging in the air after the end of the Vietnam war.  Mighty America had just been chased out of a small, comparatively primitive, south-east Asian country.  That took an enormous toll on our national psyche, and also led to the idea that we were no longer invincible internationally and encouraged OPEC to use our thirst for oil against us in our support for Israel.  And believe me, nothing takes the wind out of your sails like gas rationing.  I remember the days when, in many places across the US, your ability to get gas was determined by the last number on your license plate: odd numbers could get gas on one day, even numbers on the alternate.  
     Economically, we were faced with a bloated and outdated industrial base.  Manufacturing equipment, material and techniques were out-dated and inefficient.  Business leadership equally so.  Frankly, the stuff we made was crap, and the manufacturers couldn't be bothered to give a shit.  The Ford Pinto and its explosive surprise, while probably the most extreme example, wasn't alone in its craptacularity.  You bought the things they made because you didn't have a choice.  Seriously, what were you going to do?  Buy a Japanese car?  Oh, shit.  Wait.  
     Additionally, the whole country was basically a shithole.  Infrastructure was crumbling, the cities were becoming an urban wasteland due to white-flight to the suburbs, and fucking RIVERS were catching on FIRE because they were so polluted.  Lead was in the paint and in our fuel, asbestos was everywhere, and polyester leisure suits seemed like an awesome fashion choice.  Seriously, white belts and matching shoes were as much of a national tragedy as the Cuyahoga River.
     So, there you are, James Earl Carter, taking the wheel of this bus on January 20th, 1977.  You have the best of intentions, but the only thing you can do to fix anything is to tell people exactly what they don't want to hear.  Conserve energy.  Don't pollute.

True,ladywithadd,RED,ADHD-PH,"I feel your pain. I'm Australian and I was referred to a psychiatrist in my early 20s by my GP who suspected that my anxiety/depression was related to my ADHD going undiagnosed. I forked out $250 per session to see this guy who kept getting me to talk but refused to give me medication because of my past drug history, which I was honest about. He said that no one was going to diagnose and treat someone with ADHD who has taken recreational drugs. So I left it at that and completely forgot about it.

Several years later, I've relocated to Canada, and I'm dragged kicking and screaming into a clinic specialising in addiction and ADHD. I won't go into details, but let's just say that I had hit rock bottom and needed help. After a six-week assessment period, I was given the diagnosis of severe ADHD and depression (whatever ""severe"" means in that context) and started on a course of Concerta. My life has not been the same since.

I'm no longer moody and depressed, I'm working hard to chip away at a massive debt I've accumulated due to poor impulse control and generally not being good with money, I no longer wake up in the middle of the night with anxious thoughts about offending someone by blurting out something inappropriate, I get deep quality sleep now that I've never experienced before, and for the first time ever I feel like I'm in control my mind rather than my mind being in control of me. I no longer just want to press the ""off"" button on my life, and I feel hopeful about the future. 

 In Australia, my drug history was a *barrier* to diagnosis and treatment. In Canada, my drug history was a compelling *symptom* of ADHD and enabled my diagnosis and treatment.  My advice to you is this: find a psychiatrist or doctor who specialises in ADHD specifically. Be prepared for a lengthy assessment process that will test your patience. Be prepared to pay lots of money for the specialist appointments and the medication. And don't give up.

True,IWasSurprisedToo,,,"I worked for a while doing insurance coding and billing in a Dermatologist's office. I've heard his tips on acne care so many times, I can repeat them by heart now, so here goes...

* Clean linens. Absolutely essential. If you have common cystic acne, severe enough to warrant going to the Dermatologist, you should be changing your pillowcase every day, and the pillow should have a zip-on cover under that that you wash once a week. If you have acne on your back, shoulders, chest, or buttocks, it's the same story. Linens accrue body oil quickly, especially if you use any kind of softener solution. If you can go without it, don't use the softener products, and stay away from detergents with fragrances. Wash linens in the hottest water possible.

* Do NOT over-cleanse the skin, especially with those exfoliating washes. They break down the horny layer (I know, right?!) of the skin, and the constant assault will only make your oil glands overactive. Cleanse once a day, with a gentle cleanser, and exfoliate no more than once a week.

* Hot long showers. Avoid them. The hot water will provoke the oil glands in your skin, and, ironically, dehydrate it too.

* If you use facial products, try to not use your fingertips to apply them. Use cotton balls or pads. Your fingertips will leave an oily residue, and cross-contaminate the products with bacteria from your skin. Generally avoid touching your face if you can help it, if you have oily skin or are prone to redness.

* Salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide. Choose one. For nearly everyone, the two of them together will dry / irritate your skin, and cause it to peel.

* Comb your hair back, and wash it regularly. The oil from your hair can make forehead acne worse. It can be embarrassing to reveal it if you've been deliberately hiding it with your hair, but it makes a real difference.

* Sunglasses, collars, and hat brims can similarly contain oil that will provoke acne, and the constant rubbing will irritate the skin further.

* Having a diet with a high glycemic load (lots and lots of carbs) can aggravate a case of acne. Also, it's generally unhealthy anyway, so try to cut back.

* Picking at a pimple, pinhead, or blackhead (no matter the technique, this is part of the reason doctors are so reluctant to lance boils if it can be avoided) will almost always result in a scar. Allowing it to heal naturally, no matter how maddening it is, will almost never result in one.

That's what I can remember from my time there, anyway. 
Good luck!

True,Cboy808,,,"We have a 33 panel system that does 100% of our power. Our bill is the minimum 16.xx every month for the last year now. 

I went with alternate energy. The reason we choose them was they were one of the few companies who has been around forever. They were doing solar water before they got into PV. Not just one of these other companies who popped up to take advantage of the PV boom. 

They have a 25 year warranty unlike other companies some of which only give a 5-10 year warranty. 

They do not subcontract the installation, it is done by their own in house people. This means there will be no finger pointing to the contractors later if something goes wrong. 

They install made in Japan, Mitsubishi panels.  They are not selling you some made in china panels and misleading you to believe that they are higher quality panels and charge a premium for like other companies. They also do not sell made in Mexico panels and mislead you to believe they are Japanese, just because the brand name is Japanese.

I found a lot of shady dealings in my research of multiple companies over 6 months of looking. I recommend you do a lot of looking and getting multiple quotes. 

Do not fall for the ""most efficient panel"" marketing bs. The ONLY reason you would pay a premium for a more efficient panel is if you are unable to get your system size you require on your roof space.  Otherwise going to a more efficient panel makes no sense.

True,synapticimpact,ibuki,steam: soulsynapse,"1. Pick a main and stick with it. Unless your main has ridiculously bad matups picking alts is for after you're placing top 8 in tournaments.

2. Start reading frame data. You don't have to wonder if something is safe or unsafe, you can *know* it since all that information is out there. Practice your tight punishes.

3. If you lose to a setup oriented character and you *don't* hit the training room to figure out your options out you won't improve. There is (very often) an option that beats all potential attacks and their option selects, figure it out. Even ibuki isn't a guessing game if you've played against her enough.

4. Start playing offline, at a local scene preferably. Start building your reaction time and reads so you can go from ""throw this out online and hope it works"" to ""he's going to throw cr.mk when I step into his range, lets bait that and punish the wiff."" 99% of serious players play offline because when you're playing online even against the best connections you're dealing with ~30ms or 2 frames of lag which if you're not an offline player might not seem too bad but if you do play offline you realize its a *big* fucking deal. Make sure your monitor isn't laggy too, while you're at it.

5. On that note, start playing with [footsies](http://sonichurricane.com/?page_id=1702) asap. 

6. Make sure you can hit all your links. That means training mode, hours and hours of it. Practice without sound so you can compensate for other people's setups being weird or whatnot. Learn to plink all your inputs.

7. Fight players (online and offline) that are way way better than you. Review your matches or ask somebody who is better than you to skim over it and give you pointers, SRK forums are excellent for this.

That's all I got at the moment I'll add anything if it occurs to me.

True,VictoriaDunn,,,"But it's a universal question, which everyone asks at one point or another in their lives.  Banning the question or getting angry at people for asking it isn't helpful to anyone.  The question simply needs to be answered.

Here's what I tell people when they ask:

**Why doesn't she leave?**

Because she learned when she was very young that bad situations are something you learn to live with, not something you run away from.  Bullied in school?  Only quitters run away!  Make friends, make peace, take your lumps and suck it up.  This is how it works in the real world.

Because she knows, in her heart, that it's her own fault he's so angry.  She knows he get insecure when she goes out drinking with her friends.  Is it really so hard to just respect his wishes and stay in?  He's only looking out for her welfare.

Because she's an optimistic soul, and believes that this is something she can fix if she just tries a little harder.

Because every bad situation is different, and there's a million good reasons why this one isn't really abusive.  (For starters, it doesn't exactly match the circumstances described in that Very Special Episode of Law and Order she saw last week.)

Because she's ashamed and afraid everyone will blame her for creating this situation.  After all, she's heard what his friends say about his exes and she doesn't want to be lumped in with those skanky, horrible bitches.

Because she's afraid he'll hurt her if she tries to leave.

Because she's got nowhere to go and leaving is scarier than staying.

Because most of the time he's really nice, and treats her better than anyone else in her life.

Because he has so many good qualities, and everyone else loves him.

Because the children need him.

Because he needs her, and couldn't survive without her.  He might even kill himself if she leaves, and who could live with that?

Because he's hurting, too.

Because it sometimes seems that every damn Disney cartoon, romance novel and soap opera tells young boys and girls that obsessive, stalkerish, controlling behaviour is how you know he loves you, and dickish behaviour is a symptom of a wounded soul that can only be healed by the love of a good woman (or man).  (Twilight, I'm looking at you!)

And finally because staying too long in a crummy situation isn't something only women do.  Men stay in abusive situations for exactly the same reasons as women - shame, fear, responsibility, optimism, compassion, and love.  Children learn at home and in school that there's no escape from the people who are hurting you, and that pain is the price you pay for love.

It's universal, and a horribly difficult problem to solve.  And yes, sometimes the victims of spousal violence frustrate us and make us feel like we're banging our heads against brick walls.  But the solution isn't to blame them, because that'll only perpetuate the cycle.

Instead, teach your own children that it's not okay to be bullied, even if the bully is a parent or a friend or a teacher.  Teach them that they never, ever have to stay in a bad situation.  They always have the right to walk away.  Teach them that they won't be punished for speaking their mind.  Teach them to be critical thinkers.  Teach them that they have value and worth and dignity.  Try to use force and manipulation sparingly in your parenting.  Show them, by example, what a loving adult relationship looks like.  Raise them in the kind of home you hope them to have when they're grown.

And then go donate to your local women's shelter or spousal violence advocacy group.

True,[deleted],,,"Well, let's see...

I met a beautiful girl at a bar. She was gorgeous. And we played pool, and had a good night. We were both drunk, so I didn't think much of it. But we exchanged numbers.

I called her the next day and we made a date to go out. Meet at the same bar, and get to know each other. We had a great time.

As I was leaving some guy was outside, yelling and screaming at the sky. Pissed at who knows what. I kind of mocked his angry-ness, and laughed it off. Me and the girl and my friend got into the car. Turns out, crazy guy pulled out in front of us. We were all headed to my friends apartment. We pulled out of the lot, behind crazy guy. Got to the next light, behind crazy guy. And made the same turn, as crazy guy. We ended up at the same apartment complex, as crazy guy. I was slowing, looking for a spot, when crazy guy gets out of his car screaming at me for following him. I get out of the car, somewhat pissed, but mostly confused. I figure I can explain or at least tell him to calm the fuck down. 

No, that's not what happened at all. He just socks me in the head. And I fall to the ground. He kicks me in the face, over, and over, and over, and over again. I look up and he hits the girl I'm on a date with. My friend stays in the car. I eventually get up, and get to the car. My windshield is covered in blood. Blood splatter everywhere. 

I go to a motel. Take off my clothes. Blood on my undershirt, my boxers. My shoes. 

What the fuck. What kind of first date is this?

Yeah... that sucked. I didn't die I guess. But that sucked. I ended up dating the girl for about a year. She eventually left me for an ex boyfriend when I moved out of state for a month. And that sucked too. And I got back with an old ex, who ended up leaving me for someone else. And that also sucked. But I ended up with a nice girl, who ended up leaving me with a mortgage to pay myself. And that sucked. Then my father died, and that sucked. During the depression of losing my dad, I was laid off from my job, and that really sucked. And now here I am, drinking budwieser and Jim Beam with my 2 dogs in an empty house talking to people I don't know on the internet.

Per the above, *weak atheists* reject belief in deities.

*Strong atheists* hold the position that deities do not exist. While this is an ""unprovable"" assertion, in that we cannot search the universe in its entirety, nor step ""outside"" it in order to demonstrate its truth, it is no different in principle from asserting that unicorns or leprechauns do not exist. 

Those asserting that a god or god exists bear the burden of proof to demonstrate their claim is true. Until evidence in favor of the assertion is presented, one can *reasonably conclude* that gods are fictional entities. Additionally, evidence in support of the contention that gods are fictional/do not exist comes from neurology and psychology: we are wired to instinctively *assume agency* to explain unexplained phenomena, from sociology, in that humans develop god-beliefs as a cultural practice (stemming from the previous), and in the historical failure for *any* claim of a divine act or miracle to withstand scientific scrutiny. 

There is no evidence that any god that has ever been proposed exists, and plenty that they have all been made up by human beings.

*Tools of Screenwriting* is incredibly clear and well written, breaking down all of the narrative concepts and then going over the plots of several films to show you how they've been successfully implemented and tweaked.

*The Art of Dramatic Writing* has a strong focus on character development, and includes what is called 'Bone Structures.'  According to Egri, if you know the three dimensions of your character -- the physical, social, and psychological, then your character is real enough to be put into any plot and react in a natural manner.

*Poetics* is the other side of the coin, and that focuses on plot much more so than character.  Those are the two main elements of drama.  Plot and character.  Plot defines character, character drives plot.  It's a chicken &amp; the egg type thing.

*Hero With A Thousand Faces* is a good way to wrap your head around the classic hero's tale.  Most popular example of this would be *Star Wars.*  You don't necessarily have to read the book (there are documentaries based on it), even the Wikipedia article will give you a good idea, but it's a book worth having if you ever attempt to write your own hero's journey.

True,Frostiken,,,"This is a post I've been wanting to make for a while. First of all, some background. I'm active duty Air Force. Deployed twice to Afghanistan and one to Aviano in support of OEF, OOD, and OUP. I was stationed at Bagram AFB in direct support of F-15 operations (much respect to any veterans in the field, I sent my love with every GBU-12 my pod directed). I carried a rifle, SAPIs, and got bombarded with mortars. I've never had a shoot a guy, though one incident came close. I voted for Obama twice. I'm an atheist, pro-choice, pro-gay-rights gun-lover.

I've heard the arguments on both sides. In fact, I used to make the arguments for the other side. I understand why, to someone with no interest in guns or who never had to carry or ever even used one, why they would find them distasteful. Incidents like Sandy Hook hardly help matters, as it just serves to underscore deeply-rooted opinions people already have. The anti-guns hear about them and think that it makes their position even more righteous. Thus, it makes defeating such opinions difficult.

I'm just going to cruise right on through to some main talking points here.

First of all, the nature of the second amendment. Neither you nor I are qualified to properly interpret the second amendment. Only the Framers could, and the Framers chose a Supreme Court to make doubly sure, and like it or not the Supreme Court decided that the second amendment is what it is and it will not be going away any time soon. So any of you who are 100% anti-gun and are in favor of total disarmament... I'm sorry but there's simply no point to even having an argument with you. It cannot happen. Furthermore, the best translations of the second amendment are what we can get through writings of the Founding Fathers such as George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. They make it fairly clear as to what the purpose the second amendment was:

""I ask, Sir, what is the militia? It is the whole people. To disarm the people is the best and most effectual way to enslave them."" -George Mason, Co-author of the Second Amendment
""Those who hammer their guns into plowshares will plow for those who do not."" -Thomas Jefferson
""The best we can help for concerning the people at large is that they be properly armed."" -Alexander Hamilton
""No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms…"" -Thomas Jefferson

The second amendment was implemented in part to ensure that the government could never completely rule its people, that there would always be a way to fight back against tyranny. Now while you may say that one redneck with a shotgun is no threat, what about a hundred rednecks? A thousand? What about 1,064,000? There's another bright side to the second amendment:

“You cannot invade the mainland United States. There would be a rifle behind each blade of grass.” -Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto

While you could argue that a person defending their home doesn't need a semi-automatic rifle, and a hunter doesn't need 15-round magazines, the truth is that the second amendment says nothing about protecting your home or hunting meat. It's purpose is to fight a standing military, and strictly, as far as the second amendment is concerned, mandates the necessity of modern armaments. Did the Framers know about machine guns back then? No, of course not. But they also didn't know about layered ceramic / kevlar armor. A citizen with a rifle will not topple an army, but I know of no army that would possibly dare to put boots in mainland America, because they would be spilling blood every inch of the way. After all, was not a musket the pinnacle of handheld firearm technology? They thought that a minuteman with a musket, the modern equivilent of a soldier with an M-4, was sufficient power for citizens to have. You can chose to believe that it's not ""what they intended"", but actions speak louder than intent, and I don't recall any instances of confiscating muskets and only allowing Blunderbusses.

This segues nicely into my point about regulation of arms itself. Yes, it's true that only few hunters (mostly boar) need a semi-automatic rifle. And it's true that no sane person would defend themselves with a semi-automatic rifle. A stray bullet from an AR-15 could literally punch a hole through three houses before lodging in a stud. The general principle is that there is no serious need for these weapons. But that doesn't mean to ban them.

I constantly hear the anti-gunners make the same counter-arguments: ""Oh you can't compare it to drugs, because ____"" or ""You can't compare it to a car, because a car has more purpose"". The fact is that both comparisons are valid.

The drug argument is valid because it underscores the futility of outlawing them. Australia, Japan, and Britain have highly-successful anti-gun laws. Australia, Japan, and Britain are also islands with a limited number of controlled access points that are easily screened. The United States has two of the largest land borders on earth, and one borders a country that sometimes seems to border on pure anarchy. This is on top of the classical sea and air borders, as well as the simple fact that the United States is mind-boggling huge with its population spread from one coastline to the other, not packed into a handful of coastal cities like Australia. As long as criminals can be assumed to have guns, no citizen should lose his ability to defend himself, even if it's only a slim chance of it. No government should deem that someone ELSE'S life is more valuable than your OWN, which is essentially what a gun ban is dictating.

The second argument, concerning cars, is because the car argument isn't refined enough. Yes, cars serve many purposes, but so do guns. Guns are tools, and are deadly in the wrong hands, much the same as cars, but this is a weak argument. More specifically, however, should be the distinction between cars, and high-performance cars. Guns, and semi-automatic rifles. There is absolutely no purpose to a semi-automatic rifle, much like there is no purpose to a high-performance car. A high-performance car isn't designed to carry goods or passengers. Its only purpose is to obey the law and use it only in tightly controlled racing circumstances, or to break the law and engage in speeding, reckless driving, and running from the police which overall endangers lives. Speeding is one of the highest causes of accidents, and car accidents far outweigh gun fatalities. In 2001 there were over 300 fatalities related to illegal street racing in San Diego alone.

If we can argue that a semi-automatic rifle has no real PURPOSE, and its presence is a threat to lives, why are we also not arguing that a 400-horsepower turbocharged street racing car that can double the highest speedlimit in the country is not also completely purposeless and a threat to lives? Should not every law-abiding, sensible person think it's acceptable to forbid manufacturers from making cars with more than two such ""racing"" features, including 5-point-harnesses, turbochargers, spoilers, carbon-fiber body elements? Should not everyone be happy to have the government install a speed governor that limits them to no more than 65 MPH, and make all the owners of such high-performance vehicles report in to the local DMV for investigations into their personal lives for their ""right"" to drive whatever car they damn-well want to drive?

The fact is, I own an AR-15 for the same reason I drive a mid-performance luxury car. Because I *can* and I *want* to own them. I don't hunt (too much work), but I enjoy target shooting. I would never think of using my AR-15 for personal defense, because it's way too impractical. Like a high-performance car, a semi-automatic rifle is a luxury that exists for pleasure, and that pleasure comes with an element of danger. If we can accept that souped-up Mustangs are a necessary evil for living the American Dream, then we can also accept a tiny handful of incidents as a necessary evil to uphold the second amendment.

After the test they all got mad at me for refusing to grade on a curve because all but like 4 of them got that question wrong.

True,thorstad,,,"Sauce: Son of an amputee, brother of a guy who make prosthetics for a living.  The tech these days is insanely life changing.  Whatever discomfort or disease is taking your limbs, they will be replaced by something stronger and faster than what you were ever born with.  

There are major support groups out there.  Amps have good times, and generally have a twisted sense of humor that is offsetting and hysterical.  Find these people, even before your surgery.

Small example of where you will be after getting over the stump: my dad, who is retired, has a single digit handicap in golf, and is skiing powder tomorrow.  My brother makes prosthetics for world-class river folks that kick my ass down any river on a boat and up any mountain on a bike.  

Find a community, get off your ass, and kick fucking ass.  Losing a chunk of your body will only define you in a negative way if you let it do so.

True,[deleted],,,"Okay, American here so some of the rules might vary and it actually took me a minute to realize that ""preference shares"" were the equivalent of ""preferred stock"" here. ""Loan stock"" would be what we call bonds. I even remember doing those problems, but can't remember the exact steps. Basically, you're going to run the numbers for each option and see which one comes out the best. For each option, you're raising 100 million and each year your gross profit will be 20 million higher - this doesn't change between the options. So for #1 for question B (basically create new columns on your sheet), 2.50 per share means (100mil/2.5)=40 million new shares, so when you're calculating earnings per share you have to divide by a higher number (previous shares + 40 mil). Do the same for the other two: How do preference shares affect the sheet - what entries change? Ditto loan stock, which will change the interest charge.

It's been a while since I've done these and I'm not sure what you're doing lines up exactly with what I learned, but that's the general idea behind what you need to do.

""A growing number""? This does not bode well...

&gt;Lots of guys, 20s or so, can't get it up anymore with a real girl, and they all relate having a serious porn/masturbation habit

It'd be pretty tough to find a ""20s or so"" guy who does **not** have a ""serious porn/masturbation habit""

&gt;Threads relating to this issue are springing up all over the Web on bodybuilding, medical help, and pick-up artist forums

...

&gt;Due to the overwhelming emails and requests we have received

And more...

&gt;Desperate young men from various cultures, with different levels of education, religiosity, attitudes, values, diets, marijuana use, and personalities are seeking help

How exactly are those related and why have I *never* heard of anything like this before if it's supposed to be a major problem of society?

&gt;Many have previously been to doctors, undergone various tests, and been declared ""just fine"" physically.

More uncheckable blah...

&gt;See this 900-post thread and this 300-post one.

Yeah, over 6 years and 4 years, respectively.

&gt;Not long ago, Italian urologists confirmed an erectile dysfunction-porn use connection via a large survey.

A link to an article with no sourcing whatsoever, giving bullshit phrases such as ""experts have said"". Digging further we find no paper, just more articles (the first english one was apparently on Fox News, what a surprise), making the survey pretty much unverifiable. Questions about porn and sexuality in general are prone to skewing if the survey isn't done right, it's a touchy subject.

Also:

&gt;When interviewed about the survey, urologist Carlo Foresta [...] mentioned that 70 percent of the young men his clinic treated for sexual performance problems had been using Internet pornography heavily.

Only 70%? Either 30% were lying or not watching porn increases the risk of erectile dysfunction. Seriously, every young man consumes porn, this is known[source].

&gt;    Middlebury College physician sees rise in ED - blames porn   
    Does Porn Contribute to ED?   
    Study exposes secret world of porn addiction   
    Sexual dysfunction: The escalating price of abusing porn   

I only skimmed the articles, one of them is from *their own site* and only one of them contains a reference to an actual study.... sort of. The study is not done yet, they only have preliminary results which are thus:

&gt;Preliminary results from the study have revealed that 43 percent of those surveyed started to view porn between the ages of 11 and 13, 47 percent spend between 30 minutes and three hours a day watching porn.

Beginning at 11-13 years old and doing it 30mins to 3hours a day hardly sounds representative to me. It also contradicts the italian study which had 2.9% starting at 14 or before, that's quite a significant difference.

&gt;Recent behavioral addiction research

No link, no research.

&gt;In the last decade or so, addiction researchers have discovered

...

Guys, this is a BS article. This woman tries so hard to convince the reader with all sorts of shady phrases and sob stories after every second paragraph, even digging up fucking *forum threads* yet she cannot produce a single study that supports her claims?

Hell, she's not even a doctor, she's a fucking [attorney](http://www.psychologytoday.com/experts/marnia-robinson).

There are lots of reasons for not getting it up, going a little overboard on the fapping can be one, but stress and growing older are just as likely, especially stress. I feel that this is very reminiscent of the ""video games causing violence"" debate, I am annoyed by the suggestion that I cannot tell what is virtual and what is real. My partner's body is not perfect, I wouldn't want to watch that body in porn, but for reality it's just fine.

The subject of porn is highly politicized by conservative/mother/feminist groups and the more politicized an issue is the more attention needs to be paid to proper fact checking. I'm *not* saying that the claims of the article are incorrect; I don't know, I've never heard of that problem before, but it's definitely a shit article.",0,1355974829,,0,1355975028,1,c7jfbdn,t3_154jxl,t1_c7jfbdn,t3_154jxl,,1435655928,719,False,todayilearned,t5_2qqjc,719

True,grammatiker,,,"While a lot of people in this thread joke and write in a stereotypically ""black"" manner, it's of interest to note that this is actually part of a fully-fledged dialect of English (some theorize it may even be a creole) called [African American Vernacular English](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American_Vernacular_English). This variety of English has its own consistent grammar and phonology.

To put it into perspective, other languages don't use ""be"" in these kinds of copula constructions, such as Russian and Arabic.

Essentially, it's not broken English. It's a different English altogether.

I just knew that everything in my life always went wrong.  I always sabotaged my shit, but I couldn't see it that way.  There was a lot of ""*Why meeeeeee?*"" going on.  

I'm not sure exactly what brought about the revelation that made me realize what a wet blanket I was.  I know it coincided with turning thirty, and I know it prompted me to end my abusive relationship (with someone equally  miserable and shitty), quit my job that was making me unhappy and tired, and give up my beautiful hill-top apartment with a view of the mountains.

True,oneiorosgrip,,,"Crying is not a healthy reaction to the circumstance you describe. This is something you should ask her about, not in the context of whether or not it will change her mind, but because it indicates the possibility of an issue she's not telling you about. That doesn't *definitely* mean there is one, but if there is, and it's deep enough to make her cry during a sex act, it's going to impact on your relationship if you don't find out what's on her mind.    
     
If it turns out to be nothing, however, that also indicates a problem. Either she's so fragile that doing something she's not interested in makes her cry, or she's using tears instead of assertion to persuade you to go along with what she wants to do or avoid doing. It's also a bad sign that she feels so entitled to treatment from you that she's not willing to reciprocate that she castigated you for refusing. In connection with your description of her response to giving oral, it indicates a really selfish attitude - a concern focused much more on her own experience and feelings than on yours.    
     
However, your conundrum is not whether you should or should not push her to change her mind... but whether you really want to invest yourself in someone with that kind of attitude toward you.

I explained what happened, I had the e-mail conversation with the scammer saved and I had a postage receipt, but PayPal wouldn't have any of it. Fortunately, I never post anything until the money is in my bank account, so I didn't lose anything. My PayPal account remained locked and they wanted me to repay them for refunding the scammer - yeah, right. Now I just use my girlfriend's account when they're the only payment option.

Just thinking about it makes me angry. You know what? I feel like using Amazon Payments right now just to spite PayPal. Have some Humble Indie Bundle 7 keys:

&gt;Even assuming the government could prove that taking private weapons is for public use, they would have to provide ""just compensation.""

As you've pointed out, that's a pretty big assumption. But, if we make it, what is ""just compensation"" for any other property that has become illegal to own? They need not say ""we're confiscating all the guns""; they need only say ""Gun ownership is now illegal; you have 30 days to responsibly dispose of your illegal property.""

Back to the commerce clause argument, I would point out that it is not the only power under which a de facto gun ban could be enacted. The PPACA doesn't fit under the commerce clause, but it is within Congress's power to tax.  I believe that the NFA was enacted under Congress's power to tax. The NFA created a tax equivalent to ~$3500 in today's dollars on certain items. Can Congress expand the NFA to cover all weapons and move the 1934-established $200 tax to its equivalent,  $3500 today?

FOPA banned automatic weapons that were not registered prior to 1986. Could they expand FOPA to all weapons manufactured after an arbitrary date, say 1 Jan 2013?


Without a constitutional amendment repealing the 2nd Amendment, I don't think Congress has the power to make it impossible to own firearms, but I do think they have the power to semi-arbitrarily increase the price of a Glock from ~$500 to about $10,000. 

What is actually preventing them from doing so is democracy in action. The people don't want gun bans. Congress is listening to the people. Right now, the loudest voices they and we are hearing are knee-jerk reactions to a tragedy, while the vast majority of gun owners are maintaining a respectful silence.

The reason we do this in game is because earth orbit's characteristics are a bit different from Kerbin's. On Kerbin, the surface gravity is 9.8m/s^2, just like on earth. However, unlike earth, orbital velocity is 2.2km/s, instead of 7.7km/s for low earth orbit. This means that the vertical speed gained in KSP is comparatively much larger than that of an earth vessel, and the horizontal speed is much less. Vessels in KSP burn horizontally for a considerably shorter time than those on earth, which makes coasting to apoapsis more efficient, whereas in real life, you need to pick up more horizontal speed and less vertical speed.

True,Contrapaul,,,"**How to shop at Target**
 
Everything at Target goes on sale, and eventually goes to clearance. Typically, an item comes out, goes on the shelf and is priced at X. While at regular price, it will go on sale every couple of weeks, for small discounts. If a shirt is $25, it might go to $22, or $20, or $18, but will hover around it's initial price for a month or two. The best part of deeper discounts and sales is that Target, like other retailers, drops the cost to clear clothes out for the next season. They do this right when you want said item, not too late. For example, in the last month sweaters, flannel shirts, coats, and other such winter/fall apparel have been on sale, and will be moving to clearance soon. It isn't even ""Winter"" yet, but over the next month you can snag Dec/Jan/Feb/March clothes for great discounts, because Target wants to move Spring clothes in soon.
 
When I go to Target I head to clearance first. Smaller stores usually have 2 racks, one marked 30% and one marked 50%. Occasionally they'll have 70% off either on a separate rack, or on the 50% one. Larger stores tend to have all three racks most of the time. These are all great, because they reward you for being a bit patient on items you don't have to buy immediately. In recent months, I grabbed some Odin shirts for 70% off, a [Parka for 50% off](http://i.imgur.com/Ek2ws.jpg), and a crew-neck sweater for 30% off. As the discount gets bigger, items obviously get more and more picked over, so if you're a medium or small you may want to snag things earlier.
 
Clearance items at Target can be returned without issue, just like everything else. Fit is my most common issue, with something feeling and looking right in store, then looking less good at home. This also applies to online orders, though you're out shipping if you paid for it.
 
Lastly, the clearance rack is a great place to snag items to just beat around in, or experiment with. Currently they have some [bright shorts](http://i.imgur.com/DSTak.jpg) they're trying to clear out, that aren't exactly a style item, but would be awesome for a casual spring look, or for playing Chivalry on your PC.
 
**Bonus Items**
 
Target's look and feel extends beyond clothes, and various home goods, kitchen items, and decorative pieces are worth a look. They're a little hyper-aware of their demographic sometimes, and you can occasionally employ the same sale algorithms to unique decor and things like plates or lamps.
 
They sell Timex watches, including the [Weekender](http://i.imgur.com/1ItwZ.jpg) and [Easy Reader](http://i.imgur.com/sGLAL.jpg), so you can pair a simple watch with your clothes, and many sell [Weekender bands](http://i.imgur.com/MdapU.jpg), which work with most nylon strap ready watches. [Tortoise shell wayfarers](http://i.imgur.com/jmnje.jpg) and [simple aviators](http://i.imgur.com/2d9QL.jpg) are also available, along with other sunglasses, for a pretty cheap, if more costly than Amazon price.
 
Shoes at Target are of uneven quality and material, and generally should be avoided. That said, at sale prices, some things like [suede chukkas](http://i.imgur.com/e9PO9.jpg) and [canvas bluchers](http://i.imgur.com/5cpB3.jpg) are ok. As with anywhere, avoid synthetic leather and poor construction. Yes, some things can look attractive- especially if your wallet is empty, and you *really* want to copy some looks, but don't waste your money.
 
Finally, you can grab some other useful things while in store, which aren't exactly unique to Target, but worth noting. [A pull up bar](http://i.imgur.com/w4Vbj.jpg), some [hair products](http://i.imgur.com/uBfdm.jpg), or a [cheap mirror](http://i.imgur.com/2sfmE.jpg) can help improve your look quite a bit with minimal effort and cost.
 
**Takeaways**
 
Target is constantly improving and altering its lines, though they are far less 'fast fashion' than H&amp;M or Express. Their quality is generally good for the price, and similar items from H&amp;M are of inferior construction and material. Clothes will generally not be overly trendy, or feature extra or unnecessary detailing that you can find other places. Unless you find something weird, most things you buy would have looked alright last year, and will look fine next year- which is good for your wallet and your look.
 
The best thing you can use Target for is filling out a void of basics in your closet, and promoting a clean look. Almost everything you can buy is free of branding, distressing, and obnoxious designs. As long as the fit is good, and the color or pattern is too, it's hard to go wrong with most items.

Vegas, baby!  In my own private plane!  Could there be anything cooler?

I'd just recently gotten my Private Pilot License and, just a few weeks before, had bought my first airplane.  I’d already gotten 10 hours of dual instruction in my new craft, but my insurance also required me to fly 10 hours solo before carrying any passengers.  I planned some short trips on my own, the last of which was to Vegas and back.  It’s not a fun city without friends, so I hadn’t planned to stay -- just fly up, get a bite to eat at the airport, and fly home.

My plan was to land at Las Vegas International which lies at the center of a mass of what's called Class B airspace.  Learning to fly around LAX, I’d gained plenty of experience flying near this kind of busy and restrictive airspace … but into it?  Not as much.  I reviewed the charts and mentally prepared to tangle with complex and unfamiliar airspace and its controllers.

It was a sweltering Saturday afternoon.  The weather was perfect, but the instructors standing around the flight school had a concern.

“Make sure you’re hydrated before you go up there,” one said. The route from LA to Vegas goes through the Mojave Desert.  “You don’t want to get light-headed or pass out while you’re flying!  And make sure you have extra water in case you go down.”

Wise advice, it seemed.  I drank a bottle of water.  Then downed a second just to be sure.  For good measure, I also filled a sport bottle with ice water and stuffed it into my flight bag. I lifted off from Santa Monica and pointed the plane towards the mountain pass to Palmdale.  The plane was operating beautifully -- let me tell you, there’s almost nothing that beats flying 165 m.p.h over a highway while the cars underneath you are stuck in traffic.  I settled in at 7,500’ for the 90 minute flight. Vegas, baby!

As I reached the desert I realized a slight flaw in my flight planning.  All that water was having the obvious effect.  I had to pee. *It’s not that bad,* I told myself. *This can wait.  I’m only an hour away from landing.* Vegas!!

Over the next ten minutes my body informed me, no, this wouldn't wait an hour. I tried to focus on the sectional chart but my mind kept wandering to Niagra Falls and the giant Bellagio fountain.  I’d be tangling with Bravo airspace soon but couldn’t even think straight!

OK, I thought.  What are my options?  I looked down and found the only one: my sport bottle.  Step 1 was to empty it.  The only place to do that seemed to be into my stomach. Have you ever tried throwing back a pint of ice water at a time when your bladder feels one turbulent bump away from rupturing?  It’s not easy!  I finally managed to do it, feeling like an overfilled water balloon.

All right.  Almost there.  Now for Step 2: refill the bottle. The air was smooth and the radio was quiet.  I might just be able to get away with this!

I carefully trimmed the plane until it flew straight and level without control inputs. I took my hands off the controls tentatively -- nothing seemed to happen. *All right, J., you can do this.* I opened the bottle, ever-so-carefully unzipped and got myself into it. The relief that followed was indescribable.  Euphoria!

Relief quickly turned to panic. The bottle seemed to be filling at an alarming rate.  Was it possible that my bladder actually had a larger capacity than this bottle? I really didn’t want to find out empirically.  I’d owned this plane for 3 weeks and I sure wasn’t going to let my own pee geyser erupt from this bottle all over my upholstery!

Alas, the bottle was opaque. I willed myself to stop peeing, pulled myself out and peeked in the bottle to check how much space was left.  This cycle repeated several times, one hand holding the bottle and the other holding myself to prevent pee from spraying everywhere like a loose firehose.  I had no hands free to fly the plane.  The situation was … let's just say: delicate.

The third time through this dance I realized something alarming: my gonads were cold.  Oh no!  Cold gonads must mean there was a fluid leak.  Crap!

Then I noticed something else: a hiss.   *Ssssssss.......*  What was that?  I realized I was cold because of air, not liquid. Where was this airflow coming from?

A moment later, this question was answered.  *SssssssssssssPOP.*  The latch had not been secure.  My door popped open!

Oh.  Holy.  Hell.

My indicated airspeed was about 120 m.p.h. and turbulent air raced past the door.  It was also the first moment in my life I remember being afraid of heights.  I sat for a moment, dumbfounded.  My heart raced.  Both hands were still occupied holding my bottle and my junk.  What the hell do I do!?

*Don’t panic*, my instructor Gary’s words echoed through my head.  *The plane still flies fine with the door open.*

Oh god. Ok. Let’s figure this out.  First thing’s first: I decided that this was not an emergency.  Flailing around would make it one -- let’s avoid that. The only thing that would make this an emergency, I reasoned, would be if I somehow fell out of the plane. I used my non-bottle hand to verify my seatbelt was secure. I also checked behind me to make sure there was nothing loose in the back seat that might depart the aircraft.

All right. I decided I was safe. What next?  I needed both hands to close and latch the door.  My hands, however, were occupied with Operation PeePlosion. So, I reasoned, the correct next step was to finish peeing.  I would look back later and see this as having been my first major executive decision as a pilot-in-command.  With wind whooshing past, I filled the remaining third of the bottle, sealed it up, and set it on the floor like a boss.

Finally, with both hands now free, I tried to close the door -- no luck.  The wind was too strong.  I throttled back, slowed the plane down to about 75, and was able to slam and latch it at last.

I made my way into Las Vegas, landing on runway 19R and shutting down in front of the executive terminal where all the fancy private jets land.  I grabbed the bottle and hopped out of the plane to use an actual restroom and find some food.

I took 20 steps and froze: it was Las Vegas.  It was a Saturday afternoon.  Playboys and party girls were descending on the city.  There were two private jets parked in front of me; they literally had red carpets running out to them.  Fashionable men were emerging from the aircraft with women on their arms -- blonde, leggy women in skin-tight clubbing dresses and immaculate makeup.  They were ready for a night on the town.  I was standing there in a ratty t-shirt, unshaven, and holding a warm bottle of my own piss. 

I couldn’t do it.  I turned back.  I found a quiet spot on the tarmac near my tie-down and emptied the bottle onto the ground.  I hoped it would be discrete, but …. I guess I hadn’t had enough to drink after all.  The pee was a radioactive shade of yellow.

“Well, at least this can’t get any *more* embarrassing,” I thought to myself.

Wrong.

“CLEAR!”  Someone parked in the next row started up their turboprop.  The propwash started to propel my giant ocean of shame downwind, spreading it out over the tarmac and spraying warm pee all over me and my plane.

I looked up to see a lineman giving me a icy glare.  He shook his head sadly and drove off.

I returned to Vegas a couple of weeks later.   It doesn’t rain there very often so the ramp was still stained yellow. I hope it's gone by now, but if you're ever there and see a yellow patch, raise a sport bottle and toast the day I learned how to keep my cool.

True,rwbombc,,,"Unfortunately, something like this sort of happened to me in London. We were in a hostel and there was a bar connected to it and my friend's friend picked up another American girl at the bar. She was no beauty queen and I'd doubt she could fit into a moomoo comfortably. 

We go to bed and they start having sex in the room with lights out and she starts getting loud and finally yells, **""whoever wants to fuck me join in!""**. Another kid jumps out and into the other bunk, almost as if he was waiting for her to say it. My other friend and I were horrified and he said he was biting his blanket to stop from laughing. Man, let me tell you it is hard to pass out when two dudes are railing a fat chick who is screaming.

She was gone the next morning but as we were checking out we found her panties. They had some sort of green stain on them. One kid kept them. The sad part is the guy who picked her up was quite a handsome fellow and her cute friend was interested in him, but he wasn't in the mood to play games. Some guys are lazy, some guys have no shame and some guys are both. Turn off the lights and add 150 lbs to the chick and the guy in the picture in the bottom bunk  was me. This is my hostel gangbang story. Thanks for reading.

My test proctor had a reputation for being quiet the entire time, and being the hardest one to please, hurray!

I make it out of the fog and, thankfully, I am not upside down, though emerging from the fog gave me another problem.  Left engine failure.  Again, check list comes out.  I make a call to traffic control, and let them know whats up and that I need an emergency landing.  While getting in position to land, this single engine Cessna gets in front of me.  I make calls to him saying I need priority landing, I have left engine failure, and this is not a drill, I NEED to land.  No response.  I make the same call over and over again, stopping short of saying ""HEY! ASS HOLE! GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY WAY! OR I WILL RUN YOU OVER!"".  Again, no response.  So, I do what I have to do.  I pull as close to the Cessna as I possibly can, landing right behind him, knowing full well one mistake and the ass hole in front of me, the proctor and I could very well die in a fiery plane explosion.  Fun.  Also, note that the proctor is just sitting there, not moving, and completely calm, while I am freaking the fuck out.  The planes land safely, and the proctor, without saying a word, gets out of the plane and heads for the terminal.  I get out a little after him, shaking and nearly on the verge of breaking down, sick to my stomach from the adrenaline and stress.  My teacher emerges and basically says ""what the hell happened""?  I tell him the story as best as I could at the time, and he just walks away.  ""Fuck, I failed this test so hard...""  Those words, just running over and over in my mind.  I make it back to the terminal, and see the guy who was piloting the Cessna that was in front of me walks in.  I take a seat, and waiting for the proctor to tell me I failed.  I feel a tap on my shoulder, and my teacher points and says ""look at this..."".  I look up and see the test proctor walk up to the Cessna pilot, hear him basically scream to see his license to pilot, take it from him, rip it in half, and walk away, and heading towards me.  He walks up, and says ""I would like to speak to your student, if I may"".  My teacher nods and says ok.

To answer a few quick questions (that many already guessed the answers to):

They're 5 sized PCR fragments (roughly 150, 300, 500, 700, 1kb), I went back through my notes to find 5 primer pairs that I knew worked pretty well (so don't feel bad, they're selected out of primers that had been pre-validated =p). The other lanes are just mixes of the 5 sizes (either 2:3:4 or 4:6 volume mixes going in decreasing size, since larger fragments tend to be brighter). The gel actually didn't take that long (though it was terrifying loading it), but I made a mockup in Illustrator beforehand (along with a ladder to test what sizes to use), and then sketched it out beforehand so I knew what to add to each lane.

700 was the hardest to find for some reason, so I didn't really care about whether it was perfect or had primer dimers (and yeah I've had a friend complain to me about that also)

Gloves were used handling the actual gel; I don't usually bother with gloves for the printouts unless I dropped the gel on it or something

The most difficult part of the entire thing was actually coming up with a good enough excuse to get her to image a gel in my lab! And meeting a girl nice enough to actually agree to do that while believing it was my real work!

The actual proposal occurred a couple minutes after and involved flowers (outside the building - the gel was fun, but I decided a long time ago I didn't want to actually propose in any place with as many cockroaches as our lab buildings =)) 

@stanleypolley123, I find that hilarious and awesome (I'm finishing up a worm PhD), but my (now) fiancee does mouse genetics so I don't think she'd have appreciated it as much. =) Someone in lab suggested that I hide the ring in one of her mice to dissect, but I don't think I could have ever touched the ring again after that.

True,SmashedBrotato,,,"The way they treat their employees is nothing short of reprehensible, and they actively block people from collecting unemployment and workman's compensation benefits.  

When my boyfriend had to go to his Unemployment Hearing for Amazon (He was let go due to an injury, they lied and said he quit.  He brought boxes of paperwork to prove his case, they brought nothing.) they signed paperwork on his behalf saying he was dropping the appeal, so he'd have to pay back all the money he'd collected when he was out of work.  Repeat: **They tried to stop the appeal, claiming to be his representatives**.  Due to Clerical Oversight, it was processed and the state sent him a notice saying he had to pay back such and such amount of money.  When we realized what happened, he took them back to Unemployment Court.  We had a hearing in front of a judge.  The fella asks about it, and Amazon's rep said it was ""irrelevant"" and that he wouldn't answer questions about it.  

Ultimately, he won, and got to keep the right to file for Unemployment and didn't have to pay anything back.  He was part of a massive article about how Amazon treats people and how they do shady things like that to a lot of people who have sought Unemployment.  

This isn't even getting in to how Amazon treated him when he was injured in the first place, and how they told him he would be considered on medical leave, when they in fact fired him for not attending work.  That was a huge clusterfuck to set right.

True,squidthesid,,,"EDIT: A disclaimer, I have finals tomorrow (the joys of high school), and I need to drop off a package at USPS, so commentary will be delayed by an hour. 

As usual, don't buy any games that aren't on a daily deal. 

Alright, here's what I think of the games today: 

[Mirror's Edge](http://store.steampowered.com/app/17410/?snr=1_4_4__800): If anything sticks out about Mirror's Edge for me, it's the distinctive visual style. Instead of the shades of gray and brown, it's got a nice mix of white and red in a rather pristine environment. While the platforming is fairly functional, it's not not as fluid as I would like it to be, and it's difficult to determine jumps at times because of the first person perspective. The game works the best when you're free to run about and solve puzzles, but it's at its worst when the game forces you to mow down soldiers with the poorly implemented combat. It's also quite short, and there's no multiplayer of any sort and limited replayability. Overall, I enjoyed it, but it's a very flawed experience. 

[The Borderlands Franchise](http://store.steampowered.com/sale/wintersale2012_borderlandsfranchise): To be honest, I'm not a big fan of the series. While it attempts to fuse Diablo loot grinding with glorious FPS combat, the series has always fallen flat for me. The combat has never felt particularly good, the quests are essentially fetch quests, the plot is practically non-existent (although the second one has a much better plot in comparison), the environments are rather bland, and the humor falls flat for me. Co-op hasn't made the series more enjoyable for me. Also, as to differences between the first and second game, they're rather minute. Borderlands 2 is more of the same, really. Overall, while I wasn't too big of a fan of the series, I know people who enjoyed the series, and I know some people love the series to death. If you haven't played the series, I'd probably pick up the first game with a few buddies (I'd get GOTY, because the DLC is quite varied) and play it with some friends and see if you like it before shelling out 30 dollars on the sequel. 

[Scribblenauts Unlimited](http://store.steampowered.com/app/218680/): It's the latest entry in the Scribblenauts series, known for its ridiculous solutions to rather mundane tasks. The shtick of the series is that you're given an encyclopedia full of objects, and you have to choose objects that will help you achieve your task. If all you need is a bicycle and some rope, go for it, if you want to have a full scale war between God and Cthulhu, that's your option. How much enjoyment you get of the title is proportional to how much you can much about in the levels with contrived solutions. To further customize your creations, you can add in modifiers and edit the objects in an object editor. In addition, this entry boasts more polish than the original game. At this price, I'm not sure if you should pick it up if you have no experience with the series, but it might be worth a shot if you've got a creative mind. 

[Price of Persia Franchise](http://store.steampowered.com/sale/wintersale2012_princeofpersiafranchise): The original trilogy has very well implemented platforming which was quite fluid, and the sands of time mechanics can often save your hide. I heard the later games in the series weren't as good as the original trilogy, but they still might be worth picking up. If you can get past the age, the original trilogy offers some great platforming experiences that focuses on ""fluidity"". I haven't played the series in a while, so my knowledge of it is rusty at best. 

[SirCannonFodder](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/156ebg/the_steam_holiday_sale_is_live/c7jpbck) said that Prince of Persia 2008 was ""an absolutely gorgeous looking game, even 4 years after release (the amazing cel-shaded art style plays a big part in that). The combat and platforming flow well (even if the ""activate the big glowing pad thing to do something cool"" platforming bits are a bit boring. They're not too common though, thankfully), and there's a good chemistry between the Prince and Elika (not quite as good as the Prince and Farah in Sands of Time, but still good).

The story itself isn't much to write home about for the most part (big evil released, you have to go to the places and do the things to put it back), but it's told well enough, has interesting villains, and there's one hell of an ending.""

[The Hitman Franchise](http://store.steampowered.com/sale/wintersale2012_hitmanfranchise?snr=1_4_4__802): The Hitman franchise tasks you, Agent 47, to kill people in various creative ways. While the games offers you various methods of completing your objectives, stealth is often the most rewarding path, while direct combat is often frowned upon. The first two games haven't aged very gracefully, but Blood Money still holds up rather nicely. Absolution has gotten a mixed reception from many people. The general consensus seems to be that it's a good game, but it's a large departure from Blood Money, so your mileage may vary. If you're looking for a good stealth game, definitely check out Blood Money.

[Wargame: European Escalation](http://store.steampowered.com/app/58610/): To be honest, I haven't played this one, as it didn't particularly interest me. However, from what I've heard, it's a very competent hybrid of the war game and real time strategy genres that offers a lot of complexity despite rather simple controls. And to top it off, the developers have been constantly releasing free DLC. If this interests you, then I'd recommend checking it out. 


Flash Sales (Due to the brief nature of the sales, I'll be writing shorter comments):

[Fable 3](http://store.steampowered.com/sale/wintersale2012_fablefranchise?snr=1_4_4__806): It's a mediocre sequel to a rather enjoyable game. It's supposedly an action-RPG, although a lot of the RPG elements have been stripped out. Overall, Fable 3 is the weakest entry in the series as its gameplay, story, and humor fall flat. Oh, and it uses GFWL. Overall, I'd pass on Fable 3, it's just not very good. 
 
[The Arkham Series](http://store.steampowered.com/sale/wintersale2012_batmanfranchise?snr=1_4_4__806): It's a collection of stealth brawlers. The core combat, although simple, is very fast and enjoyable, and combat doesn't get too repetitive. Arkham City arguably has a weaker narrative, but it boasts a very enjoyable open world to mess around in. The PC port of Arkham City is much better than at launch. Also, a word of warning, both games use GFWL. 

[Natural Selection 2](http://store.steampowered.com/app/4920/): Natural Selection 2 is an enjoyable FPS and RTS hybrid with asymmetric multiplayer that's executed quite well.

It doesn't play nicely on modern systems without some file editing, but it aged well otherwise. Get that instead of BFG when it goes on sale. 

[Deus Ex: Human Revolution](http://store.steampowered.com/app/28050/): Deus Ex: Human Revolution is the latest game in the series of RPGs that heavily emphasize choice.

Human Revolution manages to rather seamlessly blend stealth and firearms together in a rather open ended fashion, allowing for varied playstyles. The plot and characters were quite enjoyable and I was engrossed into the story and the conspiracies surrounding it. While it's not perfect, as it's quite flawed in many aspects, it's still a very cohesive package that will offer an immense amount of entertainment for a low down payment. If you have any interest in shooters or RPGs, pick this game up. The Missing Link DLC is also quite good as well. Also, I'd recommend getting the Augmented Edition if you don't own it, as the soundtrakc is easily worth the extra cash spent.

True,snarkhunter,,,"A consistent problem that space-based scifi has is that a lot of writers (and people in general) just don't have a great idea of how vastly bigly huge space is.  And ""transit time"" is something a LOT of plots require.  Let's say the average galaxy is about 100,000 LY across.  How long should it take a ship to cross the galaxy?  The Millenium Falcon can apparently ""be on the other side of the galaxy"" in under a day.  If that's the case then it's much harder to have points in the plot where we're hoping that someone makes it in time.  If you can cross the galaxy in under a day, that means that going from one star system to another one nearby is practically instantaneous.  There's no ""the invasion force has set off and will arrive in a matter of days"" or anything.  War would be this ridiculously dynamic and ever-changing cross-galactic melee.  If they hit your homeworld with a strike team, in 15 minutes every ship in your fleet can respond, except for the ones you send to bomb THEIR homeworld.  Etc.

So maybe you lower the cruising speed.  Star Trek: Voyager saw a ship flung 75,000 years from home, and we're told it will take about 75 years for them to get back (wormholes and such aside).  So that means your cruising speed is roughly 1000 light years per year.  Or about 2.75 light years a day.  Alpha Centauri is the closest star to our sun, and it's about 4 LY away, so in order to make Voyager a compelling storyline now it takes over a day to get from Earth to Alpha Centauri, and a matter of weeks or months to get anywhere else.  So now that delegation takes a month and a half to get from Qo'Nos to Romulus.  Bajor is three weeks from Earth.

So there's a problem with just increasing your maximum speed to X times the speed of light.  Most shows basically lampshade this.  Some, like Trek, kind of attempt to deal with it by making high speeds maintainable for shorter distances.  You *can* go at warp 9 to get from Earth to Vulcan quickly, but it's riskier, bad for your warp core, and if the plot requires it a line from Geordi - ""we're still seeing fluctuations in the warp core, I can't push it past warp 3"" means you'll be too late to save whatever from whoever.

Star Wars and BSG both have VERY fast transportation, arguably faster than Trek, at least that's what we're told.  The caveat, though, is that you need star charts.  You can't just point yourself towards some unexplored corner of the galaxy and land yourself in the middle of it.  Well you can but you could die because there's a supernova there.  You have to do some plot-required amount of navigational calculations, THEN you get to almost instantaneously travel to your destination.  And we get the feeling that exploration and charting safe routes through new areas is fairly slow work.  The idea of ""space lanes"" in Star Wars - corridors that have been shown to be free of black holes and other dangerous obstacles - help corral ships together.  Which also helps with plot.  If I can randomly take almost any route through 3-dimensional space to get from any point A to any point B, it's much harder to set up an ambush.  If to get from A to B I have one fairly narrow tube I got to go through, then OH NO Imperial Interdictor-class Star Destroyers!

The method that works best for me plot wise is the wormhole one.  Starships can go fast, but possibly not even past light speed, or at least not by much.  But once you discover and activate a mass relay or stable wormhole or jump gates, you can travel to and from that place fairly quickly.  AND those provide good strategic positions.  Blockading a system just means you're putting a bunch of ships right at the jump gates or wormholes near to it, because those are the points through which the invaders have to come.

tl;dr - actual speed isn't that interesting to me.  Choosing a mode of transportation that is both consistent and sets the stage for good plots is.

As usual, don't buy any games that aren't on a daily deal. 

Alright, here's what I think of the games today: 

[Mirror's Edge](http://store.steampowered.com/app/17410/?snr=1_4_4__800): If anything sticks out about Mirror's Edge for me, it's the distinctive visual style. Instead of the shades of gray and brown, it's got a nice mix of white and red in a rather pristine environment. While the platforming is fairly functional, it's not not as fluid as I would like it to be, and it's difficult to determine jumps at times because of the first person perspective. The game works the best when you're free to run about and solve puzzles, but it's at its worst when the game forces you to mow down soldiers with the poorly implemented combat. It's also quite short, and there's no multiplayer of any sort and limited replayability. Overall, I enjoyed it, but it's a very flawed experience. 

[The Borderlands Franchise](http://store.steampowered.com/sale/wintersale2012_borderlandsfranchise): To be honest, I'm not a big fan of the series. While it attempts to fuse Diablo loot grinding with glorious FPS combat, the series has always fallen flat for me. The combat has never felt particularly good, the quests are essentially fetch quests, the plot is practically non-existent (although the second one has a much better plot in comparison), the environments are rather bland, and the humor falls flat for me. Co-op hasn't made the series more enjoyable for me. Also, as to differences between the first and second game, they're rather minute. Borderlands 2 is more of the same, really. Overall, while I wasn't too big of a fan of the series, I know people who enjoyed the series, and I know some people love the series to death. If you haven't played the series, I'd probably pick up the first game with a few buddies (I'd get GOTY, because the DLC is quite varied) and play it with some friends and see if you like it before shelling out 30 dollars on the sequel. 

[Scribblenauts Unlimited](http://store.steampowered.com/app/218680/): It's the latest entry in the Scribblenauts series, known for its ridiculous solutions to rather mundane tasks. The shtick of the series is that you're given an encyclopedia full of objects, and you have to choose objects that will help you achieve your task. If all you need is a bicycle and some rope, go for it, if you want to have a full scale war between God and Cthulhu, that's your option. How much enjoyment you get of the title is proportional to how much you can much about in the levels with contrived solutions. To further customize your creations, you can add in modifiers and edit the objects in an object editor. In addition, this entry boasts more polish than the original game. At this price, I'm not sure if you should pick it up if you have no experience with the series, but it might be worth a shot if you've got a creative mind. 

[Price of Persia Franchise](http://store.steampowered.com/sale/wintersale2012_princeofpersiafranchise): The original trilogy has very well implemented platforming which was quite fluid, and the sands of time mechanics can often save your hide. I heard the later games in the series weren't as good as the original trilogy, but they still might be worth picking up. If you can get past the age, the original trilogy offers some great platforming experiences that focuses on ""fluidity"". I haven't played the series in a while, so my knowledge of it is rusty at best. 

[SirCannonFodder](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/156ebg/the_steam_holiday_sale_is_live/c7jpbck) said that Prince of Persia 2008 was ""an absolutely gorgeous looking game, even 4 years after release (the amazing cel-shaded art style plays a big part in that). The combat and platforming flow well (even if the ""activate the big glowing pad thing to do something cool"" platforming bits are a bit boring. They're not too common though, thankfully), and there's a good chemistry between the Prince and Elika (not quite as good as the Prince and Farah in Sands of Time, but still good).

The story itself isn't much to write home about for the most part (big evil released, you have to go to the places and do the things to put it back), but it's told well enough, has interesting villains, and there's one hell of an ending.""

[The Hitman Franchise](http://store.steampowered.com/sale/wintersale2012_hitmanfranchise?snr=1_4_4__802): The Hitman franchise tasks you, Agent 47, to kill people in various creative ways. While the games offers you various methods of completing your objectives, stealth is often the most rewarding path, while direct combat is often frowned upon. The first two games haven't aged very gracefully, but Blood Money still holds up rather nicely. Absolution has gotten a mixed reception from many people. The general consensus seems to be that it's a good game, but it's a large departure from Blood Money, so your mileage may vary. If you're looking for a good stealth game, definitely check out Blood Money.

[Wargame: European Escalation](http://store.steampowered.com/app/58610/): To be honest, I haven't played this one, as it didn't particularly interest me. However, from what I've heard, it's a very competent hybrid of the war game and real time strategy genres that offers a lot of complexity despite rather simple controls. And to top it off, the developers have been constantly releasing free DLC. If this interests you, then I'd recommend checking it out. 


Flash Sales (Due to the brief nature of the sales, I'll be writing shorter comments):

[Fable 3](http://store.steampowered.com/sale/wintersale2012_fablefranchise?snr=1_4_4__806): It's a mediocre sequel to a rather enjoyable game. It's supposedly an action-RPG, although a lot of the RPG elements have been stripped out. Overall, Fable 3 is the weakest entry in the series as its gameplay, story, and humor fall flat. Oh, and it uses GFWL. Overall, I'd pass on Fable 3, it's just not very good. 

[ArtRage Studio Pro](http://store.steampowered.com/app/100970/): Your guess is as good as mine. I'm not an artist (unless you count stick figures) so I have no idea what this product offers.

[DOOM 3: BFG](http://store.steampowered.com/app/208200/): Don't buy this, it's a blatant cash grab from id. That being said, it's essentially Doom 3 with more brightness and worse graphics and some ""new"" linear levels. It has no effort put into it and although id's made the PC port better recently, the original game is still better. If you don't know anything about Doom 3, it's the third game in the Doom series (natch), that's a mix of survival horror and shoot everything in the face until it explodes into giblets a la Painkiller. It doesn't play nicely on modern systems without some file editing, but it aged well otherwise. Get that instead of BFG when it goes on sale. 

[Deus Ex: Human Revolution](http://store.steampowered.com/app/28050/): Deus Ex: Human Revolution is the latest game in the series of RPGs that heavily emphasize choice. Although many considered it not as great as the original Deus Ex, I loved it. Human Revolution manages to rather seamlessly blend stealth and firearms together in a rather open ended fashion, allowing for varied playstyles. The plot and characters were quite enjoyable and I was engrossed into the story and the conspiracies surrounding it. While it's not perfect, as it's quite flawed in many aspects, it's still a very cohesive package that will offer an immense amount of entertainment for a low down payment. If you have any interest in shooters or RPGs, pick this game up. The Missing Link DLC is also quite good as well. Also, I'd recommend getting the Augmented Edition if you don't own it, as the soundtrakc is easily worth the extra cash spent
 
[The Arkham Series](http://store.steampowered.com/sale/wintersale2012_batmanfranchise?snr=1_4_4__806): It's a collection of stealth brawlers. The core combat, although simple, is very fast and enjoyable, and combat doesn't get too repetitive. Arkham City arguably has a weaker narrative, but it boasts a very enjoyable open world to mess around in. The PC port of Arkham City is much better than at launch. Also, a word of warning, both games use GFWL. 

[Natural Selection 2](http://store.steampowered.com/app/4920/): Natural Selection 2 is an enjoyable FPS and RTS hybrid with asymmetric multiplayer that's executed quite well. Although it's quite fun, the game has some very large performance issues, so if you have a weak computer, this game might not run properly for you.

True,voltaire-o-dactyl,,,"Not quite the requested scenario, but close enough I hope: last Fourth of July, I was at a BBQ when I got a call from my dad -- mid-50s lawyer who's truly a plane nerd at heart. He's also fortunate (and hard-working) enough to own an old 5-seater Commanche. 

Now, every summer, my Dad and I usually fly cross-country, East Coast to Montana. The women in our family are straight terrified of the little plane, so I was sorta on tap to not break his heart entirely. Last year was the first year I had been unable to accompany him.

So I get the call, and he opens with: ""I'm calling you because I gotta tell somebody about this, but you gotta swear not to tell your mother, because otherwise it might be the end of her."" 

Dude goes on to tell me how he found himself boxed in on all sides by a thunderstorm over middle-of-nowhere-mountainous-terrain, Wyoming. ALL OF A SUDDEN his engine just CUTS OUT. Dies. Totally. 14,000 feet up. Instrument conditions. Unfamiliar, dangerous, remote terrain beneath. 

So he's in contact (barely) with ONE flight controller hundreds of miles away. He starts gliding down, through the IFR fog. Controller is not much help, as he was outside of her radar range. 

FINALLY breaks cloud cover a couple thousand feet over the ground. He said he saw the airport, immediately realized he wasn't gonna make it. Started looking for a field. Found one and made a beeline. 

Comes in for a BEAUTIFUL landing in a giant radish (I think) field -- the point being they were root plants, so despite the Commanche being a low-wing design, there was not a single scratch, dent, nor scuff on the damn plane (good thing too, he loves that paint job). Just three tire trails through the fields. 

KICKER(s): 

1) AS SOON as he landed, the storm just vanished. Totally. People who live in Wyoming/Montana know how that goes.

2) Turns out he landed on the ranch of a family mid-celebration. They saw this plane land in their field, and one (adult) son drove out to check it out. Gets up to the Pilot side, raps on the glass and goes ""Hey, you alright?"" My dad says yes. Then the guy goes -- I shit you not -- ""Look, you're never gonna believe this, but I actually work for the FAA.""

3) My dad made the front page of their (6 page) daily newspaper. He has many framed copies. My dad is a huge nerd. But bigger badass.

And I'm really, really glad that story goes the way it does, and not the other way.

True,IB_Bangin,,,"Fuck 2012. Seriously. This has been the worst year of my life. Since August, I've broken up with a serious girlfriend, my parents have gotten divorced, my aunt died, my Opa died, and my grandfather died.

I was coping with the rest, but a month ago, when I got word that my grandfather passed away, I slipped into a deep depression. I hadn't spoken to him in years because of a stupid family feud, and I never got the chance to mend fences with him, or tell him I was sorry. 

Also, the day I heard about his passing, a girl I'd been seeing dumped me. Through a text message.

So, yeah. Since then I've been dealing with borderline addiction, depression, etc. And what makes me feel worse is that I know there are people out there with far more serious problems who are able to cope. I feel like a failure.

It feels kinda good to get that all out, actually.

Edit: Wow, you guys are awesome. Reading all the kind words, advice, etc, has really brightened my day.

True,boxybroker,,,"- Have long, supple digits (optimally. Short, stubby fingers that just won't reach? To the toybox!)
- Get a girl
- I'll wait in case that takes a minute... 

- Back? Okay. Get her very aroused. Perhaps bring her to orgasm or as close as possible by some other means. (This is important. Lots of women's g-spots don't... ""activate"" until they're already well aroused. This is why I could never find mine until the first time it got found.) 
- Have her lay on her back with her pelvis elevated, if it's comfortable 
- Insert a finger or two^1 (two is better) with your palms turned upward so that you're making a ""come here"" motion. Feel around the front wall of her vagina. 
- That area that feels different? Kinda rough and spongy? That's where you wanna be. Push on it. Rub it. Gently at first. 

Now go to town on that shit however she tells you to. Personally I prefer no simultaneous tongue action and steady, increasing pressure back and forth. Applying pressure to her pubic mound with her other hand may help as well. 

If you're doing it right, she'll eventually feel like she has to cum and pee at the same time and probably ask you to stop. **Don't stop.** Tell her to go for it.^2 Once you've been rinsed, give her a second to recover (not too long! momentum is key!), then repeat. 

Or at least that worked for me. I actually taught him to teach me that I could do it. Like, ""You wanna make me squirt? Do it like this!"" And it worked! :D

**Notes:**

**^1.** The index and ring finger tend to work best. I don't know if it's actually more comfortable for the acting partner, but it seems easier to maneuver that way.

**^2.** She will not pee. The body has a way of shutting that kind of thing down. But for real, at the point of ejaculation the bladder cuts off and the Skene's glands take over, similar to men's testicles when they ejaculate. Fluid comes out of the urethra, so there's an off chance that a tiny bit of pee may be mixed in. However, that's not likely, and it won't be a noticeable amount. 

It's better for the potential squirter to go to the bathroom first for her own comfort's sake, and to help get over that wall, but either way, she *still* won't pee. I have started messing around knowing I had to pee to begin with, squirted buckets, and then immediately gone to the bathroom. I sniffed the sheets and there wasn't any urine at all. 


**On messiness:**
I honestly hate to even call it a ""mess."" Different women squirt different amounts. Some only have a couple teaspoons in there. Some are on log flume status. If towels and blankets aren't enough to contain the drain, try a couple pillows. They're like giant fluffy, comfortably absorbent pads. They'll soak up most of the business and you can just toss them in the washer. Or you can be fancy and try a [Liberator Throe](http://www.liberator.com/eng/product/fascinator-throes-by-liberator/10342). Either way, ejaculate dries clear pretty quickly so it's more of an inconvenience than anything else. 

In a hotel? Get two queens instead of 1 king, sleep in one, fuck in the other. You're welcome. 

**On aftercare:** 
I completely forgot about this. In addition to splash waterfalls, be prepared for any number of orgasmal reactions. There will probably be a good bit of involuntary bucking and flip flopping around. There will be loud noises that may be guttural in nature. Me? I giggle uncontrollably. It's as cute as it sounds. This is probably the most potentially embarrassing part for her, next to the peeing thing, so be supportive. I'm sure that goes without saying, but just be ready so you don't freak out or anything (or bust out laughing) if dying Wookie sounds start happening.  

When she has had all she can bear (which is probably two more than she *thinks* she can bear) *Just hold her.* I get uncharacteristically snuggly and huggy and lovey dovey, which is really just a means to an end to continue gently humping my partner's leg to another few ogasms. This is pretty common, apparently. 

I've continued to have rolling, full-body O's for another 45 min to an hour afterward before I just fell asleep. And all my partner had to do was lay there and rub my back. Every time you feel a little shiver go all the way down her back? That's another one. There is quite possibly no better feeling. I've heard of couples being able to keep that going for hours, but I be too sleepy for all that. 

Go forth and conquer that g-spot kiddos. Ladies, give up the ghost and let that thang loose.

It's all about continuing to learn to love yourself at the same time as practice, practice, practice. The two go hand in hand; you start to ask girls out and then go out with them, and suddenly instead of saying ""I'm such a loser I can't ask girls out"" you say ""I'm such a loser I can't get a girl to kiss me"". And then you start kissing them. And then you start kissing girls you just met. And then you start getting them back to your place. And then you're going, ""I'm such a loser, I can't get any of these girls to fuck me."" See a pattern? Keep at it - you'll eventually be in enough situations that it just works itself out in one of them. And then you'll have sex a little more often, and a little more often, and a little more often.

And then you'll be out at a bar and you'll see a girl and it won't even seem weird for you to try to talk to her and get her to be with you. Because suddenly there's ""nothing wrong with you"" anymore. 

But that's just how it works out because it's really hard to just change the way your thinking works. Truth is, there's nothing wrong with you NOW either. You're money and you don't even know it.

Sadly, it's hard to just accept that. So what should you expect? Baby steps. Put yourself out there as often and as extremely as possible, and keep pushing your boundaries. It isn't just possible that you'll get laid, it's a complete guarantee. 

But then at the end, you'll be fucking beautiful women all the time, and you'll be going, ""I'm such a loser, I have all these women but why am I not happy?""

Believe it or not, it will be worth more the less you do with it.  When you're ready to sell, people pay a premium for cars that *haven't* been modded.  Because there's nothing worse than reversing modes made by some kid.  Mods also indicate that the car has been raced and beaten on.  Spend less, get more.

With $500, the first thing I'd do is drop about $200 on a motorcycle [MSF](http://online2.msf-usa.org/msf/Default.aspx) course.  Get your motorcycle endorsement, too.

Yes.

Seriously.

They have an *excellent* course on road safety that goes beyond what you learn in driver's ed.  Then you spend a day riding a bike, which is pure awesome.  These will sharpen your skills and awareness.  The course will make you a better driver.

Take the other $300 and buy a set of wrenches and your car's service manual.  Learn to do routine maintenance.  Get in the habit of routine maintenance.  Buy a notebook and keep track of the maintenance.  If you drive, it is your responsibility to know how the car works and how to fix it.  I'm not talking about the heavy stuff, but you should know how to change:

* Belts

* Hoses

* Spark plugs

* Headlights and other bulbs

* Fuses

* Starter

* Alternator

* Flush the radiator

* Gas pump

* Wiper blades

* Front end, including shocks and springs

* Filters (air, fuel, etc.)

* Change the fluids (oil, tranny, etc.)

And all the other minor repairs.  I don't know how old your car is or its condition, but as money comes in, start replacing stuff preventively.  It'll make your car more reliable, you'll learn the skills, and you'll get top dollar for it when you sell.

* http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel/cs287-fa11/ CS287 is graduate robotics, introduces you to a lot of math needed for robotics. The hardest class I took at Berkeley (although I stupidly took CS150 and EE128 the same semester, and was also GSIing a class). EE128 is also a good class, you can find notes from an older iteration (maybe like 2009ish, Claire Tomlin's notes are really good). Maybe EE221A. Convex optimization is also pretty important, try EE127A/227 or Stanford EE363/364 (these are things my research advisor told me to do and I never got around to learning properly, lol...)

For open source projects there's ROS and OpenRAVE which are some frameworks for robotics programming, I don't really like either much though because they're a bit overengineered and there's a lot to learn (mostly ROS) and they keep changing it.

I think if you do all the CS287 lectures and do all the homework you'll have a good idea of what's interesting in robotics and you could potentially come up with an interesting project on your own. I would suggest doing your own little project in Matlab/Octave rather than work with a framework because you'll most likely end up spending a lot of time just learning the framework rather than the math. But ROS and OpenRAVE have simulators (I think OpenRAVE is easier to use on the whole) so maybe eventually you'd want to test things out there.",0,1356076419,,0,False,1,c7k1364,t3_156lkr,t1_c7k1364,t1_c7jy6eh,,1430734348,2,False,berkeley,t5_2qh9w,2

You may not take it seriously or might fancy a sneaky look at the photos of celebrities in bikinis or actresses 'all grown up' at awards ceremonies, whatever, you're still supporting the Daily Mail &amp; General Trust company. The company made £78m operating profit last year from their newspaper division, the Mail Online's revenue increased 74% to £28m and there was a 4% increase in circulation revenue. As long as the paper and website continue to grow and make more money, they will be continue to exist. There are so many things wrong with the paper &amp; the website, the journalists that work there and the articles they write that as a British citizen, if you can help it, I think you should do what you can to make sure you don't support the Daily Mail so the country is a better place.

True,ukegnome,,,"I was one of the lucky few there when the sunlight made it's way in at the winter solstice a few years ago so thought I'd share :-)

I signed a big book in Dublin in 1991 to get into the queue to be in the tomb one of the mornings of the solstice. I could see there were hundreds of names in the book, so I didn't hold my breath. About 20 people fit and the sun comes in about 3 days a year. In the end I waited 7 years, my name came up in 1998. I had put my name down for two, so my now wife got in too. 

There is now a lottery to be in the tomb one of the mornings this happens, so it is a lot harder. Here's the form http://www.newgrange.com/solstice-lottery.htm

The icy morning my wife and I arrived, the sky was semi-clear so we were hopeful. But we could see cloud approaching even as the sky began to brighten as the sun approached the horizon. We headed into the narrow passageway and squeezed along 80 feet until we were 30 feet or so below the surface (don't remember the figures exactly, but it felt like being in the barrow downs in Lord of the Rings). It was cool, dry and dark in a round room about the size of a small car garage. The amazing thing is that because of a fear of the Sidhe/Fairies (most likely) no-one had disturbed the place after it was abandoned all those millenia ago. It did not have to be rebuilt so every stone was exactly as it has be placed.

The Irish attitude to the Sidhe is peculiar. Most say they don't believe in them, but are careful not to annoy them, just in case.

Then in the 18/19th century tourists started to wander in. And some left their names on the walls. 

Anyway, it was cool and quiet, and we huddled down in the dark and waited around the sides so there was a space on floor. There was a sense of excitement as we all checked our watches.

Then, golden light hit the floor. Everyone gasped, but stayed silent. There was some happy and excited whispers.  The sense that we were watching something that others like us watched here centuries before even the great pyramid of Giza was built, made that time seem closer and made the people then seem more like the people now. I didn't think of them as primitive cave-men, just people.

The glowing, long triangle looked so warm and tangible, life itself had appeared in this dark tomb. There was something magical about it. Everyone was so excited but stayed quiet, except one man who kept babbling. We heard later he was a diplomat with the Mexican embassy who has skipped the queue and now was feeling uncomfortable in the dark so he had to talk to re-assure himself. Plonker.

The beam wasn't perfect, axial procession means the earth has tilted on it's axis in the last 5,000 years. Newgrange will be perfectly aligned again in 21,000 years.

But it glowed and it was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen. There was no magic, no religion, so superstition, only the awe and mystery of the real relationship we and our planet have with our star and how life is so tied to the movement of these objects through space and time.

Someone put some crystals in the sunbeam to ""capture it's magic essence"" I guess, but sure, why not?

We all came outside again, the sun was up and the view around was frosty and clear, after the cramped confines the world seemed big and bright and new and we felt exhilarated. We left with big smiles on our faces.

Friendly convos always but I always got the feeling her face lit up when she saw me. So in lue of the world ending I had to through it out there.

True,thrombosed,,,"Here is what I would do, based on our current setup at work that I did. It takes some setup on the back end, but once done it makes it very easy to manage, guarantees that they have been authorized and puts ""unauthorized"" users on a separate vlan that you can possibly still allow connectivity to the local LAN to play LAN games, but not internet.

It will require a managed switch with dot1x authentication and a server with radius (I use a linux box personally). If you are doing 200 people LAN partys, I am assuming you are somewhat technically savvy and shouldn't have a problem setting something like this up.

Get the switch to authenticate (I use FORCE10 which are very similar to Cisco commands, so the commands may work as written or with little modification **SEE BELOW FOR CONFIG**). Radius is pretty simple to set up, and I use a MySQL back-end for it. In my example, I use VLAN 106 for a ""guest"" network and the radius server gives the authenticated people their registered vlan if they are authenticated.

The great thing about this is that you can split the network up in vlans to help with congestion, the user only needs to provide you with a MAC address to get on the network, and people who dont want to sign the release can get limited/no access based on what you feel like allowing. If you have a good DHCP server, you can supply all the vlans with IP's individually using subnet statements. You can even do something like putting up the waiver on a website that they have to fill out and once done gives them access (but it would be a lot of work).

I plotted the rate of change of the population in excel and applied an exponential equation to the data and came up with: f(x)=.9332728479*0.8639001849^x

For 2009-2010, the population increase was 0.8095238095 (80.95238095%)

For 2010-2011, the population increase was 0.6909090909 (69.09090909%)

For 2011-2012, the population increase was 0.6041666667 (60.41666667%)

This was plotted in excel and the above equation was created, and then click-and-dragged in excel to see where the upper limit of the population was.

I didn't use just the population amounts to model it because that isn't a good way to do it. After getting the equation in excel, the rate of change for the population very, very quickly becomes constant (an increase of 70.73777% per year), and the population increase becomes linear, which isn't possible :)

Strip the victim of all wet clothes, down to underwear or naked is preferable, place the hot water bottles in the hollows of the body.  Armpits, crotch, neck, etc.  These are places where the blood vessels run close to the skin and a lot of heat is lost (and can be absorbed from).  Then wrap the victim in insulation.  Lots of sleeping bags, make sure no air escapes around the neck, put a hat on him/her.  Finally add a vapour barrier.

divide by five to get yearly percent change

So now we have two curves, and just need to see where they meet

True,M00ty,,,"The year after High School was probably the time which I did this the most. After all I had plenty of time with no school and no job, and while being able to sit at the computer all day uninterrupted sounds like a dream come true, I often found myself falling victim to the symptoms of cabin fever. So to remedy this I would frequently venture off to the park. During school hours this little grotto was a pleasant place, lightly populated with joggers and old folks from The Home about a block down but being young and easily bored I decided to entertain my self in the way most little shit heads do; by bothering people. This is when I started asking passer-byes "" Do you *really* want to do that?"" 




For the most part I had gotten weird looks, most of which that of confusion, a couple of ""huhs?"", scowls and some even picked up their pace and walked away. However, one day when I was up to my usual childish shenanigans I came across a girl in a grey pull-over hoodie who seemed particularly out of it. Seeing it as a perfect opportunity to ask my question I was met with a most unexpected reaction. The look she gave made me feel like her heart was going to shatter. She sobbed. 




At first I had no fucking idea what to do. I worried I had spooked her, but asked what the matter was anyway. From her pocket she pulled out a small, orange, cylindrical bottle. It took a few seconds to settle in but when it did I immediately took them from her. She was going to kill herself. Apparently she planned on going off into the more thick of area of the woods that split off from the park's trails to OD on her mother's painkillers. She wanted to be somewhere that it was unlikely anyone would see her do it. 




I spent the rest of that morning up till a little past noon talking to this person, talking about her family, living situation, friends, people that would miss her, things she might miss out on. Eventually her mood lightened, deciding that maybe it was not for the best, and she asked me if I would be willing to walk home with her. We've been friends since.

True,Boogaloooooooooooooo,,,"Oh god I used to deal with horror parents all the time:

I used to ""coach"" a dual soccer/teeball league for seven year olds in the summer (soccer on tuesday, teeball on thursday). The focus was on having a good time and making sure everyone was included. If they learned some fundamentals and rules of the games, that was just a bonus. No score was kept and no outs were counted in teeball--one team's turn to bat was over when all the players got a chance to hit.

One parent decided this wasn't good enough. He was an over-the-hill  jock that you could tell wanted to relive the glory days through his seven year old son. He was a giant of a man with huge muscles that would usually drop his son off and then go quick work out at the gym down the street. When he returned, he brought back a massive protein shake and a short temper as well. He saw it as his personal mission to make sure that his son's team ""won"" and to inform the other seven year olds as much.

On the last day of the ""season"" he skipped his workout and brought his own scoreboard (who owns a scoreboard?)  to the game with him. Halfway through the game he started to heckle the kids on the other team, shouting sarcastic praises like ""Way to ground out Brandon!"" or ""Nice foul ball Ashley!"". When I asked him to tone it down, he got a little bit mad with me and got pouty. 

He kept it down for an ""inning"" before he started heckling seven-year-old children and their parents. ""Hey blue team, you're losing!"", ""Leave it to Kevin to strike out in teeball!"" and ""Hey Roy, your son swings worse than the girls on the team!"". After two minutes of this I stopped the game and told him that either he left now or I would end the game and call the cops.

He decided to take his heckling to the other side of the road, convinced that it was okay to heckle fucking SEVEN_YEAR OLDS as long as he wasn't on park property. He continued to keep score and shout at the game from far away. I called my supervisor and one of the parents called the police, but there was only ten minutes left of ""game time"" so unfortunately the cops didn't get there before the game was up.

During those ten long minutes, his son was visibly embarrassed by his dad and the other kids started to be affected by the screaming of the dad. One kid broke down in tears and ran to his parents after the dad heckled him about how far he hit the ball. (WHO IS OKAY WITH MAKING KIDS CRY?!?)

The dad kept keeping score and oddly enough found that his son's team was losing at the end of the game, so after it was all done, he came to me and tried to bribe me to ""change the score"" of a game that WE DIDN'T EVEN KEEP SCORE OF. He insisted that his son needed to win the championship and that getting a trophy meant the world to his kid. 

I tried to explain that every player got a trophy and that we didn't even keep score, but he persisted in trying to bribe me, so I decided that I would take his money and use it towards the end-of-the-summer ice cream party for the kids. ""Ok"" I said, ""How much will you give me to change the score?"" He stopped and pondered for a moment and said ""About tree-fiddy."" I was surprised, but then I realized that this giant angry dad was actually a 30-foot high monster from the paleozoic era. ""Aww, lochness monster, I ain't taking no tree-fiddy! Get out of here!"" He scurried away back into the lake just as the cops showed up, so they never got to arrest him. The next year when he tried to sign his kid up again, we refused to let him or his son back.

Nothing infuriated me more than terrible parents, especially in a league for SEVEN-YEAR-OLDS that DIDN'T EVEN KEEP SCORE.

True,kulkija,,,"Where the break would occur depends on the [shear strength](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shear_strength) of the material. Because the rotor will come to an instantaneous stop, the force comes from the inertia of the solid structure acting against the anchor point. In my mechanics / trusses class, we were taught that the break should occur at the point furthest from the anchor where the force surpasses the shear strength of the material. If the rod were spinning at the minimum speed to break the material, it will occur where the torque is greatest - right next to the anchor point. At greater speeds it will break farther away.

First you will have to calculate the speed along the length of the rod -  a simple calculation, using the number of rotations per minute and the perimeter of a circle with a corresponding radius.

You will then have to use these numbers to calculate the momentum along the rod's length, and then the resulting torque acting on any given point along the rod's length. Compare this torque to the required torque for a breakage, and voila, you have a length of rod over which a break can occur.

True,DevWouter,,,"Lets get you up and running, shall we?

First grab a pen and paper and I mean one without wires, batteries or anything. Retro, baby!

The first thing on the list should be the first thing you want to see in the game. For example: The level, the player and 1 enemy. Now reduce it to the most basic thing you can possibly do: A green background, a blue ball and a red square.

Now turn off the phone, lock the room, grab something to drink and eat set your alarm to go off in exactly one hour. Start coding and ignore style, rules, design or anything else to give you a green background, a blue ball and a red square. Once the alarm goes look at what you have on the screen. Is it green? Does it have a ball and a cube? Yes, you sir, are good. Wait, you can move the ball? You sir, are awesome!

Assuming you are not as good as you hoped ask yourself: Did you think about the design or the code style? Yes? Why, did it help you in creating the basic background? Or a ball? Or a square? Did the design matter? Was the style so important? What is the goal? Now put 30 minutes on the clock and get it done. If you fail reduce it (round upwards) and do it again and again until it is finished. If you have only a minute left, delete all the code and start over. You had almost two hours and still nothing is done.

Now take short walk and think about something else. Like the bastard who gave you the advice about creating this. You most likely could have done it with paint. Hack, you could draw a circle and a square on the paper and tell him to put the retro where the sun doesn't shine.

Now get back and do the next thing that is required: Making the player move. Same strategy as before. Use the keyboard to move to the left. Go! Now make it move to the right. Go! Make it shake. You enjoyed that, didn't you? Now make it move up and down. Go! Prevent it from leaving the screen. Go!

Awesome a moving circle. Now the circle has to die. If the player touches the cube it dies. When player dies show game over in a message dialog or kill the game. Just go! Now when player dies let it respawn. Go!

Ok, now we have moving circle that reset when hitting the cube. We take a look at the design. It's a strategy game. Turn based? A grid system it is. Let use make the circle move always the size of the circle (like it was a chessboard). Go! 

So, strategy... Multiple tanks? Spawning.... Shouldn't be too difficult once we get a cursor running. Clicking a grid, selects a sector, hitting the k-key spawns a tank. Go!

Tank spawning. Awesome. Now enemy vs player. Lets make the p-key for players (k remains enemies). enemies are a square, circles are friendly. Don't worry about overlap, just go!

Then moving different tanks (instead of the first player). Then adding a turn button. Then adding a max move range in turn. Then adding different tanks. Then adding factories. Then adding score.

Done? Awesome, you have now created your first demo. Go to bed, sleep. The following week you allow yourself to improve the quality of the code, but after a week. It's go time. Go!

It might take two days, but if you follow this you will have:
* A good feeling (because you implemented the basic)
* A better feeling (you are on track)
* A game

True,seattlyte,,,"Here is your strategy: Do not merely chase after this girl, and co-opt your cousin to do it. I'll explain why.

There are a few different strategies one can take in the dating world. You seem like you are employing the least successful methodology. That is, you're fixating on one particular girl you do not know and who possibly (likely?) has a boyfriend. Face it. You do not know her. She lives an hour away. Why should the fact that learning this random girl who lives an hour away has a boyfriend hurt your feelings and disappoint you? It's because your strategy to dating sucks.

What you need to do is drop the idea that you are going to chase after a particular girl and ""win her over."" What this causes is you to overemphasize each particular woman you are wanting to date. Then, come time of action and possible rejection, you get emotional and shy and uncomfortable - primarily because there is so much you are putting on the line.

What you need to do instead is grow and foster as many relationships as you can. These relationships should be with friends and family, girls and guys, teachers and mentors. (A trick to time management - invite people to stuff you are already doing; ""you should never be eating alone"").

Then, as you get closer to prospective dates you can choose to try to move into relationship territory with the ones you truly click with by consciously shifting things into 'official dating territory'. (Afraid of the friendzone in the meantime? Keep things _mildly_ flirtatious. And if you have a dozen relationships fostering, losing one to a friendship is nothing. We can all use more friends.)

Here are the benefits:

* More friends, more events to go to, more invites and parties, more support in times of need. You'll also get better at socializing with all of this practice and something of a smoothtalker, if you aren't already.
* You will lose your butterflies. In part because you're comfortable with these people already and in part because there is less fixation and less devastation on possible failure. She isn't interested? That's okay, maybe Sarah is. Or Jennie. Or Rachel. You get the point.
* The social circle will be self-sustaining. You will be introduced to friends of friends and friends of friends of friends all of the time. You can pick and choose the ones you would like to maintain contact with. Be civil to everyone, though.
* You will date more people, more often, and get to choose the relationships you want to get more serious with - instead of having a series of long term relationships with large gaps between each. You will become the guy that girls say ""If feels like every time I find an awesome dude life slaps me in the face and goes, 'He has a girlfriend, bitch! Haha!'""

*TL;DR - Don't fixate on a single girl at a time. Grow relationships with everyone around you and choose the girls you'd like to get to know even better. It will be less awkward, less nerve-wracking, and you'll know ahead of time if they have a boyfriend.*",0,1356132593,,0,1356214730,1,c7kcemo,t3_158rgu,t1_c7kcemo,t3_158rgu,,1430739824,2369,False,offmychest,t5_2ranw,2369

True,beenOutsmarted,,,"There are several complicated issues, which kulkija mentioned, but I might mention them in another way. For convenience, I will call the length of the rod l.

Some complications by using extremes. Imagine a very heavy pendulum with a very low shear strength. Now lets put our stopping pin at some point far away. The rod could have several points of breakage. One at the stopper point where the end flies off and the other somewhere near the middle of the pin and the fulcrum. You could find a point where both occur, so that it must be necessary to find both in your algorithm.

A high strength beam stopped near the fulcrum will break near the stopping point.

Anyways, what you need is to do some FEA. You can easily find in some books methods of determining the shape of a beam once it stops. This is rather simple and most introduction to FEA textbooks have a section precisely on this. The harder part is applying your loads. The stopper may be modeled as an impulse of some sort. Applying the proper equations will yield some force which you may apply to your FEA.

Note: I'm not sure that I'll finish this as I don't think your assumptions about the simulation are valid. A beam stopped literally instantly will experience infinite force, regardless of angular velocity of the rod which would suggest that it should break literally everywhere. See F = ma. If each point has a literally infinite acceleration to zero, the force at each infinitesimally small point is zero which would mean the thing completely shatters.

Maybe you're looking more for the maximum moment applied during the stopping. Here's what you'll do. First, we're ignoring force along the pendulum (axial force.) We'll have some tangential force proportional to the angular velocity and the specific mass and the length to the fulucrum. (If you're familiar with free body diagram, the loading will be triangular here. Break the rod into maybe 100 sections for numerical analysis) Now we need to apply our stopping force. Here we need to solve some things. For our equations, we need equilibrium. Thus we need: sum of the forces in the tangential direction equal to zero. For us, this means: 

F(l) times pendulum length / 2 + REQ'D STOPPING FORCE + FULCRUMFORCE = zero. 

We have two unknowns here unfortunately. Thus we must invoke the sum of the moments equals zero about the pin most simply. Let F(x) = inertial force which we calculated above. (F(x) = specific mass(kg/m) * l * x) Note F(l) = max force and pinx = location of pin. So: 

(F(l) + F(pin))*(l-pinx)/2 + STOPPINGFORCE + pinx*F(pinx)/2 - FULCRUMFORCE = 0. 

FULCRUMFORCE may be positive or negative. Here it is pointing downwards if the pendulum is stopping pointing to the right from spinning clockwise. Now you have 2 variables and 2 unknowns. I trust you can solve them. Now we may have Force as a function of x. Now, the beam doesn't break at the highest force, it breaks at the largest moment. Look up shear and moment diagrams. The are essential to an understanding of this problem. The moment is the integral of the shear force (which we calculated) over the distance. Perform your numerical integration and find the maximum magnitude(s) and you have your possible breaking points.

Note that for any interesting solutions, you cannot make your grid size to fine, as this only increases the force needed and increases the moment which will most likely not be true. There will be a critical step where anything above that will yield a break at the pin.

Once you calculate this position and force, we can somewhat approximate it's actual value. We now need a reasonable acceleration, thickness and shear strength along with the height and shear strength to obtain a reasonable guess as to whether or not it will break. Look up some mechanics of materials equations to check as I'm kind of out of steam.

The sole purpose of these systems is to spread either positive or negative news about a given target.  The term target is multifaceted;  Target could refer to a specific corporation, a person, a political ideology, or -- less generally (edit: more specifically, as in more target-specific than a political ideology) -- a topic that is on the mind of the public.

Automated Propaganda Networks may be considered a subset of the topic ""Utilizing Social Networks to Modify Public Opinion Online.""  The latter may itself be considered a less-explored or mostly-unexplored topic in the field of Computer Science called Social Network Analysis (SNA). As an aside, the federal government is currently vomiting money in that general direction.

SNA is a budding field that is at the crossroads of mathematics (graph theory, statistics), computer science (computer networks, natural language processing, algorithmic sentiment analysis), and the human sciences (psychology, marketing, political science).  The driving force behind SNA is actually not the offensive utilization of social networks, but the prediction and automated gauging of public opinion.  For example, marketing firms would like better ways to advertise, judge public response to advertisements, and better predict the success of a given product.  Political candidates want better polling systems.  Etc.

The conference that I follow in SNA is SocialCom.  I presented a paper at SocialCom 2011 at MIT, but to maintain some minute amount of anonymity, I'm not going to link you to it (edit: the paper itself).   Let me see if I can grab you some current research -- you don't want to pay $30 per paper..

Edit: Links to socialcom conference.  AFAIK this is pretty much the top-tier conference in social computing.  Paper acceptance rate is about 9%.

True,ItchyFlea,,,"I'm surprised at the sense of entitlement I'm seeing in some of the posts on this subreddit recently. When did the uptight young players of Minecraft start playing KSP, and why did they bring their sense of entitlement along with them?

I'm in the same boat as everybody else here, the patcher annoys the heck out of me, and sometimes, I too, will complain. However I won't go overboard and start accusing squid of theft (which one person did in another thread, but with different wording) just because the patcher has issues.

I get it, the patcher has problems. Guess what? The game does too. I really don't understand why so many people have such a sense of entitlement. Yes, you paid for a game that's currently in alpha. You *knew* that when you purchased the game, as the website clearly states the games current state prior to purchase. If you didn't, that is your fault for not paying attention, not anybody else's.

Just because you can't get the latest update the same second it comes out, doesn't give you a right to jump off the deep end. As I've seen, if there's a problem with how updates are distributed, Squad will do something to try and alleviate the problems.

At first, a new update was just a full download directly from their servers, which most of the time couldn't cope with the strain of thousands of people trying to download all at once, and the servers would crash.

So Squad has tried a new approach, with this patcher. This really improved the availability of the game when a new release came out. Instead of waiting several days to get a new version, I could download it with the patcher the same day. (Heck, I got 0.18 less than an hour after it was made available, same with 0.18.1)

And now, they've gone with uploading the game to Amazon.

Sure, your complaints will have helped to shape Squads direction for improving the availability of the game when a new update is available, but jumping off the deep end, calling Squad and their patcher shit isn't constructive, its just going to annoy people. Constructive criticism is the best way to get results to a problem. Non-constructive criticism, on the other hand, isn't going to really get you anywhere.

TL;DR Version: Be patient. If there's a problem distributing a new update, Squad will do their best to fix the problem. Jumping off the deep end calling Squad, and their attempts to improve the distribution of new updates shit, isn't going to help solve the problem in any way.

True,Amadameus,,,"Since you don't want to be data-logged, ""doing this a better way"" pretty much means getting off Facebook. You could create a ""watcher"" account that simply keeps tabs on your friends, but the temptation is too great and I don't advise it. There are better, more meaningful ways to keep in touch - for example, hang out with your nearby friends and write letters to your faraway ones.


**Easy, sloppy way?** Deactivate your Facebook. Don't return to it while you're in the waiting period, and eventually your profile will be deactivated. You won't be able to use it, but it'll still be stored in their records forever.


**Harder, complete way?** DON'T deactivate your Facebook. If you do this, then FB has a complete record of you from 2009-2012. The only thing you've done in this case is stop your access to the account and their direct data logging, but they still know your friends, your likes/dislikes, et cetera. And they will use this information to build a ""phantom profile"" of you based on your friends activities and such.


Since they don't delete any data, the second-best way to remove your info on FB is to replace it with garbage. If you do this all at once, they'll be able to notice easily. Instead, you'll slowly and quietly replace all information on FB with useless junk data. The transition will be so gradual that the content-bots won't flag you, and you'll effectively become a nobody. Bonus points - you contribute to the number of spambots on FB!


**UNO** - inform all your friends of what you'll be doing. This is the only step I skipped, and I regret it. Send them a message on FB that you'll be getting in touch with them off of FB. Contact them through some non-Facebook means, and tell them how you'd prefer to be contacted. Telephone, AIM, email, whatever. (Keep it to your short list of friends - because calling or emailing is much harder than FB poking, you'll need to evaluate which of your FB 'friends' are actually friends. I was surprised.) Same goes for family - get all their emails and contact info so you won't be left out of the loop.


**DOS** - clean house. Rip all your data off FB, using GiveMeMyData or some similar tool. Then clear all your old junk off FB, using Exfoliate or some similar tool. I used Exfoliate to delete everything 1 week old or older. FB gets to know about it, but nobody else does!


**TRES** - make a timeline. Set a total amount of time - how long until you want to be rid of FB? I chose 1-2 years, to be on the safe side, but you're welcome to choose any amount of time. Divide this up into sections - by X date, you should be 75% true on FB. By X date, you should be 50%, then 25%, and finally 0% of the stuff on FB actually relates to you. Hold to this timeline, and keep it someplace you'll see. I printed mine out and tacked it on the wall by my computer.


**QUATRO** - start identifying ways FB can track you. This is actually easier if you assume they track everything, and start building a fake persona. You're a Democrat? FB You is a Republican! You like computers? FB You likes football! You work at an insurance agency? FB You is getting involved in politics! It's easy. While you're at it, make a quick note of things that could identify you - your friends, locations you like to hang out, groups you're a part of, where you work, where you live, etc.


**CINCO** - resist the urge to start closing off your privacy settings. Instead, open them wide! Make sure there's nothing embarrassing or incriminating on there (Exfoliate should have already done 80% of that) and then let the world see the new you! Start actively looking for new friends. At first, find friends of friends. Make it a habit to send out 2-3 friend requests per day. Once this is a trend that's well-established (a week?) start making more unsolicited friend requests. Go to the groups labeled ""OMG I HEART RANDOM FRIENDS"" and friend request three of them a day. Friend request DJs and political figures. Friend request businesses and Jersey Shore hags. The more vapid and brainless, the better. (Changing your profile pic to an attractive model makes your success rate skyrocket) Once you get a few accepted requests, start friending their friends. Build a network, a social group out of people who have never seen you before. It's actually easy! (Once I built a network, I started to notice people tagging me in group photos and mentioning me in their posts - even though I lived in a totally different country!)


**SEIS** - start erasing your previous info. Do it slowly, but consistently. Delete old photos of you. Remove tags. Change your interests and alter your work record. While you're creating your false persona, allow it to quietly overwrite your real persona. Use the data you collected from GiveMeMyData to make sure nobody you actually know is left on FB by the end.


**SIETE** - once your online profile has been reduced to nothing but randomly selected interests and a collection of people you don't know, simply stop using it. Maybe if you enjoy trolling, use your profile to mess with people or something - but it's done. It's junk data, a pile of useless 1s and 0s meant for nothing more than covering up the 1s and 0s you didn't like.


**OCHO** - maintain the new ways you kept in touch with your friends. I now have a wonderful hobby out of writing letters to people. When you tell people you don't have a Facebook, the next thing you'll hear is an incredulous *""how do you keep in touch with your friends?""* as if people never interacted before FB. When they ask that, you need to be ready. You write letters, you mail each other books you've read with little Post-its inside containing your thoughts and comments on particular sections, you play Halo together, you have coffee every Tuesday at Missy's Diner, you volunteer at your local high school, you go drinking together, there are infinite ways to keep in touch! Once you explore some of the *real* ways people interact, the pokes and games of FB look like the pale and lifeless gestures they always were.

True,sighsalot,,,"There was a great post in this sub a few months back about the change in club culture in the past few years, where the scene went from exclusivity to a place where everyone was accepted but it was more about showing off your wealth by paying $150 for a bottle of $20 vodka and three grand for a table. 

Some clubs in Miami, like Liv and Mansion are horribly guilty of this. The main crowd is a bunch of drugged up trust-fund boys and future trophy wives who want to go out clubbing for a night and couldn't care less who the DJ is. 

The problem in Miami is that the biggest clubs are all connected through a shady group of people (*cough the Opium group*) who know all the managers in the business. Ultra Music Festival has made Miami a destination for EDM in the past few years, and the connections of these big clubs allows them to book huge names like DJ Shadow, Armin van Buuren, Deadmau5,  etc to play *every weekend*. I live in Coral Gables, I constantly see artists I love playing at these big clubs who can afford to book the huge names. 

But again, the main crowd who can afford to pay outrageous amounts of money are the ones who get to enjoy the music. That means the audience comes to get fucked up, and to music they recognize. So when a DJ isn't catering to his or her audience... things like what happened last week can happen. It's not a new phenomenon. 

But that's not to say there isn't a good scene in Miami if you look! There are places like Grand Central, hell even Space has good shows. I saw Cut Copy, Mord Fustang, Flosstradamus and plenty of awesome shows with an awesome crowd without ever buying an overpriced drink or bribing a bouncer. The gigs organized through parties like Live Nation are always good shows for me, and it's made me a returning customer. I'm always sad when people talk shit about the Miami scene, because there are *really* good shows there if you know where to look. I've come to respect a lot of the local DJs who open up for smaller acts and go to their own club nights without a major act, because I enjoy the crowd and their style which is how I feel the scene should be. 

Even out of the city there are good places. Coconut Grove in Coral Gables is fucking wild on Thursday nights  mostly because of UM. Good music, cheap drinks, a sexy and awesome crowd and zero fucks are given, I recommend checking out Mr. Frogs in the Grove for a good time if you're visiting Miami and don't want to go to a big club where you can't get in. El Sitio we nickname El Shittio because it's always a shit show and it's usually hilariously good time.

It might just be a word, but it is a word that has some pretty negative associations in my life. The blazé way that people toss it around here is, in my mind, just childish and uninformed. They claim that they are appropriating the word, making it mean something else, but it is not for society at large to do that, in the same way that it is not up to the white community to appropriating nigger, or spic. Faggot has similar incredibly negative connotations for gays, and while I'm sure that the intent of people who use it on here aren't to make people uncomfortable, I certainly still do every time I see people upvoting comments like ""OP is a faggot"".

just my two cents.

I'm all for people using whatever words they please, but it does bother me that people pretend that their use of ""faggot"" doesn't imply anything homophobic.

""OP is a faggot"" images always have text like ""OP literally cannot stop sucking dicks"", or something similar. For example -- [one of the top images](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/457/438/862.jpg) in Know Your Meme's ""OP is a faggot"" page. Even in this thread, someone below called the person you're replying to ""homo"".

True,KAMalosh,,,"Yes, we are.  Faggot is a word that has been used to abuse, oppress and subdue gay men for decades.  Fuck is a word that has been used for decades as a naughty way to describe fornication.  There's a pretty significant difference there.

The word faggot is not for Reddit or 4chan or the straight community to reclaim and redefine.  If gay men wish to reclaim it, they can, but they better be aware that it's a word that still offends many people, so if they use it, they might piss some people off.

I have also been around the internet for a while. I am not so bothered by the word itself as I am by the cavalier use and bitching when someone calls the user out. They offended someone, intentionally or not. Now they know better, and can apologize and adjust their behavior if they want people to not be pissed. After that, they know it will offend, and when they use it, they are making a choice to offend someone. All I'm asking people to do in a public forum is exactly what you would do with your friends. Why should strangers, aka potential friends be treated differently than actual friends?

Not really. See [*Heller*](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/07pdf/07-290.pdf), page 8:

&gt; Some have made the argument, bordering on the frivo­lous, that only those arms in existence in the 18th century are protected by the Second Amendment.  We do not in­terpret constitutional rights that way.  Just as the First Amendment protects modern forms of communications, e.g., Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union, 521 U. S. 844, 849 (1997), and the Fourth Amendment applies to modern forms of search, e.g., Kyllo v. United States, 533 U. S. 27, 35–36 (2001), the Second Amendment extends, prima facie, to all instruments that constitute bearable arms, even those that were not in existence at the time of the founding.

Of particular note, ""the Second Amendment extends, prima facie, to all instruments that constitute bearable arms""

&gt; Subjective.

Not really. How else could, for example, a smaller woman, who hasn't spent years developing skill in martial arts, defend herself against a large, male attacker? Pepper spray? A TASER? Those don't always work; you can fight through pepper spray, and [you should not rely on a TASER unless you have a firearm as backup](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vG2M7er_txc) (video, probably NSFL; a guy dies, but there's no gore). I would never use a TASER in a circumstance outside law enforcement.

&gt; So you arbitrarily decided to stop at wheelchair?

Just an example. I'm not sure what your point with the following paragraph is about; they level the playing field for anyone able to use them. Most people who have lost the use of their legs but are otherwise physically healthy are still able to function independently; with the exception of missing arms, I'm not aware of a purely-physical injury that would preclude independence and prevent being able to use a firearm. If you're talking about shooting skill, it's actually not that hard. Until a few weeks ago, I had fired all of ten rounds from a handgun. I rented a gun in 9mm, and between myself and one other person we fired 150 rounds at something like 25 feet or more. Every one of them would have been effective hits on a person at that range. Without much more practice at the range, you could do a fair bit better, and if you spend some time at home practicing your draw, you can be good enough to stop an attacker.

OK, as for the first part, it isn't an area I know much about. I was not even aware what STEM was until I got to reddit. Although, if anything, my sense is that it is the STEM folks who look down at non-STEM folks. My sense is that SRS is reacting to the STEM distain for non-STEMers and that SRS is not anti-STEM. But, in general, it's not something I generally pay much attention to. 

As far as nature/nuture in terms of math aptitude, etc., I am not sufficiently up on the science to have that debate (though I am generally skeptical of such claims - it used to be thought that women couldn't participate in athletics, for example). So, it would be a citation needed situation (but I'm kind of doubting nature/nuture has been definitely worked out since I last looked at it). What I will say is that feminists I certainly have a great deal of respect for - Carol Gilligan, for one - assumed hard-wired differences between the genders (although, of course, the extent and implication of those difference has been hotly debated). 

&gt; Feminism holds that a nice, caring, submissive guy would be perfect relationship material

Lolwut? Citation needed.

&gt; However, women tend not to be attracted to those men, a deep biological feeling that no one has intellectual control over.

This is all painted with too broad a brush to go anywhere. I can say that I don't have cognitive dissonance with respect to my sexual attractions.

But something that I would consider a line of division among feminists is the degree to which you're sex positive. Pornography has always been very divisive. And I would wager there is disagreement regarding certain consensual bdsm sexual activity. I tend to fall pretty heavily onto the sex positive side of the spectrum, but honestly, I haven't engaged the feminists who fall on the other side of this debate. So, I'm not *that* familiar with the other side.

But all in all, I think once rephrased, you have actually identified two areas that are very heavily debated WITHIN feminism.

True,fdnynyr,,,"This is similar to what Columbine should have been. The intention of Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold wasn't to just commit a school shooting. They made multiple 20 pound bombs. 2 of which they brought into the cafeteria which were supposed to detonate at 11:17am and 2 more, one in each of their cars set to detonate a short time later. Those were timed to go off when people were running out of the school. They studied the school for months. Plotting and figuring out when the cafeteria and the library were most full so their bombs could do the most damage. Their intention was to detonate the bombs in the cafeteria at the peak hour thus causing the library above to collapse in on it. This alone would have killed hundreds. They then would have positioned themselves outside picking off survivors as they ran out side. Their secondary devices would have killed people running past their cars as they tried to get away. After they realized their bombs hadn't gone off is when they decided to start going inside and shooting people. In one of the videos from the cafeteria Eric Harris can be seen shooting one of the propane tanks with his gun ( possibly his first attempt at suicide that day). Most people think Columbine was because of bullying where studies have shown that Eric Harris was a psychopath who believed himself better then everyone around him ( hence he wore a "" natural selection"" shirt during the massacre). They believe that something like this would have happened either way with Eric Harris while Dylan Klebold was heavily influenced by Eric and probably would hae not committed something like this without that influence. 

""The killers, in fact, laughed at petty school shooters. They bragged about dwarfing the carnage of the Oklahoma City bombing and originally scheduled their bloody performance for its anniversary. Klebold boasted on video about inflicting ""the most deaths in U.S. history."" Columbine was intended not primarily as a shooting at all, but as a bombing on a massive scale. If they hadn't been so bad at wiring the timers, the propane bombs they set in the cafeteria would have wiped out 600 people. After those bombs went off, they planned to gun down fleeing survivors. An explosive third act would follow, when their cars, packed with still more bombs, would rip through still more crowds, presumably of survivors, rescue workers, and reporters. The climax would be captured on live television. It wasn't just ""fame"" they were after—Agent Fuselier bristles at that trivializing term—they were gunning for devastating infamy on the historical scale of an Attila the Hun. Their vision was to create a nightmare so devastating and apocalyptic that the entire world would shudder at their power.""

True,TheCat5001,gilded l-1597e2 c-c7kobqa,"We did not find the gods, but became as gods ourselves.","This conversation would ideally take place on a clear night at a fire.

Look around you, look at the heavens and the earth, the trees swaying in the wind, think of the stars, the Sun and the Moon. You have probably wondered where they came from. Who made them. What is fire and how does it burn?

You might think that a god or many gods made the stars, made the stone from which you make your tools. That the anger of the gods makes the sky cry out in rage with the thunder of a storm. That their vengeance makes the earth tremble without warning. That we are helpless creatures in the face of such power, and that all we can do is pray the gods have mercy.

I come from a place where we have looked for the gods. We have searched for their dwellings, for their reasons and their powers, and what we have found was beyond our wildest dreams. But I'm getting ahead of myself. Lend me your ear, and I shall tell you a story so amazing, it could not be imagined. And I give you my word that all of it is true.

Let us start with the Earth, the hills and valleys, the rocks and grassy meadows. It stretches as far as the eye can see in every direction, such grand splendor. It is round, a great ball of rock and water floating in nothingness among the stars. We cling to its surface, tiny creates on a giant sphere. How do we cling to it? We call it gravity, for it gives *gravitas*, weight to us and everything around us. Everything in the universe pulls on each other through gravity, yet the Earth is so great and massive that it feels like it only pulls on us. 

The Sun is a star, massive and giant, greater than a thousand Earths combined. And it attracts the Earth through gravity, our planet - that's what we call it - circling around it year after year. Our position towards the Sun causes the seasons. The Earth rotates around its axis, causing day and night, yet it rotates with a tilt. If we are tilted towards the Sun, we have Summer. If we are tilted away, we have Winter.

The Moon rotates around the Earth like the Earth rotates around the Sun. Great spheres rotating around each other in the inky black nothingness of space. But even the Sun, the Earth and the Moon are tiny specs compared to the vast distances to the stars. As I said, the Sun is a star like them, but it is very close to us. The others are like the Sun, some even the size of a thousand Suns, vast distances away.

We have searched for the meaning of the stars, and we have found that they are just like us, Suns with planets, mostly barren and scorched rock. There might be other creatures there, but we don't know. We have peered into infinity and seen the creation of the universe. But we have found no gods.

But besides things great, we have also studied things small. Wave your hand and feel the air. Look at the water and see it flow. Water and air are similar, yet different. They *flow*. Look at this rock. It is hard. Solid. But yet still, it is similar to the water and the air. They are all made of *atoms*. Tiny particles, too tiny to even comprehend their tinyness. But there are billions and billions of them in every rock, in every lungful of air, in every mouthful of water. Each different kind of particles. The ones in the air hardly interact. They bounce off each other, but have great distances between them. The ones in the water crawl across and about each other, interacting but not pulling each other tight. In the rock, the atoms are strongly bound. They have fixed places towards each other, and vibrate around their resting place. A hot rock will have the atoms vibrate more, and if you heat it very much, the rock may melt, and turn liquid like the water.

We have found how these particles act with each other. We have learned what fire *is*. The particles of the wood react with the particles of the air. But it cannot do so by itself. It needs heat to start. But then the wood is consumed, and heat comes out. It heats the surrounding air, so hot that it starts to glow. That is the flame of the fire. We have tamed this fire, we have made boxes which summon it at will.

But we have looked even deeper. The atom has a structure, we have found that it is composed of even smaller particles, held together by seemingly magic forces which attract at a distance, much like gravity. Only this one is electricity and magnetism. We have studied this, and found the behavior of the small particles to be even stranger than we could possible imagine. Particles are in multiple places at once! They move in different directions at once! They can instantly move through impassable walls, they can do seemingly impossible things. We thought the gods crazy.

We have built machines, great things to smash these particles into each other. We have broken these particles down to even smaller bits, and found them to be weirder and more magical every time we looked. We have used this knowledge to give us light, heat, great machines which let us move at speeds that no animal can reach. We can reach the other side of the planet in half a day.

We have built a giant machine which shoots fire down to fly. We have sent it to the Moon with men inside. We have had men walk on the Moon, and found it to be a strange world, similar to the Earth yet different. There is no air there. There is gravity, yet it is lighter than here. But we have found no gods.

We have done all this. We have been everywhere on Earth. We have found monsters in the oceans and built machines that can fly. We have been to the Moon. We have studied the Sun and the stars, we have studied the tiniest particles which make up everything that exists. We have mastered warmth and cold, light and dark, fire and ice. We have looked for the gods, but found only natural beauty, and ways to master it. We did not find the gods, but became as gods ourselves.",0,1356203640,,0,1356288862,1,c7kobqa,t3_1597e2,t1_c7kobqa,t3_1597e2,,1430745581,275,False,explainlikeIAmA,t5_2t5iz,275

True,jeffp12,system,,"Lets say you have a station at a circular orbit of 150 km. You send up a pod and get to the same 150 km circular orbit, but are on the other side of the planet (like you did). 

Lower the orbit of the pod so that it's apoapsis is still 150 km, but it's periapsis is lower than 150. It doesn't matter how much lower. Remember, a lower orbit is a shorter distance, and so you'll catch up. The lower the orbit the more catching up. So when you have a lot of ground to make up, dropping to 130 km will start to do it. Once you're closing in then raise that periapsis to 140, then 145. When you're almost at rendezvous, perhaps just a periapsis of 148 or 149. 

The key concept is that you gain ground in a lower orbit. You lose ground in a higher orbit. 

So if you take incremental steps, you'll get to a point where you're just a few km apart. Then return to that circular orbit, and your distance should pretty much stabilize. That's when you start to dock, and stop worrying about orbits, but that's only when you're within 2-3 km or so. Beyond that, thrusting at your target will actually take you away from it, since thrusting at it will raise your speed, thus raise you to a higher orbit, and that will mean you will lose ground. 

You'll also probably have some north-south variance in your orbit, that's called inclination. You'll notice the target moving left and right, back and forth. Look at the map view, you'll see a slight difference in the orbits. They will however merge, then diverge again twice per orbit. What you do is wait until they merge, when the station and the pod are in the same inclination, then thrust straight north or south to compensate for that motion until your orbits line up exactly on the map view. 


If you overshoot, as you did, then what you need to do is get into a higher orbit. Higher orbit means you lose ground. Lower orbit means you gain ground. So if you go too far, then wait until you're at your apoapsis of 150 km, then burn, making that point your periapsis, and making your apoapsis 152 km, or some bigger number depending on how much ground you have to make up. Then as the station catches up, keep lowering your apoapsis until you rendezvous, at which point, circularize, then dock.

We've lost 5 CL finals.

* In one, our most influential player of the time had his foot almost torn in half on the pitch and we had to play the last 40 minutes with 10 players. There were no substitutions allowed at the time. We lost 2-1.

* In another, our goalie suffered a dreadful goal and was injured. There were no subs at the time, so we had to use a central defender in goal for most of the game. We lost 1-0. Also, the field was flooded with water ([video here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBIJARn2NOs) . Goal at 2:30, Injury and Defender Goalie at 5:50)

* In another one, Eusébio lost an easy goal in the last moments of the game that would give us the win against Man Utd. We eventually lost 4-1 in E.T. ([video here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-miJBBb5eA). Eusébio fail at 9:40)

* In another one we lost it on penalties. ([video here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgiTE0Topi0). Penalty fail at 5:47)

* Also, 2 of those 5 finals we lost were played in the opponent's country (v man utd in wembley and v Inter in San Siro) and one of them was actually in the opponents own stadium (v. Inter in San Siro).

&gt;After the 1962 final Guttmann approached the Benfica board of directors and asked for a pay rise, but, despite the success he had bought the club, he was turned down. On leaving Benfica he allegedly cursed the club, declaring ""Not in a hundred years from now will Benfica ever win a European Cup"". Despite being finalists on five occasions – 1963, 1965, 1968, 1988 and 1990 – Benfica have never since won any European Championship. Before the 1990 final, which was played in Vienna, where Guttmann was buried, Eusébio even prayed unsuccessfully at his grave and asked for the curse to be broken.[citation needed]",0,1356226188,,0,1356231249,1,c7kte12,t3_15ak84,t1_c7kte12,t1_c7kp86p,,1430747965,27,False,soccer,t5_2qi58,27

True,unseenpuppet,molgas,Gastronomist,"Both true cinnamon(Cinnamomum verum/Cinnamomum zeylanicum/Ceylon Cinnamon) and Cassia(an umbrela term for any other plant in the Cinnamomum genus) can be found in stick form so this is probably not the case. There is no labeling law that requires the use of the cinnamon to only refer to true cinnamon, so it is difficult to know for sure.

In powdered form, it is virtually impossible to tell exactly what plant's bark you are buying. In stick form, an indication is in the thickness of the layers. Cinnamon is thinner than cassia. Cassia is also rolled up more, while cinnamon is more layered. The color of cinnamon is also slighter lighter, and the texture a bit smoother.

It should be noted that I don't think it is such a good idea to hate on cassia. Just because it isn't true cinnamon doesn't mean the plant isn't equally as delicious. There are several types of cassia that can, in my opinion, rival ceylon any day.

True,sotonohito,,,"If he'd put through a deal that involved abandoning the Tea Party and bringing in some Democrats he'd have lost the long game.  As well as likely lost his position as speaker.

Right now one of the major things that gives the Republicans their power is their party unity.  They are working more like a party in a Parliamentary system, voting as a bloc, etc.  

One thing the Democrats have failed to understand is that the Republicans are very good at playing the long game and it's pretty much all they do.  Losing a vote here and there, losing an election here and there, being blamed for failures by the President, is all stuff they'll pay as a price for pushing the long term politics of the nation more their direction.  Why do you think that the Democratic party in the USA is generally to the right of the right wing parties of Europe?  It's because the Republicans are very good at moving the Overton Window.

That's why they've got a whole branch of people devoted to being publicly seen as crazy who have the job of pushing really out on the fringe ideas into the mainstream.  The militia leaders, backwater talk radio hosts, less respected weekly newspaper columnists, etc all take ideas that are currently so far out of the mainstream that no one who pushes them can be taken seriously, and they push them at the cost of their own credibility.  Then the higher tier commentators talk about the ""controversy"" which moves the idea further into the mainstream.  Repeat a few times and soon torture, a tax rate for the wealthy that's at a historic low, indefinite detention, public health care as Communistic evil, assassination programs targeting US citizens, endless decade long wars on three fronts,  etc are positions that everyone including the Democrats take as given.

So no, Boehner will not break his party's unity to give the President a deal.  In the short term it'd be a good thing for Boehner and the Republicans, Obama has indicated that he'll trade away massive cuts in Social Security, Medicare/Medicaid, etc for pocket change level (and temporary) tax increases on a few millionaires.  If the Republicans were playing the short game they'd take it and count it as a win.

Rory waited 2000 years for her yeah. But if he really cared about her, he would let her do what makes her happy instead of emotionally blackmailing her.

Everybody seems to overlook the fact that she sacrificed her *life* for him. Twice. That she choose to get zapped by an angel so she could live with him. Amy makes big sacrifices to Rory. Just because Amy doesn't snuggle Rory and crawl into his arms and talk about how much she loves him doesn't mean that Rory loves her more. It was Rory that Amy was counting on to rescue her from Demon's Run. And from the Silence in the Impossible Astronaut. Amy always chooses Rory and she always chooses to live her life with him or not at all (Amy's Choice).

So she treated him like crap in Vampires of Venice. So she makes fun of him. Yeah, they made up and he likes the teasing.

Rory pulled a major jerk move saying that to Amy. Amy doesn't *owe* Rory her love. If she doesn't love him, then she doesn't love him. But she does. So to say that your love is greater is just some major BS. Or to say that love is measurable by the actions performed. And even if it was- again, Amy sacrifices herself twice.

True,FrankReynolds,,,"Okay.  I will explain myself for your benefit.

* **Team Fortress 2 is boring.**  It brought absolutely nothing new to the FPS genre, unless you count microtransactions.  The gameplay, to me, was wholly uninteresting, and everything about the game just felt like it was sluggish.  It feels like it is trying to be a little bit of everything.

* **Valve is not some saviour of gaming**.  Half-life and Half-life 2 are great games, but one was released a decade and a half ago and one was released almost a decade ago *and is still not complete*.  If any other gaming developer pulled the shit Valve has pulled with the Half-Life series, reddit would be sending White House petitions to have them removed from the country.  Gabe Newell has a history of following the dollar.  Look at what he said about the PS3, calling it a miserable failure and a trainwreck, then giving it native Steam support and account binding once it started selling well.  He opposes any competition to Steam.

* **MOBA games are not interesting at all.**  Just a personal opinion.  I do not find these games entertaining to play or watch.

* **I didn't enjoy BioShock in the least**.  I may have overstated that, because I really liked the environment and design of BioShock.  The story and gameplay left me wanting it to be so much more.  It was hailed as the spiritual successor to System Shock 2, and it was nothing of the sort.

* **Portal 1 and 2 are the most overrated video games ever.**  Look, I enjoyed Portal and Portal 2, but I don't think they are as great as they are made out to be.  The level design in Portal 1 is quite poor, and the game lasts all of two hours if you're taking your time.  Portal 2 was much better, but still a bite sized experience with a tad more ""story"" thrown in.  Level design was far superiour to Portal 1, but that isn't saying much.

* **Indie games are enjoyable about 1% of the time.**  Most indie games, especially recent ones, try to be ""art"" and forget that video games are supposed to be fun.  Bastion hit the nail on the head, and managed to be a bit of both.  Just go browse Desura or any indie gaming site, and you'll see 90% of the games are derivative platformers that try to shoehorn ""artsy"" elements into the game that just end up detracting from any kind of fun.

* **Nintendo is a shitty company.**  Shitty may have been the wrong word.  I guess a better phrase would have been, ""archaic, unimaginative, stale"" company.  The hardware they release is nothing but gimmicks.  The Wii brought motion controls.  Look how many people give a shit about motion controls now.  The DS brought two screens.  There are maybe a handful of games that even utilize both screens in a way that make them both useful or needed.  The 3DS brought 3D, a technology that companies try to resurrect every decade only to leave it alone five years later.  The WiiU brought the second-screen-on-a-controller thing.  I'll put money down right now that says the next Nintendo console doesn't have that.  And lets talk about games!  Show me the last great, refreshing IP or game that Nintendo has made.  SMG is probably the last one, and that was over five years ago.  And looking past SMG, you have to go back even further than that.  They re-re-re-re-re-re-release their best games on every new console, and those become the reason to own said console.  Sorry, but I don't feel like buying Metroid or Ocarina of Time again.  I won't even mention online capabilities.

* **SWTOR is fun.**  Again, personal preference.  I play video games to be entertained, and what entertains me is a good story.  SWTOR gives me that.  Sure, the end-game is stale and repetitive, but I don't care about end-game.  The leveling experience in SWTOR is the best I have ever found in an MMO, and it keeps me coming back.

But you need to snap out of it and re-word your standards. An ""amazing person"" would not have done this to you. If cheating on you with a child is ""treating you *so* well,"" I'm curious as to how you stay alive by the end of his bad days. 

You need to ask yourself: This is what ""being his"" entails. This is what I signed on for, but I can get out. Now that I know what he is capable of, do I really want this ""forever""? For my whole life? 

What about when your kids hit high school? Can they have friends over? Will your husband try to bang them, too? Maybe, maybe not, but *you*'ll always wonder.

* He's dating a sixteen year old. Avoid internalizing this... I know it's hard *not* to! But understand that it reflects badly upon him and her, not you. I mean, he is married and therefore should know better or have better values. You didn't *make him* do anything. And, uh... he's twelve years older. Pshh- that love doesn't last forever.

Other thoughts....

* **Keep the evidence. I can't stress this enough. You can always choose to not use it later.** Make a rough transcript, or take direct quotes out of his conversation with her. Especially if they are insinuating that they've had sexual contact of any kind, it's gonna be really useful in the divorce if you decide to go that path (UM YOU SHOULD). Also, if he starts trying to derail or distract you, even blame you- it'll keep you focused (and pissed) enough to stay on topic and get enough answers to make an informed decision. 

I know you love him and might just want to make it quick/easy, but... divorce is costly (so is staying him because self-respect is priceless), and you have a standard of living you were accustomed to, until he decided to take that right out from under you. I think it's a *But for* argument: *But for* his cheating, you would have it much easier (distress, a place to live... would you need to move/work/change jobs?), and therefore he should be liable for getting you back on your feet.

As for the confrontation...

&gt;He then asked me to leave him out of it and not tell my husband that he told me anything about it.

Fuck this guy. He let his friend parade his pet teenager around for *months*, and it didn't occur to him to give you a heads-up. *He has the NERVE to ask for a favor from you!?* Betrayal begets betrayal, my dear. Don't feel bad about not obeying someone who screwed you. You owe him nothing- just as he acted like he owed you nothing. It's likely that your husband is going to give you denial bullshit (or *You looked through my phone GAWD you're crazy* cheating-man-bullshit) until you let loose the source anyway. 

So, I would consider bypassing the phone argument and cut right to ""Your best friend sold you out."" 

&gt;Should I stay with him or move out?

Do whatever makes you comfortable without regard to his convenience. If that's going to your parents, do that. If that's kicking him out because you have shit to do, even better. Hell, make him stay with Cheyenne! If she wants him so bad, she can take responsibility of ""her"" man now. (I'll bet right now that her love's as deep as the script of Twilight, and their romance will last half as long once she's actually got to deliver the goods.)

&gt;Should I tell the police? 

I'm genuinely curious as to whether or not they can do anything, but personally, if my kid was being a hoe with some older married guy, I'd want to know. 28 year old men aren't *in love* with teenagers unless there is something fundamentally wrong with the man. After this, would you really want to stay married to this guy and have daughters with him? Just saying... danger ahoy.

&gt;If he promised never to see her again, could we stay together?

You know, he also promised a lot of other things in your *MARRIAGE VOWS.* I don't think he's going to respect a lot of promises from here on out. 

TL;DR: You can't get rid of every nubile young female he ever meets. It's WAY easier to get rid of a shitty proto-pedo husband.

True,azn6138,MAL,http://myanimelist.net/animelist/azn6138,"Sugou never ceases to be crazy, huh. What actually happened to his right eye? That seems weird, since he was sliced on the left cheek in-game... He looked like he was back to normal, but grey-haired in his interrogation scene; what happened in that case?

I'm overjoyed at the epilogue part, and how that was the vast majority of the episode.

Kazuto meeting Asuna for the first time was very touching, finally the IRL meeting happens after two years in game and one week of extreme sketchiness. Straight to the kiss, I'm assuming that means that they've implicitly agreed to date already. Thought it was a nice gesture, for the Kirito and Asuna avatars to turn their backs, hold hands and walk off. Their purpose has been completed.

At least the sandwich won't disappear if he doesn't finish it this time around. Also, at the discussion about character names v. IRL names, Asuna would typically be referred to as ""Yuuki-san"", unless they're dating, no? Either way, that was definitely a lame excuse for Kazuto not to bother changing. Typical, I guess.

Poor Sugu; she must feel so left out at the two meetups. I guess she'll reappear down the road in future escapades? I can't foresee her being left out from the gang. It was touching to see the ALO dance, seeing as to how they've reconciled and still care about each other. I'm glad that Kazuto isn't ignoring her and wants to involve her in their group.

As for Klein, I wonder if he actually goes to work with the bandana on his head, or wore it for recognition sake.

Surely, the World Seed is foretelling what's to come, yeah?

THE RETURN OF CROSSING FIELD. YES. CLOSURE ACHIEVED.

----

**General implications on the series:**

The SAO arc was fantastic, no doubt about that in my mind. Spine-chilling danger, adrenaline-pumping fights, character relationships and development... Got me watching this show and I loved every minute of it. Asuna and Kazuto's married life were probably my favourites, and watching their interactions made me feel warm and fuzzy inside. Akihiko was a great villain, deranged but understandable, unique in his approach. Watching everyone band together to clear the game brought me back to playing MMOs.

ALO was alright. Definitely not as strong as the SAO arc, and it elicited totally different emotions. I felt Kazuto's unrelenting drive to rescue Asuna, and the fact that Sugou needed a good beating was what kept me watching this time around. The arc felt a lot more focused than SAO, and I'm glad that they spent fewer episodes on it. Sugu's a nice character (and it was equally nice to hear Azunyan again), albeit a bit awkward in the way she crushed on her first cousin. Another thing I appreciate about the arc is that it concluded *realistically*; Sugu took rejection exactly as expected (i.e. pretty badly, but understood their familial ties in the end), and Kazuto delivered Sugou his beating as deserved (i.e. without remorse). The main issue that I had with this arc were Sugou's extreme ecchi-sketchiness with Asuna, and with him being an obsessive nutjob. It did make me loathe him (as I believe he was designed), and I really don't think I'd be able to stand rewatching the ecchi-sketchy parts of ALO if Kazuto didn't eliminate him the way he did.

The best part about this series is how the ending was handled. I didn't want to see some two-minute aftermath, and I'm overjoyed that they fleshed out the characters' IRL development and world too. The way the IRL Kazuto and Asuna meeting occurred had me shed a tear, and the other characters' appearance and tales in the episode really helped to bring the series full-circle. The return of crossing field and the accompanying montage really helped to seal the deal.

As for rating this series, I've seen only two other series that I've enjoyed on this order of magnitude: Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu S1, and Angel Beats!. Out of the three, Haruhi has just been downgraded to a 9 in the grand scheme of things, because I feel like it wasn't crafted as fantastically as the other two due to its skipping around, remedied by the absolutely fantastic Shoushitsu and the good non-E8 material in S2. AB had the [AB spoilers](/s ""Tenshi clones episode and shadows arc (episodes 8, 11-12)""), that I didn't like at all, besides their push to conclude the series. The other episodes were fantastic. SAO fits that mold, except that ALO is more tolerable than those three episodes (which I usually speed through or skip on rewatches), and the mediocre episodes of SAO far exceed the mediocre episodes of AB. This and AB are solid 10s in my opinion.

I've heard rumours that this anime has been wildly successful, especially in BD-sales. We should be seeing more from this series, yeah? I really want to see more.

I also realized that I spent a ridiculous amount of time and space on this comment and it's likely to be buried. Crap, but whatever.

**tl;dr:** Show was fantastic: SAO excellent, ALO passable. I want to see more. 10/10 would watch again. And again.",0,1356242483,,0,False,1,c7kx1zr,t3_15agbd,t1_c7kx1zr,t3_15agbd,,1430749769,31,False,anime,t5_2qh22,31

True,[deleted],,,"I would love to share this with you as my mother endured a similar situation...

My mother was born in Japan. She was put in an orphanage right from the start. She hated the nuns. They used to beat her and they were mean. She said there would be days when families would come to the orphange to pick out a child. They would all stand in line and hope they would be the one who was picked. My mom was disappointed often. I wish I know when she finally did get adopted, but I don't know and I didn't know enough back then to ask her. But she finally did. She was happy. But then the father and her brothers began to rape her. She was basically the dirt of the family. They made her into a slave basically. She fetched water from a well, and she carried this pole with two buckets on the ends. She did it so often, that her area near her neck (I believe it is called your clavicle. I would google it but it really ins't an important enough part of the story to do so) was permanently disfigured. It dipped in, where it shouldn't have. She said she was often beaten. She had two toys her entire childhood life. One was a doll, and the other a ball. That's it. One time she did something wrong and she was tied naked to the tree in the front yard to shame her in front of all the neighbors and all the people going to the village. This was in Japan, and when according to my mom, she believed there were no such thing as child protection laws. When she was 16, she said she had enough, and she ran away. She ended up in a gang. and as a result of it she ended up in jail. When she went to jail, she said she really liked it. No one was raping her, and no one was beating her. She felt safe. After she was released from jail, she had no way to make money. She became a prostitute. This lasted until she got some STD that was days away from killing her (don't know which one or what it was). After that she worked at a bar. My father was in the navy. and he met her there. She was in love with some other soldier named Danny, but eventually my dad asked her to marry him and she agreed. She just wanted to have a new start, and thought the USA would be it. She was super excited, and she was pregnant with my older brother. She came to America and immediately she was shocked and depressed because she never thought how much our culture was different than hers. She expected everyone to speak Japanese and no one did. She moved in with my grandparents, my dad went back overseas (for two years), and she had my older brother. She did not speak any English at all. She learned how to by watching Sesame Street with my older brother. My grandparents knew she was from Japan and liked fish, so they took her to McDonalds a lot for fish sandwiches. As a side note, my dad took her to a buffet, and she did not know what to do so she started filling the taco shell with the pastas and potatoes and all the wrong things. Anyhow, she barely spoke english now, she was depressed, she hadn't talked to anyone in years (she married my dad not knowing how to speak English, and he spoke no Japanese. I can't fucking believe it, that just hit my for the first time ever. WTF?) Anyway. she became pregnant again with me. She gave birth to me, and a year later my father either bought or renting a place of their own. He went away again (I don't know if he went back overseas or he did whatever, she just told me it was her again) and she was bathing my older brother and I. Suddenly, she saw dark clouds from the corners of her eyes rolling in (prior to having us she did a lot of acid - but after getting pregnant with my older brother she stopped them all forever, until the end when she smoked some marijuana) and she heard a voice, that was very clear and very real tell her to ""drown those kids"". She grabbed us both in her arms, picked us up and ran us to the neighbors house and banged on their door. They opened it, she told them that they had to watch us and she ran away. She ran into the middle of a busy street and tried to kill herself by getting hit by a car. But fortunately, that did not happen. She had a nervous breakdown instead and was hospitalized. I don't know how long, I didn't think to ask back then. Eventually she was released or got out, and she decided she wanted to get a career so she went to cosmetology school. After school, she went out and found work as a beautician (that is what they were called back then). That is where she met her life, long best friend. They worked together until my mom died, many years later. They moved from shop to shop together. They were really good friends. I am jumping ahead though. Going back to when my mom had met Sara, and they became good friends. Us kids started growing up also. One or maybe both of us started telling my mom that we loved her. Finally, one day she confided in Sara that something was wrong with us. She told Sara that we keep telling her we love her. It really bothered my mom. Sara told my mom that this was normal. and we were supposed to tell her that.  To me. I am surprised that this did not come naturally from my mom because I cannot recall a single day in my entire life, from  my earliest memory to the last time I talked to her that she did not tell me she loved me. If I were walking out the door to go to the store or a friend's house, she would holler that she loved me. If I were going to bed, or she was going to sleep she would remind me that she loved me.  What I am going to tell you next is the entire reason for this long story because it is important that you hear her words. She told me that all of the hurt she went through, all of the disappointment and despair she went through as a child and young adult were horrible. But she told me that she would do it all over again if everything were to end up the same, meaning she would have her children and have as much love for them that she did. She said it was all worth it. She meant it.  And we were shit head children too. All three of us got expelled. I got her sued for $300,000. We all went to Juvenile Hall. We fought constantly. She was the sole provider for us. My dad got hurt at work and quit working, then he somehow much this 28 year old lady (he was in his late 40's at the time) and began going to church with her. He became real Christian. He cheated on my mom for this other Christian (it was okay because my mom was not Christian) and she finally kicked him out of the house. My mom did try to become a Christian for my dad prior to kicking him out. She asked him to take her to church with him, but he said only if she would go to the church the lady he was cheating on her with was at. She declined and a few days later she kicked him out. 

I am just going to put an end to this story as I told you my main point. Actually I guess I did this because it let me remember her a bit, and it did something amazing for me. I have an 18 month old now, my mom died more than 15 years ago so she has never met him, or met me as a father. But I have changed. And typing this all out just gave me a whole bunch of ""oh shit"" moments as I realize the struggles she went through that I had no idea of 15+ years ago. Damn mom, you rocked. I hope I do you proud. I love you so much. *edit: And I miss you very much. You are still in me, I love my son more than life itself, and I know that is because you allowed me to love so much. Thank you.

If there's reality to your idea of being happier without reddit, your nervous system has to see it with its own eyes. Just pay attention -- notice how the world feels for you. Do small experiments of renunciation.

Notice (for example) what happens tonight, at 20 PM, when you put your phone in airplane mode, do a small bow towards your WiFi router, and unplug it for one and a half hours. Pay attention to that mental shift as your mind realizes its usual conduit for dopaminergic stimulation and social validation -- has vanished. Notice the somewhat unsettling yet beautifully spacious feeling of ""huh... what now?""

Send out a scout to patrol for the feeling of having to take up some other equivalent stimulation. That feeling is actually pretty lightweight and easy to defend against. It passes quickly. Sit in your favorite armchair. Pace around your apartment. Attune yourself to unfamiliar sensations like ""ease,"" ""patience,"" and ""boredom."" Do some contemplation.

I think the deal with reddit is mostly that the mind is extremely happy to have a single, reliable source of comfort + stimulation. Even if there is a diverse set of other sources of comfort / stimulation, if there's one single source that's always available, it will make a deep warm valley in the landscape of your habits, and you won't want to leave -- even if there's a perfect calm lake just half a mile away, even if beautiful women are waiting for you up in a nearby meadow, even if your horse is ready for any journey.

The valley gets boring. As you've noticed. But it's comfortable and right there. There's really no pressing need to go anywhere else. Except some inkling of desire for something else... Some whiff of another fragrance.

There are stories about people who spend most of their lives in various states of torpor and confusion, but when destiny calls, they find some kind of reservoir of unknown energy and become heroes. This seems related to what old Joseph Campbell called ""following your bliss.""

It's about discovering some kind of motivation that's so deep you wouldn't even call it by a lame, ad-copy, career counselling word like ""motivation."" The religious people call it ""faith,"" or ""doubt,"" which are two sides of a coin -- what's the coin?

We generally joke that no one dies in the OR, we just stabilize them enough to get them to the unit to be pronounced, but it does happen. Worst for me personally, and that surgeon: Cancer doc did a lot of surgeries on folks with pancreatic cancer, called the Whipple procedure. Gave them a few months, etc. One guy didn't tell us that he had been having chest pains for a few days, guess he was afraid we'd cancel surgery (we would have). Part way through the hours-long procedure, he flat lines. Surgeon did compressions for over an hour, wouldn't let anyone else take over, just kept pumping and pumping while anesthesia slammed drug after drug and units of blood. I had just updated the family literally seconds before this happened that everything was going great. It had been. And then he died. We literally had to pull the surgeon off of him. He wiped his streaming tears and went with the anesthesiologist to tell the family.

True,brostep19,,,"Multiple people have gifted me reddit gold, and I've felt guilty every time. I appreciate the gesture, as it shows a level of thanks that goes beyond an upvote. But at the same time, somebody paid money to the reddit business, because of a contribution I donated. It doesn't make sense.

Think about it. You take your time, your energy, your talent, and write something of value, that you freely share with others. That's your donation, which is what gives reddit.com any value at all. But then for appreciation of your donation, somebody else donates in your name, again to reddit.com.

Seems like a scam, and it makes me feel good that somebody is thanking me, but it makes me feel bad they paid money in this way. I've been nervous to look at how much it costs, because I don't want to know. I ignore it, so I can imagine it was only $1 or something. It's not worth all the bad feelings I have, because it doesn't feel fair, and I don't want to be the cause of them spending money, especially when it's just to give to reddit when we're already donating to reddit by posting.

As for the features, it does come in handy, because you can save comments and then find them all in a list. I like to save comments with useful info, so then I can find them again easily. But the problem with that is, once reddit gold runs out, do we still have access to the saved comments? I don't know. I'll save the web page listing them before it runs out just in case.

It also lets you load 1500 comments at a time if you want, which is useful sometimes, but not really because there can be 10s of thousands of comments in these AskReddit threads, and there's still ""continue this thread"" branches you can't see. It seems to get rid of the ""load more comments"" though.

The best is probably how it sometimes highlights new comments when you return to a thread. But it does it in an odd way, where there's a list of times you visited it where you can show new comments since then. Except it's not every time you visit. So if you reload a thread often it doesn't really show you what you haven't seen.

Then there's the /r/lounge, which you can see in [this screenshot](https://i.minus.com/iyDCpFItMWTTs.png), which I've only visited once, to take that screenshot. It's embarrassing really. I don't like how having reddit gold gives a feeling of royalty. I think I'm beyond all that, until I've caught myself thinking about how I have it, in a snobby way. Then I slap myself mentally, because that's so stupid! There's an emblem thing on the profile page, which makes me reddit royalty. This kind of thinking should not be encouraged.

The new ""give gold"" link on the comments makes all this worse because now it's part of the public voting. It's like a super-upvote. It could mean something, but it doesn't. A lot of the comments you see the gold star on are ""only like this long and are just a joke"". How is that worth money? Why does the money go to reddit and not the author of the joke? It just makes the comment stand out as some royal class, like the most popular kids in school. But it's not free.

Which brings me to the question of, what are you supposed to say? I've ignored everyone giving me gold, because I have no idea how to respond. I see people responding in the comments when they get it, with excitement, ""oooh thanks for giving me reddit gold!!! I'm so happy!"". But I'm not very social like that for one thing, so it's uncomfy, and I also didn't really get much, because the money goes to reddit's business, not me. Then I feel guilty they paid money, when they could've used it to eat food, or their children to eat food, or something better than donating it to reddit in my name. Then it puts a burden on me, because am I supposed to show thanks for their thanks?

Honestly, if anyone ever appreciates anything I've done through this website, please just say ""thank you"" or something similar. That to me is priceless and well beyond just an upvote, showing all that reddit gold does, and being a pure gesture that doesn't involve money, reddit's business, or any guilt on my part.

It's like those Facebook gifts I heard about. I've never seen them, but I heard you could buy people little pictures of gifts. They're not real gifts, so how would you feel if someone paid money to give you a picture of a teddy bear? The gesture means something, but wouldn't you have conflicting emotions about it? What are you supposed to do? ""Thanks for my teddy bear! I love it!"" It's just a picture, and reddit gold is mostly just [this picture](http://s3.amazonaws.com/static.reddit.com/award/reddit_gold-40.png).

Now I feel bad someone who bought me reddit gold will read this and feel bad because I feel bad. It feels like reddit did a bad thing, by getting involved in our personal social exchange, and capitalizing off it with tricks. I wish reddit was a new internet protocol, like NNTP, so we didn't have a corporation in between us, mixing in money and all that. I'm here for the people, the community, and that has nothing to do with you reddit. It's us. When we say thanks, it's to the people who provided us with something of value. You didn't do that, all you did was host it. It's like if someone throws a party, and 2 people are attracted and go in a room to kiss, just because you're hosting it doesn't mean you should be involved in that at all. You don't deserve any credit for that, all you did was invite people, and without anyone showing up your party would be meaningless.

People complain on here often about how Facebook intercepts friends and family, to own all your personal data and use it for profit. Well, what do you think reddit is? It's the same thing. It's a for-profit newsgroups, and they're even intercepting our thanks to make money from it. This isn't a pure social community, it's another trick, just like Facebook and the rest. They deserve something for hosting it, but where do we draw the line?

True,CalmSpider,,,"Virginity FAQ
by CalmSpider

I've received many questions about how to remove the virgin debuff or the mechanics of the partnership features. This guide should give a player a very concise path to removing the virginity debuff. Many FAQs have already been written about partnership mechanics, and that's really beyond the scope of this guide. I also did not include item tables, since those are in other FAQs, too.

This guide is copyrighted. Unauthorized reproduction is prohibited. If you see this guide posted outside of gamefaqs.com or reddit.com, please let me know.

First off, if you have a male avatar or prefer the aesthetics of male avatars, go to the house of healing and obtain some condoms. NPCs usually give them to any player that asks. If not, they are sometimes in a jar or treasure chest in the area. Failing all of this, you will have to buy them at a shop. You'll need these for later. 

Level your strength and endurance if they are not already at least to middle-of-the-road levels. Then, make sure you have armor equipped that gives the best charisma bonuses (You have to play around with combinations to get the best set bonuses). VERY IMPORTANT: De-equip any weapons before progressing any further. Approach other players that raise your arousal meter as you get near them (avoid approaching NPCs like shopkeepers and other types of workers for this). Invite them to go on quests with you.

In order for this to work, you usually have to do quests as a pair. The nature, duration, and number of quests will vary based on your stats and the stats of the other player you picked. Usually, players complete three quests that take about four hours each and occur in the evening, but some players skip the quests entirely, while others wait until they have established some kind of formal adventuring partnership before progressing. 

What you want to do next is find a location to which you or your companion control access by other players. Restrict access to just the two of you. Next, both of you should start de-equiping armor one piece at a time. Equip the condom you obtained earlier. Right-click on the other player and select pretty much any option that shows up in the top five. The debuff will be removed shortly thereafter.

I recommend completing the STD screening quest even though you have the virgin debuff and insisting that the other player has done so recently before any armor comes off. 

Other good items to have are lubricant (only water-types, as latex armors are weak against oil attacks), candles, and items that change the background music. In addition, there are a few types of armors and enchantments other than condoms that give bonuses against STD attacks or unwanted spawn events. You'll want to check out the item and spell tables to see the different effects and how to obtain them.",0,1356281262,,0,False,1,c7l24o4,t3_15brwp,t1_c7l24o4,t3_15brwp,,1430752162,95,False,outside,t5_2r3f3,95

True,nixed9,,,"This happens to alot of people... Now I am not a neuroscientist, but I do read a bit of psychology journals. This phenomenon seems like it's related to ADHD/concentration/motivation pathways.

There is a theory gaining traction that the use of modern communication technologies, particularly the internet, has overstimulated our dopamine pathways. Always multitasking has basically shot our dopamine levels to shit. This makes it harder to stay concentrated and motivated, and it trains your brain to always look for that next ""hit"" of novelty/stimulus for more dopamine. 

Just some theory... your mileage may vary.

EXTENSIVE EDIT: Alot of people have been asking for articles on it. [Here's a peer reviewed study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22505818) talking about how internet addiction decreases dopamine transport. [Here's another one.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22253926). [Here's a 2009 article](http://edition.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/10/05/depression.adhd.internet.addiction/index.html) showing a correlation between internet addiction and ADHD. There are many more, just google Internet Addiction and Dopamine. EDIT2: [Here's a link to a Ted Talk about modern day Internet Porn Addiction. This was a real eye-opener for me personally.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSF82AwSDiU)

Dopamine is the brain chemical of MOTIVATION, CONCENTRATION, and DESIRE. The upshot to this is that dopamine is also the chemical of ADDICTION. Our brains love to have it floating around in there. **Well, the way you get the biggest dopamine hits are through discovering novelty**. New (novel) experiences provide a massive rush of dopamine. In today's society *and for the first time in human history,* we have INSTANT visual/auditory novelty available by clicking on an almost endless amount of new hyperlinks. I mean, why bother reading a 20 page essay, or a 300 page novel, when you can just go TL;DR and click the next link? The reason you do that is because of a lack of novelty, and it's because your brain is going ""OMG IT'S BEEN TOO LONG, WE NEED MORE DOPAMINE, GET NOVELTY IMMEDIATELY!""

Consider this: several hundred years ago, what kind of stimuli did our human ancestors have? They were almost all farmers, waking up every day with the sole goal of tending crops and defending themselves. They spent almost all day in the fields and they had sporadic random positive stimuli. But now, we can SIMULTANEOUSLY watch television, play a game, skype with someone, be on reddit, check your mail, do your math homework, etc. Our brains are so used to this that when we're NOT doing it, we feel anxious or bored or foggy. Instead of averaging less than one interesting piece of novelty per day, now almost all of us have 1-3 pieces of dopamine stimulation *running continuously.* I just think that that's probably not a good thing.

And while this may be TMI for some, for those who are curious, I came to this realization slowly and painfully by discovering my own internet porn addiction. A few years back I had some personal problems with the ladies. Particularly, I was suffering erectile dysfunction. I had had sex with many partners before, but the problem was getting worse. As a young male in my 20s that's not normal and I was freaking out. I went to doctors, urologists, psychologists, had my testosterone checked, everything said it was normal.  After reading *a lot* of psychology research, and discovering some websites like [YBOP](http://www.yourbrainonporn.com) and /r/NoFap and after a lot of introspection, I came to learn that this is a major problem that many young men are experiencing. 

And it makes sense: the neuroscience tells us that what regulates arousal and erections is a dopamine-regulated pathway in your brain that tells you to seek out women. Throughout history, that pathway has been probably the single most powerful motivating factor for young men. But now, with high speed internet, it's almost *completely* supplanted by porn. 

Remember those same ancestors I was just talking about? Figure this: how many young, hot, naked women did your great-grandfather see in his lifetime? Maybe what, five? Maybe ten if he was a major pimp? Nowadays the average teenager can have direct visual access to literally HUNDREDS of young vaginas before breakfast. What do you think that's doing to their dopamine levels? There are entire generations of young men now who are growing up on high speed internet who are SO USED TO and SO OVERSTIMULATED BY a 2D image of a pornstar and their left hand, that when it comes to actually getting with a girl, their brains will be like ""this isn't the correct sexual stimulus"" and they won't be able to get it up. I know, because I was one of them. Fortunately this is reversible and I was able to overcome it by doing a noFap for a few months, which was without a doubt the most difficult experience of my entire adult life. But I digress.

It's all about dopamine. When was the last time you went seven full days without internet access? Can you even remember? Do you remember craving it or feeling irritable? That's your dopamine right there. I now believe that ADHD, ADD, Depression, Social Anxiety and all the other factors affecting the majority of the US population are NOT primary diseases in most people; rather they are caused by the behaviors we have come to accept as normal. Overstimulating dopamine is creating a major psychological and social problem. **That's why we can't concentrate on long passages or read books without feeling 'foggy.'**

Look, again, I'm not a neuroscientist, and these are only MY opinions. But to me, they make alot of sense, and they explain alot of things. And I look around, and I see my entire family and most of my friends are unable to break their addictions or recognize the problems; my sisters, mother and father will all watch TV while playing on their iPads and managing different tasks. My best friend is the most videogame addicted person I've ever met and he has ZERO social interaction outside of xbox live and his mp3 player. And for me, I STILL battle internet addiction to this day, and when I'm not being vigilant, I will find myself easily binging and spending 8+ hours per day on reddit, playing games, or peeking at porn.

**TL;DR It is my belief that our brains didn't evolve to use the internet and research is showing that it's disrupting our normal dopamine pathways, and that is the primary cause of the rampant ADHD, Depression, and Social Anxiety we see in modern society.**",0,1356285593,,0,1356304829,1,c7l33le,t3_15btlj,t1_c7l33le,t3_15btlj,,1430752618,285,False,AdviceAnimals,t5_2s7tt,285

True,LovableContrarian,,,"I hope it's not too late and this doesn't get buried. Here's the thing: things like this are on done on purpose, and they aren't necessarily bad. There is basically a trade off between flexibility and job security. In many European nations, job security is very high. What does this mean? Unions. Safety nets. More rules on when employers can fire employees, and when they do, it's more expensive. What does it mean for these countries and their laborers? Several things. First, people do indeed have more job security. In many European countries, it's common for people to hold 2 jobs in their entire career (in the US, the average is more like 13). This also means education is much more focused. Think about Britain, where you pick a career path before high school and essentially graduate college with the skills to do a job. In the US, college is very general, and on the job training is expected. This is because we have low job security in the US, so the value of specific education is lowered (why spend 8 years learning a specific craft when you might get fired next month?). 

But, here's the point. There is a flip-side. The US's low cost of hiring and firing allows for increased flexibility. Let's say that China starts making extremely cheap steel, and western nations can no longer compete with their prices. In the US, firms would fire their steel workers, re-train people in more useful skills, etc. In Britain? Well, the steel union would fight their employers. Employers would find it way too expensive to shift industries. So, in the end, Britain would continue making steel, even though it's a massive inefficiency in their economy. 

So, I submit this: you don't have to agree that it's okay for America to have low job security. But, at least accept that it was an intentional system designed to create flexibility of labor, and it served us damn well and made us a super power. Mostly, though, realize that America isn't bad to laborers just because we are big meanies. The argument has very little to do with labor standards, actually. It has to do with production. 

Source: studied labor and economic development for years. 

Edit: I should mention how this relates to the article in question. Mandatory vacation time is a sweeping labor law. It's an example of employers being forced to follow certain rules, and unions generally push for it. It completely goes against the American labor ideology. Again, you don't have to agree that it's okay. Just know that it is part of a larger movement: labor flexibility and low costs of hiring and firing. 

EDIT 2: I seem to be getting some kickback in regards to my comments on education, and that is fine. I would like to point out that education wasn't the focus of my comment (I was really talking about job security, not education).

However, this is a studied and peer-reviewed aspect of market economies. Specifically, we are comparing coordinated market economies (safety nets, specific education) and liberal market economies (low costs of hiring and firing, general education). Ben Ross Schneider from MIT has done a lot of research in this area. Here is a journal article in which he compares CMEs and LMEs in Latin America:

Inequality in developed countries and Latin America: coordinated, liberal and hierarchical systems - Ben Ross Schneider and David Soskice

http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03085140802560496

(You'll need access to scholarly databases to read the entire article).

Basically, he comes to the same conclusion. In LMEs, there are low safety nets, low job security, and the costs of hiring and firing are very low. As a result, labor is flexible and education is general (compared to CMEs).

True,cass314,,,"But what the rule implies is that there is absolutely no reason to indicate that you are anything other than the ""default"" except to attention whore, so you must in a sense pretend to be the default (in this case, male) in order for your opinion to be legitimate.  It's a stupid justification for enforcing ""no gurlz allowed"" in appearance if not in fact, because any time you notice that someone is female, you can ignore their words and call them out of bounds for not hiding it well enough.  If you're telling a story on reddit about a video game and let a gendered pronoun slip, you'll occasionally get replies like ""OMG I'm a gamer gurl give me karma"" or even comments about making sandwiches, which are usually answered by nothing but upvotes.  It allows people to distract from the fact that women who post in male-heavy forums and who game online are frequently subject to sex-based harassment, because every time that subject comes up there are comments asking why the person revealed their gender as if that makes it their fault, or trying to delegitimize some of the complaints by distinguishing between *real* female gamers and ""gamer girls"".  It's just another way of dodging a real issue.

This attitude reinforces the idea of male as ""normal"" and female as ""other"".  It gives sexist assholes a borderline socially acceptable out for delegitimizing the opinions of women.  It implies that the only reason to acknowledge diversity is to profit from it personally, and so you must conform in order for your opinion to be considered.  It implies that the only way women win arguments, make friends, or secure help when they need it in the real world is by using sex as a weapon or a tool--that is, that without the specter of sex, they are dumb and useless, so if you strip them of their gender identity, they are put back in their correct place.  It's not really all that different from saying ""I'm fine with people who are gay, as long as they don't *act* gay and make a big deal out of it""--what you're fine with is not gay people; it's the presumption that they're straight which allows you to pretend they're not there.

It's not saying ""everyone is judged by their merits"".  If it was, it would say ""there is no gender on the internet"" and would encourage us consider opinions on their logic and basis in fact instead of based on what pronouns the person writing them used.  ""There are no girls on the internet"" is a cheap way of wrapping sexism in the appearance of fairness.  It whitewashes the presence of women in the conversation and enforces the idea as male as the norm and female as other and marginalized, but ties it up in a pretty bow to keep people from objecting.",0,1356287966,,0,False,1,c7l3p5x,t3_15burb,t1_c7l3p5x,t1_c7l33bf,,1430752975,436,False,funny,t5_2qh33,436
True,fellowtraveler,,,"**Here is the answer you seek...**

Regarding Bitcoins and gold, it's important to keep in mind that neither has ""intrinsic"" value.

Rather, both are valued by men for their unique properties.

Gold is:

* Divisible.
* Fungible.
* Value dense.
* Recognizable.
* Durable.
* Zero counter-party risk.
* Stable in supply, yet minable.
* Liquid.
* International.
* Non-manipulatable. (Non-centralized.)


By comparison:

* Diamonds, while valuable, are NOT divisible, nor are they fungible.
* Water, while valuable and divisible, is not value-dense enough to compete with gold as a form of money, on the free market.
* Food, while valuable, is not durable.
* Dollars, while liquid, do not represent zero-counter-party-risk (rather, they are debt-based.)
* Dollars, while recognizable, are not stable in supply (inflation is a worry).
* Dollars are also not minable. (Production is available only to a monopoly cartel, versus gold, which anyone can produce.)
* Food, which anyone can produce, is not liquid, especially in comparison to dollars or gold.
* Dollars, while you can hold them in your pocket, a board of bankers still has the power to reach into your pocket and manipulate its value. (This is not the case with gold.)


Soon it becomes very clear that gold was never ""declared"" to be a form of money by any ""authorities"" but rather, became money due to natural market forces.

If gold became money strictly due to natural market forces (as a result of its unique properties) then clearly the only reason it has been supplanted by dollars is due to artificial restraints imposed on the market by government force. (Such as legal tender ""laws"", tax ""laws"", money laundering ""laws"", etc.)

Such forces must be constantly active, otherwise, natural market forces would immediately resolve back to gold again as they have for thousands of years.


**Now let's consider Bitcoin's unique properties:**

* Divisible.
* Fungible.
* Value dense.
* Recognizable.
* Durable.
* Zero counter-party risk.
* Stable in supply, yet minable.
* Liquid.
* International.
* Non-manipulatable. (Non-centralized.)

AS WELL AS:

* Non-confiscatable.
* Accounts cannot be frozen.
* Anonymity is possible.
* Electronically transferrable.

As you can see, Bitcoin's unique properties are similar to those of gold, although it adds new properties due to its ethereal nature.

Those new properties (non-confiscatable, non-freezable, pseudonymous, transferrable electronically) all serve to route-around the artificial forces that are currently being used to supplant gold with the dollar. After all, the various immoral, legal-tender legislation in place today uses the force of a gun to impose fiat money onto an economy that would otherwise resolve to gold by natural forces. That artificial force depends on the government's collusion with banks and their collective monopoly on the ability to issue, store, freeze, confiscate, track, and transfer dollars.

There's no real benefit to full tower cases (aside from watercooling potential) seeing as you can still easily have dual GPU setups in a mid tower. I personally favored the more understated look of the Arc Midi but both brands make excellent cases.

I think both motherboards are very solid. I'd just go with whichever one is cheaper at the time of purchase.

I'm a little unsure how to help you with the GPU question as I'm not familiar with prices in the Netherlands. You said that the Twin Frozr was £220 with postage, so assuming that's competitive in pricing with other HD 7950s it's a great buy. MSI are reputable and their Twin Frozr is an excellent design. Other cards that compare would be Asus's DirectCU II, Gigabyte's Windforce and Sapphire's Vapour-X, so it might be worth checking if any of those are much cheaper. 

I wouldn't pay much more for an HD 7970 as they're only fractionally faster and the MSI card should overclock quite well using MSI's afterburner utility (I OC'ed by 20% easily on my card).

When you sink a red ball, you get one point, and you then get to try to sink one of the other colour balls. The balls range from the yellow (2 points) to the black (7 points) - so obviously you want to sink the black more so than any of the other colours. When you sink a colour ball, it gets put back on to its spot. Then you get to go for another red, then another colour, and so on.

Once all the red balls have been sunk, you then have to sink the remaining balls from yellow up to black, in the right order (and then they stay sunk, they aren't put back on the table).

So the tricky thing in snooker is to make sure that each shot ends up with a good position for the next shot. So in this video, the player is putting on an absolute clinic; at 1:22 for example, there's no red balls free from the pack so not only does he have to sink the black ball, he has to make sure the cue ball breaks up the pack of red balls so he has a chance of sinking one for his next shot.

True,MarioAntoinette,,,"&gt;The U.S.-Centrism on Reddit is incredibly problematic...

SRS is one of the most american-centric subs on the whole damn board. Pretty much every thread in the entire fempire has someone talking about US issues as if they are universal. Their entire culture is based on pushing the social mores of a small number of privileged Americans onto a global site. They constantly assume that anyone who doesn't go out of their way to declare their identity is a white American male teenager, etc.


EDIT: let's take a look at the first comment on that thread...

&gt;Black person here.

&gt;As I think you can figure, this rubs me the wrong way:

&gt;&gt;    It means benefitting from slave labour

&gt;I'm not sure why exactly, but yeah I acknowledge I am a Westerner.

So, *immediately after being reminded that the world outside America exists* we have an SRSer making a statement which pretty much relies on total lack of global perspective to hold together. 'Black people' are all apparently decended from slaves and slavery of other ethnic groups doesn't exist? Someone who supposedly sees themselves as some kind of social progressive doesn't care about labour rights in the developing world?

Now, they do go on to say some things which show a little bit of insight before getting mired down in backbiting and language-policing, but we all know that the only thing likely to come of this is that they will come up with some silly euphemism for 'American' and carry on ignoring their massive cultual bias.",0,1356317890,,0,1356318723,1,c7law12,t3_15cq16,t1_c7law12,t3_15cq16,,1430756422,32,False,SRSsucks,t5_2uuwv,32

The Wonderful Wizard of Oz wasn't a standalone book, it was large collection taking place in the [Land of Oz and surrounding territories](http://i.imgur.com/O7O8x.jpg). Firearms did indeed exist in this universe. 

For example, in the Tik-Tok of Oz, the Oogaboo army shoots down a Rak. (Oogaboo being located in Oz's Eastern Winkie Country). In fact, guns and bullets actually grow on trees in Oogaboo, and have to be picked while perfectly ripe. 

Edit: Quotes from the Tik-Tok of Oz.


Gun Trees:
&gt;Ann was much pleased with Private Files. He seemed indeed to be such a warrior as she needed in her enterprise, and her hopes of success took a sudden bound when Files told her he knew where a gun-tree grew and would go there at once and pick the ripest and biggest musket the tree bore.


Shooting down the Rak (with bullets from a bullet-tree)
&gt;""The Rak!"" shouted Private Files, and with a howl of despair the sixteen officers fell to the ground, writhing and moaning in anguish. Queen Ann sat down upon a rock and faced the cloud more bravely, although her heart was beating fast. As for Files, he calmly loaded his gun and stood ready to fight the foe, as a soldier should.

&gt;They were now in absolute darkness, for the cloud which covered the sky and the setting sun was black as ink. Then through the gloom appeared two round, glowing balls of red, and Files at once decided these must be the monster's eyes.

&gt;He raised his gun, took aim and fired.

&gt;There were several bullets in the gun, all gathered from an excellent bullet-tree in Oogaboo, and they were big and hard. They flew toward the monster and struck it, and with a wild, weird cry the Rak came fluttering down and its huge body fell plump upon the forms of the sixteen officers, who thereupon screamed louder than before.

&gt;""Badness me!"" moaned the Rak. ""See what you've done with that dangerous gun of yours!""

&gt;""I can't see,"" replied Files, ""for the cloud formed by your breath darkens my sight!""

&gt;""Don't tell me it was an accident,"" continued the Rak, reproachfully, as it still flapped its wings in a helpless manner.

True,joy_indescribable,,,"That's just it though, *we don't understand the physical phenomena of how the brain works*. We get the general principle; impulses go in, impulses go out (you can't explain that!), but the specifics of how neurons interact, how the different systems link together and *especially* how the whole mess creates the emergent phenomena of a person is still beyond us. Now, the logical response to this is ""build some fuckhuge scanning thing and take it apart piece by piece"", but that's still mostly beyond our abilities too. On top of that, doing that to a live human brain is (morally/legally) impossible because it would almost definitely kill, or traumatize beyond all reason, the person in the brain we're doing it to. Doing it to a dead human brain is what we've *been* doing, with the technology we currently have at our disposal. Unfortunately, a dead brain, especially one that isn't *very* freshly dead, is vastly different than a live brain.

To put this all into a metaphor: 

The human brain is a trans-sonic plane, and the doctors studying it are engineers from 1900. They understand the the visible effects: push (a lot of random) button(s and weird glow-y panels that fill with changing words and may or may not be the result of the devil), receive thrust, and on some planes that are broken they've managed to tear off an engine and fiddle around inside it, but the avionics equipment, what with using semi-conductors and microprocessors, is basically black-box witchcraft to them, and the engines themselves are pretty much nonsense. 

They recognize the basic idea of how the engines work; combustion of a hydrocarbon compound that isn't totally alien to them and is orders of magnitude more pure than anything they have outside of labs, much less in the quantities they need to run it for an extended period. The actual principles of the jet engine (compression from forced intake, fuel-air ratios, carefully tuned gear ratios and intelligent onboard systems in the engine itself to detect failures, damage and atmospheric conditions) are totally beyond them, and every engine they dismount to try to figure out stops working after two, maybe three, ignition runs since they're fueling it with total crap and have nothing hooked up to the diagnostic outputs and control inputs. Even the fucking landing gear is lightyears ahead of them; tires of vulcanized rubber, shocks based on pneumatic and hydraulic systems created through complex computer models to handle, y'know, a whole goddamn fucking plane bouncing off them. Even the goddamn *metal itself that the plane is made of* is alien to them, partly because [aluminum was worth more than gold until some time in the late 1800's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium#History), and partly because the metallurgical techniques we use to create aircraft alloys, especially for trans-sonic planes, are utterly impossible given their level of technology.

So, to tie it all together: While the plane is in a running state, the engineers can't (from their perspective, with their tools and methods of figuring out how things work) touch a single damn thing that matters without everything breaking and flashing red. When the plane is disassembled and/or broken, they can't get *anything* working again and as far as they're concerned every single fundamental principle behind what we know to be how the plane operates is *totally fucking impossible* (remember that they hadn't even discovered heavier-than-air flight at this point. The wright brothers are still a ways off). Given a few decades or so, they'll eventually come to understand the principles behind some of the macro mechanical systems, and maybe even manage to mix up some fuel that will actually get the engine to do more than fail/explode, and at best even get an early start on powered flight in general. But actually replicating the plane itself is easily a generation or more out of their reach.

So, what does this mean for us and the brain? Basically, we're still a paradigm shift or two away from *really* understanding how the fuck the brain actually works. Unfortunately, until we understand how the brain actually works, we won't be able to replicate it without some *disgustingly* powerful hardware to emulate it at a near-molecular level. 

To understand this, look at modern videogame emulator technology: it takes about a generation or two of hardware advancements to truly emulate previous consoles. Right now we're right at the level where we can just about comfortably emulate the N64. For the unfamiliar, many generations of emulators have bee built around literally disassembling the CPU of the system in question to figure out how it works on a hardware level and them emulating *that* in software. This is why many emulators, even though the emulated systems are fucking calculators by modern standards, have the tendency to lag like a motherfucker.

In conclusion: **Can we emulate a brain without understanding how it actually works?** Yes, but this will require a hardware-level emulation, which requires **fucktons** more horsepower than a software-level emulation. **So rest assured, one way or another we WILL emulate a human brain in a computer. It's just a matter of which comes first: True understanding of a human brain** (which will allow software-level emulation, and thus require much less computational resources)**, or the computational power required to emulate a few metric fucks of neurons at a molecular level.** To radically over-simplify things, both the level of understanding required to emulate a brain in software and the flops required to emulate a brain in hardware are at the same point on the horizon. Personally, I think one or the other (or if we're lucky, both) will happen in the lifetime of the millenial generation. **What I think is frequently glossed-over is that yes, we're about to hit the point where computers have equivalent processing power to what we believe the human brain to have, but that computational power WILL NOT let us emulate the brain at a hardware level** (see the videogame hardware emulation example, and if you're so-inclined, check it out further, as the techniques used to do figure out and emulate old consoles are *really* cool)**, only a software level, which is useless without actually understanding how the brain works.**

**tl;dr** Human-brain-equivalent flops of computational power only allow for software-level emulation of the human brain, which is useless without understanding how the brain truly fundamentally works. Hardware-level emulation will require orders of magnitude more computational power, so in my *incredibly* oversimplified opinion, both hardware and software emulation of the brain are about a generation away, rather than some time in the 2020's, and this is factoring in exponential growth of technology and science.",0,1356340246,,0,False,1,c7lffct,t3_15cvhs,t1_c7lffct,t1_c7lejr0,,1430758560,2142,False,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2142
True,flibbertygiblet,,,"**Wrong!** 

The Wizard of Oz is my all time favorite movie and I know an embarrassing amount of trivia about it. 

He has the gun because of The Jitterbug. 

There was a scene, including a song and dance number, about a bug that was sent by the witch to kill them in the Haunted Woods. Matter of fact, in the scene right before the Haunted Woods, she says she's, ""gonna send a little insect to scare them"". 

They find out about it and arm themselves. Scarecrow with a gun, Tin Man with a bug sprayer, and Lion with a net. The whole jitterbug thing was cut out of the movie, all that's left is the witch mentioning it, and our favorite characters inexplicably armed for bug warfare.

True,IAmTheWalkingDead,,,"How would one respond to the argument that media/entertainment plays a role in these tragedies because people have ""become desensitized to violence through a steady diet of violent movies, games, music lyrics, etc.?""

Because if we make violent video games because we're violent as a society or people, then we consume violent media that desensitizes us to violence, then doesn't the cycle just continue and possibly get worse to a certain degree?

Because part of me buys the idea that someone can become desensitized to violence to various degrees with everyone falling somewhere different on the spectrum (you could take that to the extreme of repeated exposure for brain washing someone for violent, nonviolent, religious, political, sexual, etc. purposes), but to me there is a missing link of how that plays a role in our society repeatedly having these types of mass tragedies.

If these people perpetrating these mass tragedies are already mentally unhinged, maybe one of them might play Call of Duty and think ""Yeah, its time to go blow some heads off"" or he might watch Hobo With A Shotgun and decide ""Yeah, these motherfuckers and their shotguns have it right"" or he just might have a fight with his mother or be teased by a classmate once too often and decide ""Yeah, its time to blow these people away"" and that's the trigger that sends them over the edge so to speak, possibly regardless of what they've consumed.

But on the other hand, it also seems extreme violence could be a learned thing to a certain degree. People who are beat or mistreated by their parents often turn around and bully other kids at school. People who are sexually molested as children many times become abusers themselves. Could people whose minds have broke down consume violent media and turn around and decide that's the course of action they should take?

Are there any widely accepted studies about the role violent media and how consumption of it to varying degrees affects our responses to ""real life"" situations? Have they ever been found to be the trigger for perpetrators of mass tragedies? Have they been found to increase an unbalanced person's ""appetite"" to do harm in severe ways?

I guess I'm just curious what science has shown us so far so that I may be able to contribute to a meaningful discussion about this topic. A lot of the discussion seems to just be boiled down to things like ""If its the person and not the gun that kills people, then its the person and not the video game"" etc etc etc. I hope violent media can't change people but it very well might - regardless I don't want to have my pre-conceived conclusion then fill in convenient study just to support that. I'd rather see all of what's other there and come to a conclusion about what those studies actually say.

Does any of that make sense or have I just rambled on endlessly?

~~Live Video of fire: http://www.13wham.com/content/mediacenter/live/default.aspx~~ (Feed Gone)

**Update 1**: two firefighters dead, two wounded.

**Update 2**: both wounded firefighters are in guarded condition at Strong hospital in Rochester. No active shooters. Fire spread to surrounding houses. 

**Update 3**: At least four houses destroyed by the fire as crews were not able to safely put out the flames. 

**Update 4**: Allegedly, neighbors heard shots before the fire started. A knowledgeable source of mine said that they heard the swat team take down the shooter earlier over the scanner, but that's unconfirmed.

**Update 5**: firefighters are back on scene, currently putting out the fires. Roads still blocked by police forces and swat teams.

**Update 6**: Woman reported erratic and suspicious driver going 90+ down the street early around 5:30am before fire started.

**Update 7**: ""Webster"" #4 trending topic on Twitter. Press conference to be held soon. 

**Update 8**: Webster Police Chief conference, 5:30 am- call for car/house fire on 191 Lake Rd. Upon arrival of 1 firetruck, all 4 firefighters were shot on arrival by shooter. 1 was able to flee the scene, other 3 pinned down on location. SWAT teams were able to 2 firefighters died on scene, 2 are being treated at local hospitals. SWAT teams eliminated threat at the scene, ""believed to be deceased."" Only 1 shooter, and he is deceased by gunshot would- don't know if self-inflicted. Police Chief, Maggie Brooks visibly shaken (along with most reporters/anchors at that).

**Update 9**: Police have confirmed that this was set up *as a trap* for first responders. Sick.

**Update 10**: More details will be released at 2pm at a Webster Police Conference. [FB Page set up for Fire dept.](http://www.facebook.com/WebsterFirefighters)

**Update 11**: 2pm News Conference updates: 

* 
Fire has been culled under control, 7 houses totally destroyed. Have not gotten into homes to search for additional victims yet. 


* 
Red Cross has asked that you call 241-4472 for emergency housing/mental health needs/any aid needed. 


* 
Scardino is listed as guarded condition, Hofsetter is in stable condition. Ritter was released and is at home.


* 
Shooter is deceased due to self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head at approx. 11am, has ""quite a lengthy criminal history"" and served a lot of jail time in the past (killed his grandmother in 1980- [here is the D&amp;C news article from the 1980 incident (warning: shooter's name shown)](http://www.democratandchronicle.com/assets/pdf/A21985601224.PDF) ). Still appears that it was a trap for first responders, was shooting from barricaded area/position of cover next to house the shooter had set up to shoot first responders. 

* 
**Weapons** unspecified ""Rifle,"" among other guns, was used on first responders. Weapons obtained illegally since shooter was convicted felon, although many weapon larcenies in the area may be the source according to Webster Police Chief. ""at least a long gun and a hand gun."" according to police.

* 
""Outpouring of support"" from community, Red Cross, Wegmans, and many across the country for victims, families and first responders.


* 
Lt. Gov Bob Duffy: ""Never in my career.. have I seen anything like this."" ""Unthinkable, unspeakable."" ""Governors position will not be a secret"" on gun control after this.


* 
Shooter's sister is still unaccounted for. Nobody else unaccounted for to Police Chief's knowledge so far.


* 
Lt. Gov Bob Duffy: ""look at the lives of these 4 public servants.. that reinforces my belief in humanity"" in response to a question on how we can keep our belief in humanity after this and Newtown shootings.


**Update 12**: Interesting development with **the Motive** of the shooter- When the shooter's mother died this past October, ""She directed donations be made to West Webster Fireman's Association."" [Here is her obituary from Oct 7, 2012 Warning: Shooters name shown)](http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/democratandchronicle/obituary.aspx?page=lifestory&amp;pid=160322241#fbLoggedOut)

**Update 13**: Area is still considered an active crime scene. Fire investigators will need 12-24 more hours, residents are not likely to be back their homes until tomorrow. Power is still cut to around 80 homes and businesses.

**Update 14**: In yet another tragic twist, deceased officer Lt. Mike Chiapperini has a son Nick Chiapperini, also in the Webster Fire Dept. training to be a fireman. His good friend with whom he graduated high school was Tomasz, the other deceased volunteer firefighter in the incident.

**Update 15**: Vigil at 530pm at the West Webster Fire Station, 1051 Gravel Rd, Webster NY. Another Vigil will be held at 7pm at the Four Corners of Webster. Fire investigators have started the search for additional victims in the debris, most notably looking for shooters unaccounted sister.


**Update 16** (Dec 25, 2012) Human remains have been found in the shooter's house, the original starting point of the the fire. It is believed to be the sister of the shooter.


**Fire Damage**



33 residents removed by armored personnel carrier.

7 homes destroyed, 1 sustained some damage.

Nobody has been able to get inside of houses to check for additional bodies/evidence as of 3:00pm

As of 4:50 pm, the search has begun through the houses for evidence and additional victims.

**Victims**

'Twas the night before Christmas,  
And all through this site,  
Nothing was stirring,  
Though minds were alight,  
With the dreams of the joys,  
That tomorrow would bring;  
The brightly wrapped presents,  
All tied up with string.

*And the girls of gonewild,*  
*With their ribbons and bows,*  
*Forwent taking photos,*  
*Up-close, with dildos.*  
*They left off their pictures,*  
*Of '[m]ale/[f]emale blow';*  
*They hung up their stockings,*  
*And thought of the snow.*

And the Atheists looked,  
On their Facebooks with glee,  
For comments of faith,  
And God-gaiety.  
And when they saw '*Christ*-mas;  
Not 'Xmas' at all!'  
They each sighed content,  
For they heard Reddit's call.

*And the gamers of Reddit,*  
*Each with their PC's,*

True,geirrseach,,,"A limited study carried out on nine men provided this ""Cold exposures (D) increased the TPR. Cold did not increase the cardiac oxygen demand but increased the stroke work. The alternation of heat and cold (A) or cool (B) presented the most intensive strain on the heart."" 


Basically, alternating heat and cold increases the blood pressure in the center of the body as the blood vessels on the periphery constrict, additionally, it increases the ""stroke work"" of the heart. Your central blood pressure shoots up and your heart has to work harder. 
BUT

from a companion study ""The tendency toward enhanced ACTH and cortisol secretion and sympathetic activity shown by increased catecholamine secretion suggest that the winter swimming practice may raise the pain threshold and develop a potential for improved cold tolerance, possibly by nonshivering thermogenesis."" 

The practice of alternating sauna with cold also makes you more tolerant to both cold and pain, tuning your endocrine system to adapt to these rapid changes. The author's speculation about ""nonshivering thermogenesis"" means that your body may be able to heat itself more efficiently in the face of sudden cold. 

One other study had this to say: 

""Sudden cooling, for example diving in cold water, causes a severe transitory volume load and pressure load to the heart and increases the possibility of cardiac arrhythmias. The risk of cardiovascular complications in correctly practiced sauna bathing is very small and it is confined to subjects predisposed to the risk because of manifest or latent cardiovascular abnormalities""

I'm a deaf 17 year old Chelsea fan from Norway who has been struggling with depression for a while. 
A few months ago (September 2012 to be exact), I travelled across the North Sea to watch my beloved Chelsea play live. I had contacted the club before travelling to hear if it was possible to meet up anywhere after the game to get some autographs if possible. The answer I got back was that I could meet up at the East Stand Reception where the team bus would be located. So the game went on, and after the game I went there. Stood there for a hour, freezing in my shirt. Started losing hope, and almost started walking away before Lampard showed up. Unfortunately I got shoved back and got no autograph.  

Fast forward November 2012 - JT gets an Instagram and I try to contact him on there. He sees my message and replies back, telling me to send my shirt to him. I did so, and a few weeks later I get my shirt back AND matchworn boots (which was a huge surprise for me). Best gift ever.

True,subtextual,130lbs,,"It's not muscle gain. Even if it were her first time training and your diet and routine were perfect, a female can expect to gain *maybe* [one pound of muscle per month](http://www.aworkoutroutine.com/how-much-muscle-can-you-gain/). And generally people do not gain *any* muscle at all if they are on a caloric deficit, unless they are consuming a ton of protein and cycling their calories extremely carefully, because your body has to make the muscle out of something. The point of weight training while losing weight is to *keep* the muscle you currently have, not to gain muscle. 

The real culprit when people seem to stall or gain weight when they start training is [water weight](http://www.livestrong.com/article/277259-strength-training-cause-water-retention/). Your muscles hold on to water while they repair themselves, and this sudden retention of water when you first start a more intensive exercise routine is what causes that jump on the scale. It usually stabilizes after a few weeks, and then you should start seeing the numbers on the scale creep back downwards.

True,ingolemo,,,"How to name things better:

You should think carefully about what kinds of data are being passed around and what the names of things imply about it. You use the name `winning_ticket` to hold a list of the winning numbers, which is not a ticket at all. You have a function called `validator` that doesn't validate anything as it has no error checking, rather, it takes a list of tickets and returns how many wins each ticket contains. `prize_calc` can't be calculating anything since it has no return value, instead it prints the monetary value of each of the winning tickets.

In order to make best use of duck-typing it's often not a good idea to include type information directly in your variable names. That means that you shouldn't use prefixes such `list_of_` in case you later move to some more advanced data-structure.

Generally it's a good idea to use verbs for the names of functions to indicate that processing is going on. The first word of a function or method should be a verb. If necessary, an object name can be included to help clarify what's being done. For example; `append`, `print`. One exception to this are functions that act as constructors for some type such as `str` and `dict`.

Also notice that at the end of your script you're aliasing your functions by using the same variable names for the result of each function (e.g. the result of `list_of_tickets()` goes into `list_of_tickets` which overwrites the function). Such aliasing is usually a bad idea.

Here's how I might name all the things:

    list_of_tickets() =&gt; get_tickets()
    list_of_tickets =&gt; tickets
    number_ticket() =&gt; get_single_ticket()
    winning_input() =&gt; get_winning_numbers()
    winning_ticket =&gt; winning_numbers
    power_play() =&gt; get_power_play()
    power_play =&gt; is_power_play
    validator() =&gt; calculate_wins()
    prize_calc() =&gt; print_prizes()

I have one point that is not about naming: You should be vary careful about mixing different types of data together into the same structure. This doesn't matter too much in this code since you're not doing much complicated with it, but as code grows more complicated, keeping data clean becomes much more important. You do this in two places in your code;

The first is in your ticket list which stores the powerball in the same list as the rest of the numbers even though you need to treat the powerball differently to the rest of the numbers (your `validate` function has to chop the end off of the ticket list three times). I would store your ticket as a tuple which contains a set of the regular numbers and a number representing the powerball; `(set(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), 7)`

Secondly, your `validator` function crams both the number of winners and whether the powerball wins into a single string when it would be better if it just returned a tuple `(win_count, powerball)`. You can still use the dictionary trick to match winners onto prizes, but this way you can still treat the data inside as numbers and booleans later on if you needed to.",0,1356377878,,0,False,1,c7lldzk,t3_15c5v3,t1_c7lldzk,t3_15c5v3,,1430761437,5,False,learnpython,t5_2r8ot,5
True,juchesack,,,"Best comment in thread! I play 1/2 as well and though I'm just 22 and younger than most the players I like to keep a nice friendly banter atmosphere especially when there's poor players at the table, number one you can say things like ""ah come have a look at the flop with me"" when their on the BB and you have a monster and sometimes they will then bet flop if they check and say something like ""ah I just bet to let you know where you were in the hand"" taking the conversation away from poker is always good and onto sports etc. Get a guy talking about the form of his favourite team and he gets so caught up in the conversation he literally does not pay attention to the game,


 also complement bad beats against you! a guy rivers a gutshot against your flopped top two?don't cry and call him a moron laugh and say ""get a lottery ticket on your way home pal nice hand!"" some players will criticize the guy who called with the gut shot and just say ""hey sometimes you gotta make those calls when your on a good run and a feeling the hand is going to be lucky"" that way the guy who makes the terrible call gets justified to keep making terrible calls and you reinforce the gambler fallacy that tonight's his night. Overall with that strategy you get a good end result of being a really liked and friendly player who creates good atmosphere for beginners to feel comfortable and hell once you keep your own discipline you make a few more bucks cos the game got softer. 


I love listening to music and not talking playing online but in a casino its to your disadvantage to sit in serious silence, the weak players will mark you more and feel ""this guys a serious semi pro player I really want to play good against him"" instead of ""I love the guys at this casino theres always some good laughs and conversation and even if I dont win its a great way to spend a night to winddown and enjoy myself"" see a lot of the weak players dont want to be big poker pros they just want to have a good time and make a few cashes now and then so they can buy a round of drinks when they hit the bars at the weekend and if someones there deep down for entertainment though they claim there a handy player just join in on the buzz it makes a great profit night an excellent night if you had fun with the other players and even if you lose you hopefully enjoyed yourself somewhat more than you would have if you just got cleaned out at 6am by some one hitting a gutshot.

True,Dreamamine,,,"Sorry for the delay! I was on a long Greyhound trip home. Anyway, as much as I know precise measurements and ratios are important for great recipes, I don't really consider myself up to that caliber so most of the time I just eyeball it or wing it when I'm trying new stuff. I'll try my best to be as detailed about what I did as possible:

&gt;**Tomatoes &amp; Cheese**
&gt;
* 10 campari tomatoes
* 4 slices of Dubliner cheese
* Chèvre cheese

&gt;Cut 8 of the tomatoes in halves, and the remaining 2 in quarters.

&gt;Arrange 6 halves counterclockwise (or clockwise if you're feeling rebellious) in a bowl.

&gt;Take another 4 halves and lay them atop the center of the circle, forming an ""X"".

&gt;Spread chèvre inside of the ""X"" and around the perimeter of the bowl in the same direction you arranged the tomatoes.

&gt;Take 4 of the quarter slices and arrange between the spaces of the ""X"" above the cheese, then take another quarter slice and place within the center.

&gt;Lay the 4 slices of Dubliner cheese around the tomatoes between where you spread the chèvre cheese, tilting slightly to follow the spin of the dish.
  
** **

&gt;**Fried ham and cheese balls**
&gt;
* Leftover deli meat (I used mostly ham and some turkey)
* Shredded cheese (Mexican four cheese blend, cheddar jack)
* (light) mayonnaise
* (spicy brown) mustard
* 2 eggs
* mixture: 2/3 flour, 1/3 corn starch
* bread
* [roasted red pepper hummus] (http://cavafoods.com/products/roasted-red-pepper-hummus) (optional)

&gt; Cut up deli meat into very small bits, and mix in a bowl with shredded cheese.

&gt; Add mayonnaise and mustard to the bowl and mix with hands. I used much more mayonnaise than mustard, but you can do it to taste. The main purpose here is to be able to mold the meat and cheese into balls.

&gt; Tightly press the meat-cheese-mayo-mustard into balls or whatever shape you wish to fry. Set aside for now.

&gt; For the bread crumbs, take a few slices of bread and microwave them for 2 minutes. Then blend them in a blender on a high setting. Pour out into a bowl or dish for breading later.

&gt; Beat two eggs in a bowl, and stir in some of the flour and corn starch mixture so that it is thicker. You can also add salt, pepper, or other seasonings here or in the bread crumbs to taste.

&gt; Oil and heat up a pan on a medium-high heat.

&gt; Take each ball, dip in the egg batter until the surface is fully covered, then roll in the breadcrumbs until the surface is again fully covered.

&gt; Fry each breaded ball in the pan. I used tongs to pick up each ball and control the frying in the pan, and be able to see to it that every side becomes nice and brown to my liking.

&gt; When each ball is done, take out and place on a paper towel-ed plate.

&gt; Here is where I decided to take some of the hummus we had left and spread on top of each ball like a hat. Then I sprinkled some Parmesan and oregano for more flavor. This is all optional and very open to experimentation.

** **

&gt;**Peppers &amp; Onions**
&gt;
* Red peppers
* Green peppers
* Onions
* Beef broth

&gt; There isn't really much to say here. I just diced up the peppers and onions, oiled a pan, and cooked for a while before adding in some beef broth and further simmering until enough of the broth had evaporated. I'd say this was probably the most underwhelming of the dishes, but I had to do *something* with the vegetables.

** **

&gt;**Creamy potatoes au gratin**
&gt;
* 4 potatoes, sliced into 1/4 inch slices
* 1 onion, sliced into rings
* 3 tablespoons butter
* 3 tablespoons flour
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 2 cups milk
* 2 cups shredded cheese
* salt, pepper, parsley, garlic powder to taste

&gt; I actually just got the recipe from [allrecipes.com] (http://allrecipes.com/recipe/creamy-au-gratin-potatoes/), but decided to add some more cheese and then season with some parsley and garlic powder.

&gt;Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Butter a 1 quart casserole dish.

&gt;Layer 1/2 of the potatoes into bottom of the prepared casserole dish. Season with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Top with the onion slices, and add the remaining potatoes, and again season to taste.

&gt;In a medium-size saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Mix in the flour and salt, and stir constantly with a whisk for one minute. Stir in milk. Cook until mixture has thickened. Stir in cheese all at once, and continue stirring until melted, about 30 to 60 seconds. Pour cheese over the potatoes, and cover the dish with aluminum foil.

&gt;Bake 1 1/2 hours in the preheated oven.

&gt;Season with parsley, salt, and pepper after taking the potatoes out of the oven.

** **

&gt;**Toasted coconut candied sweet potatoes**
&gt;
* 2 sweet potatoes
* brown sugar
* coconut flakes
* 1/4 cup butter

&gt; Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

&gt; Cut up sweet potatoes into small chunks, and arrange in a small casserole dish.

&gt; Distribute butter around the sweet potatoes, and add some brown sugar on top.

&gt; Bake for 40 minutes.

&gt; Take out from the oven and mash up the sweet potatoes a bit.

&gt; Lay a layer of coconut flakes on top of the sweet potatoes, then continue baking for another 10 minutes or until flakes are reasonably browned.

True,MooseyGramayre,,,"Hijacking the top comment (sorry) to try and dispel the enormous amount of confusion about autism in this thread. I never realized how little people knew of the disorder, but as a younger brother to someone with moderate Autism and severe Williams Syndrome, a seven year volunteer at a summer camp for Autistic kids, and a respite care worker for the disabled, I feel like there's a few things I need to address. 

First off, the way they are speaking to Trevor is not degrading or looking down on him. There are many different ways Autism has impacted people, but a lot of moderately to severely Autistic people on the spectrum can be generalized as adults that will never grow up. They are speaking to Trevor more like a child because 1.) They are trying to raise the excitement that ""Santa"" came to visit him and 2.) Because he probably responds positively to it.

Many Autistic people don't pick up on social situations, so sometimes you have exaggerate your speech and mannerisms to relate to them. 

Second, a lot of people seem to think that he doesn't care that Santa is visiting him, and is more excited about the presents. Anyone who has spent time with someone Autistic knows that they can have a hard time showing excitement and can collapse within theirselves in high tension social situations. 

I can't speak for Trevor, but if it were my brother (who is a year older than him, but has the same childlike love of Christmas and still believes in Santa) he would react the exact same way. He would seem unenthusiastic, and we would have to get his attention to point out that Santa was even there. 

However, that would be all he talked about for weeks. He would never, ever forget something like that. We've done surprises similar to this before, and while he didn't seem like he cared so much at the time, he would ask about it and talk about it all the time. ""Santa will come back next year?"" ""Santa came to visit."" ""Santa comes in the winter time."" etc. It makes a lasting positive effect, even though it doesn't seem like it at the time. 

A lot of of people seem to think its pointless to allow Trevor to believe in Santa even though he's an adult. It makes sense, because we stopped a long time ago. 

But again, most Autistic people are kids who will never grow up. My family's goal with my brother is to help him succeed and become as independent as possible. We want for him to have a job, house, and yes, be mature enough to no longer believe in Santa. 

But we're realistic as well. We know that he will probably always have to live with a family member, and be taken care of. 

I don't tell him Santa isn't real because it's not hurting anyone for him to believe. It makes him genuinely happy, the same way the church environment does. I'm an atheist who no longer believes in Santa, but my brother knows none of this. When I go to the volunteer camp, I speak nothing of Santa or God not being real. Because it makes them happy. And I know it's hard to explain, and I'm not doing it much justice, but the burden of truth is for people who understand enough to no longer be innocent. These people are innocent, and blissful just like children. 

Anyway, I hope this helps. I know it may seem uncomfortable, but remember that people on the Autism spectrum or social morons. They don't react to situations the same way we do. So even though it may seem tense and uncomfortable, this really is a joyous video. I promise you that Trevor enjoyed this visit, and that the people of this video are showing him genuine kindness and not just exploiting him. 

Edit: Wow. I had hoped that people would see this but I didn't expect it to blow up so much. It's nice to know that people genuinely care and that all the comments that seemed wrong really were just misconceptions. You guys are good people. 

To clarify a few questions that came from the original comment: 

""The Autism spectrum is very broad as you've stated, so where's the line between someone reacting positively or negatively to being spoken to the way Trevor is?""

Sadly enough, the distinction isn't easy at all. Not for me anyway. For more mildly Autistic people, this could definitely be insulting. I have had full conversations with people diagnosed with Asberger's and had no clue that they were different. There are many higher functioning people who are capable of everything we are, with just a few (sometimes unnoticeable) social hiccups. 

For anyone like this, I meant no offense to you. 

It really all comes down to judgement. In the past I've noticed that higher functioning people will get very defensive when you do anything that would be considered looking down on them. Even if you mean it in a friendly way. Most of the time they will simply tell you, and give you the benefit of the doubt. Once you know that they are on the higher end of the spectrum, then it's good to speak to them normally. They can think on the same level we do, so there's nothing wrong with holding them in the same regard. Just make sure to keep their condition in mind. It could be very easy to forget that they may react differently than you would, simply because they seem just like you in most other ways. 

""Where is the point where it will benefit them to bear the burden of truth? When can I tell them that Santa isn't real?""

Anyone who's a parent can apply the same mindset to their children. What age do I tell my son that dragons aren't real? When do I tell my daughter that she'll never be an actual princess?

These decisions are very difficult. Nobody wants to crush someone's dreams, especially someone innocent. 

I find it would be best to just leave them alone. My parents never TOLD me that Santa wasn't real, because I matured enough to figure it out on my own. 

If one day Trevor vocalizes that he's too old to believe in Santa, then it would be his decision. Nobody forced it on him and upset him. He reached the maturity to make his own calls, so the problem mostly solves itself.

I hope that clears up any questions I may have caused firsthand. If anyone wanted to learn more, the best way is first-hand involvement. You can only learn so much from books and the Internet. Spend some time with them, and you'll have a much greater understand of the disorder. Not to mention other disorders, and even dealing with children or adults that behave like children. 

Volunteering with mentally disabled people is unbelievably rewarding too. You feel like a good person. I cannot explain in words how much you can better their lives. Most of them don't get to have fun like we do. They can't go out and get drunk, or hang out at the mall whenever they want. So events set up by volunteer programs can be the only highlight of their lives. I recommend anyone to give it a shot at least once. I'm no saint. I do stupid stuff and don't consider myself an ideal role model at all. But when I help people like them I feel like a genuinely good person. It helps you as much as it helps them. 

And don't be discouraged because you feel nervous or intimidated. It's scary working with mentally challenged people, because you feel under qualified and overwhelmed. But I've seen people do it. I've seen reckless assholes with no patience find it in them to work just fine with these people. Everyone has the capacity to do good things. All you have to do is put yourself out there and go for it. 

Merry Christmas and happy holidays everyone.

True,ShiningRayde,,,"The aught question is well answered, so I'll tackle the mm/caliber one more in-depth.

The simple answer is that they are two different standards for the same measurements. A barrel's diameter can be roughly measured in millimeters, or in inches. A .50 caliber gun shoots a round that's half an inch across. This does not signify anything about the round other than the length across: a .50 caliber round can be the action-express pistol round or the full .50 caliber rifle round.

The .50 caliber provides a further example: the standard .50 BMG (machine gun) round can also be found under the title '12.7mm NATO'. They mean the same thing: .5 inches = 12.7mm, roughly.

Some rounds are easier to express in mm than caliber. The .40 caliber S&amp;W is a well known revolver round, but less well known as the '10mm round'. The common 9mm round, on the other hand, would have to go under the name .355 caliber, which is a bit of a mouthful in comparison!

Once you go above .50 caliber, it's more common to find rounds marked in millimeters: The 25mm cannon round is well known to the US military, used in the Bushmaster cannons of the Bradley AFVs and some aircraft: in calibers, it would be 1.0 caliber, but it's never (or perhaps rarely) mentioned in this way. The 4.7 caliber round is better known as the 120mm tank round, used in US and English battle tanks.

The reason for higher-diameter rounds using millimeters rather than calibers is a more complex question. From [what I can tell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_pistol_and_rifle_cartridges), the US and England used predominantly calibers in measuring their rounds, whereas mainland Europe (Germany and Russia in particular) favored millimeters. This trend would be seen extensively in the second world war: the US favored .30 and .45 caliber, the Germans 9mm and 7.92mm rounds. England did something regarding the weight of their ammunition, and the Russians got really drunk. It is a question for historians then, if we abandoned caliber designations for cannon rounds for some significant reason: perhaps due to Russian and German tank divisions being the largest and most wide-spread forces in the war? Such as, after their widespread adoption of mm designations, it became the norm? 

So, to wrap up this increasingly-poorly-designed-for-five-year-olds story, mm and caliber are the same measurement, just in either metric or inches, for the width of the barrel of the gun, and some bullets can be found in both caliber and mm names.",0,1356413576,,0,False,1,c7lstiy,t3_15e4ma,t1_c7lstiy,t3_15e4ma,,1430765016,6,False,explainlikeimfive,t5_2sokd,6

True,Cleev,no-knight,Agnostic Atheist,"It really all comes down to two things for me - a lack of evidence and a lack of morals and common sense.  Let's talk about the lack of evidence first.

For the sake of argument, I'll stipulate that a man named Jesus was born a couple of thousand years ago.  I'll even stipulate that he was the son of a carpenter, had a ministry, and was crucified.  So what part of that leads to an assumption of divinity?  That he claimed to be the son of God?  So did Charles Manson, David Koresh, and [dozens of others](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_messiah_claimants).  Why take one man's claims of divinity more seriously than the others?

Now let's talk about the morals and common sense, or more precisely, the lack of them, in the Christian mythology.

According to Christian mythology, God is perfect.  Then he created stuff, including the world and people to worship him.  However, creation comes out of needs or desires, both of which indicate a lack.  As a perfect being lacks nothing, a perfect being would not need or want to create anything.  Thus, the Christian God is necessarily imperfect, and thus is not God.

Additionally, the Christian God is allegedly perfect, and imperfection cannot logically be a product of perfection, thus any of God's creations would necessarily be perfect.  As we learn, however, God's creation was flawed, which leads us to the conclusion that the Christian God is not perfect, and therefore not God, or that all of this is simply mythology borne out of ignorant and superstitious minds.

God creates man and woman and puts them in the garden with the tree of knowledge of good and evil, from which he commands them not to eat.  However, the Christian God is allegedly omniscient, which means he knew they would eat from it.  So why put them in the garden with the tree to begin with?  The possible explanations are that the Christian God is not omniscient (and therefore not God), or it is simply a myth.

However, God placed his creations in the garden with the tree.  Having no knowledge of good and evil (having not yet eaten from the tree), how would they know that disobeying God's commands is an act of evil?  Clearly, it was a test, one for which Adam and Eve were ill-prepared.  Such an unfair test is not the act of a loving, kind, benevolent God, such as the one of Christian mythos.  So again, we are left with the notions that God is not loving, kind, and benevolent, and is therefore not God, or that it is a simple myth.

God forbade eating from the tree of knowledge of good and evil and told his creations that if they ate, they would die.  As we learn, this was not the case.  God misled his creations by saying something that was untrue, which we call a lie.  Lying is, I think we can agree, bad.  The Christian God is infinitely good, and that which is infinitely good is incapable of anything but good.  As God lied, we are again left with the two alternatives; either he is not God, or it is myth.

When discovering (ignoring the omniscience problem for a moment) that his creations disobeyed him, God curses them, and all their children, and exiles them from paradise.  To punish infinitely for a finite offense is neither just nor moral.  To punish the offspring for the offense of the parent is neither just nor moral.  The Christian God is allegedly infinitely just, and all morality allegedly comes from him.  If he acts in such a way that is unjust and immoral, then we are left with the same two conclusions - that he is either not god, or all of this is mythology made up by bronze age nomadic tribes who were entirely ignorant of the physical sciences.

Skipping over a lot of genocide, slavery, rape, murder, etc, until we arrive at the new testament...

God decides after untold thousands of years that he is ready to forgive mankind for the offense of two people who didn't know any better.  So instead of just forgiving mankind (he's God, he's allowed to that if he wants, I suspect), he sends himself (the holy spirit) to impregnate a young woman with himself (Jesus) to serve as a scapegoat and a blood sacrifice to himself.  To punish one individual for the crimes of another is unjust and immoral.  To demand blood in exchange for forgiveness is unjust and immoral.

Not to mention that, taking the Jesus story as read, that he knew he was the son of God.  He would have known that after spending an afternoon being beaten, mocked, and tortured, he would die, and after three days he would come back and be God.  So really, he didn't die for the sins of man.  He had a bad weekend for the sins of man.  Think about it.  If you had the opportunity, wouldn't you endure a few hours of torture and a couple of days of nonexistence in order to be supreme ruler of the universe for all eternity?  I would, no hesitation.  Not to mention that when Jesus was in the desert, what could Satan have possibly tempted him with that might make him reconsider the whole ruler of the universe bit?

It's a story full of holes that made sense to ignorant tribesmen, but can be picked apart for what it is in a matter of hours by anyone with any reasonable critical thinking skills.  The absence of sense notwithstanding, the foundation of Christianity is eternal punishment for finite crimes, scapegoating, and blood sacrifice, which I find reprehensible.  If your God is less moral than a human being, why worship him at all?

As to Aquinas' arguments, the problem with those is that you can replace 'God' with 'The Flying Spaghetti Monster', 'The Great Star Goat', 'Dick Cavett', or even 'That stuff I scraped out from under my fingernail last Thursday'.  But the important thing to bear in mind is that Aquinas was a Dominican Priest in the 13th century.  It stands to reason that, as a priest, he would have a slightly biased opinion on the subject of the existence of God and how the universe works.  It also stands to reason that Aquinas, who lived in the 13th century (1225-1274), did not have access to physics, astronomy, chemistry, biology, geology, and all the other natural sciences that seem to indicate through mountains of evidence that a god was not required to set the universe in motion or to create the things we observe in our world.

Lastly, let's talk miracles for a moment.  We'll establish a definition of 'miracle' as 'an event attributed to divine intervention, which is otherwise inexplicable by natural phenomena.'  I'll even stipulate that the events recorded in the bible as miracles actually occurred and have no natural explanation, and were, in fact, miracles.

So why are modern miracles relegated to things like 'I found my car keys', or 'I got a job I applied for', or 'My cancer went away after months of radiation and chemotherapy'?  What happened to the burning bush, the feeding of the masses, the parting of seas, the healing of the terminally ill and the resurrection of the dead?  Has god's power waned so much in two millenia? Christians love to cite the healing powers associated with the waters of [Lourdes, France](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Lady_of_Lourdes), but let's examine that more closely.  The faithful have been traveling to Lourdes in hopes of a miracle for 150 years.  Taking an **extremely** conservative estimate of 100 visitors per day (actual estimates stand at around 6 million annually), that's a total of about 5.5 million visitors so far.  Out of the extremely conservative 5.5 million visitors have only 7000 (about 0.001%) claimed to have experienced a miracle there, and only 68 (0.00001%) actually been cured of some ailment?  It's almost as if that 0.00001% might represent the percentage of patients who get better without medical intervention anyways.  

But let's talk about that miracle that everyone knows about.  Let's talk about that flood/fire/tornado/hurricane/hailstorm in which someone's life or property was miraculously spared from the destruction experienced by their neighbors.  Where was the miracle for the neighbors?  Were they not as deserving of God's grace, or had they perhaps angered or offended God in some way?  Or is there a natural explanation, such as poor home construction, use of proper fire safety equipment, older homes being less able to withstand the elements?

I've been around for a little over a third of a century, and while I haven't experienced nearly everything life has to offer, I can honestly say that I've never seen or been told of any event that simply has no natural explanation.

Sorry for the wall of text.  I do hope you'll take the time to read it, though, as it explains a great deal of why I find Christianity as a whole, Aquinas' proofs, and the existence of miracles to be suspect, at best.

True,Sachemdot,,,"The pattern and theme is very inconsistent, which combined with the font, really makes this seem less minimal or dark then you might want.

For instance, the pattern in the largest two hexagons isn't really connected to the rest of the piece in any way I can understand. They don't really give off a minimalist vibe. The coloring is inconsistent with the rest of the piece, in particular in the bright pink background within the frame.

Additionally, the choice of the gradient brushed metal look for the frames and the letters seems pretty loud, especially when combined with the much more minimalist background hexagons. The outlining of the two types of hexagons is different, and that's distracting.

Even on its own, that font might benefit more from a simple, elegant monocolored design. The radioactive green glow says hardstyle YouTube video more than it says   minimal, dark techno to me. 

With all the geometry already there, the cubes within the hexagons are probably too much in their current forms. With all the variation in design and orientation, they add unnecessary  complexity to a minimalist pattern that didn't need them.

Sorry if this sounds harsh, just trying to be helpful. I really like the hexagons in the background and the geometric way they're laid out. It just feels like you tried to create something with more details than you needed to make something minimalist. Also, merry christmas!

True,bananaphophesy,,,"In the UK, Christmas usually ends up being about a two week break more or less. Most of my friends head back to their families for Christmas, I'm not very close to mine so I've had to learn a few things to make the whole thing more bearable / enjoyable.

These are sorta kinda in order:

**(1) Spoil yourself**

Fill your place with whatever food and drink you can muster, also stock up on movies, music, games, reading. I usually have a long Christmas laundry list that I try to get through over the break. This year it's Fringe Season 4, Game of Thrones Season 2, and a book by Ron Jonson. Also all those fucking Steam games I bought in the sale.

I like to have a couple of modest christmas decorations too, just tokens really. Anything more is like you're decorating for a party that no-one turns up for.

**(2) Get out everyday.**

If your friends have all gone away, or you don't have very many (or any: msg me), one of the hardest things is the isolation over christmas. So make sure you get out every single day, and try to find some sort of personal interaction. Just chatting with the lady at the shop will help a huge amount.

**(3) Be physically active**

I love climbing, and my local climbing gym is open during most of the break. I'm planning on spending lots of time there over the next couple of weeks. This also helps a lot with social interaction too ... lots of climbers in similar situations, or escaping from their families for a few hours :)

**(4) Meditate (or something like that)**

Not for everyone, but I find meditation helps me find peace of mind. So I do my best to meditate every day, and for longer periods during the christmas hols.

**(5) Have a project**

I have a mobile game project I'm working on, and having dedicated time to work on it is awesome. It might be organizing your LP collection, or memorizing the script of The Empire Strikes Back, or learning how to do cryptic crosswords, but having something you can aim to achieve over the break will really help

**(6) Have a plan**

I find that having a daily plan of the break really helps. I schedule in physical activities, getting out and about, personal projects, and just chill out time. I'm lucky that a few mates are around after Christmas so I'm planning to meet them for drinks too. This really helps to alleviate boredom, and to give some sense of purpose to the time.

**(7) Be online**

Kinda goes without saying if you're reading this :) Reach out through reddit, it can make all the difference.

HTH.

True,ilovesharkpeople,teamehome,,"**For starting items**, it's a generally good idea to get one salve and one tango, some clarities if your character really needs them, some Ironwood Branches (VERY cost efficient), and then either a courier/wards, or something like a ring of protection, stout shield, quelling blade, or the +3 stat items. That'll give you some extra stats (int = mana/regen, str = hp/regen, agility = armor and attack speed, with your primary stat also giving you damage) and plenty of laning presence early on. From there you probably want to get boots and start working on your core items.

**In terms of items you will want to know about**, here are some common items that should help you get a firm footing on what you'll be wanting to spend your cash on, and also what to look out for.

Items are very dynamic, and most of the most powerful items in the game's strength comes not from stats, but the ability to give your hero another dimension to their play. Stuff like Force Staff, Blink Dagger, Scythe of Vyse and Pipe are prime examples. 


[DOTAFire](http://www.dotafire.com/) is a good place to start looking at some item and skill builds. [Playdota](http://www.playdota.com/guides) is probably even better, but most of the guides there use DOTA 1 icons, which you'll likely find very confusing.

Some good general stuff to get/watch out for:

*Arcane Boots/Soul ring:*

* Gives you lots of disposable mana. You still have to watch your mana pool closely, but these items are great for supports or any hero that relies more spammable abilities. Tranquil boots + soul ring is a super-cheap way to give yourself a lot of sustainability and upgraded boots, too.

*Power Treads*

* Overall very nice stats. Gives you pretty much anything you want and a decent default choice for upgraded boots

*Magic Stick/Wand*

* Get this on EVERYONE. Great emergency button that costs next to nothing.

*Iron branches*

* Have some extra starting gold? Buy lots of these. Gives a ton of stats for low cost, and sell when your item slots fill up.

*Mekansm/Pipe of Insight*

* Super good team support items. If you're not a carry, it's not a bad idea to look at picking one of these up for your team.

*Force staff/Blink Dagger*


* Initiation and escape. DRAMATICALLY boosts your mobility. Force staff can also save allies, or force staff in enemies to pick them off.

*Bracer*

* Been playing as a support and very, very poor? Get some bracers for a little extra HP

*Drums of Endurance*

* Incredible stats for the cost. The aura is also awesome. Really good all-around item that also helps your team.

*Scythe of Vyse*

* Even if you're not an int hero this can be INCREDIBLE. It's a 3 second disable. Holy shit.

*Vangaurd*

* Playing someone tanky, or someone who needs to be? This is a cheap way to get a ton of HP. Builds from stout shield, which is a great item on any meele hero.

*Aghanim's Scepter*

* Not for everyone, but generally a great item on most. Make SURE you know what the bonus your ult gets is with this, and if it's really worth the 4200 gold that you could be spending on more utility or survivability items.


*Ring of Basillius*

* Armor and mana for cheap, and with an aura. Great for the cost. Just keep the aura off unless you're pushing or your lane is going to push out too far and you're going to be forced to be farming in a very dangerous area. Also, don't be eager to upgrade this into vlad's offering very fast. Vlad's is not nearly as good as most newbies think it is, since lifesteal isn't really very important if you're not a hard carry with a ton of farm. Despite the cost, Vlad's is more appropriate to pick up late game (if at all) than as soon as you have 2000 gold.

*Necronomicon 1-3*

* Good stats, and the necro units give you SO much pushing power and damage in a fight. Ideally you want to be microing them, but even if you just select them, put them in a single hotkey and tell them to attack something they're great. The Necro III's melee summon also has invis detection, which is just gravy.

*Medallion of Courage*

* Mana and armor again. The active lets your team's main target in a fight drop ridiculously fast. It also works on neutrals, siege units, and Roshan - use it liberally if you're not worried about being ganked, or have to kill something fast.

*Assault Curiass*

* I'm staying away from damage items for the most part, but this is SO good for you and your team it's a great choice for anyone who's in the middle of the fight or doing a lot of right-click damage. The + and - armor auras are so, SO good.

*Black King Bar*

* This thing changes the game more than almost any other item. Spell immunity is a HUGE advantage. It often translates to more damage for you in a fight by a HUGE amount - the ability to avoid nukes and disables and freely move around in a fight is just incredible. Don't confuse with Monkey King Bar - they are VERY different.

*Urn of Shadows*

* Really advisable for someone on your team to have this, but if you're not a dedicated ganker, be it farmed up or a hard support, don't bother. Urn charges are great for getting a teammate up to full to keep them in lane or keep a push going, or finish off a retreating enemy. The strength and mana regen bonuses are solid too.


*Wards*

* BUY SOME DAMN WARDS.

*Dust of Appearance*

* STOP DYING TO RIKIMARU AND BUY SOME DUST TO KILL HIM

*Scroll of Town Portal* 

* This item is SO important. ALWAYS have one on you to assist a lane or escape quickly

*DPS items*

* Diffusal blade, Crystalis, Daedalus, Mjolnir, Yasha, Manta Style, Abyssal Blade, Radiance, Daedalus, Deslolator, Mask of Madness, Orchid, Shadowblade, Armlet of Mordiggian, Monkey King Bar, Basher, Battlefury and Butterfly are probably the things to watch out for the most on enemy heroes that focus on doing right click damage. They're not universally good on all heroes but if you see any, be aware.

**Pubstomping hero-wise** you'll probably mostly have issues with Rikimaru (perma invis), Ursa, Drow and Huskar. ALL rely on a lot of right clicking, so you can stun and kill them (save it for when huskar is low since he hits harder the lower he is), buy a Ghost scepter to survive them, a force staff to escape them, or wards to see them coming in advance. Riki can also be solved with sentry wards or Dust of Appearance.

Not sure how much research you've done, but I figured I'd mention this just incase since a program may not tell you: also remember to take the size of the star into account in reference to its lifespan. Increasing the mass drastically decreases the lifespan. For example, on a blue giant, its lifespan would be in the millions of years rather than the 6 billion our sun will have and life would not be able to fully evolve. In other words, despite having a habitable zone, you wouldn't find any life there. (naturally that is).

So everyone ever should listen to [skeptoid](http://www.skeptoid.com) by Brian Dunning, because it is wonderful and so is he. I'm about to copy+paste a section of one of his podcasts (he posts transcripts online) about the bermuda triangle

&gt;The Bermuda Triangle
&gt;
It's perhaps the best known of all the world's regions said to be strangely treacherous. The triangle goes from Miami to Bermuda to Puerto Rico, and despite a huge amount of normal shipping traffic passing through it every day, stories persist that some force there lurks to pull ships and planes to a watery grave.
&gt;
The most common appearance of the Bermuda Triangle today is on television documentaries and popular books that purport to take a ""science-based"" look at the phenomenon. They give the appearance of skepticism by dismissing the paranormal explanations like psychic energy, Atlantis, or alien abductions, and instead focus on natural phenomena that could be responsible for disappearances. These include rogue waves, undersea methane explosions, or strange geomagnetic fluctuations. They test these explanations with scale models and sophisticated simulations.
&gt;
But in fact, this representation of being scientific is wrong. To investigate the Bermuda Triangle scientifically, we would start with an observation, and then test hypotheses to explain it. Popular programming today tends to skip the very first step: actually having an observation to explain.
&gt;
One of the first things you learn when researching the Bermuda Triangle responsibly — which means including source material beyond the TV shockumentaries and pulp paperbacks that promote the mystery wholeheartedly — is that transportation losses inside the Bermuda Triangle do not occur at a rate higher than anywhere else, and the number of losses that are unexplained is also not any higher. Statistically speaking, there is no Bermuda Triangle. The books and TV shows are trying to explain an imaginary observation.
&gt;
The United States Coast Guard, which is the primary safety authority in the area, has this to say:
&gt;
The Coast Guard does not recognize the existence of the so-called Bermuda Triangle as a geographic area of specific hazard to ships or planes. In a review of many aircraft and vessel losses in the area over the years, there has been nothing discovered that would indicate that casualties were the result of anything other than physical causes. No extraordinary factors have ever been identified.
&gt;
That's not to say that losses don't occur there. They do. They also occur everywhere else on Earth. Some are unexplained. A similar percentage of losses worldwide are also unexplained. Unexplained doesn't mean unexplainable; it simply means that insufficient evidence remained to allow to cause of the loss to be determined, which is, sadly, all too common with ships and planes that go down at sea.



So there you go.
He also talks about HOW the myth got started, so if you'd like to read that, I've pasted it below.

&gt;
So then, how and why does the story exist at all?
&gt;
The answer is that it never did, until 1945 when a flight of five Navy training planes (the infamous ""Flight 19"") ran out of fuel and ditched, and were unfortunately never recovered. An author, Vincent Gaddis, dramatized this in the fiction magazine Argosy in 1964 with a story titled ""The Deadly Bermuda Triangle"", the first time the name is known to have been used. But it remained a relatively unknown footnote until 1974, when paranormal author Charles Berlitz published his mass market paperback The Bermuda Triangle. It was the perfect book for the New Age movement of the 1970s, and quite suddenly the Triangle became a giant fixture in urban legendry.
&gt;
It fell to a skeptical researcher, Larry Kusche, to attempt to debunk Berlitz's assault on the public intellect, which he did most thoroughly with his book published the following year titled The Bermuda Triangle — Solved. Unfortunately, as we see so often, the market took little interest in the humdrum assertion that something amazing and paranormal did not in fact exist, and it was Berlitz's version that has remained the icon of the story.
&gt;
On his summary of the Bermuda Triangle, researcher Robert Carroll writes of Kusche's efforts:
&gt;
After examining the 400+ page official report of the Navy Board of Investigation of the disappearance of the Navy planes in 1945, Kusche found that the Board wasn't baffled at all by the incident and did not mention alleged radio transmissions cited by Berlitz in his book. According to Kusche, what isn't misinterpreted by Berlitz is fabricated. Kusche writes: ""If Berlitz were to report that a boat were red, the chance of it being some other color is almost a certainty.""
&gt;
And so despite the fact that unexplained losses have happened there — just as they happen everywhere — it turns out that the Bermuda Triangle is nothing more than an invention, and subsequent embellishment, by imaginative authors.

True,No_transistory,,,"I'll oblige. Firstly, I'd like to point out nobody was hurt. It was a single vehicle incident and I had no passengers. Secondly, thanks for any support and any criticism. 

To keep it basic and relevant, I didn't have a great time at school. Bullying continued after leaving school and into my first full time employment. Within a month, my Girlfriend left me, I was pressured into leaving my job and had learned that my Father (whom I had idolised growing up) had try to commit suicide. After leaving my job, I had trouble finding a new job, debt started accumulating and I became increasingly anxious. 

One day, I had failed two interviews, and on the drive home I ""lost it"" and drove into a ditch at around 80/90mph. The car had rolled several times with such impact, that the roof had collapsed to the point it was touching the front passenger seat. The drivers side stayed intact, I climbed out the window while passers by helped me out the ditch. After that I lay sobbing at the side of the road until an ambulance arrived.

I've been as basic as I can. There is a lot more to it and I don't want to depress people even further than I may have this Christmas. As for counselling, I don't believe in it. I've tried it and it doesn't help me. I'm a lot better since (this happened 4 years ago), but I still have low points. I may visit a more relevant subreddit and go into more detail as it helps talking about such things.

Oh, and always wear your seatbelt. If I wasn't wearing my seatbelt, I'd have got my ""wish"".



EDIT: Thanks again for support. Those taking the time to read this means a lot. 
Also, Thanks for the criticism. I expected a lot more negativity than I received, but I take it all on board. I know a meme isn't the best way to express oneself so I apologise if it's deemed insensitive, but I feel better for sharing.

If you are going to be late, even if you don't have an excuse, just call/text me and tell me so I don't stand on the street waiting for you like a dumbass for a half hour. Tell me you're late, when you're going to get there,  and I'll go get a cup of tea and everything will be chill. My biggest complaint about late people is most of the time they don't tell you they are late or when they are going to show up. 

I visit a lot of people in other cities, as a college graduate my friends live in various cities, quite often people are late. If someone goes through an extreme amount of effort to hang out with you...being late basically says you don't value that effort. Now don't tell me ""That wasn't my intention."" We know its not your intention to make your friends think you don't value their time and effort...but honestly if you think its OK for someone to sit and wait for you while you diddle around, you need to think about your priorities. 

A lot of people in here are like ""Just plan for your late friends to be late."" Now hold on, how is that fair? I'm on time 95% of the time, why can't they plan for me being on time when they know I'll be on time as much as I know they'll be late. 

You don't think we have anything better to do? We dropped whatever we were doing when it was time to get ready so we could be there. So just tell me you are going to be late. Then I can take care of whatever I need to take care of and we'll have fun when you get here.

True,ThePunkSwoleBrother,,,"This is my wife. I think a lot of people are like her in that she doesn't want things to take any more time than the bare minimum and insists she has completely optimized her routine, which may not be strictly the planning fallacy, but it's related. 

So, let's say it's morning and she needs to take a shower, get dressed, make and eat breakfast, put her dishes in the dishwasher, turn it on, make her lunch, get her stuff, and leave. Let's say that takes 30 minutes, on average. So she'll wake up at 8am to leave at 8:30am. Exactly 30 minutes. 

Only shit happens, you know. Maybe it takes a few minutes for the shower to get warmed up. Or she discovers the thing she was going to wear has a stain and she needs to pick out something else. Or...whatever. 

So now she's 5 minutes behind her routine and she's running late and has to leave and she gets into a flailing panic cascade where hurrying to do one thing leads to it actually taking longer than it normally would which adds a minute here and there and eventually she goes flying out the door in a complete tizzy and she inevitably forgets her lunch or to turn on the dishwasher or something. 

But of course, if you say ""Why don't you just get up a few minutes earlier?"" she thinks you're an idiot because IT ONLY TAKES 30 MINUTES TO GET READY, STUPID and she could be sleeping those 5 minutes instead of getting up a few minutes early and not spending the morning in a panic. 

I think a lot of people are like that and just stick to whatever their time estimates are no matter how serious the evidence is to the contrary. 

Me, I always give it more time than I need, so while she'd be spending the morning flailing around in a panic, I'd be slowly waking up and serenely eating my cereal and she'd be glaring daggers because I'm sort of laughing about every morning being a fire drill/RED ALERT. Upside is I seldom had to make myself a lunch because she always forgot hers while flailing around in the morning.

At this point it's almost effortless, but there are a few things I always keep on my mind when I'm around people so I stay focused on presenting myself with confidence:

- Maintain eye contact. You'll naturally break it while talking, but try to keep it when others are speaking.
- Stand up straight and avoid sitting when feeling awkward. Posture has a strong effect on confidence.
- Get in the habit of turning your life into a narrative. Be able to tell an interesting story about anything in your scope of knowledge (having ADHD makes this easy thanks to our wide range of interests)
- When you make eye contact with strangers, especially cute ones, looks sideways rather than down. It seriously helps, try it.
- For the love of your chosen deity, *don't get lost in your own head around other people*. It's comforting for introverts but takes you out-of-sync with people around you. Feeling confident is difficult when you missed the last question because you were too busy thinking about how ratty your shoes look.
- Put more effort into ""primping"" yourself when going out. Being well-dressed and freshly-groomed may not give some people confidence, but a lackthereof will sure as hell take it away.

True,beefcakez,,,"Came here to defend my use of Cursive writing. 

Cursive is only irrelevant as a symptom of a much larger issue: we are no longer a patient society. We demand instant gratification for all things we do. Writing anything by hand is simply not cost-effective any longer. We could much easier send an email, call, or text a message. Writing something takes a long time; time we don't have to spare. 

However, as anyone who still writes letters, cursive is an invaluable tool. It was designed as an efficient means to convey a message legibly and fast during an age before digital mediums. Knowing that some other soul has touched that, planned their thoughts, and taken the time to write it is truly endearing. 


**Edit:** Okay, I guess it wasn't clear in my initial post that I refer to our impatience as a society as a separate thought from cursive being faster than print. What I meant was that a handwritten note or letter requires mailing or hand delivery. This takes much longer than an email. When sending a letter it takes days, maybe weeks to receive, and a response takes just as long. It may be a month before you receive something if at all. Fast forward to now; we can send an email and have a response in seconds. We've become accustomed to this and now find anything other than immediate gratification unpleasant. 

As for cursive: connecting the letters was faster than the press-and-release method of print writing and required less effort of the forearm/hands. Therefore you could writing longer with little fatigue to the hands.

There were times were I wanted to give up, times that I thought I couldn't continue on any more.

True,Rhomboid,,,"This code is actually quite awful.  The point here is that to control some IO pins requires reading and writing to some addresses in physical memory where they are mapped.  But a normal process does not have access to physical memory, but virtual memory.  However, the device `/dev/mem` exists which presents a file-based view of physical memory, and that is what this is using to be able to twiddle those addresses -- this is like the old PEEK and POKE from BASIC.

So what this is doing is mapping a 4K block of memory starting at offset `0x20200000` (`GPIO_BASE`) of the file `/dev/mem` into the virtual address space of the process.  Doing that doesn't require calling `malloc()` first, and in fact doing that is wrong and unnecessary.  The memory that was allocated with `malloc()` will just end up being lost anyway, because this mapping will override the mapping that allowed that block of memory to exist. This function should have just been this:

Passing NULL as the first parameter to `mmap()` tells the system to choose an address at will, instead of specifying one.  All memory mappings must occur at page boundaries, so while that page alignment stuff would have been necessary if you were picking the address, you don't have to pick the address, you can let the system pick it.

Mappings must be page aligned because by definition that is the granularity of the memory management unit (MMU) which is the hardware that implements virtual memory.  You can't partially map a page, because the whole point here is to reduce the number of possible things that the hardware has to deal with.  If the MMU had byte-level granularity and a 32 bit address space, then potentially each byte could be mapped to something different which would be billions of mappings.  By making the page size 4K (a common value) there are at most only 2^32 / 2^12 = 2^20 or about a million pages to manage, which is a lot more tractable.  The MMU also uses a 3 or 4 level page table structure to further reduce the complexity.

The block in `BLOCK_SIZE` here is a generic term for a block of memory.  It has nothing to do with blocks on a hard disk.

True,shitty-analogy,,DETRITUS ANALOGOUS MOTIVATIONUS,"LETS START WITH WHY YOU SHOULD EVEN LISTEN TO MY ANONYMOUS ASS:

**REASON NUMBER ONE**: I SMOKED A PACK A DAY FOR JUST UNDER **8 YEARS** SOUND FAMILIAR?

**REASON NUMBER B**: I HAVE A PACK OF CIGARETTES IN MY CAR AND IN MY DRAWER AT ALL TIMES THAT ARE OPEN AND HAVE CIGARETTES IN THEM.  **WHY?** BECAUSE THAT IS THE ONLY WAY TO TRULY GET OVER THE ADDICTION.  TEMPTATION DOES NOT TAKE A HOLIDAY, THIS HAS TO BECOME YOUR REALITY.

**REASON NUMBER -7**: DURING MY ENTIRE SMOKING TENURE I HAVE MADE THE DECISION TO QUIT **ONE** TIME, AND ONLY ONCE, AND DID SO SUCCESSFULLY.

**REASON NUMBER 46**: I HAVE NOT SMOKED A SINGLE CIGARETTE FOR OVER HALF A YEAR (YES MY CIG PACKS IN MY CAR AND DRESSER ARE STALE AS BITCH-CANKLES RIGHT NOW)

IT WON'T HAPPEN OVER NIGHT, CHANGE IS SOMETHING THAT TAKES TIME AND COMMITMENT AND GOD KNOWS THAT MOTIVATION WAVERS LIKE A MOTHERFUCKER.  SELF DISCIPLINE IS A FINITE RESOURCE, AND THERE IS A FINE LINE BETWEEN DEDICATION AND OBSESSION.  I REALLY DO HOPE YOU WILL READ ALL OF THIS AND I TRULY DO WISH YOU THE BEST OF LUCK.  CHANCES ARE YOU ARE RIGHT AROUND MY AGE (MAYBE A LITTLE YOUNGER) AND YOU CAN FUCKING DO IT.  SERIOUSLY THOUGH, DON'T USE THE ""NEW YEAR"" OR YOUR BIRTHDAY OR ANY OTHER ARBITRARY DAY TO MAKE A CHANGE.  THESE DAYS ARE NO DIFFERENT THAN ANY OTHER DAY.  NEW YEARS DAY IS FUCKING IDENTICAL TO TOMORROW, OR TODAY, EXCEPT PEOPLE PRETEND ITS SPECIAL.  **IT IS NOT**, EVERY DAY CAN BE YOUR ""NEW YEAR""  I KNOW THAT WHEN I'M CELEBRATING THIS NEW YEAR I WILL NOT BE MAKING A RESOLUTION, I WILL BE CELEBRATING THE CHANGES THAT I HAVE MADE ON QUIET, REGULAR, UNASSUMING, COMPLETELY NON-SPECIAL DAYS.

DO YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW I DID IT?  EASY: IT WAS DIFFICULT AS HELL.  IT WAS SERIOUSLY ONE OF THE MORE DIFFICULT THINGS I'VE DONE IN MY LIFE.  I DID NOT USE THE PATCH, I DID NOT USE NICORETTE OR ANY NICOTINE SUPPLEMENT.  WHAT WORKED FOR ME WAS REALIZING WHAT SITUATIONS MADE ME WANT TO SMOKE THE MOST AND DEALING WITH THEM ONE AT A TIME.  I NEVER SMOKED INDOORS SO THAT WAS AN EASY ONE FOR ME, IF YOU ARE USED TO SMOKING INSIDE THAT IS GOING TO BE THE FIRST STEP, MAKE A COMMITMENT TO NOT SMOKE INSIDE.  MY BIGGEST TRIGGER WAS DRIVING, SO I STARTED MAKING IT A HABIT TO CHEW GUM AND HAVE A DRINK OF SOME SORT WITH ME TO DISTRACT MYSELF FROM SMOKING, IT SUCKED AT FIRST BUT IT IS SURPRISING HOW QUICKLY YOU GET OVER IT.  WITHIN A WEEK OR TWO I DIDN'T EVEN NEED THE GUM AND DRINK ""CRUTCH"".  THE MOST DIFFICULT TRIGGER FOR ME WAS DRINKING ALCOHOL.  WHENEVER I WAS AT THE BARS WITH MY FRIENDS I WANTED TO SMOKE, THIS ONE TOOK THE LONGEST AND I ACTUALLY HAD TO START BY LIMITING THE NUMBER OF CIGARETTES I WOULD ALLOW MYSELF TO HAVE.  THIS ONE TOOK A COUPLE MONTHS TO TRULY GET OVER, AND THE FIRST TIME OR TWO I SUCCESSFULLY WENT TO THE BARS WITHOUT SMOKING HOLY FUCKING GOD DAMN DID I WANT A CIGARETTE, BUT I FELT SO FUCKING HAPPY WITH MYSELF THE NEXT DAY FOR FIGHTING THE URGE AND EACH TIME I WENT OUT DRINKING THE URGE TO SMOKE WAS LESS AND LESS.  

THE DESIRE **REALLY DOES** GO AWAY, DURING THE PROCESS IT MIGHT SEEM LIKE IT WON'T BUT IT WILL. AND NOW LIKE I SAID I HAVEN'T SMOKED A SINGLE CIGARETTE FOR OVER HALF A YEAR AND GUESS WHAT? **I DON'T EVEN WANT TO** I CAN EASILY GO TO THE BARS NOW AND NOT SMOKE WHILE STANDING AROUND IN A GROUP OF **PEOPLE SMOKING** WHICH I THOUGHT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE, IT DOESN'T EVEN OCCUR TO ME TO SMOKE WHILE DRIVING, I JUST WROTE A HUGE DIATRIBE ABOUT SMOKING AND MOTHERFUCKER I DON'T WANT TO SMOKE.  IT'S NOT EASY, BUT THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE BATTLING REAL SHIT, DISEASE, DISABILITY, DEATH, THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO HAVE NO FUCKING CHOICE BUT TO MAKE TOUGH DECISIONS EVERY SINGLE FUCKING DAY.  HONOR YOURSELF BY MAKING AN EFFORT.  

REMEMBER THOUGH, SHIT DOESN'T CHANGE OVER NIGHT AND IF YOU SLIP UP YOU DON'T ACCEPT DEFEAT YOU PICK UP THE PIECES AND MOVE FORWARD.  I DON'T CARE IF YOU TAKE TWO STEPS BACK, YOU CAN ALWAYS MAKE THE DECISION TO TAKE A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.  

ONE AND A HALF YEARS AGO TODAY I WAS A FUCKING SORRY MESS, I SMOKED CIGARETTES, HAD A SHIT DIET AND DIDN'T WORK OUT AT ALL. I WAS OVERWEIGHT ETC ETC YOU GET THE FUCKING PICTURE.  NOW, I WORK OUT CONSISTENTLY, EAT LIKE A BADASS (LOST NEARLY 40 LBS WHICH IS MY GOAL WEIGHT AND NOW I MAINTAIN) AND DON'T FUCKING SMOKE.  HELL I BARELY EVEN DRINK ANYMORE, AND WHEN I DO IT IS NOT NEARLY AS MUCH.  I DIDN'T JUST WAKE UP ONE DAY (LIKE NEW YEARS DAY) AND MAKE ALL OF THESE CHANGES. **FUCK NO** IF SOMEONE TOLD ME BACK THEN I WOULD HAVE MADE ALL THESE CHANGES AND I WOULD BE HERE TODAY LIKE THIS I WOULD NOT BELIEVE THEIR DUMB ASSES.  IT IS ABOUT MAKING ONE STEP, DECIDING TO DRINK WATER FOR THIS MEAL INSTEAD OF A SODA, DECIDING TO GO OUT ON A WALK, THEN WHAT THE HELL YOU ARE ALREADY OUT ON A WALK, WHY NOT TRY JOGGING A LITTLE?  MY PATH WAS NOT AND **IS NOT** WITHOUT SLIPS AND OCCASIONAL STEPS BACKWARDS.  **BUT THAT IS FUCKING LIFE**.  WHEN YOU FUCK UP, WHEN THINGS GO OFF TRACK THERE ARE TWO CHOICES

**CHOICE ONE:** CRY ABOUT IT AND SAY WELL YOU TRIED, BUT IT WAS TOO HARD AND MAYBE DECIDE THAT SOME SPECIAL ARBITRARY TIME IN THE FUTURE YOU WILL CHANGE, AND CONTINUE FUCKING UP.

**CHOICE TWO:** REALIZE THAT YOU ALWAYS HAVE THE POWER TO MAKE ONE SINGLE STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION, RIGHT FUCKING NOW, NO MATTER HOW MANY STEPS YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'VE TAKEN IN THE WRONG ONE.

I AM TRULY ROOTING FOR YOU, I REALLY AM.  THIS IS COMING FROM SOMEONE WHO KNOWS **EXACTLY** WHAT IT TAKES, DOWN TO THE SAME NUMBER OF YEARS SPENT SMOKING.  THERE IS A WAY PAST IT, AND THE DESIRE GOES AWAY.  ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT AT ANY MOMENT YOU CAN MAKE THE DECISION TO MAKE ONE SINGLE STEP UP THE MOUNTAIN.  DON'T FOCUS ON THE WHOLE MOUNTAIN OR IT BECOMES OVERWHELMING **AND YOU WILL GIVE UP**.  FOCUS ON NOT SMOKING A SINGLE CIGARETTE AT A TIME, NOT THIS IDEA OF ""NEVER SMOKING AGAIN"".  WELL ALL I HAVE TO SAY AFTER THAT EPIC RANT IS **HAPPY FUCKING NEW YEAR.**

True,AnonymousHipopotamus,,,"This brand of feminism shackles you as severely as (most of) the patriarchy that it stands against. You can tell yourself that you're kicking down the bulwarks of inequality, but you are sacrificing your dreams, and you right to search the world for what makes you happy, in order to appease the social expectations of those around you.

Maybe you feel like your work is important enough that you are willing to sacrifice your family life in order to further it; I actually understand that. 

Sacrificing a family life that you really want just for the vanity of calling yourself an empowered woman is just tragic irony. Empower yourself to damn the consequences and *decide that you have the right to define and pursue a successful life.* 

Decide if you want kids. If you want them, have them. Decide if you want a partner to help you spawn and/or raise them. If you want one, find one who will work with you on equal footing to decide on directions, goals, and actions for the family. Be the woman you want to be. This isn't an abandonment of feminism, but the fulfillment of the concept. Be the woman you want to be, even if that means spending less time in the lab and more time building a family.

True,rockbottomm,,,"I had a son who passed away at 2 months old. The first year was torturous, all I did was cry. I stayed in my room and didn't come out unless it was to use the bathroom. I contemplated suicide many many MANY times. My soul had shattered it a million pieces and NOTHING was going to put it back together. Nothing anyone said or did could ever make me feel better. It wouldn't bring my baby boy back, it wouldn't undo the great injustices that were places upon me. 

There was nothing in the world that could ever prepare you to watching a child take their last breaths in your arms, watching them slowly grow colder and turn blue as the last bit of life leaves from their body. I had nightmares for weeks, where I would wake up drenched in sweat wondering what I could have done differently to help my precious baby boy. 

The second year was better, I found a chat room that I could vent my frustrations and anger out, I read a couple books on grief and more specifically grief over losing a child. I still didn't go out because I couldn't stand people, especially pregnant people. I went through a phase that anyone with children under the age of 2 would instantly set me into hysterics. Pregnant people were a huge no-no, because all I could think of was hoping their baby would die so they would know how miserable and jealous I was (happened somewhat in the first year but more towards the end, was too filled with intense grief to care about anyone else).

Now here I am almost 4yrs after the fact and I'm a happy, productive member of society. It hurts, it really does, just not at much. You learn that life has to go on, because if you don't then two lives will be ended too soon. I'm crying as I write this, not because I'm sad but because I love my son even if he's not with me. I cry because I remember that even though his time with us was short, he brought us much joy and gave us wonderful memories.

So yes in the beginning it seems like all you want to do is die of sorrow, but things get better little by little. What saved me is a passage (not verbatim) from a grief book I read: 
&gt;*""You know that old saying ""Take things one day at a time.""? Well if you can't take it a day at a time, take it an hour at a time, if you can't handle that take it a minute at a time.""*

Well it definitely worked for me, it's what got me from curling into a little ball every night to talking to people online to eventually where I am today.

It doesn't get better, losing someone really close to you especially a child is not something you just ""get over"" one day. It doesn't every go away, it just gets easier to go on with your daily life. It breaks you in the beginning and it's up to you put the pieces of yourself back together. You'll never pristine again, they'll always be a piece or two broken in the fray. But you should take comfort that the person that you got broke you, picked up the pieces you left behind so that you'll always be with that person no matter what.

TL;DR When you lose a child you're a train wreck at first, but things do get easier as long as you're willing to pick yourself up and ""glue"" yourself back together again.

If I had to guess, the reason she can't be happy for you now has a lot to do with her own underlying depression issues. You sound like you are doing well, and that may be hard for her to acknowledge given your guys past relationship. The dynamic of the past made it easy for her to feel better by belittling you, but when that option is off the table, there is no outlet to make her feel better about herself. Ultimately, you have to live your life and make yourself happy. Even though your sister may not acknowledge your improvements, she likely sees them.

The big thing with American football is it's less endurance focused than soccer/rugby, and more on big explosive and intricately planned bursts of athletic skill.  The fact that they get half a minute between plays to catch their breath, reset and go back at it is what makes the highlight reels so much more exciting to watch.  You still get the crazy plays in rugby, but not as often because of the combination of the athletes are going to be a bit more gassed as the game goes on and that the football players are padded up and a lot more willing to just take crazy dives at each other.

It's a different sort of game, and honestly I think it's the reason that we Americans don't enjoy soccer/football as much as the rest of the world.  We're used to these discrete packages of tremendous action, then taking a moment to digest what just went down, then back to it, vs the marathon of poking and levering for advantage and the tremendous cathartic release when a goal is finally scored that soccer brings.

True,biggestofmikes,,,"Prioritize these are your own discretion, as things will accumulate over time or you'll see something on sale. Check replies to this comment as some have more experience with certain items than I do. Having said that, and having lived on my own for about 6 years getting through college, here's my list...

* **Lamps**. Some have said 3 light sources for your main room is a solid rule.
* **Storage totes/bins**. After awhile, you'll accumulate more then you'll know what to do with.
* If you're a techie, **extra ethernet/USB cables** as well as **extension cords and power strips, notice I said ""strips""**
* **Wet wipes.**
* **Isopropyl alcohol** for everything from cleaning a white board to cleaning a wound, should you need to.
* Darn! You got that small cut on your white undershirt... **hydrogen peroxide** will take the stain right out.
* Some kind of **box** for recycling. (I just use a cardboard box from Sam's Club.)
* **First aide kit**.
* **Screw driver &amp; various bits** as well as a **small tool kit.** - if you're on a budget you can axe the tools first. Although some may disagree with me, your landlord should take care of any maintenance needs. If you want it done NOW though, might be good to have it. Also gives you experiencing fixing something if/when you buy a house.
* Some **window coverings** like curtains or the plastic wrap stuff, if you're paying for your own heat in a cold climate area this will be nice.
* Splurge on the **extra internet speed**, if you can.
* **Extra sheets/blankets/pillows**. Nothings more embarrassing than having someone come over and they need to crash, and you 1.) don't have anything to give them 2.) give them a used blanket/pillow that may have odor that could bother them.
* **CROCKPOT/SLOW COOKER** - countless times it's been nice to come home to a beautiful meal, that was cheap to make, easy to prep, quick to clean up, and made lunch for the next two days.
* **Coffee maker** if you enjoy that. Get a programmable one for a pleasant surprise when you wake up!
* A decent **computer chair**, again if you're on the computer a lot.
* **Plastic roller surface** for your computer chair if you're on carpet. Saves the carpet, you can roll around easier, and if you're in the same place for an number of years help assure you'll get the security deposit back if you can keep the carpet decent.
* **Coffee table.** Didn't think about this one until I realized it's a pain to bend down to the floor to pick up my food.
* For fun... it's always nice to have **board games** (Monopoly is my favorite) and some **yard games** if your apartment is ground level (or you have a community court yard) when you want something different to do.
* If your city ordinance/apartment complex allows, a **grill** is nice to have. Otherwise, a **George Foreman grill** works great too.  
* **Xmas lights**. Wait for those LED's to go on sale and get a few strands. I have some simply tacked up around my wall with thumbtacks. Some argue it's VERY dorm like and not very mature, but there's a reason. My apartment is ground level, and the area is not the best - so this gives me a cheap way to make it feel like someone is home, and also acts as a nice nightlight that doesn't keep me up. 
* **Something alive.** A lot of apartments won't allow pets, but fish are always a go. If you're on your own and need some kind of interaction, sometimes SOMETHING is better than nothing. A turtle, a fish, whatever you can get through the fine print and your lease agreements **so long as you can care for it.** If you're someone who's out and about a lot, perhaps a plant would be a better option - not to say those don't need care, but you won't feel as guilty if you don't water it once in a while. The plant will do wonders for your apartment air stream.
* **Piggy bank** for that spare change, if you're a cash person. Adds up fast, and is nice if you're in a pinch for laundry money. 
* **Night stand** is just plain nice to have and you don't realize how much you'll like one until you're without one. A simple plastic milk cart or piece of plywood on a cinder block works for keeping your phone on, water, ect.
* **Microfiber clothes** act as spectacular dusters, and it'll get dusty fast (esp. if you have a lot of carpeting) so maybe once every other week I wipe down every surface with a cloth. You can get these in packs of 8-10. Washable, although I'd recommend washing them on their own or with a microfiber blanket or something.
* **Vacuum cleaner** - because you'll need one, trust me. I went with some no name bagless thing, and it's worked for me for with a few filter changes.
* **Renter's insurance** - sometimes things just happen. My neighboring complex had a fire, and those without the insurance were left with the clothes on their backs, whereas those who did have insurance got everything from temporary housing, to brand new equipment after filing their claim. I'm sure your results will vary based on who your provider would be, but the $15-25/month is a solid peace of mind. Especially once you've accumulated a good amount of stuff.
* **Britta filter** because sometimes, the water in your new place might just plain old suck. I come from a place where tap water is FANTASTIC, versus the REALLY solid water that has a ton of, well, solids in it. The filter can sometimes be expensive, but if you're making coffee, or cooking things like pasta or boiled items in general, then this can be a god send. Someone replied and said that the containers aren't typically cleaned by the owners, and that faucet filters would be better. The choice is yours.
* **Basic kitchen wears** - you can Google a simple list of kitchen stuffs and use your own judgment on what you may or may not need, but I stocked my entire kitchen from Goodwill. Plates, mugs, basic mixer - the whole gambit. I just cleaned the snot out of them before hand and I think I equipped my entire kitchen for under $25.
* **Some sort of file system** - even if it's just a plastic thing, it's nice to have a central location for important documentation such as copies of your driver's license, social security card, passport, medical paperwork,lease paperwork (tip: sometimes you'll do something that's okay on YOUR SIGNED lease, but the complex updated their lease for new/resigned residents. If you weren't notified, it's always nice to have an original document for reference.) ect. 
* **Art/Posters/Something for walls** - whatever can cover your walls to make it a little more personalized is good. Going overboard/too dark makes the place seem smaller and cluttered. I'm no means an interior designer, but sometimes less is more in this category. Doesn't need fancy shadow box stuff, some tacky putty will do fine as far as keeping them there. Double sided/single sided taped to itself also works.
* **Extra chairs** - these can be fold-able cheap things, but they're nice for sitting on the patio/deck or if you need more seating inside if you're entertaining.
* **Clock** - didn't realize that it's nice to have an atomic clock around. Good for quick checking the date, time, whatever. It's a clock, and you could argue you have one on your phone if you don't want to bother.
* **$1 dustpan/broom** - kitchens typically have tile in them, and render a vacuum difficult to pick up stuff with.
* **Swiffer mop** - does the trick for picking up a floor quickly. Not for big jobs, mostly for that sparkly finish. Someone may disagree with me here, though.
* **Rechargeable batteries** - AA's and AAA's seem to be needed most. Handy if you're using wireless stuff like computer mice, 360 controllers, point'n'shoot (if it's not a lithium ion type) cameras, ect. [Eneloop are apparently best. I got these at Costco for far less. ](http://www.amazon.com/Sanyo-Eneloop-Charger-Rechargeable-Batteries/dp/B003VLAEPQ)
* **Calculator** - your phone and computer both have one but if you're the ""it's time to sit down and crunch some numbers!"" type, then it's handy. Battery or solar powered both work well.
* **Check book** - if you don't yet have your own check book, it's about time to invest in one. My complex, for example, will only take payment via check. Others do it electronically, but it's good for other ventures too.
* **Scissors** - those pull tabs don't always work on food, or for when you get packages. I'm disappointed I just spelled out the NEED for scissors. Oh well.
* Maybe a **pull out sofa/blow up bed** - The pull out sofa is GREAT once it's in place, but they're a pain to move. The blow up bed is a good solution, if you have a lady friend over and want to fall asleep watching a movie in the living room, for instance. Relatively cheap, good for guests, all that stuff.

True,kamajo8991,,,"I think a lot of kids had a goth-phase. I did. I had mine because I went through a dark period when my Mother started drinking because my Step-Dad started to cheat on her. She did nothing but sleep on the couch, drink, smoke and sleep some more. I had to grow up real fast and mother my twin brothers, 5 years younger. So, as a 13 year old, I learned to drive, cook meals, clean the house, take them to school, talk to their teachers, help my brothers with their homework, make our doctor appointments and drive ourselves to them. I ended up having to write the checks out and send them to the companies billing us (for electricity, heat, water, garbage, etc.).

Now, some of you may say ""You should have known how to do this anyway! Learning experiences!"" But it's not. Doing dishes and taking out trash as chores are learning experiences. Tucking your younger siblings into bed because our Mother was too drunk to do it was heartbreaking. ""Sorry, Mom's asleep. I'll read you guys a book, but you gotta go to sleep, we have school in the morning.""

As soon as they were asleep, I went to make their lunches for the next day and I'd always write them a note to make them feel better, since they felt bad that they wouldn't be eating a hot school lunch with the rest of their friends (as 8-12 year olds tend to pick on ""poor"" kids eating cold-lunch instead of hot).

And, I know food is food, but when my mom said ""There's a can of peas in the cupboard, eat those for dinner!"" and rolled back over to sleep, it made me feel awful. I had 3 of us to feed. A can of peas? I ended up making ramen soup with these peas. Added some eggs to it, some spices. My brothers liked it. Made me feel better. 


That's why I had a goth-phase. I felt like a 13-year-old single mother with nobody to love me. I hated my mother for a very long time. But, now, as a mother myself, I suppose it did teach me how to cook, clean and take care of kids, right?

True,Cebus_capucinus,bio,Primatology | Primate Behavior and Infant Handling,"Well there are two main hypotheses, and a third less likely hypothesis. Likely a combination of factors led to their extinction. Local conditions may have also played factor like disease, malnutrition or a particularly harsh season. Sometimes even factors like distance between groups can be enough to cause extinction. If their isn't enough migration between groups then the groups may be too small to flourish. This can be especially hard for k-selected species like humans / Homo species where we usually only produce one offspring every year. If all available females die, or are unable to raise offspring because of bad conditions that could be disastrous for already dwindling populations. Anyway, the two main contributing factors that likely most groups were:

1. Climate change: Neanderthals could not adapt physically or behaviourally to the changing climate, where as humans could. We were more innovative and could rapidly build on old ideas or invent new technologies. On the other hand as far as we can tell Neanderthals were pretty stagnant in terms of culture and ability to innovate.  They had the same tool technologies for hundreds of thousands of years, they had the same hunting techniques, they lived the same kinds of lives and they never migrated out of Europe. If a prey species moved out of their territory they may not have been innovative enough to adapt to new food sources, this may have led to the extinction of certain populations. 

2. Humans out competed them. As we moved into Europe we either extirpated or killed off the Neanderthals. They could not compete with our better tool technologies, our ability to adapt and innovate. Also behaviourally we may have been more cohesive. Humans engaged in trade and even long distance trade, that same type of cohesion between Neanderthals is less evident. So we simply moved into their territory and there wasn't enough room for two highly intelligent species. One had to go. 

3. We mated with them and they blended into our species. This is less likely because we don't know how frequent interbreeding events were or how common encounters between neanderthals and humans were or what the nature of these encounters were generally like (were they aggressive? friendly?). It was probably not ubiquitous for all neanderthal groups. So it is unlikely that their entire population somehow blended into ours. Remember we were very different, both morphologically and behaviourally. It is more likely that we competed for resources then shared them.",0,1356508313,,0,1356511427,1,c7m91ew,t3_15fz98,t1_c7m91ew,t1_c7m8o1c,,1430772854,6,False,askscience,t5_2qm4e,6
True,bangsecks,,,"I think you'd benefit from a quick run down of the ingredients of beer and what each does and how it affects the taste and character of beer.  First is water, obviously, which should be clean and more or less balanced in terms of pH; water can be the simplest thing or very involved when we get into mash temps., residual pH, relative mineral concentrations and other chemical considerations and so on.  For now lets leave it as being simple and not pay it any more attention.

The next ingredient, really at the other end of the dial, is the yeast.  This is a galaxy on its own and really, like the intricacies of water chemistry, best left alone for now.  Just keep in mind that much of the flavor of beer comes from the yeast, which ferment the sugars into alcohol and CO2 and there are two major classes of beer depending on the yeast, lagers and ales.

The other two ingredients, barley and hops, are where we should really concentrate for someone like you.  What are they and what do they do?  Barley is a grain, like wheat or rice or corn or oats, and it's the traditional grain for making beer although others can be used like those just mentioned.  Barley grains are subjected to a few processes to get them to a stage where they can turn all the starch or endosperm into sugar for the yeast to eventually eat and ferment into alcohol.  There are two major types of barley, 2-row and 6-row, quite similar to one another, each of which can be subjected to additional processes to develop flavor characteristics.  This is where I think you might benefit from learning something about the process as it relates to your ability to select a beer you will be likely to enjoy.

First, after barley is malted, that is germinated and then kilned just enough to halt further germination and sprouting, it can be roasted to varying degrees.  Think of a piece of bread; if you eat it straight out of the oven a bit undercooked it will be a bit bland and will taste more like the wheat itself than if you take a slice and then toast it a while.  Once it's toasted it will have that wheat taste but it will also have other tastes, those we associate with toasting, nuttiness, caramel, a little burned and so on.  What if we *really* toasted the bread to where it was nearly blackened?  That would be quite a different taste, bitter and less like wheat.  We can do the same with barley for beer; roast it, like coffee beans, to varying degrees to bring out those different flavors.  The more we do this the darker the grain and the darker the resulting beer.  We can also mix grains of varying degrees of roast together for one beer, a bit of light and bit or dark and so on, to further complicate things.

Once we have our grain, whether not roasted at all and just plain, or roasted to the point of being black, we then have to basically soak the grain in water for some period of time, this is before we actually brew the beer, at some temperature to get the enzymes within each kernel to convert the starches into small sugars the yeast can metabolize.  The different temperatures at which we do this give us different sugar and carbohydrate profiles; the overall temp. window is about 145F to 165F in terms of extremes, the best ranges are about 148F-152F for one type of conversion and about 156F-160F for another type of conversion.  The first type breaks down the starch molecules in such a way so as to give us a very dry beer, in other words it gives us a lot of simple sugars which the yeast can totally convert into ethanol leaving little else behind, while the other type breaks down enough to still give us alcohol but leaves a lot of longer chain sugars which the yeast can't eat but our tongue can still detect slightly as a sugar.  This means that if we do this, mash the barley, at a lower temperature we get a dryer beer and the higher we do it the more sweet and malty a beer we get.

Now, it's important to note that we don't usually do one or the other, we can try to reach a compromise so we get something in between, we might for instance mash somewhere in the middle, say 154F, or we might start low for a while then raise the temperature half way through.  Basically, the point I'm trying to make, is that there are two major barley characteristics, dry and alcoholic and often a bit thin, or sweet, thicker and full of body.  Light beers are often dry and dark beers a bit sweet.

A quick note here returning to yeast; there are two major types of beer which I mentioned before and with which I am sure you're already familiar, lagers and ales.  These are basically the same type of yeast but different strains, although there are some different species altogether in some cases, and these different strains ferment best at different temperatures.  The Bud and Coors and Miller and Michelob you reference are examples of lagers; there's a whole story behind why American macrobeers were and are lagers and where that came from and why ales were the default face of microbrews thereafter, but that's a different story which could take up a lot more room than I'm already doing here, but, basically, these beers are lagers and lagers are beers that ferment at low temperatures and give light, clean flavors.  Ales are more versatile and ferment higher and can be light but can also be dark, like the Guinness you like.  The point here is that there are two major branches of beer depending on the yeast, lager and ale, and a good ale is a dime a dozen, they're easier to make, and a good lager is a bit more difficult, plenty of cheap bad ones out there.  An example of a quality lager is the Sam Adams you mentioned.

Now, on to bitterness, the last ingredient, hops.  Hops are the oil and resin laden glandular buds of *Humulus lupulus*, a plant not too distantly related to the *Cannabis* genus and similarly containing many pungent alkaloids.  These compounds give beer its bitter taste and if treated properly its spicyand often citrus nose and bouquet.  These compounds are called collectively alpha acids and part of the reason beer needs to be brewed, boiled, is to cause a reaction with these acids wherein they change shape slightly and they thereafter gain shelf life and bitter the beer.  Depending on when hops are added to the boil, this well after the barley has been mashed and sugars converted, they give varying degrees of bitterness.  Just as when cooking where you can add your herbs at the beginning and by the end they're all cooked down and not vibrant or add them at the end right before you're done so they stay green and pungent so too do hops retain their flavor the less they're cooked.  So there are two factors where, boiling longer and getting them to bitter the beer or adding them later so they keep the higher notes and aromas, and so we add hops in stages, a bit early on and then a bit later to get the full range of their flavors and aromas.

So, now I'll try and wrap this up into a longish **TR;DR** bite here: two types of beer, lagers and ales, lagers are light and watery, ales can be light but also heavy and dark and everything in between, start you assessment here; next the barley can be mashed in such as way as to be thin and light and high in alcohol or in a way that has more body, more malt character, more of those sugars that your tongue can taste but the yeast can't break down into alcohol; next you can have something low on the hops, just a bit bitter and no hop aroma, or you can have at the other end of the spectrum something very bitter and very aromatic.  These are three main categories, each with two variables, a beer can be anywhere on each data point, find out what you like in each or which combinations and then get beers that fit those profiles.  If you would like I can give some beers that I think are exemplary models that convey the gist of each category and or variable.  And lastly, in addition to these, other flavors can be added to beer, like herbs, spices, chocolate, coffee, fruit and so on; these are outside the normal considerations and should be treated as an after thought.

True,neverfarts,,,"Interesting. I was involved in making a film about this incident a few years ago. We had interviews with the Israeli region commanders and the U.N commanders of the U.N. peace keeping force in Lebanon. The facts that we managed to gather were:

1. The U.N bunker was clearly marked, both the actual structure and on the maps. It has been so since Finland rebuilt it in the late 70's (after it was bombed by Israel in 78).

2. The U.N force was unarmed, and was communicating to the U.N HQ that artillery shells were falling very close to it in the morning of the incident. U.N. HQ contacted the Israel (north) HQ, reported the shelling and demanded they stop.

3. In the next few hours the shells came closer and closer, hitting the U.N bunker and destroying the communication tower.

4. Communication with Israel continued, more demands by the highest ranks (of the U.N force) were made, begging (in the words of U.N. Commander to Lebanon) to stop killing their men. 

5. At 18.00 the shelling stopped. U.N Indian battalion assembled a rescue mission to evacuate the four soldiers from the damaged bunker.

6. As the rescue mission was on its way (~19.00), a communication came from the bunker (iirc, the U.N said it was over a mobile phone, the short-wave radios were destroyed) saying they observe an F16 jet approaching them, ""it fires!"" silence. Further attempts to communicate with the bunker failed.

7. A U.N investigation found that the F16 jet launched a laser-guided ""bunker buster"" JDAM. The bunker was damaged before this from the artillery and was now completely destroyed. It was never designed to stand to such a hit in the first place.

8. Kofi Annan referred to this as ""apparently deliberate attack"".

9. Israel promised an investigation. No one knows if there was one and if yes, what were the findings.

10. Israeli generals involved in the event were interviewed. They claim:

- The pilot entered the wrong coordinates.

- The maps were not updated.

- Hizballah was firing from the vicinity of the bunker.

- The U.N is an enemy of Israel at times of war.

True,thisismymoniker,first time,,"*sigh*

I'm not going to call you names, but I'm not going to give you a high-five, either.

Extramarital sex is all well and fine when all parties involved have given consent. You haven't allowed yourself to feel guilty because being guilty reaps no benefits for you. Being guilty does not release the trifecta of endorphins or the intoxicating wash of oxytocin that dirty, biting, scratching, I'm-going-to-make-you-sore illicit sex does.

Because you don't feel an emotional connection to 'Mary', it is easy to alleviate yourself of perceived guilt and judgement: 

*""I still love and sleep with my wife, and things are good between us. What does it matter if I have secret, no-strings-attached' dirty sex with another woman? It's purely physical. It's not as if I am in love with her and am planning on leaving my wife for her.""*

*""We're just satisfying each other in a way that we can't inside our marriages. In reality, what we're doing is beneficial to our relationships.""* 

In some sense this is a logical train of thought - you may, indeed, be a better and more appreciative lover (physically and emotionally) to your wife because the pressure for her to provide for all of your needs is alleviated. The problem, however, is this: How would your wife feel, were she to find out? 

Would it end your marriage?


Is an emotionless, torrid, lust-driven affair worth destroying your marriage to someone you love, and care about, *and* still have pleasant sex with on a regular basis? Is your *personal need* for 'different' sex more important than the promises you made on your wedding day? Promises that your wife is under the impression you are holding fast to every day because you have remained married to her?

You didn't say that you have any children, and I know you said you aren't emotionally attached to Mary; but consider affects that your actions could have on other people, (instead of just yourself): consider Mary's three children, Mary's husband. They may be much like you and your wife; happy, functional. Is ruining four other people's lives worth an affair that, as you said, lacks emotional connection? Are four other people's lives - five, including your wife - worth how good it makes you feel when you ram Mary in a dirty parking lot after she sucks the residue of your wife's pussy off your cock?


If it is, divorce your wife. Leave Mary alone unless she wants to leave her husband, too. Meet random people off of CL and other online forums, and fuck them until you're blue in the face. Don't talk to your wife ever again. Don't cuddle with her, don't plan holidays with her, don't buy her presents. Don't wish her parents ""Happy Anniversary"" or choke down her sister's horrible lasagna at family gatherings. Take care of all the chores she does yourself. Throw away all the pictures you've taken together, and kiss the memories of concerts, dinners, and nights out goodbye.

Give yourself the chance to experience as much slapping, hitting, biting, name calling, humiliating, dirty, nasty, spontaneous sex as you possibly can, without the restraints or possible risk of hurting others.

Lay in bed, alone, at night, and see how long it takes to 'come down' from an affair. It's not long. And it *never* feels worth it in the long run.

EDIT: more to say:

I think you confessed this for a reason, and I think the reason is that you're bothered as to why there isn't some inarguable road block 'keeping' you from having an affair. You're bothered as to why you haven't felt 'guilty' yet. You're bothered by how easy and rewarding it is while you are simultaneously intoxicated by the power and freedom it gives you. I think you feel like if it was *really* wrong, if it was *really* bad, if you didn't *deserve* the extra pleasure, that you wouldn't be able to do it.

How many criminals sit in jail and think to themselves, ""I really wish I hadn't robbed that store""?

The only thing that will stop you from having an affair is you. You stopped yourself before; were you happy then? 

If yes, why re-complicate things? Why risk everything you have (again)? If you think anything is worth risking the mind and soul of the woman you promised your fidelity and support to when you married her, leave her. Leave her and do your thing.

One more thing before I go. You sleep with both of these women bareback, and maintain that you and Mary both get tested for STDs regularly. What happens when an STD occurs between two tests? Or, what if Mary gets HPV, and you then pass it on to your wife, and [your wife discovers it at her annual gyno visit](http://www.cdc.gov/cancer/cervical/basic_info/screening.htm)? 

What then?

Please think more carefully about what you are doing.

True,edit1754,,QuickPicks Updater Dude,"The Y580 can be a great choice, but not that one. That model is not a good choice, because it is one of the models that comes with the 1366x768 display and not the 1920x1080 display.

If you are looking at the Lenovo Y580, you need to make sure that the model in question comes with the 1920x1080 display and not the 1366x768 display. You should avoid buying any model/version of the Y580 that is equipped with a 15.6"" 1366x768 display and not a 15.6"" 1920x1080 display.

1366x768 resolution in a 15.6"" display make things onscreen large, and 15.6"" displays that have 1366x768 resolution tend to be low-grade LCD panels with very poor image quality due to low contrast. You should make a point to avoid displays like this when it is reasonable to do so, unless you require the larger text for eyesight related reasons.

This is more of an issue than the other differences between various models of the Y580 as well as other laptops. A GT 650M (as opposed to the Y580's GTX 660M) is not a terrible GPU, an i5-3210M (as opposed to the Y580's i7-3630QM) is not a terrible processor, but a 15.6"" 1366x768 display is a terrible display. You should be concerned with improving a display that's pretty bad before you start trying to improve upon performance that's already pretty good. If a 1920x1080-model Y580 fits in your budget, then great. But if it doesn't, then a 1366x768-model Y580 is not an alternative nor a good choice; look at other laptops.

That said, here's a guide to buying the Lenovo IdeaPad Y580:

- Select Windows under Operating System if you cannot acquire your own copy for cheaper.
- Recommended: Matte display upgrade.

**HP DV6t** (NVIDIA GT 650M, 15.6"" 1920x1080 display) - **$749 + tax**

- Saved Configuration: http://www.shopping.hp.com/webapp/shopping/load_configuration.do?destination=review&amp;config_id=7674563
- Apply coupon code **REDTAGPC**
- Don't downgrade the GPU to the GT 630M or to Intel HD 4000 graphics. The GT 650M is considerably faster than either, and if one of the lower GPU options would work just as well for you then I would probably suggest getting an entirely different laptop.
- Don't downgrade the display to 1366x768. The 1366x768 display makes things onscreen large, and is a low-grade LCD panel with very poor image quality due to low contrast. The availability of the upgraded 1920x1080 display is part of why I'm recommending this laptop; I wouldn't be recommending this laptop if it didn't offer it.

True,DiscussionQuestions,,,"1. This stark, elliptical narrative offers very little in the actual way of plot, instead focusing on the setting and mood.  It appears that the only words spoken, beyond the basic interactions between customer and Subway employee, were: ""Do you believe in dragons?""  Do you feel as if the entire narrative were conveyed, or do you still have questions about what occurred?  Did you expand upon the story in your mind, filling in the gaps with your own imagination?  If so, what did you add to the narrative that is not explicitly stated in the text?

True,YearOfTheMoose,,Felagund,"trotro10, these are the main works by Tolkien with regards to Eä, listed in the order which I think that you should read them in:

*The Hobbit*: which is about how Bilbo Baggins goes questing with thirteen dwarves to reclaim a mountain kingdom from a Dragon, and along the way finds a ring. This is the prequel story to *The Lord of the Rings*, and while it is a children's story, it is still delightful to read. 

*The Silmarillion*: This is the history of Arda as told by the Elves. The beginning, called ""The Ainulindalë,"" is about the creation of the world. This can be very dry, but I personally found it wonderful. Then it moves on to ""The Valaquenta,"" which talks about the Valar and Morgoth. Again, it can seem dry, but it's very rewarding. It's like reading about any other pantheon of gods, but more interesting. After that comes the real meat of the book--""The Quenta Silmarillion."" This is where we learn about the shaping of Arda, and Morgoth's fall from grace. The elves are created, and clash with Morgoth, and the First Age of the World begins. It is a tragic account, and does a lot to explain the mood of the elves in *The Lord of the Rings*. Some of the chapters in the Quenta Silmarillion are quite emotional once you've adjusted to Tolkien's writing style. The Quenta is one of my favourite sections of any book. After the Quenta you get to ""The Akallabêth,"" which is a brief account of the History of Númenor. Beyond that is ""Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age,"" which is in turn a brief synopsis of what you've read in *The Lord of the Rings*, but directly tied in to the Quenta Silmarillion. *The Silmarillion* may seem dry, but if you can get past that it is a beautiful work--and the more you learn of Old English/Old Norse mythology, the greater *The Silmarillion* seems.

After that comes *The Unfinished Tales of Númenor and Middle-earth."" This is a collection of random essays and incomplete stories that don't necessarily flow well with any narrative but are fascinating nonetheless. For example, one of the essays is ""Of the Istari,"" and Tolkien describes the Wizards over the course of several pages. One of the incomplete stories (which radically changed my perception of some characters) is ""The Disaster of the Gladden Fields."" It is about said disaster and the death of Isildur. This book has dry moments and exciting moments, but I think that it is still fantastic if you're really interested in getting into the established lore.

*The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien* is a collection of his responses to various letters. It is in this book that we get some of the most particular details about his legendarium, and for that reason this might be my favourite after the masterpiece itself. This book covers pretty much everything, and it's wonderful. It has three hundred and fifty-four letters from him within it.

Next come the twelve tomes of *The History of Middle-earth*. These books can be very dry, as frequently they're very rough, early drafts of Tolkien's ideas, but they are also very rewarding. Christopher Tolkien has his own commentaries at the end of most chapters to explain anything confusing (it would be more helpful if his explanations were not frequently more confusing). 

--*The Book of Lost Tales* Vol. 1 (01) is like an early draft of the first half of *The Silmarillion*. Tolkien presents it in the form of a human being told the tales by an elf, but it is very engaging. He changed many names after this draft, so it can be confusing to switch between this and *The Silmarillion*, but when you get the hang of it it's all fine.

--*The Book of Lost Tales* Vol. 2 (02) corresponds to draft 01 of the second half of *The Silmarillion*. I like this one far more than Volume 01, but that's likely due to the wonderful chapter, ""The Fall of Gondolin."" 

--*The Lays of Beleriand* (03) is a collection of five poems which Tolkien wrote for Eä. Two of these are fairly long (sadly, they are also incomplete): *The Lay of the Children of Húrin* and *The Lay of Leithian*. This book is as fantastic as any other book of long poetry, but more exciting to me personally due to the familiar characters with whom it deals.

--*The Shaping of Middle-earth* (04) is another stage in the development of *The Silmarillion*. It includes a lot of prose fragments which are clearly in transition from *The Book of Lost Tales* and *The Silmarillion* in style. This book deals a lot with the lay of Arda, and we get maps in it (maps are one of life's great joys). 

--*The Lost Road and Other Tales* (05) includes, among other things, an early form of ""The Akallabêth,"" and a story called ""The Lost Road,"" which ties Tolkien's stories to the present. It's in this book that we get a further scholastic/academic look at the various languages of Middle-earth. If you're a linguist, this might be your favourite of the books.

--*The Return of the Shadow* (06) is about the development of *The Fellowship of the Ring*. It's mostly a collection of prose fragments and notes which Tolkien left for himself, and it's exciting to see how the story developed into the narrative which we now know and love.

--*The Treason of Isengard* (07) is the corresponding book with regards to the development of *The Two Towers*

--*The War of the Ring* (08) is the corresponding book with regards to the development of *The Return of the King*. **Note:** This book also includes an ultimately-rejected epilogue to *The Return of the King.* Sam answers questions which his children have about his adventures. This never made it to the final draft of *The Lord of the Rings*, but it is well worth reading anyway.

--*Sauron Defeated* (09) is a further look at the events of the War of the Ring, but also goes back to talk a bunch about Númenor and its fall. We get a look at Adûnaic, which is the language of Númenor. It's a very exciting book.

--*Morgoth's Ring* (10) might be my favourite of these books. It includes a lot of prose which is fairly consistent with *The Silmarillion*, along with some essays which Tolkien wrote. Most excitingly, it includes a dialogue between Galadriel's brother and a mortal woman with regards to death, healing, and the afterlife. It is absolutely *fascinating*.

--*The War of the Jewels* (11) is a very analytic and interesting book addressing the later stages of preparing *The Silmarillion*. It also includes more prose accounts that couldn't be fit into said book. To my great delight, it also has an essay about the Eagles and the Ents and how they fit into everything. 

--*The Peoples of Middle-earth* (12) is the final volume of *The History of Middle-earth*. It establishes a lot about the writing of *The Lord of the Rings* and *The Akallabêth*. We also get more essays on linguistics, and some on more controversial subjects like Glorfindel and Círdan. At the end there are two short stories which Tolkien abandoned fairly quickly. One is about Aragorn's son, and the other is about Númenórean colonization from the perspective of one of the Wild Men. 


*The Children of Húrin* is essentially one of the stories from within *The Unfinished Tales of Númenor and Middle-earth* but within its own binding. It has been expanded to a small degree, but by-and-large it is redundant from the latter book (though I'll be the first to admit that I own both and am happier for it). There are new details to be found within it, and it looks awesome, so it's worth your time.

Tolkien also wrote a number of other books which are mostly unrelated to Eä. I'll just list the titles rather than explaining them, but I greatly enjoyed reading them all:

--*Farmer Giles of Ham*

--*Roverandom*

--*Leaf by Niggle*

--*The Adventures of Tom Bombadil*

--*Tree and Leaf*

--*The Road Goes Ever On*

--*Smith of Wootton Major*

--*The Father Christmas Letters*

--*Mr. Bliss*

--*Songs for the Philologists*

--*The Lay of Aotroun and Itroun*

--*The Homecoming of Beorhtneoth Beorhthelm's Son*

--*The Lay of Sigurd and Gudrún* (This is my absolute favourite thing 
which he has written which is unrelated to Eä)

He also did a lot of academic work, like translating *Sir Gawain and the Green Knight* from Old English, but I won't list them here.

So, that should give you an idea of what to read from Tolkien and why. I can only hope that your adventure through his writing is as enjoyable as my own has been. Everything which I've listed here is absolutely worth every minute you spend reading it...I think one of the reasons why I enjoy Tolkien's works so much is that even outside of fiction it stands up so well. His essays are fascinating, and his translations are excellent. ",0,1356540554,,0,False,1,c7mcyft,t3_15f6ej,t1_c7mcyft,t3_15f6ej,,1430774760,17,False,tolkienfans,t5_2r6jm,17

Early Reddit was an environment friendly towards tech geeks who wanted something more indepth than slashdot or HN.  As such, it attracted erudite geeks.  Middle Reddit was an environment friendly towards thinkers and seekers who were looking for discussion beyond what was available on the archetypal PHPBBs, news outlet comment sections and, notably, Digg.  As such, it attracted thinkers and seekers.  Late Reddit is an environment friendly towards image macros and memes.  As such, it attracts ineloquent teenagers.

Something Reddit did early on, under Alexis and Steve, was curate content.  They very much seeded the site with the sorts of content they wished for it to have.  Once the content took over for itself, they had a nice, successful little site that reflected their interests which they sold to Conde Nast.  From that point forth they grew keenly disinterested in the site and established the current culture of ""hands off at all costs.""  You will certainly get a robust ecosystem if you do this, but it might not be what you're looking for.

Australia had one of the most diverse ecosystems on the planet prior to the arrival of Aborigines.  Now it has dingos and kangaroos.  New Zealand had an impossibly diverse ecosystem prior to the arrival of Europeans, who brought their cats.  Kiwi can't compete with cats.  The American Southeast is a great environment for Kudzu.  The Pacific Northwest is a great environment for English Ivy.  Etc. Etc. Etc.

The bottom line is that if you want an herb garden with diversity, you need to keep the mint from taking over.  If you want an herb garden that takes care of itself, don't bother planting anything but mint because after a couple years it'll be the only thing left.

Here is a brief article from a friend who has a degree in economics (mine is in history)

MARXISM, IN A NUTSHELL

For the past few months I’ve been studying and reading Karl Marx’s most important work: Capital (Das Kapital). This thing is enormous. It’s three volumes, containing over 2000 pages. In it Marx attempted to figure out and explain how capitalism ‘works’… What he came up with is fascinating. It is a very detailed and intricate analysis.

While Marx is commonly known for being the “father of communism” the reality is that his major accomplishment is his examination of capitalism. In fact, this may surprise you, Marx never wrote about how communism ‘works,’ which is kind of strange for someone that is considered the father of it.

Unfortunately, there is such a negative stigma attached to Marx that we, as a society, are missing out on a very interesting perspective for understanding capitalism. 

In this post, I will lay out the essence of what Marx was trying to tell us about capitalism. His book Capital is much, much, much more intricate and detailed. But the following is the big picture.

Enjoy…

…

Throughout all of human history there is something that happens, no matter what kind of society, no matter when in human history, that we as humans fail to appreciate, consider and integrate into how we understand the world we live in: some people use their brains and their body to transform nature in a useful way, i.e. they do work, and some people do not. The easiest and most simple example is babies. They are not doing work. Often elderly people do not work. Very sick people do not work. Sometimes people who can work, i.e. they are mentally and physically capable of doing work, also do not work. 

This raises a question: how is it possible for people who do not work to survive?

In order for it to be possible for some people to not work and also survive, be it a baby or a capable adult, it must be true that those who do work, produce more stuff than they themselves consume. Otherwise, the people who do not work would die. 

For each person that works, the produce of their work that goes to maintaining themselves, Marx calls Necessary Labor, and the produce of their work that they do not consume themselves, Marx calls Surplus Labor.

So, Marx asks: how does any given society decide 1) who will work, how will they work, and how much of what they produce will go to them… 2) who will not work, but live off of the surplus labor of those who do work, and how much will they get? 

Marx says that how a society decides to deal with this issue shapes the society in various ways: culturally, politically, economically, etc… and if we don’t recognize how this shapes society, we are missing a very important part of understanding how and why our society is the way it is.

Again: who works, who doesn’t, how much of the produce does each group get, and how is that decided. 

Marx breaks the history of humans down into 5 types of arrangements based on how the Surplus is distributed to those who do not produce it. 

1)) Communism – a community or a group of people work together, and they produce a surplus, maintain it, and themselves distribute it to those that do not work. 

For example, if a group of us grow some food, and we have more than we are going to consume, we decide how to distribute the extra.

2)) Ancient – the work is not done not by a group of people, but by individuals alone. This would be someone that is self-employed, and produces stuff on his or her own. 

For example, if I grow some food, and I have more than I am going to consume, I decide how to distribute the extra.

At this point, Marx makes a distinction. The following three types of arrangement have something in common that is different than the first two, and it is this: the people who do the work that produces the surplus are not in control of the surplus that they produce, and therefore are not in control of distributing it. Marx calls these systems exploitative. The producers of the surplus are exploited, and all this means is that the producers of the surplus do not maintain and distribute the extra.

3)) Slave – if the work is done by a person or a group of people and none of what that person or the group produces belongs to them. What they produce is maintained and distributed by the slave owner.

For example, if a slave produces some food, the slave owner decides how much the slave gets, how much the slave owner gets, and how to distribute the extra.

4)) Feudalism – the work is done by a serfs, and some of the time is spent producing what is for them, and some other amount of time is spent producing what then belongs to the feudal lord. The lord maintains and distributes the surplus.

For example, if a serf produces some food, some of the food belongs to the serf, and the rest belongs to the feudal lord, and the feudal lord decides how to maintain and distribute the extra.

5)) Capitalist – the work is done by wage or salary earners, and they do not control, maintain, or distribute the surplus that they produce. They receive a wage or salary, and all of what they produce belongs to the capitalist/owner. 

For example, if some workers grow some food, they are paid a wage or salary equivalent to some of that food, but importantly not all of it, and the capitalist maintains control of and distributes the surplus/extra.

Marx claims, I think correctly, there is only one reason why a capitalist/owner/employer would pay a worker a wage or salary, and that is if he or she is going to get more out of the worker than the value of what worker contributes during his or her working hours. 

...

What’s interesting is this relationship, between the capitalist/employer and the worker/employee, is that it is closest to the slave/slave owner relationship. Hence why sometimes capitalism is referred to as wage-slavery. They are certainly not the same, but strangely they are more similar to each other than the capitalist and the ancient is. (again, ancient refers to self-employed)

Here’s an irony: in our modern day capitalist America, the American Dream for a lot of people is to be self-employed. According to Marx, self-employment is NOT capitalism. It is the “ancient” form of production. Capitalism, on the other hand, is a relationship where someone (a capitalist), pays someone else (a worker), to do work for them, and in this relationship the worker contributes MORE than they receive in the form of a wage or salary. It is precisely in paying workers less than they contribute that the capitalist/owner is able to make a profit. 

The common objection to this Marxist perspective is: “But the capitalist/owner is risking his or her own money in the business, so they have to receive a profit, or why else would they invest their money in starting a business.”

Indeed, I don’t think Marx would disagree. That's how capitalism 'works'...

This is Marx's FUNDAMENTAL insight of capitalism: the profits of capitalists/owners come from the exploitation of workers, i.e. paying them less than the value they contribute to the business. 

This raises an interesting question: is what’s best for our ‘Job-Creators’ in America (capitalists/owners)... also what’s best for the majority of Americans who live on wages and salaries?

Is it any wonder that Marxism is a taboo subject in America? What if Marxism becomes common knowledge, and workers start thinking to themselves: do we really need the capitalists/owners? Could we collectively run businesses and make decisions as groups, i.e. communally (communist)? If so, wouldn't we then get the full value of what we contribute in our working hours?

EDIT: How did this blow up after 3 weeks?

Now I see...even though they gave the wrong redditor credit for it in the post...it's all good


EDIT 2: Thanks for the Reddit gold! I love these discussion and would love to reply to all of you but there is just too much here...I can't even read everything. I enjoy hearing your thoughts whether pro or con. 


EDIT 3:


MARXISM, IN A NUTSHELL (continued…)

Hello Everyone. I wrote the Marxism, In a Nutshell piece. My friend posted it here on Reddit. This is amazing how many of ya’ll are interested in Marx. It’s really great. Marx has some very interesting things to tell us. Unfortunately hundreds of comments are too overwhelming to even begin responding to some of you. But there are a few things I want to make clear and I guess a few things I’ll just say…

[1] For full disclosure: MARXISM, IN A NUTSHELL is not 100% original by me. When I wrote it, it wasn’t intended for a mass audience so I did not cite where I was paraphrasing. The section between the two sets of three dots ( … ) is the framework that Richard Wolff uses in his talks. Youtube him. He is a very interesting Marxist economist. The writing before and after ( … ) is 100% my commentary. I used the dots to note to myself where I was directly borrowing from someone else and where I was wasn’t.

[2] The piece is NOT a summary of Marx’s book Capital. That book is far more complex, intricate and specific. The piece IS my general impression of Marx’s ‘main point’ i.e. what he was telling us about Capitalism if it was to all be distilled down to around 1000 words. Again, this is it (in my opinion): the way capitalism ‘works’ is through the exploitation of labor by capitalists, where exploitation means the maintenance and distribution of the Surplus created by labor. Very much simplified. HOW it all happens is laid out in much much much more detail by Marx in Capital.

Also, a lot of people go into a frenzy over the word exploitation. They get very defensive of capitalism. Settle down. Marx is just describing how he understands that Capitalism ‘works’ … and it does not in and of itself say whether some other system (e.g. Communism) is better or worse. It could be that capitalist exploitation is the best system we can come up with for promoting general welfare and technological innovation, etc. Maybe. Maybe not. That's what's interesting about economics!

[3] David Harvey.

Along with the above mentioned Richard Wolff is another very interesting and informative Marxist named David Harvey. Youtube him. If you’re honestly interested in Marx’s Capital and haven’t read it, you’re in luck!..

David Harvey does a lecture series called Reading Marx’s Capital. If you youtube or google it you will be able to find it. It’s worth listening to on its own. You’ll get even more out of it if you read Capital along with it, as he suggests that you do.
Again, if you’re interested in Marxism: look up Richard Wolff and David Harvey. If they don’t stir up your fascination, then I reckon it's time you move on to some other topic that does interest you.

[4] Lastly, one commenter on here clearly has read Capital. This is that person's comment:

“You've certainly done a good job of describing some of the themes included in Capital. However, and as you stated, the first volume alone is over 1,200 pages long. Thus, although you're certainly justified in your complaint about Marx's work having been distilled into a ""communist rant,"" your comment really obscures some very important themes. First, you left out a discussion (or summary) about the differences between exchange value and use value. This discussion is incredibly important (especially Marx's discussion of the fetishization of the commodity), as it establishes the foundation of Marx's critique of capitalism. Second, you ignore Marx's description of variable capital and constant capital. This discussion is especially important for those who want an historical analysis of how the industrial revolution exacted further pressure upon the work force. Third, Marx's discussion of how unemployment tends to reduce the bargaining power of the worker (Marx calls the pool of unemployed people the ""reserve army of labor""). Fourth, one cannot leave out of their summary of Capital the concept of primitive accumulation of capital (which Marx refers to as the ""original sin"" whereby the capitalist-relation is begun (it involves wealthy aristocrats expropriating the peasants' land and forcing them into the factories). Finally, one of Marx's most important concepts (at least as regards Volume 1) is the tendency for the rate of profit to decline: the idea that as a market becomes saturated, the rate by which profit is made tends to decline--forcing capitalists to constantly find new markets in which to sell their commodities. I do not mean to insult you with this comment; only to suggest that any summary of Capital, no matter how small or off the cuff, should include mention of the above concepts. It's these concepts that truly make Marx's thinking unique and useful. Finally, if you're discussing Marx (and Capital) as a foundation for social action (where you wrote ""What if Marxism becomes common knowledge, and workers start thinking to themselves), you should include a portion of the subsequent thinkers who revised some of Marx's ideas to better fit the post mid-19th century world. Recommended reading might include Rosa Luxemburg, Antonio Gramsci, Frank, Wallerstein, Samir Amin, and (contemporary writer) Noam Chomsky. Thesewriters have made important contributions to, and corrections of, Marxist thinking.”
If you take the time to read Capital then you will understand what this commenter is talking about… i.e. the Nuts and Bolts of HOW Capitalism ‘works’…

Needless nit picking at someones appearance is just mean, and it's bullying. Why potentially risk hurting someone for your own amusement? Perhaps some people here need to grow up.

True,NoAttentionAtWrk,,,"Finally something that I can help with ! 

You need to understand that to keep a converstaion going, you need to be a *good listener*. That word is thrown around a LOT but what I mean by a good listener is **NOT** that you just sit there and listen to whatever anyone has to say but what you need to do is really listen!

Let me explain the difference : the difference being that when someone says a line you make mental notes of different things.(**very very important - I'll get back to this point**) Then from within those things, pick up one and ask something about that. Repeat the same thing with whatever reply you get from the person. 

Every now and then add to the conversation. Share your own *related* story/thought/experience related to what you are talking about. That keeps the conversation from becoming an interview.

Almost everyone does this naturally (yes, even most of the socailly awkward), but what you need to do to keep conversation from dying out are just 3 simple things :

* **Avoid simple yes/no questions, one word reply questions or questions you reply with ok.** Avoid them as much as you can ! these are conversation killers ! specially when the other person is not as talkative. Dont ask them unless you have something else you can go on about even with a one

* **Never EVER reply with a one word reply when asked something.** Those are conversation killers. Since the other person doesnt have much to go on about, they might not be able to reply (remember : they have probably not read this wall of text that I am typing, they might not conciously know what they are doing when they are having a conversation with you/anybody). Eventually what happens is even though they are as interested in carrying on the conversation, it turns into an awkward sielnce. If you are asked something that can only be answered in a one word reply, follow up with a question / statement.

Example:

    ABC : Are you still friends with XYZ

    You : no.

&gt;end of conversation because you didnt add anything here

    ABC : Are you still friends with XYZ

    You : No. We fell out of touch when we started different colleges;
         I went to &lt;some place&gt; and he went &lt;somewhere else&gt;. 
         Facebook is where we mainly keep in touch. I heard he got married recently. 

&gt; you added something to the conversation and bam! you have something new to talk about!. like ""you know who else got married?""

* remember those **mental notes** that I was talking about? Those are THE MOST important tool for keeping any conversation alive. **If nothing else, read this!** When a person says something you have to pick up on the important phrases that they mention. Keep those in mind and pick one of those to continue on the conversation. DO NOT FORGET the other points that the person mentions. These are your go back to points when you dont have conversation flowing with your previous point. 

So, for example, if someone mentions they went to college in a different state, you now have 2 things that you can take your conversation forward on. One that they lived in that state and second that they went to college. 

Say, you pick up on the state You can talk about how it was like living in that state, if the person worked there or how did they handle their finances without work. etc etc etc. 5 mins into this conversation (where you are still picking up more phrases the entire time) you find that you are approaching that awkward silence phrase (we all can tell if it is coming in, even though if you start to follow this, you'll probably avoid this phase for a long time). When you are about to get to that phase, look at your list. You now know that this person went to college in a state, worked for a bit managed mostly on his parents money. All the things you haven't talked about ! ask him which subjects did he take? were the professors any good? what was the craziest thing that he did in college ? where did he work? what was it working like over there? you'll start a completely different thread of that conversation. Add a few of your own thoughts/ opinions / (occasional) jokes into the mix. Tell them where you lived all your life. How it was like growning up there etc. 

Dont make the convesation about yourself too much, concentrate on the other person. Everyone loves talking about themselves - specially the ladies. No guy or girl, young or old, ever complained that they had a boring conversation with someone cos they only talked about themselves.

Another example :

    You : So where are you from ?

    Person A : &lt;XYZ City&gt; 

    You : Born and brought up there ?

&gt; you avoided a potantially conversation killer, a one word answer, by asking a related open ended answer.

    Person A : No, I was born in ABC town but then moved to &lt;DEF&gt; for college 
        and then moved here after working in &lt;RST&gt; city for a while.

&gt; That one line was a potential goldmine! you know ABC town, college, DEF city, first jobin RST city, RST city, XYZ city. What was the person doing there, how was the place, what made them move, etc etc etc. pick one of these and start! then come back to this and continue a different thread. Throw a few non offensive jokes in the mix and the other person would have a fun time and they'll try to make sure the convo doesnt die out too!

**People LOVE talking about themselves.** It gives thier experiences a third party validation. It puts them back in the good times mode or reduces their stress. End result is always the same. The person would want to talk to you more.

Additional Notes :

* Fake enthusiasm in wanting to hear the other person. If the other person senses that you are interested in knowing about something they'll talk more. If they sense you are just asking for the sake of asking they are going to stop talking.

* Body language and expressions - read up on body language and figure out how to fake interest (things like slightly lean in, smile, nod occasionally). Laugh with the other person as hard as they are laughing even if you didnt find the joke as funny as the story teller.

* Always remember : Sometimes it is okay not to say anything. There is the awkward silence and then there are the perfectly acceptable, sometimes short, sometimes long non-awkward silence which is like a break you both would need in between conversations. For example : if you are both travelling in a car for say 4-5 hours. It can be okay to just take a few minutes every now and then and observe the view around you. Point something interesting out and you can continue the conversation.

* This is amazingly effective in one on one conversations but a variation can be applied when talking to a group of people. You need to be able to dail it back a notch with asking questions (let othes chip in) and you need to get better at keeping track of different things that different people are talking about. When find out similarities between 2 thigns that 2 people said, point it out (not abruptly) with a joke/question 
say something like 

&gt;Person A : blah blah blah ""so after that I **lived in LA** for about 2 years"" 

&gt;*random convo*

&gt; Person B : blah blah ""I went to college in UC**LA**"" blah blah

&gt; You : oh you went to UCLA ? is that how you two met ? while *person A* was living in **LA** and you went to college there?

* By the way you cannot have a script for a conversation with anyone. You can start every other conversation with a few selected lines (""interesting weather"" ""where are you from"" ""funny thing that happened today"") and you can try to stear the conversation into a direction but you cannot have the exact same conversation with everyone because no 2 people would reply with the exact same thing every time.


TL;DR : you wont gain anything by reading the summary. read the whole darn thing !


If you need some help in practicing - just ask.

Nick Warren is still going strong (I just saw him here in Melbourne a few weeks ago and he was excellent). There is a solid compilation series called Balance that's worth getting into - Nick Warren did Balance 018, released about a year ago. It's readily available via retail and online and is a solid two disc mix. Also in the same series and likely to appeal (in no order):

Joris Voorn Balance 015 - a master class in mixing a large number of tracks together with solid flow

Henry Saiz Balance 019 - Haunting, groovy, deep disco prog

James Holden Balance 005 - almost nine years old now, but if you're wondering what you missed while you were away, this is one of the high points of the past decade in progressive, still sounds fresh

Anthony Pappa Balance 006 - You may have missed progressive breaks as a genre, which peaked in 2003-2005. If you did, this mix is your make-up assignment. The same big basslines and complex melodic structures as straight-up prog, but with more complex, syncopated, breakbeat-driven rhythm. This is where prog briefly went after traditional progressive crawled up its own arse and tried to kill the rest of us by boredom ten years ago. (I blame Creamer &amp; K)

Danny Howells is still doing his thing and is quite solid. My go-to Danny Howells is still GU027 Miami, which has been around a while but (having just fired it up here while writing this) is a great mix if you're looking to fill in the gaps in your history. Lots of the tunes in this mix I still play in my sets (e.g. Olaf Pozsgay - Like a Virgin).

Sasha's still kicking goals, he plays here in a few weeks' time. He has made two compilations worth catching up with - the prog/breaks Involver (2004), and the more indie-prog Invol2ver (2008) - with a third to be released very shortly. 

Digweed has at least another 20 years left in him if the quality of his current work is any indication. He's just released a 4CD live mix set called ""Live in London"" which is very live sounding and very good. His 2010 Essential Mix for BBC's Radio One is solid and easy to find online. Other essential mixes worth checking out include those by Seth Troxler and Robert Babicz. 

On the trance side, trance and prog have after a period of divergence merged much more closely in recent years (thanks in part to the likes of Deadmau5, Cosmic Gate and Martin Roth). The good news for us old folks is that the BPMs have dropped significantly over the past ten years, meaning less bang-bang-bang and more melodic groove. For trance, Above &amp; Beyond are at the top of the pile to my ears. Tiesto has gone weird, Armin Van Buuren has gone commercial, and PVD has gone stale. 

For an optional make-up assignment on where trance has been, listen to Above &amp; Beyond's Essential Mix from 2004, which I would put forward as the high point of trance for the mid-2000s and still worth a listen. Sticking in the present day, however, I'd check out Above &amp; Beyond's weekly podcast called ""Group Therapy Radio"", starting with Episode 4, the one with the Guy J guest mix. They have a record label called Anjunabeats, and it too is very strong (see for example the recent Anjunabeats compilations, e.g. Anjunabeats 9)

Speaking of Guy J, he is a (relative) newcomer within the Sasha/Digweed orbit with excellent potential. Check out his soundcloud page here https://soundcloud.com/guy-j. In terms of additional new names to check out, I'd start with Luke Porter. He played at Bedrock a few months ago, check it out here: https://soundcloud.com/lukeporter/luke-porter-live-bedrock

As far as where to listen to this stuff? As you can see Soundcloud is the best place to start - sign up (its free for a basic account) and start following the people you like, you'd be amazed what comes up. It's a mix of single tracks and mixes, some downloadable some not, but definitely give it a dig. (shameless plug - this is me: https://soundcloud.com/mbelleghem)

Podcasts are big too, get on them for lots of good free fresh music. iTunes sells a lot of the retail mixes and is DRM-free, and of course this being the internet there are also dodgy ways to get music too. Keep in mind, however, that over the past ten years it has become exceedingly hard to make a living as an underground dance musician. Between internet downloading and the demise of vinyl as a mainstream DJ format, artists have been squeezed both ways - so buy your music wherever you can, and even better, support the DJs you like by going to see them when they're in your town! :)

These are of course just my opinions but hopefully give you a good starting point. source: been listening to music for a while.

True,[deleted],,,"Okay, guy, let me educate you.

If you're going to be making snowmen around here, you need to be taught the proper technique.

What I'm seeing so far is you clumping the snow down like some savage. When you live in a country with snow, you don't do that shit (this is coming from a guy who lived 6 years in Ukraine and 10 years in Canada). 

So, what's the proper way to make a snowman? Well, the technique for making each piece is the same, but with different amounts of snow. 

First, you take a nice big handful of that white stuff and you clump it in your hands until you make a snowball. Easy, right? Fuck you. It takes practice. You got your snowball? Cool (no pun intended). Now put that shit on the ground and roll it in more snow like you're a motherfucking dung beetle. Continue rolling until the ball is precisely the size you want.  Continue until you have the 3 you need. The optimal ratio is 3/3, 2/3, and 1/3, but variations are possible. 

Now you just put them together, right? FUCK NO. Are you mad or something? You just rolled those balls all over the dirty ground, you animal. We need to do some maintenance, get those balls ready for Friday night. Pick them up and inspect them individually for swigs/dirt/yellow snow. Afterwards smooth them up all over to get rid of all rolling bumps/holes. Now you have your 3 perfect snowballs ready to be put together. You're a classy gentleman, so I won't explain how to put one on top of the other.

Once you got that all done, it's time for all of the accessories. You start with the arms: ideally, you want to find sticks that are roughly the diameter of the largest snowball in the snowman. Next, you go for the face: now, there's a lot of leeway in how you can make a face, the classics include leaves, rocks, sticks, and, of course, the carrot; but if you're feeling really good about the size of your member you can use food colouring, store-bought fish bowl rocks, or various grocery items. Other accessories are up to you: hats/scarves/shoes/gloves are all recommended as long as you don't give a fuck about them.

Welcome to civilization, young one.

True,xish077,,,"Okay so I can’t find my list, I think it’s in storage, so I’m just going to ramble for a bit and hope I don’t leave anything out. Obviously I think we can all agree that we want effective items that are as small and lightweight as possible. When it comes to first aid in a survival scenario I think the most common issues we might have to deal with are (1) Bleeding Control, (2) Infection Prevention, (3) Allergic Reaction and (4) Preexisting Illness. 

As a medic I can deal with a larger scope of issues because of my training and access to equipment. EVERY PIECE OF INFORMATION I AM ABOUT TO GIVE YOU IS CASUAL OPINION. Please do your own research. For those trained in basic first aid, that is a HUGE edge to have in a survival scenario. So I'm just going to cover the ""save your fucking life"" basics because it’s better than dying. 

(1) Bleeding Control - We have a shitload of sayings in EMS but a good one for anyone to remember is ""Blood goes round and round, air goes in and out, any variation of this is a bad thing."" 
On the subject of blood, another good saying is “If it’s wet and sticky, and not yours, DON’T TOUCH IT.” 

-GLOVES. Buy one box of [gloves]( http://emsstuff.com/diamond-grip-latex-gloves-100-bx-by-microflex.html), pull out a couple of pairs, and pack them in your bag. I prefer the diamond grip latex, they come up past your wrist and can withstand the abuse of the work we do. I have gloves rip while trying to life a backboard or stretcher. Those diamond grips are GREAT for traumas. I know the black ones on that website look SUPER cool, and they really are pretty badass, but my big issue with them is that you can’t see blood on them very easily. So if you happen to stick your hand in a patient’s gaping leg wound and then touch a piece of equipment without changing your gloves, you have now fucked everything up and gotten blood in places it didn't need to be. Fuck that shit. 

-[MASKS](http://emsstuff.com/biohazards-safety/infection-control/fold-flat-n95-respirator-mask-10pk-by-tronex.html). Who knows what kind of pathogens and bacteria will plague our failing system during a survival situation. Protect yourself. An N95 mask is also a very good idea. It is the best protect against airborne pathogens. Forget those piece of shit surgical masks. You want an N95 and you want it to uncomfortably fit your face. It should be snug and it is NOT a pleasure to wear for an extended period of time. These are the masks we use around TB patients. They come in S, M, L. Do your research, get your size. They make ones that come individually sealed and flat, then open up like a duckbill. Ideal for go bag storage and you can reuse them. Moving right along with the bleeding issues….

- [QUIKCLOT!](http://emsstuff.com/quikclot-1st-response.html) Get it. Or any variation of it. It is a homeostatic agent and will work to clot large, uncontrollable bleeds. We are talking arterial bleeds. That shit is spurting like a garden house across the room type of bleed. It is not easy to control those, even with bandages and pressure, and you could die in MINUTES due to excessive blood loss. Grab some QuikClot and just shove it right into the wound. Literally just take your hand and SHOVE it wherever you think the bleeding is coming from. Directions are on the package. Lightweight, small. 

-GAUZE. It comes in all shapes, sizes and thicknesses. There are 4x4s, 5x9s, 8x10s and [10x30s](http://emsstuff.com/10-x30-multi-trauma-dressing.html) (we refer to the 10x30s as “Oh Shit Bandages” because when you need one of those, your saying “OH SHIT!”) For your run of the mill laceration, a 5x9 is my personal favorite. Its large enough to cover the whole wound, thick enough to control some moderate bleeding and it’s not made like a piece of cheesecloth.  I keep a couple of 5x9s and 2 oh shit bandages. The benefit to the 10x30s is they can be cut into smaller pieces if needed, and part of the package they come in is plastic and if left unopened, STERILE! So it actually doubles as a sterile occlusive dressing, which is ideal for large open wounds (gun shots, abdominal trauma, etc). If you manage to control a bleed, no matter the type, it would be wise to cover it with that sterile piece of packaging then tape it on all 4 sides. Keeps out the germs while on the go.

- [TAPE!](http://emsstuff.com/durapore-hypoallergenic-tapes-by-3m.html) Get medical tape. GOOD medical tape. The bigger the better because you can always rip it down to size. Medical tape rips fairly easily, like duct tape and sticks well even to hairy or sticky surfaces. 

-[CLING](http://emsstuff.com/sterile-conforming-gauze-all-sizes-12-bx.html).  Commonly referred to as “roller gauze.”  This is pretty much an alternative to tape, but you can wrap it circumferentially around the area of the wound. It is good for pressure dressings as well if you are familiar with those. If your wound is oozing through a piece of gauze, you don’t want to remove the original piece and rip the site open again (therefore compromising any clotting that was actually happening), just throw another piece of gauze on top and wrap some cling around it. It’s pretty nifty shit and it weights next to nothing. 

-TOURNIQUETS!  As a tactical medic, these are GOLD. I carry 6 of them on my persons during missions and training. I prefer [CAT](http://combattourniquet.com/). They are easy to apply with one hand, making them ideal for self application if needed. It used to be said that prolonged tourniquet application would be more detrimental to the extremity due to increased cellular death, nerve damage, vascular compromise, etc. Recent studies have shown that in most cases prolonged application (by prolonged I mean a couple of hours) has no detrimental effect to the limb. With that said, tourniquets are more or less the ""stop gap"" from battlefield to operating room. Having them in a survival setting is a better option than bleeding to death in 5 minutes, but definitive care is a NECESSITY. You can't just run around sporting a tourniquet on your arm or leg for the next couple of years. So that is something to keep in mind, but it is a great item for any go bag nonetheless. 

Most important thing.....ALWAYS SAVE ONE FOR YOURSELF! The last thing you want is to have 6 of your buddies get shot, then YOU take a bullet, and say ""fuck, I didn't even like that last guy."" 


(2) Infection Prevention  

An infection is going to kill you.  Manage your bleeding correctly, dress your wounds well, and CLEAN THAT SHIT OUT. 
WASH YOUR HANDS OFTEN IF POSSIBLE. 
PACK HAND SANITIZER!!!!!!! Fuck. That shit is gold. 
If you have an injury site, wound, skin tear, WHATEVER, keep that shit clean. Hydrogen peroxide works, but that can be cumbersome to carry. Alcohol Prep Pads and Iodine Prep Pads are good shit. Google it. I think it’s easier than carrying a bottle.  

CLEAN IT WELL, CLEAN IT OFTEN. Apply new bandages if you have. 
BE FAMILIAR WITH THE SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF AN INFECTION. If the area is RED &amp; HOT, that’s bad. If the entire human is WET &amp; HOT that’s worse. If you have leftover antibiotics (which you shouldn't, because you are suppose to finish the WHOLE DOSE) find out what they are commonly used for. 

For example, Keflex is used for different infections than Doxycycline. Some antibiotics are used for skin infections, some for respiratory infections, some for blood infections, etc.
Be familiar with the dosage of that antibiotic. Some you take 3 times a day for a 10 day course, others are once a day for a 7 day course. Figure your shit out. 

Research FISH antibiotics. If it’s good enough for them, it’s good enough for us. Read the forums on it, make your own decisions. I keep Fish Amoxicillin because it can be used for a wide range of infections and is cheap as shit. Look into it.

True,xish077,,,"(3) Allergic Reaction – I noticed a lot of talk about EpiPens. If you have a known allergy, and you have your own EpiPen, FANTASTIC! People who have EpiPens usually have a very bad Anaphylactic reaction to something. Either bee stings, peanuts, shellfish, etc.
Epinephrine is a crazy thing. Its naturally occurring in your body. It’s adrenaline.  Ya know, that shit they stabbed Uma in the chest with.  Epi is just a fucking nutty drug. Here is just a basic summary. 

Your body has a CENTRAL nervous system which is comprised of 2 parts. (I am not trying to be condescending, just some info for those interested)

Sympathetic and Parasympathetic.  An easy way to remember……

Sympathetic Nervous System is your FIGHT OR FLIGHT. 

Parasympathetic Nervous System is FEED OR BREED. 

Your body cant effectively run away from an angry bear if your shitting yourself. (Literally pooping while your running). 

When you panic, that is epi. Increased heart rate, flushing of the skin, increased oxygen demand (especially for your heart), blah blah blah blah blah. Your body is smart enough to say HEY, I don’t really need all that awesome blood flow in my GI system right now because I am being CHASED BY A FUCKING BEAR, so let me make the blood flow to my heart and lungs a little bit more of a priority. 

Using EPI for an allergic reaction is going to get you all the same side effects. Increased heart rate, increased cardiac oxygen demand, feelings of palpitations, blah blah blah. So we don’t really want to use that if we don’t HAVE to.  In an allergic reaction EPI acts on specific alpha and beta receptors in your body, which does a couple of different things. It can act as a bronchodilator and help open up those constricted, swollen airways. It also acts as a vasoconstrictor which can help reduce hives, localized swelling and, in severe cases of anaphylaxis, help raise your blood pressure which prevents you from going into a more severe form of shock (so to say).  PROBLEM WITH EPI….a fuck ton of contraindications and side effects that can range from the feelings of palpitations to pulmonary edema and heart failure. Be careful. Do your research. I don’t recommend anyone use an epipen that is not prescribed to them. Ever. 

Happy alternative?! Not true alternative to epi, but the next best thing!  BENADRYL! This shit has so many uses. It’s pretty fantastical. If you have a local allergic reaction to a plant, or any local redness, swelling or itching because of a bug bite. Benadryl. It fucking rocks. It is our #1 go to drug for allergic reactions. Do your research. Make your own deductions. See if it’s right for you. (now I just sound like a commercial). 

MOVING ON….	

(4) Preexisting Illness. 
Hoard some medication. Pack whatever you can save up. I’m not talking about your birth control. I’m talking about your metformin, metoprolol, digoxin, etc. If you have a preexisting condition, it will kill if it is not managed correctly. 

If you are diabetic. Pack glucose. Get glucagon. Glucose tabs, or the gel, whatever. Just pack sugar. 

If you have an illness, research it. I really hope you already have, because everyone should be their own expert on their illness. As a medic, it is far too common that we meet people who take medication and don’t even know what the fuck it’s for. HOW DO YOU NOT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE PUTTING INTO YOUR BODY?!?! 
Read. Read everything there is about whatever it is you have. KNOWLEDGE IS POWER! Know what causes it, how it effects your body, what part of your body it effects, what can be done in times of flair ups or exacerbation. Find out what your medication does to your body to helps you deal with this illness. Find out the MECHANISM OF ACTION of the medication you take. Find out side effects. Find out how that medication interacts with other medications. Not just for a survival scenario, but because the BEST thing a patient can EVER have is an ADVOCATE!!!!! Whether it is speaking up for themselves or having a family member who is dedicated enough to do it for them. Please people. I’m not trying to be the fuck head paramedic who rants and raves about how “I see it every day, blah blah blah” but I fucking see it every day. Know your illness, pack your meds, pack accessories, know how to deal with it if you don’t have those things. 

I probably left some things out but that is all just some food for thought. I’d love to provide any kind of advice or answers I can and I would love to get the same from everyone here. Apologies for spelling or grammar errors. Happy prepping. 

P.S. Get a Food Saver. Vacuum seal your medical supplies based on situation use. Plus it saves space and is waterproof. I’m a fan.

For the biscuits:

4 cups all purpose gluten free flour( I use [Better Batter](http://betterbatter.org/))

2 teaspoon xanthan gum (omit if blend contains it)

2 tablespoon baking powder

1 teaspoon baking soda

4 tablespoons sugar

2 teaspoon kosher salt

2 sticks(16 tablespoons) unsalted butter, diced and chilled

2 cups buttermilk (or 2 cup milk plus 2 tablespoon white wine vinegar, shaken)

1. Preheat oven to 450

2. Mix together all dry ingredients

3. Add the butter and blend until mix looks like small peas 

4. Add buttermilk and blend for 3 minutes or until mixture has come together ( I like to just use my hands to really get it all mixed really well)

5. Wrap dough tightly in plastic wrap and chill in refrigerator for 30-40 minutes

For the Deliciousness:

1/2 cup granulated sugar

1 teaspoon cinnamon

1/2 cup chopped walnuts, if desired

1/2 cup raisins, if desired

1 cup firmly packed brown sugar

3/4 cup butter or margarine, melted

6. Use butter to grease the inside of a bundt cake pan( fluted tube pan)

7. Mix the sugar and cinnamon in a large ziplock 

8. Roll chilled dough into balls a bit smaller than a golfball 

9. Place a few balls at a time into the sugary-cinnamony ziplock and shake it up!

10. Arrange balls coated in deliciousness in the pan (with walnuts or raisins if you like)

11. Melt butter and mix with brown sugar

12. Pour over biscuits 

Place in oven and cook for 20-30 minutes. Check on it to see how its rising every 10 minutes. It should rise to the top of the pan and brown a little. If you are unsure if it's done take a toothpick and poke it to see if it comes out clean. I use long, thin wooden skewer things (kabob sticks) to poke them all the way to the bottom to see if the bottom layers are done too. 

When it's cooked through all the way, take it out and let it cool for AT LEAST 10 minutes. When cooled, flip the pan onto a tray/plate carefully and watch in amazement as the most amazing tower of deliciousness stands tall before you!

If you flipped it too early it will most likely fall into a pile of balls, it will taste delicious but look sad, like your face when you see it :(

True,phone_scissors_pen,,,"While this shot is fun and cute, it's not like Vijay was planning on making that shot.  Every year during the practice rounds before the Masters tournament, the players entertain the gallery by dropping a few balls and trying to skip a shot across the water and onto the green.  Just for fun.  This was not pulled off in any kind of tournament setting.

In my opinion, [this is the most amazing golf shot you will ever see.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nJfhUGM4Yc)

Tiger Woods in the 2005 Masters, perhaps the most important golf tournament in the world.  It's the final round, and he is clinging to a one shot lead on the 16th hole.  He has pulled his tee shot left of the green, in a nearly impossible position.  He has almost no room on which to land his pitch shot, and there is almost no hope of getting his 2nd shot anywhere near the hole.  The greens at the Masters are legendarily fast, so in order to execute the shot he must aim way, way, way away from the hole and use the slope of the green to bring the ball to the cup.  All under immense pressure, he must hit the most delicate and precise chip of his life, in order to maintain his slim lead in the most important golf tournament on the planet. 

What happens next is nothing short of miraculous, and, as I said, the best golf shot you will ever see.  It's a shot that requires some golf knowledge to appreciate, but trust me, it is second to none.

**Edit:  For those as sleepless as I am who love golf videos, here are some more amazing shots:**

Over 200 yards to go, off the pine needles, with a tree right in front of him and water guarding the green.  A shot only Phil would attempt.  Probably the greatest shot he has ever hit.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh1ZVLuZdvE)

* [Bubba Watson at this year's Masters tournament in the playoff vs. Louis Oosthuizen.  Forced to hit a high, hooking left to right pitching wedge from the trees.  The ball traveled some 50 yards from left to right on a shot that only covered about 120 yards total. He looked dead in the water before this shot, and then hit the most amazing wedge in Master's history.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOROLxwKI_0&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=15s)

* [Same tournament, this year's Masters.  Louis Oosthuizen makes a 2 on a par 5...a double eagle, also known as an Albatross.  Boosted his score by 3 shots instantly and put him in position to win the title.  Probably the 2nd most famous Albatross in Masters history, after Gene Sarazen's ""shot heard 'round the world"" in 1935 (no video sadly)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZoUJZ0yDTA)

* [Tiger Woods again.  Back in 2000 at the Canadian Open in the final round.  From a fairway bunker, a 6 iron over a shitload of water, to the edge of the green.  He made the birdie putt like a boss.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwOMPTVU0S4&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=94s)

* [Bill Haas at the 2011 Tour Championship, in a playoff for a tournament worth what would amount to be +$11 Million.  He pulls his approach shot into a water hazard, but only half of the ball is submerged.  It looks like he is done for.  If he takes a penalty shot, he will lose, so his only option is to play it from the water.  He pulls it off somehow and goes on to win the Tour Championship.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_69ahipYlV4)

* [The legend Tom Watson, at the 1982 US Open, the tournament he had coveted more than any other, yet never won.  Going down to the wire vs. Jack Nicklaus, the greatest golfer of all time.  On the next to last hole, Watson hits his approach into thick greenside rough.  Hoping to just get ""up and down"" for par, his caddy says to him ""knock it close.""  Watson, ever the wily competitor replies, ""close?  hell i'm gonna make it.""  He stands over the gnarly grass, takes a deft swing and holes out for birdie.  Another birdie on the 18th hole would give Watson his long awaited US Open trophy.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQTuLQxlYAI)

* [Fred Couples at the famous island green par 3 17th hole at the Players Championship.  He hit his first ball in the water, took a dropped shot, and hit his 3rd from the same teebox and holed it for a run-of-the-mill par.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BBO6n7HR3o&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=105s)

* [Tigers Woods' hole in one at the raucous 16th hole in Phoenix.  The loudest crowds on tour go apeshit when the king makes an ace!  Throwing beer bottles and everything afterward.  Bananas.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9U1bDcYbG0) 

* [A then-unknown teenager named Sergio Garcia went head to head vs. Tiger Woods in the 1999 PGA Championship at Medinah.  On the 16th hole of the final day, Garcia's ball lands behind a tree, nestled into some roots.  He hits a contortionist's dream of a shot...twirling the club thru the roots, hitting the ball with his eyes closed.  An impossible shot...he hits it up onto the green.  His spirited chase up the fairway is still etched in golf fans' memories everywhere.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPcddytnbFw)

* [Last One!  Tiger explaining what, to him, is his favorite shot he's ever hit.  Not many people know about this shot because it happened early in the morning, finishing up the 2nd round after it was interrupted on Friday due to weather.  From a fairway bunker, 3 iron, up and over a tree from 200+ yards away.  Listen to him describe the shot.  The actual shot is shown at the end of the clip.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgGk27rzKE8)

* [Apparently I'm not done yet.  For all the Vijay lovers out there.  Check out this nifty shot from the 2001 Players Championship.  His ball came to rest against the wood posts that separate the green from the water hazard, so he had to flip his putter vertically and hit a chip shot with the toe of his putter, to glorious results!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lc5tSQ7XAKk&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=7s)

* [Phil Mickelson showing off...hitting an extreme flop shot with so much loft that he can hit it back over his head and onto the green.  Not sure he's ever done it in competition, but it takes A LOT of skill to pull it off.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrmffcYgbGs)

* [Bubba Watson hitting DRIVER for his 2nd shot on the 673 yard par 5 18th hole at the Hyundai Tournament of Champions in Kapalua, Hawaii.  (You don't normally hit that club anywhere but off of a tee.)  Bubba hits it +250 yards, sweeping down and around off the majestic Hawaiian hillside, with a ravine on the left and a long way to go.  Hits a wonderful shot!.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GTjGSn61Xs&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=59s)

* [From the same compilation (and not really the GREATEST shot of all time, but a fun story).  At the 2011 Pebble Beach National Pro-Am, many of the pros are paired up with celebrities because this is a famous PGA tournament that Bob Hope ran for a long time, so it's the favorite tournament of celebrity golfers.  D.A. Points was paired up with Bill Murray (always a riot on the golf course, and everywhere).  Usually the golfers that are paired with big name celebs don't often factor in the actual tournament, but Points was leading the tournament all weekend and had Bill Fucking Murray there every step of the way.  Bill's magic was most apparent on this shot, where he holes out for a 3 on the 14th hole from the fairway.  Stay tuned after the shot for Murray/Points' worst chest bump of all time](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GTjGSn61Xs&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=174s)

* [Okay I'm really done now.  This is the last one.  Tiger.  Again.  (What can I say...the guy hits a lot of good shots.)  2012 Memorial Tournament...Jack Nicklaus' tournament, and one of Tiger's favorites.  El Tigre conjured up some old Sunday magic for this cheeky flop shot with water staring him right in the face, sliding the face of his wedge just under the ball to pop it straight up in the air and land soft...the slope of the green taking the ball toward the cup, and the rest is history.  Vintage Tiger.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwhZtOV1KCk)

* [Dammit, Reddit...I don't know how to quit you!  Check out unheralded journeyman Shaun Micheel's picture perfect 7 iron on the 72nd and last hole of the 2003 PGA Championship.  With just a one shot lead over Chad Campbell on the difficult East Course at Oak Hill Golf Club in Rochester, NY, Micheel hit the shot of his life to an elevated green.  Where the ball ended up, victory was all but assured.  Unreal.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_3x0_l4fXo&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=424s)

* [Last but not least, the first man to slay the Tiger on a major Sunday afternoon.  Tiger Woods had a 2 shot lead going into the final round of the 2003 PGA Championship at Hazletine.  He had never lost a major after leading thru the first 3 rounds, but he couldn't putt to save his life that day, and then-unknown YE Yang played cool, calm and collected all Sunday while Tiger struggled.  On the 18th hole, Yang had a 1 shot lead over Tiger, whom he was playing with.  Although he had the lead, most people assumed Yang would wilt under the pressure as so many do in that situation, going mano a mano with Tiger.  Yang's tee shot found the light rough, some 200+ yards from the hole.  He probably only needed par to win, but instead drew out his hybrid club and hit the greatest shot of his life, a high, towering, soft draw over a big oak tree that came to rest just 6 feet from the hole, shocking Tiger and the entire golfing world.  What a shot.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1tx36z8W3k&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=143s)

True,tootiepoot,,,"Sure.  My son (7 at the time) and I were coming home late from visiting family.  I let him out at out front door so he could go inside to use the bathroom and was about to drive around back to park the car when I noticed an old junker car idling in the street at the entrance to our driveway.  I knew something wasn't right, parked the car and ran to catch up with my son at the front door.  As I got there, a man with a gun pointed at us came up from the side of our house.  He told me to ""show me the money""  but I was speechless.  My son was trying frantically to open the front door and my husband inside heard the commotion and came to the door.  As he saw what was happening, he pushed open our heavy iron door into the guy, knocking him backward.  The guy shot (we believe at my husband) hitting me in the face as he ran off.  Luckily our neighbor had already called the cops and they arrived quickly.  Lots of blood loss and a long recovery, but no residual physical damage really.  The scar on my nose is hardly noticeable and the scar behind my ear stays covered by my hair most of the time so I don't really think about it.  Also, I was pregnant at the time all of this happened, and my son was born a few months later perfectly healthy.  Pretty crazy shit.

True,zachwad22,,,"Second the rice thing.  Seriously.  Going by AmericanDerp's logic below, rice is 40 cents per cup.  You really only need a half cup for a mostly filling meal.  15 meals = 3 bucks.  Spend the remaining 11 on:

Dozen eggs, at most $2, probably more like 1.50
2 can of Northern Beans and 2 can of diced tomatoes, 3-4.00 altogether
A bunch of bananas.  Assuming 70 cents per pound, get yourself two pounds.  That's at least 5 bananas.  $1.50.

That leaves anywhere between 4 and 5 bucks.  I personally don't take much stock in frozen vegetables in this situation and I don't remember ever seeing them cheap enough to make the health benefit over such a short timespan worth your money.  Go for the carbs and some protein to stay on your feet and kicking.  I'd go with whatever sounds good.  Some oatmeal, maybe canned tuna or salmon, or even some more beans.  Spend .99 on some Mexican brand chicken buollion cubes if you want to splurge.  A little oatmeal with salt and sugar?  Nothing wrong with that.  Use your imagination and for the love of crap don't but breakfast cereal, lunch meat, cheese, or milk.  If you're worried about calcium, buy some canned anchovies.  Calcium and protein and delicious on rice.

Make variations of rice with beans and or tomatoes cooked with it.  Toss in a chicken cube for flavor.  I'm assuming you have salt and pepper.  A little butter or even veg oil and you're set.  Serve with an egg on top.  Fry, scramble, or even just crack over your still crazy-hot rice and stir it up.  Nobody will tell, and it's delicious.

Vitamin C from tomatoes, potassium from bananas for breakfast, and whatever the heck happens to be in the beans will keep you set.  I don't know if fortified rice is as cheap as ""real rice"", but if it is, you're even more set.  Don't worry about losing out on the extra vitamins and minerals from more veggies.  Really not worth it over so short a time for the price.

Really not a ""bad"" way to eat, I am like that half the time.  Bread is mostly not worth the price, and even if it is cheap, what are you going to put on it that isn't expensive? (Peanut butter, lunch meat, and cheese are all stupid expensive for staying on your feet and a budget).

Good luck!  You'll be fine.  Don't buy Ramen.  Too much damn salt.",0,1356593594,,0,1356593956,1,c7mp909,t3_15i0zx,t1_c7mp909,t1_c7mm2dx,,1430780659,261,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,261
True,chosen_few,,,"I got an in and out through the shoulder in Afghanistan, it didn't really hurt because I'd just got hit by an RPG **blast** too ha. For me anyway I didn't immediately think I was going to die, I thought I'd lost my leg and for some reason that freaked me out more. I didn't really think about it much after I realized I hadn't lost it, I mean pain wise. A lot of other guys were hit a lot worse or dead so I guess my head was occupied, shit just stopped working though (my right leg/left wrist). I dont really remember pain at the time, but i mean 7 or 8 guys had just got killed at the OP so getting hit again was a very very real possibility. Me and another guy managed to crawl out though after another group came up to reenforce and I hopped to a medevac with some help.

It fucking hurt like hell later on though but I had drugs by that point. Unfortunately if you want to get out of the hospital youve gotta be off IV drugs so i stopped those asap. So I mean it fucking hurt but percs and plenty of alcohol and it knocked that shit right out (until the next morning). 

sort of relevant anyway, I dunno if that helps you imagine it or anything

True,minizanz,,,"the xeons are not really ""server grade,""  there are 3 chips for 2011 (a quad with 8MB of cashe that you should never buy as 1155 is quicker for quads and some are broken hexes some are not, a hex with 12MB, and an oct with 20MB.)  the ones that get sold as i7 are binned from bad chips that get cores cut down so you get a hex with 15MB and a quad with 10MB of cashe.  the only whole chip is the hex 12MB like the 3930k but they (the i7) tend to be flaky or very high leakage so they are only good with liquid and ln2 for the 12MB chip.

anyways i got off track, the only difference from a 1qpi xeon and i7 is that they have the fuse for ECC enabled, and  they are currently selling higher squs for the xeon line like the 8core 20MB that seam to be in short supply (maybe a fab yield problem since they have a bunch of the broken 6core 15MB on the market.)  you can also get the xeons with 2 QPI links enabled, but i doubt that any one here would build a dekstop with that since it is rather pointless.  back in the day before this locked chip stuff; the low leakage (aka bad) chips were sold as xeons, the normal leakage was sold as a core (good for air and liquid), and the high leakage was sold as extreme (liquid and ln2.)  it is still like that with the socket 1155 parts, but they put the really high leakage chips to MB OEMs only for competition use, but since you can only overclock the K edition, they have really tried to make them air friendly so it is a crap shoot to find a nice chip, then you also have to pop off the IHS or get really lucky with properly applied TIM.",0,1356601462,,0,1356602140,1,c7mqcd8,t3_15iaet,t1_c7mqcd8,t1_c7mq8vz,,1435653599,1,False,IAmA,t5_2qzb6,1

dont take anything personally. your dad sounds like he cares but its a tough subject to talk about weight. all the times a friend has made a fat joke only to see me become instantly depressed and awkward. talking to a girl and my friend said i had bigger boobs than her in front of her.

i kissed her at the school dance but than i left because i felt it was wrong because i was ugly.

it took a decade but i finally got to the point where i dont care what people think. what people think of me is none of my business is my mentality. 

i was at the gym and this good looking girl came up to me just to make fun of me telling me i was fat and there was no point.i was going to leave when a guy who saw it told me ""hey man some some people are in shape and miserable so they need to bring you down. i can tell youre a good person so keep at it for yourself and not for her""

really set my mind straight. do things for yourself and not for your dad or boyfriend.im 19 and ive had 1 gf for maybe 2 weeks at most.

True,charmingwit,,,"WTF i get caught jacking off all the time

i'm not unlucky, its just standard probability. i beat off alot. seriously, i beat off like if i keep doing it, i'm gonna win something. its only natural people will stumble in eventually

FOR EXAMPLE

so i'm on this direct flight from claremont (my college town) back to kansas city (my home town) for winter break. since its a direct 3 hour flight, its too short for them to have ""in flight entertainment,"" but its so long that i'm gonna be bored out of my god damn mind. so, of course, i'm like ""i guess i'm beating off like 5 times during this flight.""

its one of those small sized slingshot airplanes that goes really fast but is really unstable and has one tiny ass cramped aisle. so i'm sitting in my anorexic bucket seat w/ my shitty peanuts waiting for the plane to hit a high enough altitude when i finally hear: ding ""this is your captain speaking, we have reached a cruising altitude of 30,000 feet, you are now free to move about the cabin."" ""bink success!"" i think to myself, ""the time is right."" of course i don't rush to the bathroom, no need for that. why not give myself a little tease. i gently, slowly unbuckle my seatbelt. I stand up, and stretch a little bit. I take a nice slow, leisurely walk to the bathroom at the back of the plane. masturbation this good deserves foreplay of its own.

i get to the bathroom, close the door, and sliiiiiide my pants on down and start working myself. oh holy LORD it's amazing. i mean, i don't know if you know this or not, but i am REALLY good at masturbating. I'm in a 2 square foot, dimly lit bathroom, but i feel so good my back is arching and my foot is cramping and i'm nearly ready to start screaming my own name.

then suddenly, TURBULENCE. AGH SHIT. I HATE turbulence. It's not that it makes me feel sick or nauseated. turbulence makes me feel like i'm about to die. So i'm trying to jack off, and suddenly the jerk in the plane floods my body w/ adrenaline and i grab the handle in the bathroom and i'm like ""OH SHIT.""

do you know how hard it is to cum when you feel like you're about to die??? I mean seriously, imagine jacking off while there's a guy w/ a loaded gun to your head and he's screaming ""C'MON CUM YOU PUSSY, DO IT CUM."" You'd be shivering w/ eyes closed, tears streaming down your face as you sputter through little snot bubbles just BEGGING your dick to come. ""please cum!!!"" you'd weep ""i wanna cum soooo bad!!!!!""

so there i am trying to think of every dirty thing possible so i can finally orgasm, but all that's going through my mind is ""god i need to reconcile with my dad and tell my brother i love him"" etc etc and while i'm distracted in a mess of standard pre-death thoughts, i don't realize that i'm about to cum.

HOLY FUCK i say as i fumble and try to grab some kleenex from the box on the counter. however, in my stuttered panic, i just knock the kleenex box over, hit the ""stewardess help button,"" and i cum directly onto the floor. still in a state of panic i'm like FUCKFUCKFUCK I NEED TO TURN THIS BUTTON OFF so of course i (geniusly) press it like 5 more times trying to turn this off. Naturally, the button just goes ding ding ding ding, making my situation seem all the more urgent, and i can hear the stewardess rushing to the door since i appear to be in desperate need of help.

""FOCUS SEAN FOCUS,"" i think, ""I NEED TO HIDE MY DICK."" so, (this is genius) i pick up the kleenex box from the floor, pull out 5 pieces of tissue, and i just lay them on top of my erection... so it looks kinda like a little dick tent. so, the stewardess, responding to my urgent spams of the ""stewardess help button"" proceeds to open the bathroom door just like i knew she was going to. She looks on the ground to see my epic protein stain, looks up at my glorious dicktent, and then you know what happens?? we make eye contact.

so she's looking at me, and i'm looking at her and in general i dislike awkward silences. however, this was an all KINDS of awkward silence, so i figured it was necessary to say something. so, i did the best i could. i look her right in the eye and say ""... it is what it is...""

???? why did i say that???? what a stupid thing to say... well... i guess it's hard in that situation to ""play it off cool."" i can't be like ""hey i know smoking isn't allowed on the plane, so do you have a stick of gum??""

so she shuts the door, and i clean myself up and spend another 3 minutes trying to clean up the mass of cum on the floor. even though i did a pretty good job, its damn hard to get that shine out of the laminate flooring. i'm finally done, so i open up the bathroom door to see a line of 10 or so people that's been building up since i went into the bathroom like 20 minutes ago (again, it took my a while since its difficult to cum when you think you're about to die). I get to look across the line of all of em, and say the only sensible thing i can think of:

""for those of you going to use the bathroom, i'd make sure you're wearing shoes.""

CPU/Cooler/Mobo

6-core monster that's got high enough clocks for even the most demanding games, and 12 threads for ripping through else you can throw at it. The Thermalright Silver Arrow SB-E delivers exceptional cooling performance while remaining nearly silent. The ASRock Extreme6 has beefy VRMs for fantastic overclocking, and comes reasonably priced to boot. 

RAM
--
32GB of Crucial's awesome Ballistix Sport VLP RAM. 8GB DIMMs at DDR3-1600 CAS9... and 1.35V! Pop them up to 1.5V, loosen up the timings a bit, and they'll fly up to DDR3-2133. A bit overkill? Maybe. But it's a video crunching machine. Why not.

Storage
--

Oooh yeah, gotta love that storage. 250GB Samsung 840 SSD with blistering read speeds to install your OS, applications and games. Nothing else on there!

Two 10kRPM WD VelociRaptor 250GB drives to be run in RAID0 and used as scratch and media cache space. Definitely a boon for media editing, and highly recommended. You might think that an SSD would be better here, but infact the constant write cycles can actually wear out the NAND, reducing performance and capacity. Best to stick with solid, fast, and reliable high speed mechanical drives.

Two 3TB Seagate Barracudas to be run in RAID1. Redundant storage! Keep your data safe. You should of course be backing up to an external source as well. Something like a 3TB external drive. Redundancy is key!

GPU
--
GTX670 offers a solid blend of compute performance and gaming performance. It's not going to be any faster than a 570/580 is Premiere Pro, but the gaming performance and VRAM boost are worth it for gaming on that big monitor. You may need to do a slight ""hack"" (very simple to do) in Premiere Pro to get the card working, as while the support is there, it's not ""officially enabled"" yet. An update should come very soon though.

PSU

Enough power to add a second 670, and overclock both of them as well as the 3930k, and keep all of those running together with all of those drives without breaking a sweat.

True,Stryker125,,,"I was shot two times in the back and once in the arm in Afghanistan.
I've posted the story a few times on reddit before I shall copy/paste it.

I was only conscious for about 7 minutes if that. I felt pain pretty much the entire time I was awake. But as the minutes passed it was starting to go away and I kept falling asleep or passing out. Just kept putting my head down and closing my eyes because it felt so good. It is really hard to describe the pain, I felt frozen on the ground and couldn't move or breathe well at all. It felt like my guts had been ripped apart and pulled out of my body. I was thinking for sure I was going to die...the pain, the blood and the screaming around me..I was also sure the guy was going to finish me off and walk up to me and shoot me in the head Later i found out he did actually walk over me but was distracted by others shooting at him. Here is basically what my mind was going though. Minute 1-2: Holy shit I've been shot, Ive been fucking shot! HELP ME HELP ME I DON'T WANT TO DIE!(I was trying to scream) Minute 2-4 : Please if there is a god let me be accepted into heaven (I didn't want to just die....to become nothing and go into blackness as I was seeing. It really scared me into wanting there to be an afterlife) Minute 4-6: I just want to go to sleep and die. I have accepted my death. My family my friends I love them so much

Minute 4-6 was happening while I was going in and out of conciousness.

My squad leader was slapping my face trying to keep me up. He is also the one that mainly took down the gunman. They then picked me up and ran with me somewhere and my last memory was hearing a rotor of a blackhawk. Next thing I know I woke up in Walter Reed a week later confused as shit thinking I was captured. Yes I am in the US Army and was shot by an Afghan National Army soldier on the FOB we share with them. I lost a very good friend that day too who I watched get shot right in front of my eyes before I then got shot myself. There are a few articles of the incident if anyone cares to read. PM me because it has my name and a few others in it.

TL;DR: Got shot, it hurt like a bitch and I thought I was dead for sure. Somehow lived to tell the story.

True,Tntnnbltn,,,"* **""Why can't my brain search by ""Books owned"" tag and return a list? The information is clearly there!""**

This scenario involves a situation where memory has been successfully encoded and stored, but cannot be retrieved. 


&gt;Forgetting can be caused by the **blocking** of a memory representation, that is, by obstruction that can occur when multiple associations are associated with a cue and one of those associations is stronger than the others, preventing retrieval of the target information. Many theorists believe that the probability of retrieving a target memory depends on the strength of the association between the retrieval cue and the target representation relative to the strength of the association between that same cue and other representations. In the ensuing competition during retrieval, the representation with the strongest association “wins” and is remembered; ones with weaker associations “lose” and are “forgotten”. There is an important contrast here to decay theories, which hold that the degraded memory representation is lost; blocking theory emphasizes that the forgotten information still resides in memory, but access to it is temporarily blocked by a dominant competing representation. This weaker representation can be unblocked if a better retrieval cue, one that is more strongly associated with it, is presented.

&gt;Blocking likely accounts for many instances of forgetting; the mental representation of the old password, unused for some time, could be considered a weaker representation than the new password, which is used daily (Figure 5–16). The phenomenon is possibly adaptive: it permits the updating of memories so that we remember the information most likely to be relevant (Bjork, 1989). **Blocking also partly explains a striking and counterintuitive characteristic of memory: that the mere act of remembering one stimulus or event can result in the forgetting of another.** Suppose you idly start thinking about cataloguing your CDs, and you begin by making a mental list of them. The list grows quickly at first, but very soon your rate of retrieval slows. Your familiarity with all your CDs is about the same, so why should this be? What is happening is a phenomenon called output interference, in which the strengthening of memories provided by the act of initial retrieval blocks the retrieval of other memories. Retrieving the names of some of the CDs in your collection serves to strengthen the association between those representations and the retrieval cue; and in turn these newly strengthened representations serve to block access to other CD titles, temporarily decreasing your ability to remember them. ([link to source -- pg 227](http://www-psych.stanford.edu/~ashas/Cognition%20Textbook/chapter5.pdf))



In your case, ""Books owned"" is the cue, and each of the books on your shelf is an association of that cue. By initially starting your list (for example: ""Lord of The Rings"", ""The Hobbit"", ""The Chronicles of Narnia"") you strengthen the mental link between ""Books owned"" and those associations. As this happens though, you weaken the mental link between ""Books owned"" and other titles like ""Adventures of Huckleberry Finn"".

Using variations of the original cue (e.g. ""Books I own that I read for high school"", ""Books I own that are non-fiction"", ""Books I own that are paperbacks"") might help you make a more substantial list because there are less competing associations as each cue becomes more specific.


* **""Why is this information only accessible one way, and not another?""**

The two different types of ways you are describing are ""free recall"" (remembering all of the books on your shelf), and ""recognition"" (remembering a specific title when asked about it). In general it is easier to perform recognition (*""Do you own the Lord of the Rings books?""*) because that cue has a single, strong association, whereas in the free recall (*""What books do you own?""*) there are multiple associations and hence blocking becomes a factor.",0,1356617310,,0,1356629927,1,c7mry55,t3_15in05,t1_c7mry55,t3_15in05,,1430781923,375,False,askscience,t5_2qm4e,375

True,El_Frijol,,,"There's no way even the best truck mounted steam cleaner is going to make that filtered smoked carpet look anywhere NEAR the clean part under the bed.  In fact, I doubt it would even look marginally better.

In most houses that have rooms with carpet you will see that there are black lines along the walls of the room.  This is called: soil filtration, filter dust...etc.  What happens is that when you run the air conditioner: all the dirt &amp; smog from outside comes in, goes out of your room vent, hugs onto the wall, and tries to find a void.  All that dirt and smog constantly going in that gap, and coming back up as it hits the sub-flooring.  It's IMPOSSIBLE to clean.  It essentially dyes it black.  The worse the carpet installation (loose) the bigger that line will be.

So, yeah.  That's what's happened here, but with cigarette smoke.

For one, even in the best case scenario: short-pile nylon carpet, with a very light amount of soiling and foot traffic it's NEVER going to look like under the bed.  It's like comparing a 0 mileage showroom car to a car that's been driven relatively hard for a month or two.

This carpet looks to be either a polyester or polypropylene.  These are the worst carpets.  Polyester isn't resilient so it doesn't bounce back in traffic areas; it gets easily scratched so the integrity of the yarns will always look terrible compared to the areas where you do not walk on, by contrast.  It may be good at resisting spots from setting in, but it has an affinity for oil/dirt.  Polyester does not absorb really well, so that's why some spots will return after cleaning.  Since it's not absorbent when they try to dye polyester the yarns itself don't really receive the color--only on the face yarns. 

Polypropylene is made from recycled plastic bottles.  TERRIBLE.  It crushes down so much in the traffic areas, and like polyester it doesn't absorb spills; so everything goes into the pad, and then wics up at a later time.

Nylon is a very soft, resilient fiber.  It bounces back in traffic areas, and it cleans up EXTREMELY well.  Look at every casino there is.  What carpet do they have?  A low pile nylon with a lot of different colors and patterns to fool the eye when there are spots.  If it was polyester or polypropylene then it would look 30 years old in half a year with all the foot traffic they get.

True,MattTheGr8,neuro,Cognitive Neuroscience,"Another way to think about it is this: Your brain is made out of neurons. All neurons essentially collect activity from other neurons, sum them up, and fire themselves if the sum of their inputs is high enough.

This means that for a given neuron to fire, it must have a trigger. That trigger must either come from other neurons inside the brain, or (if the neuron is connected directly to a sense organ) from a sensory stimulus. Speaking extremely loosely, the same is true of cognitive processes -- one triggers another, triggers another, etc., ad infinitum, with the triggers coming from a combination of outside (exogenous) sensory sources and inside (endogenous) sources, e.g. your memory.

So let's say a specific memory -- ""I own Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five"" is present in your brain. But the neurons representing that memory aren't firing right now, so that concept is not active at the moment. If someone just SAYS the title of the book to you, it is fairly direct for the concept that the other person has (essentially) activated for you to trigger the activation of that memory. Hence priming.

However, if you are simply asked to list the books you own (which is an exogenous cue, but not a very specific one), you are essentially left with the job of coming up with job of coming up with endogenous cues to trigger the activation of memories of all the books you own. Clearly the cue of ""a book I own,"" though it may prime the memories of all the books you own to a small degree, is not a strong/specific enough trigger to activate all those memories to the level of consciousness (and for a good reason, because if they were all activated at once, that would vastly exceed your working memory capacity).

So you have to come up with other ways of cuing things. Think about what you'd do in that situation. You might just start randomly naming books -- in which case you might come up with a few, probably ones that are very important to you, as ""Slaughterhouse-Five"" is to me (which is why when I was fishing around for a random example, it came up) -- because those are more readily available in general; the memory traces are stronger. But then you'd probably resort to strategies looking for more specific triggers, like going through the alphabet and trying to think of author names starting with A, B, C, etc. Because those cues are more specific, they provide a stronger input to activate Asimov, Baudelaire, Chomsky, etc. But alphabet letters are still not VERY specific cues for author names, so the technique is imperfect.

Hopefully that makes some sense. Best TL;DR I can do is: Neurons and concepts are better activated by strong, direct inputs than weak inputs. A sensory input naming a certain thing (plus the instruction ""remember if you own this thing"") is a very strong input to trigger the memory of whether or not you own the thing. If you don't get that, you must resort to strategies for producing your own cues, but those cues (e.g. ""alphabet letter"" + ""abstract concept of author"") are going to be much more general and thus more weakly connected to the specific memory, so they will be less successful at conjuring it up.

True,worff,,,"It had some excellent long takes, but if you want to watch some truly magnificent ones, check out some of these:

Finally I get to repost this list of mine in a subreddit that might actually appreciate it!  And now with some explanations!

- That tracking shot of Little Bill in *Boogie Nights*, the opening shot, and the pool scene.

Paul Thomas Anderson is fantastic with this.  Although the pool party one owes a debt to *I Am Cuba,* which I mention further down.

- The tracking shot in *Magnolia* when they're entering the TV studio.

Fantastic.  From exterior to interior, across multiple floors, following multiple characters.

- The 4 minute one-shot fight from *The Protector*

Mind blowing.  The sheer amount of planning that went into this is astounding.  Fight scenes are hard enough to film even with standard coverage, but to do them in single takes is truly remarkable.

- That sequence from Tarkovsky's *The Mirror* that ends with the burning barn

This isn't the longest take by any means -- there are longer takes within *The Mirror* itself, but it is so exquisitely composed, and it uses offscreen sound so well, that it's probably one of my favorites.  Unfortunately, the YouTube link to it was removed because of a copyright claim by Mosfilm, but the film is worth watching in its entirety.

- The tracking shot from *Goodfellas*

It's just good.

- The corridor fight scene from *Old Boy*

Again, a fight scene in one take, that also has the merit of being shot in a very interesting fashion (with a cross-section set and a dolly-mounted camera, as opposed to Steadicam or handheld).

- The opening of *Touch of Evil*

Another one that uses the long take in conjunction with excellent *sound design,* which is essential to what makes this work.  That ticking of the bomb fades in and out, and you're just waiting for it to explode.  Throw in the music, the sounds of the cars, the sounds of the extras, and it's even better.  

- The lead-in to the Crazy 88 fight from *Kill Bill*

Also reminds me of that one shot in *Minority Report* that used a set and overhead-camera to show those spider-type thingies going after Tom Cruise when he's submerged in that bathtub.  Some long takes do that.  It's the great thing about working on a set.

- The car scene or ending battle from *Children of Men* and the opening coffee shop sequence (not as action packed, but still a good use of the long take.)

Everyone has talked about the two bigguns from *Children of Men,* though they are composited to a degree.  But the first one in the film, the one at the coffee shop, deserves some recognition as well.  It's simple, but it's effective.  It's not the most complex camera movement or blocking, but it works.

- The hospital scene from *Hard Boiled*

Action sequences, shot in long takes, usually result in being more astounding.

- All of *Russian Ark*

It's all in one take.  

- All of *I Am Cuba*

If you have ANY interest in long takes, you need to see this film.  The entire thing is composed of some of the most elaborate long takes I've ever seen.  There's one at the end, during a funeral scene, where the camera was actually passed from person to person in order to keep the take going (which, interestingly enough, is in line with the very obvious communist/socialist agenda that the film's propagandist plot tries to create.)  Narratively, it's not that great.  A series of vignettes with characters representing the working class, characters representing dictators, characters representing capitalists.  But camera-wise, it's a sight to behold.

- The tracking shots in Jean Luc Godard's *Weekend* and *Tout Va Bien*

Another use of sound with the long take, these are interesting, but not enjoyable in my opinion.  These two films are part of Godard's disillusionment movement, meaning he'd do thinks to prevent escapism on the part of the audience.  This includes having takes so long and seemingly without action (though they are not) that people start to squirm.

- Antonioni films

*Story of a Love Affair* has an excellent 360-degree shot when they're on the bridge, and of course the final scene in *The Passenger* has a fantastic long take.

- Pretty much any film by Rob Tregenza

I doubt if anyone has heard of this man, but he directed three films; *Talking to Strangers,* *The Arc,* and *Inside/Out.*  On the latter, he worked with Jean-Luc Godard.  He also contributed as a cinematographer to Bela Tarr's *Werckmeister Harmonies.*  You can see his first film, *Talking to Strangers,* [on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VwzS0wcTpo).  It's a film with 9 scenes, and each scene is a 10-minute shot (the maximum length of a 1000-foot magazine of film).

- The last shot in *Werckmeister Harmonies*

It's just really well done.

- Numerous shots in films by the likes of Bela Tarr, Andrei Tarkovsky, Alexander Sokurov, Miklós Jancsó

I've mentioned Bela Tarr and Tarkovsky.  Sokurov is like the current Tarkovsky.  Jancsó did films like *The Red and the White,* which, again, like Tarr, aren't too narratively inclined, but they have good camera work.  

- *Rope*

This one shines through as a very successful experiment.

- The 'hole drop' scene in *The Raid: Redemption* where they actually dropped the camera through the hole, passing it from one operator to another to continue the scene.

Two separate operators, two separate 1st AC's, two separate sets.  Connected by a seemingly impossible fluid camera move that made me sit up and question how they did it right there in the theater.

- All sorts of ones from films like *Irreversible* and *Enter The Void*

Gaspar Noé likes 'em.  His camera looks like it's actually floating in numerous scenes.

- Some of the dolly shots from *The Thin Red Line* when they're charging that first bunker.

Not much more complicated than any other tracking shot in a war movie, but the use of environment makes it worth a mention.

- The trench scenes in *War Horse.*

Say what you want about the film itself, but Janusz Kaminski is great at what he does.  

- The second shot in *Bitter Rice.*

The entire film is available for viewing on HuluPlus, and I recommend it.  It has several fantastic compound moves with cranes, dollies, and more.

- The homecoming scene in *Ugetsu* when the man enters his home to find it abandoned, walks around his house, and returns to see it furnished, his family there waiting for him.

The camera follows him into the house, which seems empty.  It then follows him around the house, and returns to find the house fully furnished with a fire roaring and his wife and child there waiting for him.  You can bet the art department scrambled when they could in order to do this.  Tarkovsky also did something similar in the shot from *The Mirror,* where a single shot in a single location includes two separate time periods, accomplished by the changing of set dressings when the camera is pointed elsewhere.

- Numerous other long takes in Kenji Mizoguchi films, many of which can be seen as early as his 1930's films.

*Osaka Elegy,* is one to look at, but really any of the ones included in the Eclipse Collection sold by Criterion.  The man was a true artist, and after seeing some of his work, I consider him to be superior to both Kurosawa and Ozu.

- Jacques Tati's *Play Time.*

This one doesn't have movement in the takes, but they're long takes in that Jacques Tati sets up the environment and lets the take play out.  He doesn't direct the viewer's attention to anything in particular (though your eyes are drawn to him and his character of M. Hulot) but instead allows people to watch whatever action is taking place anywhere in the scene.  He uses the long take in conjunction with excellent production design, sound design, and physical acting (both on his part and on the part of the other actors).

- Jean-Paul Rappeneau's *Cyrano de Bergerac.*

He said once that he wanted to integrate movement into every single shot in this film, and he pretty much accomplishes this.  They aren't the longest takes, but it all seems so seamless and kinetic.  

- Some later Woody Allen films

These are kind of hard to notice because the shots don't really let themselves be noticed (and nor should they, with all of Allen's long takes being used to aid the performances of his actors.)  But if you're one who notices shot length, you should see that in several Woody Allen films, entire scenes are done in one shot, which allows the actors to act, and allows for the blocking to say something about the characters.

**EDITS:**

- Steven McQueen films like *Hunger* and *Shame*

He knows how to use Michael Fassbender, and he has no fear of just locking off the camera and letting the scene play out.  Is it a kinetic use of the long take that exploits the blocking abilities of both actor and camera?  No, but it's still extremely effective.

- [This shot from *War of the Worlds*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUv7iRaWOOQ)

Yes, it is composited from a bunch of other shots, but the final product has the same effect of a long take.  It's intense as all hell.

&gt; I am a 28 year old married man

As someone said, not mid-20s.  Lie #1.  But this statement is such a small lie compared to the rest of your shit...

&gt; married about 1.5 years, reasonably healthy if not exactly vibrant marriage, 

Lie #2.  If you had a healthy marriage you wouldn't have fucked some crazy chick.  You are the reason your marriage is unhealthy.

&gt;  we don't communicate openly enough, but we support each other,

Lie #3 and #4.  You don't communicate openly enough, because you sure as shit have been lying about this affair the whole time.  If you supported your wife you would have never cheated.

&gt;  are generally on the same page about things, 

Lie #5.  You sure as shit aren't on the same page about this affair.

&gt; and have sex about once a week.

Your wife was pregnant, your fucking some other chick, did you EVER get tested for STDs?  You may have put your life, your wife's life, **AND YOUR CHILDS LIFE IN DANGER YOU STUPID ASSHOLE.**

&gt; I knew it was wrong,

Lie #6.

&gt; and we did connect on a deep emotional level.

Lie #7. 

&gt; the affair provided me with a stress outlet

Lie #8.  Stress outlet, really?  You've never heard of hobbies, or exercise, or therapy?  

&gt; a reminder that I am still desired, not simply a husband and father but also a sexual being.

Lie #9.  You wanted to have an affair because you are a scumbag who gives no thought to others.  How much more of a sexual being can you be WHEN YOU MADE A BABY?  You also said you are having sex once a week with your wife, WHO WAS PREGNANT AND JUST HAD YOUR BABY!!   She's probably not feeling that sexual, and yet still having sex with you.  

&gt;  And, when the co-worker got a new job in a different part of the city, it appeared managable, as we could see each other when we wanted without it complicating our work lives.

Manageable...manageable...holy shit...

&gt; The co-worker is everything my wife is not, both good and bad--she's vibrant, highly sexual, **open and honest**, and emotionally erratic.

Lie #10.  You said that you and your wife support each other and generally on the same page. I'm sure your wife has been open and honest with you, unlike your scumbag self.

&gt; and I found myself seriously entertaining the idea of leaving my wife for her once the baby was old enough to split time without it being disruptive.

I wish I could kick you in the nads multiple times and slap you upside the head.

Here comes the crazy train...Choo choo!

&gt;  Early on, I told the mistress this, though stressing that I wasn't sure and even if it did happen, it wouldn't be for a few years. 

Why the bloody hell did you tell this to your mistress?  Lie #11.

&gt; She latched onto this, and began pressuring me to leave my wife. 

Duh.

&gt; When I repeated that I couldn't leave my wife just after she gave birth to our child, **my mistress became increasingly angry and erratic, telling me I'd used her and that she didn't want to see me again.**

Duh, because that's what you have been doing.

&gt; This happened several times, and each times, 3 or 4 days later she would reach out again, we'd get together, and she seemed to be over it. I should have identified this behavior as symptomatic of a deeper crazy (or, just, you know, not cheated), but, well, she gives me all the things I mentioned above, and I've not been as disciplined as I should be.

Disciplined?  DISCIPLINED?  **DISCIPLINED**???  Disciplined means **NEVER CHEATING ON YOUR WIFE YOU DUMBASS.**

&gt; We've split again, and I am committed to this being the end of it so that I can dedicate myself to fixing my marriage and being committed to my family. How do I help myself make the right choice when she comes back in a few days and sweetly proposes that we get together?

I actually hope you don't make the supposed right choice.  I hope your wife finally finds out,  divorces your ass, tells everyone so your name is toast, gets EVERYTHING in the divorce, leaving you with nothing except a crazy mistress who wants to marry you.  Oh wait, you'll have nothing, the mistress will most likely leave you for something better.

True,BenZonaa129,,,"A couple of tricks:

1.  Match flavors.  If you're cooking something with bacon, use the bacon fat to saute your vegetables.  Cook a steak with butter.  Use white wine if the food you're cooking is light in color.  Use red wine if the food is dark in color.  Don't use butter if you're cooking vegetarian.  Don't add chicken stock to a beef based dish.
(There are, or course, some exceptions to this rule.  That is for a later time though...)


2.  Learn some basic flavor combinations.  A good way to figure this out is to read the history of the spice trade.  That way you will know what spices and flavors go with what. 

 A few examples

**French**- lemon + parsley; and/or carrots, onions, celery.  Tarragon, chervil, sage, herbs de provence 

**Italian**- tomatoes, basil, garlic, olive oil, hot peppers, oregano, bay leaves,

**Mexican**- Lime + Cilantro, coriander, cumin, hot peppers

**Thai**- Lime, Mint, Cilantro, shallots, garlic, ginger, lemongrass, galangal, Thai basil, green pepper

**Indian**- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Indian_spices

3.  Food continues cooking after you take it off the heat.  Your steaks will continue to cook for a couple of minutes after you take them off the grill.  Your turkey will continue to cook after you take it out of the oven.  Those eggs you boiled will end up hard boiled if you don't cool them off.  Remember to let your food rest a couple of minutes.  It will taste better.

4.  SALT AND PEPPER!!!!!!  I honestly don't know how so many people can cook without salt and pepper.  Whenever anything or anyone says season the food.  Only use salt and pepper.  I usually use Kosher Salt (in those boxes.  I like the texture) and freshly ground pepper.  White, green, red and black peppers are just varying degrees of ripeness or the peppercorn fruit.  
PROTIP- White pepper powder cauterized wounds without any burning or stinging.

5.  There are many different ways to cook something.  Try different cooking methods: on the stove, in the oven, dry, wet, etc...

6.  Don't discount a good stock.  Every time I cook something I save the bones to use for stock.  Basic stock is: Water, Carrots, Celery, Onions, bones.  Feel free to add a little something else, but never salt or pepper because you don't want a stock to add any saltiness to your meal.

7.  Follow a recipe online but change it up a little bit.  Experiment.  Have fun with cooking.  My least favorite part is the clean-up, but that's why you have a significant other.  One cooks, the other cleans.  (This is actually pretty lousy advice, regarding cleaning, my girlfriend and I usually both clean after the meal.  She gets mad if I don't help her clean my apartment...)

8.  Use a proper knife and cutting board.  Learn to take care of your knife.  Try not to cut yourself.  I have met many people who don't enjoy cooking because of how difficult it is to cut anything.  This should never be the case.

9.  **WASH YOUR HANDS**

**EDIT**  Some people are confused about butter and vegetables.  While butter tastes fantastic, it is not all that great for you.  When I cook vegetarian (NOT VEGAN.  FUCK THAT) I tend not to use much or any butter, but usually it is a curry or soup.  If I'm making mashed potatoes, fuck yeah butter and cream.

**EDIT 2** Butter is better for you than margerine or other synthetic manufactured stuff.  I mostly cook with butter, olive oil, canola oil, or a mix of olive and canola oil (20/80 respectively)

Also, I'm having some trouble with formatting.  Forgive the repeated 1 and 2...

You made a huge decision to free yourself from one thing/person that was holding you back and making you unhappy, and now you're ready to start over and be HAPPY. You just want to have the freedom to do what you want, when you want, without some asshole telling you what to do and stifling you, and you made that hard decision to leave that part of your life behind, and everything's great except for this stupid debt thing which is all tied to the failed marriage and your earlier bad decisions which should all be in the past... right? RIGHT? 

Except no. Here is all of /r/personalfinance telling you that it doesn't work that way. And you're on the defensive, because who are all these jerks telling you that you don't have the right to finally be happy and free of your former life. 

But this is /r/personalfinance, not /r/frugal or /r/relationships. This is the subreddit where people talk about budgets and APR and ETFs and cost of living adjustments and hard, cold numbers. We tell people to get second (and third) jobs, and to sell their cars, and to put off having kids because they can't afford it. And occasionally we tell people to suck it up because ""Life^TM"" doesn't care about what you want/need to be happy and whether you deserve it, only what you legally committed to and what's mathematically possible.

The fact is this: you owe a LOT of money. You took someone else's money and now they want it back, and student loan debt is not dischargeable through bankruptcy. 

The fact is also this: based on what you told us about your income, you can't afford to do everything you want *right now*.

But I see you digging in your heels because I think we're having two different conversations. This ""job that earns me money"" thing represents something much bigger to you. You hear ""you can't afford what you're proposing"" and seem to interpret it as ""you don't deserve to be happy"". No one is saying you should be unhappy for the rest of your life, but what everyone IS  saying is that you need to be more realistic.  

You can't *will* this to work if the math is simply impossible. What are you going to do if you get to Seattle and end up homeless?

At the very least, you need to just step back and not make any decisions about moving just yet. Just let things settle down for a while and give yourself time to think about this a little more rationally.

True,[deleted],,,"So, as far as I understand it, it works as a bit preserving repeater. So, if we call the side inputs B∈{n∈ℤ|0≤n≤15} and the front input A∈{n∈ℤ|0≤n≤15}, then let the output be called C, we can express it in mathematical symbols.


-In the first mode, if B≤A then C=A, otherwise C=0.


-In the second mode, if B≤A and A≠0 then C=15, otherwise C=0.
It's interesting to note that a repeater works similarly if written as bits.


-If B&lt;A and A≠0 then C=15, otherwise C=0.

I can see it being extremely useful if there was another redstone piece that changed any redstone signal into one of arbitrary strength. I can see it being used already in combination to create compact parity checks that preserve signal strength. If you wire 2 up so that the A from the first (which should be in the first mode) becomes B and B becomes A(so the second is at 90 degrees to the first), then you only get a signal from the second if A and B are equal. I'm not sure of the applications that could be useful for, but it's interesting. Also, if the first ""comparator"" is in the second mode, where the signal becomes 15 instead of staying as A, you get a system that's only on when B=15, i.e. full strength. There are a few other things it could be useful for as well.

True,FirstAmendAnon,,,"Alright, this is a great method, but leaves out a few important details. Here's the skinny on getting you perfect steakhouse quality steaks at home:

* Buy a thick cut of meat like a porterhouse. If its more than 2"" thick it's usually better. Look for a lot of marbling (little white lines of fat through the meat). The more the better.


* Stick the meat unwrapped on a rack in the fridge overnight (watch out for cross-contamination! make sure your fridge is clean). This ages the meat and helps dry it out. Then like an hour before you cook take it out of the fridge, pat it down with paper towels, and leave it out until your ready to season.


* Preheat your oven to really hot, like 500F, and stick your (ovensafe!) pan in there. That will ensure your pan is super hot and get a sear on your meat quickly.


* Season both sides of the steak with coarse salt and like a teaspoon of oil. I find peanut oil to be better than olive oil but it doesn't really make much difference.

* Pan out of the oven using a thick oven mitt. Stick your steak in there, it should hiss loudly and start to sear immedietly. This is the goodness. 2 minutes on both sides, then stick about three tablespoons of room temperature butter and three sprigs of fresh rosemary on top of the steak and throw that baby in the oven.


* after about 3 minutes, open the oven (there will be lots of smoke, run your fan), and flip the steak. 2 or three more minutes, pull it out. If you like it more on the well done side, leave it a little longer. Do not leave it for more than like 5 minutes because you might as well just make hamburgers. Take it off the heat. Using a wooden spoon or large soup spoon tilt the pan and repeatedly spoon the butter and juices onto the steak. Baste in all its glory.


* Let the meat rest for about five minutes. I use that time to make the plate prettified. Mash potatoes or cheesy grits on the bottom. Brussel sprouts on the side. Maybe some good goats cheese on top of the steak. Be creative.


This method is guaranteed to produce a bomb diggity steak. Like, blowjob-inducing 100% of the time. It's really high-heat and ingredient driven though, so be careful, and spend that extra $5 on the good cut of meat.


EDIT: As a couple of people below have mentioned, a well-seasoned cast iron pan is best for this method. 


Also, the 5th bullet is slightly unclear. You take the hot pan out of the oven, place it on the stovetop with the stovetop on full heat, and sear the steak for 2min ish on both sides. Then cut off the stovetop and put the steak in the oven.  ",0,1356640094,,0,1356643198,1,c7mxlhw,t3_15ivs8,t1_c7mxlhw,t1_c7mvxag,,1430784660,1881,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,1881

True,tinyshadow,northamerica,American Race Relations 1880s-1910s,"The displeasing odor of tobacco is actually recorded well before the 20th and 21st century! For example, there's this statement by James I of England in 1604:

&gt;A custome lothsome to the eye, hatefull to the Nose, harmefull to the braine, dangerous to the Lungs, and in the blacke stinking fume thereof, neerest resembling the horrible Stigian smoke of the pit that is bottomelesse.

James I wrote *A Counterblaste to Tobacco*, [which you can read in its entirety \(it's not very long!\) here.](http://www.laits.utexas.edu/poltheory/james/blaste/blaste.html) He complained vigorously about the ""filthy smell"" of tobacco, and blamed its arrival in Europe on Native Americans with great complaint that Europeans should want to imitate ""savages.""

I think one of the major reasons that tobacco appears (and smells) differently today than in earlier centuries is due to just how it was 'consumed.' 

In the 17th and 18th century, snuff was king. Snuff was pulverised tobacco pinched by the fingers and inhaled through the nose. Even though some objected to its usage, most of the elite loved snuff, especially those flavored or scented in pretty ways (think flowers). 

In the 19th century, the cigar took over as the more prominent way to 'consume' tobacco. Cigars are made from hand rolled aged/dried/cured and fermented tobacco leaves. Millions and millions of cigars were consumed annually in Western nations. Again, the famous took to cigars with great enthusiasm - from well known American authors to Russian tsars to Civil War generals (Ulysses S. Grant died of tobacco-related oral cancer). People just adored cigars and pipes in the 19th century, which may be due in part to nicotine addiction. This is the time period where Santa got his smoking pipe, the U.S. temperance movement took a strong anti-tobacco stance, nicotine was discovered to be a ""dangerous poison,"" early cigarettes were developed, the Latin American cigarillo became popular with Americans and Europeans, matches were invented (for smoking!), and so on. 

But the key difference between the 19th century and the 20th century is, of course, the cigarette. This coincides with industrialization. Instead of handrolling your own cigar or packing your own pipe or buying your own chew/cigar/etc from local/regional factories, the cigarette emerged triumphant as a way to buy cheaply and buy many and buy wherever, whenever. Arguably, here is where the tobacco that we imagine to be so ""rich"" and ""pleasant-smelling"" went away, and it's much to do with the way that cigarettes are manufactured in contrast with earlier forms of tobacco consumption.

1. Premium cigars are constructed very differently than everyday cigarettes. The tobacco found in quality cigars even today is aged for a long time and fermented for several months. This is what gives cigars their different smell and flavor. But cigars fell out of popularity when the cigarette emerged, especially by the early 20th century (some suggest that World War I and the Great Depression really did it in), and many cigars today are much more cheaply made and smell poorly. Since their creation, cigarettes have been made differently - while they are aged (""heat and air cured""), they are not fermented. They can be made much quicker and easier than a premium cigar.

2. A cigarette is made of a hodgepodge of tobacco parts, unlike the cigar. As one individual has explained:

&gt; A finished US cigarette contains only 50% tobacco, which is treated with sugar to mask bitterness and enhance absorption. Another 30% is reconstituted tobacco (RECON), which is made from stems and tobacco from factory leftovers. RECON is shredded, emulsified and sprayed on a paper substance that is finely chopped before being added to the cigarette blend. A final 20% consists of expanded tobacco (tobacco product that has been expanded with carbon dioxide) and reclaim (cigarettes that have passed their prime and are sent back to the factory). The cigarettes are then rolled into paper and most (97%) are fitted with a filter made of cellulose acetate.

3. The same individual describes why cigarettes and cigars smell differently - and I think that this may be a key part of the answer to your question.

&gt; The difference in composition of cigarette versus cigar tobacco is likely the cause of the differences in smoking patterns. Cigar smoke is alkaline (i.e., has a higher pH relative to cigarette smoke) and as a result is difficult to inhale without severely irritating the respiratory airways. The nicotine produced in a high pH environment is termed “free nicotine” and is a type that more readily absorbs through the mucous membranes of the mouth. Thus, cigar smokers can deliver a substantial amount of nicotine to the brain via transport through the oral mucosa. However, the rate of delivery is slower.

&gt; Cigarette smoke, on the other hand, is mildly acidic, making it much easier to inhale and produces a type of nicotine that is termed “protonated.” Protonated nicotine is not readily absorbed through the oral mucosa and must be inhaled to produce substantial nicotine delivery.

This individual's fascinating comparison between cigars and cigarettes and how they are made [can be found here.](http://www.stogiefresh.com/journal/Cigar_Journal/Cigar_Science/Entries/2007/10/24_The_Critical_Difference:_Premium_Cigars_vs_Cigarettes.html) 

**In conclusion** - a cigarette has a lot more odd parts in it than traditional premium cigars, pipe tobacco, snuff, or chew. These other forms of tobacco consumption appeared much earlier than the cigarette (which is primarily a 20th century construction), and they originated in times where their production limited their quantity and thus improved their quality. In the industrialized era, the cigarette has reigned because it's cheaply made, mass produced, and readily bought by many diverse groups throughout the world who ignore the foul odor you describe that's more present now due to its cheap production. But tobacco has always smelled foul to some people in history, and it has caused cancer since it was first smoked by Native Americans. It's just doing it differently now that the cigarette is so ubiquitous. ",0,1356643726,,0,1356644526,1,c7mynhp,t3_15j331,t1_c7mynhp,t3_15j331,,1430785160,1063,False,AskHistorians,t5_2ssp3,1063

**EDIT:** Just wanted to add that these incidents are met with every bit as severe outrage in big cities like Delhi or Mumbai, as they would in the States. It's just that people in India have mostly resigned themselves to this sorry state of affairs, because there's a belief that things can't change. From time to time, however, the pot boils over and you see the masses rising the way they have right now in Delhi.

See, here's the thing. You can't generalize in that way, or compare India to the US or insert-first-world-country-name-here. It simply won't work.

India has a billion people already, and more are on the way every second. India does **not**, however, have the resources or the infrastructure to educate/manage a billion people. Large swathes of the country are severely underdeveloped, to the point where basic amenities like fresh water or electricity are unavailable in entire villages. 
Most folk who live in these small towns/cities or even large states that aren't quite metropolitan don't have the best environment around them. If you were to go to one of these places, you'd feel as if you've stepped into the past - the views and beliefs held by people in these areas are the ones handed down by generations past; some of these views are the backward and archaic views on how women should behave or be treated. 
The biggest problem to arise from this environment is that the people from these areas, when they sprawl out into big cities, bring their ideas with them and refuse to get educated. These same people get jobs as (as an example) cops. The majority of the policemen in the North of the country come from the state of Uttar Pradesh. They are hired as police because they are strong and well-built and little else. They make a meager salary and live mostly off of corruption (on the scale of accepting a tiny bribe to not give a ticket). They aren't educated well enough to know how to handle things like rape cases in the 21st century. 

I realize that that's hardly an excuse for the state that the country is in, but it *is* the truth. Until the country develops to the point where it can provide basic facilities for its people, including education, not a lot is going to change.

We have great diversity in India. Region-wise, it is evident above. Caste/religion-wise, we have upper-caste Hindus (Case 6 and 7), bakcward-caste Hindus (Case 3 and 14), Sikhs (Case 5 and 15), Jains (Case 1) and Muslims (Case 16 and 21) as rapists. I've listed only the _gang_ rapes that have been in the news in the past 10 days, otherwise you can find Buddhists and Christians too.

True,agavnim,,,"Balderdash. I believe that the Mens Rights Movement overlaps in the struggle to combat heteronormacy. When I first found MRA I thought the two movements were too dissimilar, but then realized they really share common bonds. For example: I'm gay. I get super bummed when I go into a bar or club and my girlfriends get in free and pay nothing for drinks. The whole point of ""ladies night"" is to entice heterosexual men. So it kind of defeats the purpose for me being there. Not only am I left out because i'm gay. I'm also left out because i'm a man. I have great friends that can shrug this off, but I can't.

Our lives stopped, and revolved around bathing her, changing her garments, grooming her, and administering various medical therapies and medicines.

We of course were honored to give to the woman who had given us so much, but she was languishing away in a bed, atrophying and unaware.

When my sister arrived, the first thing she said to me was ""Thank god, it was enough already."".

True,Louis_Farizee,,,"Wait till she has croup and the only thing to stop her screaming is rocking her back and forth for *hours*. 

One daddy to another: please consider investing in a good rocking chair, and put that rocking chair in front of a TV. Both my kids had bad croup, and I'd cradle them while rocking them back and forth and watching episode after episode of Star Trek or The Wire. It's the only way my wife could get any sleep. 

If you have a recliner that vibrates, it's almost as good. The motion and sound calms screaming babies. 

Also: take naps whenever the opportunity presents itself. When the baby falls asleep, you should be asleep if possible, or at least in bed relaxing. Like soldiers in combat, never give up a chance to grab 15 or 20 minutes' rest. 

After a few weeks, sleep deprivation will cause both of you to become short tempered with each other. *Do not take it personally*, it's just exhaustion and hormones talking. You or your wife may say things you regret. Pretend it didn't happen and move on with your lives is my advice. 

Make sure you have infant Tylenol, baby powder (EDIT: see end), moisturizer, and Mylicon on hand at all times. Those four things are like the WD40 and duct tape of infants, they will fix 95% of all problems. In a couple months, add Orajel to the list. Seriously, have these things in your pockets *at all times* when you leave the house with the baby. 

You will smell like formula for the next six months. Deal with it. 

Keep a cloth diaper close at hand at all times, and use it, especially if you are going to be within six feet of the baby and you are already dressed for work. If you are going to be holding the baby, put the diaper over your shoulder before putting the baby down. Basically, treat the diaper as a tarp and your baby as a leaky engine. Spread the tarp first so your engine doesn't spit up formula all over your nice clean driveway. 

And remember, this will all be worth it. Having kids is the best thing ever. Nothing else you do in your personal or professional life will ever be as important as being a good daddy. 

I hope this post doesn't come across as condescending. This is all just stuff I wish I'd known when I first had kids.

EDIT: I see a few Redditors pointing out that pediatricians are no longer recommending baby powder. Therefore, strike that and replace it with a good rash cream. I recommend Boudreaux's Butt Paste, which is the best rash cream I've ever used and is also lots of fun to say. Also, when you bust it out, make sure to tell your spouse/partner ""&lt;name of baby&gt; has a rash on his/her ash"", because saying the same exact joke every single time a given situation arises is a natural part of being a daddy and you might as well get used to it now.

True,alphtrion,,Saint-Henri,"We always have the downtown vs. suburbs discussion at work, and it usually boils down to living space. for the same amount of $$ you can get a bigger place in the suburbs or a smaller place downtown. you can find equivalent places both new and old. I could rent a new place for $1000+ close to downtown (let's say saint henri or griffintown) and it will probably be under 1000sqf, for the same amount I can rent a bigger place in the burbs. Newer places are soundproof (although some of the old ones too, depends) so that can solve the noise.

it also comes down to having the option to walk places or avoiding the rush hour traffic. Maybe you can get downton in 20 minutes on the 40 when there's no traffic, but try doing that around 8-9 AM or going back home around 5-6 and that 20 minutes will easily turn into an hour. 
while we're at it, not having a car can save you money (in terms of fuel, insurance, oil changes, winter tires, registration, etc), money that could go to pay that extra cost on rent (or mortgage). 
Living downtown also gives you the option to bike places in the summer (not necessarily for leisure, but as a mode of transport, or both!) which is often more efficient (and healthy) than driving/using public transport. this option doesn't always make sense in the suburbs (I know you can bike there too and many places have bike paths, but the focus in the suburbs is on leisure biking not necessarily as a mode of transport).

lastly (and maybe most importantly) it's the ""atmosphere"" of being around/closer to people or having the option of being around people when you want to. you can decide on a whim to go on a walk and you'll instantly be surrounded by a wide array of people and activities. Yes I know there are people in the suburbs as well, but since everything is so big and far and mostly residential, the ambiance isn't the same. 

in the end it depends on the person. some people like being downtown, some prefer the suburbs. to each their own. I know each 'camp' usually tries to justify their view (and you can guess to which view I subscribe) but in the end, whatever makes you feel more comfortable is what counts.",0,1356678814,,0,False,1,c7n78tw,t3_15k73y,t1_c7n78tw,t3_15k73y,,1435653160,5,False,montreal,t5_2qnmr,5

Reddit, please excuse if I pour my heart out right now. My Uncle has been one of the most amazing people in the world to me. My cousin (his son) died when I was 13 (his son was the same age). That kid was my brother, cousin and best friend. My Uncle started his own business, worked 7 days a week, and provided for both me and my cousin. Treated us like sons and loved us. He worked so much that my cousin and I barely knew he was gone. We barely knew him. When my cousin died, my mother kicked me out of my house at 15, two years after because I was fucking up. My Uncle and I, both needed that bond, grew together. He raised me. He basically adopted me, helped me through high school and college. 

I have always wanted to be like him. Raise a family and provide for them so they never have to know we are poor, never have to worry about having a house, food, or a family. I went to an amazing school and work an amazing job, but as of late, I talk to the most amazing man I have ever had the pleasure of growing up with and being raised by- taking me in when I needed it most - not enough. I come home, want to see the rest of my family and friends. I don't sit down with him enough. 

One of the things that he has always said to me so many times, and every once in awhile I forget about it with how busy work and life gets...but he says every once in awhile, ""Cats in the cradle J...I did it because I had to, but only do it if you need to.""

I am a better person because of this man. I work an amazing job that provides for a future family, my current family, and have an amazing education, but this song kills me every time because whenever I hear this song, i feel like I re-learn the lesson he had been trying to teach me this entire time...

True,Kinths,,,"I can try. 

Basically a scale is a bunch of notes that sound good together. Play any two notes in a scale that you know like they were a chord, notice how it sounds good despite you just making it up on the spot. Do it with another two notes from the same scale, sounds good again and it sounded right with the last thing you just played. OK now just play random singular notes in that scale over the top of those chords, now you are improvising a solo and you aren't hitting 2 million bum off sounding notes while doing it. 

Scales can be used to tell you what key you are playing in which is all sorts of useful. When you get into more complex music and start jamming with more experienced musicians a key will become how you communicate to each other what you are doing. If the other band members were playing in the key of A minor, you then know that any A minor scale will sound good over that. You will also learn to know what chords will sound good over that.

Any music you like will conform to a scale and key regardless of whether the writer knew it or not.

While Key and scales aren't exactly the same thing they do go hand in hand. For instance an A minor pentatonic would not give you every note in the A minor key mainly because it is Penta(which means 5) meaning there are only 5 different notes in the scale when you get to 6th note you are just starting again one octave higher. A C major scale though contains all the notes of the C major key. There are usually 7 different notes with in a key, 8 if you count the last note which is the same as the first but one octave higher in pitch.

If you broke down the chords of C, F and G into notes you would find that all the notes within them are in the C major scale, hence why these chords sound good together and hence why notes of the C major scale would sound good over them. 

Scales lead to everything they are really just ways of memorizing the notes within a Key for whatever reason you use them for. You don't need to know every single scale and mode (more complex scales for a later time) there is though.

What I found with most teachers when it comes to scales is they never explain them properly. They will say hey this is an A minor pentatonic they wont tell you the notes you are playing though only the fret positions and only one place to play it on the neck. They wont tell you how to work out you are in A minor either. For instance did you know that if you take any scale pattern and move the whole thing up or down a fret it changes the key? So take an A minor pentatonic which starts on the 5th fret move all that up to the 3rd fret and bam you have a G minor pentatonic. You work out the key in scales via the root note. Which in normal scales (not modes) is the first note you play. That 5th fret note you started on was an A when you moved it all up to the 3rd fret you started on a G so it became the G minor pentatonic.

This is where knowing the notes on the fretboard comes in handy because not only can you work out the key of your scales, but you can also completely de construct your scale into notes. If you play any of those notes together anywhere on the fretboard you are still playing within that scale and key. So no longer are you stuck to this little 3-4 fret box the whole neck is yours to mess around in. There is a quicker way to getting that knowledge of where notes are though which is scale shapes. 

If you already know any minor pentatonic scale take a look at this 
http://www.cyberfret.com/scales/minor-pentatonic/index.php

These are the 5 scale shapes of the minor pentatonic, that is how to play in any minor key right across the neck by just memorizing 5 patterns that all fit together. All you have to do to change key is move the whole pattern up or down a fret. What ever the first not of the first pattern is (the one pattern that starts on the 3rd fret in their examples) is your key. Learning the notes on the neck (which I explained in my original post) will still help you really understand it though.

If you want to learn your theory which I highly suggest you should do, then take a look at this guys work http://www.youtube.com/user/patdavidmusic/videos?view=1&amp;flow=grid

He will show you how to build scales from the ground up, how to build the most popular forms of chords and will teach you more about keys.
With theory just don't rush it, make sure you completely understand it before moving on, there is no exam and no need to speed your way through it. 

I know a lot of this sounds pretty daunting but it really is much easier to understand than this wall of text makes it seem, honestly once you have an understanding of it all come back and read this and you will be laughing at how much simpler it all was :P. Honestly I could probably condense this down a fair bit bit I have only just woken up so my brain is a bit mushy!

Also once you have learnt the basic structure of most of this stuff you will soon find tools that will make accessing it all much easier, things like the circle of fifths which is something that will help with all the notes of every key and the chords that go with them, the thing is you can't truly understand it until you understand what scale degrees are which you will learn when you learn how to build a scale in the videos I linked above.

Just please be sure to do so while adhering to the subreddit's [rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules). I'll try to address the already huge number of questions as best I can.

---

Alright, I'll attempt to address this question as best as I can. I'd like to do so covering a wider scope, such as including the unwillingness of the Japanese to surrender even before the use of nuclear weapons, when firebombing had already devastated most urban areas and Japan lost every engagement since Midway in 1942. I already know this is going to become a huge wall of text because I have always held a great interest in the Pacific theater, something made personal by my grandfather's own experience in the Navy.


I would first like to point out that your question is inherently controversial, as the exact motives behind the use of the nuclear bombs and whether or not it was necessary to bring about a Japanese surrender have been hotly debated. I'll try to explain and contextualize the issue as much as possible without being too subjective. I'll start by explaining the demand for unconditional surrender, how this was received by Japanese culture and leadership, and a timeline of what happened. Finally, I'll try to invoke some historiography to show the ongoing debates in the field, while keeping it as limited as possible as to not spiral out of control. Feel free to skip around if you're already familiar with a section.


**Unconditional Surrender and Total War**

The first atomic bomb, Little Boy, was dropped on Hiroshima August 6, 1945. The second, Fat Man, was dropped on Nagasaki three days later. The Japanese government had, since the months preceding, been very divided on the issue of surrender. Even though a growing segment wished to end the war, a key sticking point was the Allied demand for the unconditional surrender of all Axis powers. This doctrine, established by Roosevelt at the 1943 Casablanca conference, sought to tear out all the militant elements within the governments and societies of the Axis nations.


Unconditional surrender was not particularly popular among some Allied leaders, especially Churchill and several notable American generals such as Eisenhower. It was heavily debated throughout the conflict, and still remains one of the most controversial policies of the war. Steven Casey in *Cautious Crusade* has a whole chapter dedicated to the politics of unconditional surrender, and notes that historians have long debated over FDR's motives and the effects. Generally, it's believed that his fear was that if militant entities and institutions were allowed to remain postwar, future conflict would be inevitable, invoking the memory of the 1918 armistice with Germany. FDR himself explained, ""unconditional surrender means not the destruction of the German populace, nor the Italian or Japanese populace, but does mean the destruction of a philosophy in Germany, Italy, and Japan which is based on the conquest and subjugation of other people."" (Casey, 118). The Allies would avoid any uncertainty, decisively and completely winning the war, or it would keep fighting. It has been asserted that the move was also to keep Stalin from attaining any negotiated peace during a time when the US had yet to open a second front and casualties on the Eastern front were extreme (the announcement had taken place merely a few days after the conclusion of the Battle of Stalingrad). Truman, taking office in April 1945, believed that to go back on the demand of unconditional surrender would be a sign of weakness both to the American people and to the Japanese government, providing fuel for those who wished to continue the war. Critics believe unconditional surrender was a significant boost to Axis propaganda, leading them to fight more fanatically, and lengthened the duration of the war both in the European and Pacific theaters. Upon hearing of it, Nazi propaganda minister Goebbels exclaimed, ""I should never have been able to think up so rousing a slogan."" (Fleming, *Written in Blood*)


The means for which this surrender was to be achieved was total war - the complete mobilization of a nation's resources, including the conversion of its industry and drafting of citizens. The intention is not to just destroy the enemy military forces, but also to destroy their ability to make war. This leads to an incredibly blurred line between combatants and civilians. For instance, in order to destroy Japan's ability to make war, factories in densely populated urban centers were targeted. By extension, civilians in industrial areas could themselves even be viewed as ""legitimate"" targets. By the end of the war, cities were being routinely bombed into submission in an effort to break the will of the government and people to fight.


**Japanese War Culture**


The notion of unconditional surrender is a central aspect of understanding why Japan remained undeterred amid extensive bombing campaigns, and to a lesser extent, why Germany fought until the fall of Berlin. However, also key to this understanding is contemporary Japanese honor culture.


Even today, Japanese culture is often referred to as a shame society. This essentially reflects on the idea of honor as a societal control. Particular to Japan is the concept of the Bushido, referred to as the way of the samurai or warrior. At its militant extreme, it impressed the duty of the Japanese to die for the nation, and turned war into an almost religious principle. Indeed, the Emperor was considered to be the leader of the Shinto religion, and a direct descendant of a Shinto deity. Propaganda also made the United States appear to be a nation of barbarians, and laughable accusations became a commonly held perception. This would lead to the tenacity with which Japanese soldiers fought, often to the death, and actions such as kamikaze attacks and mass suicides. Allied casualties were extremely high compared to Europe, and Japanese garrisons rarely accepted surrender. Officers, particularly duty-bound by these notions, would be more likely to commit suicide than surrender.


As the Japanese became notorious for fighting even when severely wounded, using a variety of surprise tactics, Marines also began to adopt a no-prisoners stance. According to Wikipedia, out of 22,060 defenders on Iwo Jima, 21,844 were killed and 216 taken prisoner. Fanaticism was not limited to soldiers: after the invasion of Saipan, several hundred civilians jumped off a cliff to their death rather than be captured. In Goldberg's *D-Day in the Pacific*, first-hand accounts are given: ""We had an LST in the water asking them not to jump. There were a lot of women and kids. They were Japanese nationals stationed on Saipan and they just committed suicide. They would throw the kids, then the wife would jump and then he would jump."" (202)

**The Pacific Theater**



Okay, so I've already touched on this, but it's worth providing an overview of events in the Pacific Theater, if only to outline how utterly screwed Japan was, how savagely they were bombed, yet how ferociously they fought and refused unconditional surrender. Japan began its expansion in 1931 with the invasion of Manchuria, followed by the invasion of China in 1937. The Japanese considered the Chinese inferior, and as historical enemies, they perpetrated such acts as the [Nanking Massacre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanking_Massacre) in which some 300,000 people were killed in the Chinese capital city. Other warcrimes include the creation of the secret [Unit 731](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731), which conducted thousands of human experiments.


These acts caused tensions with the US to grow significantly, and turn American public opinion. The US as well as other Western nations began supplying China, while the US cut oil exports to Japan. Japan saw war as an inevitability and struck first at Pearl Harbor, also attacking other territories such as Wake Island and the Philippines. However, after the US won a decisive victory at the Battle of Midway June 6 1942 (a victory that historians and military strategists are still amazed was achieved), Japan never won another significant battle or engagement. It was essentially the Stalingrad of the Pacific, and Japan's [empire](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b3/Japanese_Empire_%28orthographic_projection%29.svg) began to crumble. According to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_empires#Maps), it peaked at 7.4 million sq km, larger than the height of Nazi Germany and fascist Italy (or the Roman Empire, for that matter). For comparison, the land area of Japan today is just [364,485 sq km](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2147.html#ja), at 5% or 1/20th of its peak size.


As US forces island-hopped their way to the home islands, it embarked on a bombing campaign that caused such destruction and loss of life, it actually makes the nuclear bombings pale in comparison. That is quite a bold statement. But, in a single night, some 100,000 civilians were burned alive in Tokyo as a result of massive firebombing raid. This was some 20,000-40,000 more deaths than from the [atomic bombing of Nagasaki.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki#The_bombing_2) Japanese cities were largely wooden, and the devastation that incendiary bombs caused to Japanese cities is indescribable. Anyone interested in geopolitics during the Cold War should watch the documentary Fog of War, an interview of former SecDef Robert McNamara, but it also has an incredibly powerful section about the bombing of Japan that everyone curious about the Pacific Theater should watch: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmJDj-oLYyM

**Endgame - The Decision to Use the Bomb**


With the invasions of Iwo Jima and Okinawa, considered home islands, and the continued bombings of Japanese cities, the desire to surrender became increasingly pervasive in Japanese leadership. However, if they were to do so, they demanded to do so on their own terms. They believed that if they could hold out longer, or even more, lure American forces to invade the home islands in a costly fight, they could negotiate a better settlement. One of the key sticking points was the Empire's ability to retain its power structure, including the position of Emperor.


On the other hand, the United States was already looking to the postwar period, with its eyes on the USSR. Though there had been several border disputes and scuffles between the USSR and Japan, they had remained at peace. It was well known that this wouldn't last, and the original postwar settlement would leave Japan divided in the same way Germany and Korea were. In total, the US essentially had three options: invade, blockade, or bomb. Operation Downfall, the proposed invasion, would have been the largest and deadliest operation of the entire war. The geography of the islands meant few landing sites would be suitable - which the Japanese knew. Women and children were taught how to use bamboo spears for a last line of defense (http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/fl20071208a1.html). In response, the US began stockpiling chemical weapons for use in urban areas ahead of invasion - weapons which were thankfully never needed or deployed.  It's commonly pointed out that so many Purple Heart medals for combat injuries were made in preparation, that even to this day after every conflict since, the US has yet to produce more. The option of blockading was considered preferable to many, as it would essentially starve all of Japan without risking US lives. However, it still would not be a certain way to induce surrender, and would have taken months if not longer even if it did succeed. During this period, the Soviets would be mounting their own offensives and gaining influence in the Pacific. While the US engaged both in blockades and firebombing, it found itself no closer to gaining unconditional surrender. So, the nuclear bomb, a creation of the Manhattan Project begun in 1942, was decided upon.


On August 6th, at 8:15 local time, Little Boy was dropped over Hiroshima. From Hasegawa's *Racing the Enemy - Stalin, Truman, and the Surrender of Japan*, pg 179-180: ""Little Boy exploded 1,900 feet above the courtyard of Shima Hospital, 550ft off its target...with a yield equivalent to 12,500 tons of TNT. The temperature at ground zero reached 5,400F, immediately creating a fireball within half a mile, roasting people 'to bundles of smoking black char in a fraction of a second as their internal organs boiled away.' ...Of 76,000 buildings in Hiroshima, 70,000 were destroyed. Fire broke out all over the city...people walked aimlessly in eerie silence, many black with burns, the skin peeling from their bodies...thousands of dead bodies floated in the river. Then the black rain fell, soaking everyone with radiation...by the end of 1945, 140,000 had perished.""

**The Surrender**


In the months leading up to the bombing of Hiroshima on August 6, Japanese leadership had become increasingly divided, though few would publicly speak about their misgivings. In May, Japan's supreme council, known as the Big Six, voted 5-1 in favor of ""the extinction of Japan to any taint of compromise."" (Frank's *Downfall: The end of the Imperial Japanese Empire*, 94). After the loss of Okinawa, Emperor Hirohito's faith had been shaken. He assembled his council and declared, ""I desire that concrete plans to end the war, unhampered by existing policy, be speedily studied and that efforts made to implement them."" However, though this illustrated a movement towards the acceptance of a surrender, the council failed to reach any agreement. (Asada's *Culture Shock and Japanese-American Relations*, 192-193) In July, the Prime Minister rejected the Potsdam Declaration, which concluded with the line, ""We call upon the government of Japan to proclaim now the unconditional surrender of all Japanese armed forces, and to provide proper and adequate assurances of their good faith in such action. The alternative for Japan is prompt and utter destruction.""


Hasegawa notes that the use of the bomb was the best possible outcome to Truman, solving the problem of unconditional surrender, invasion, and Soviet interference. For the Japanese, news of the bomb led to complete disarray. Asada states that many in the army and Japan's R&amp;D board denied that an atomic bomb had been used, or even that it was possible that one could have been developed so soon. Information from Hiroshima was limited, as the infrastructure had already been significantly damaged even before the 6th. However, both Asada and Hasegawa note that by that evening, and certainly by the following day, little doubt remained. Asada argues that acceptance of American technological superiority helped the army ""save face"" and ""smoothed their acceptance of surrender"" - a minister tried to persuade the military by pleading, ""if we say we lost a scientific war, the people will understand"" (Asada, 197).


On August 9th, the USSR declared war on Japan and Soviet armor poured into Manchuria. Coupled with the use of the atomic bomb, this utterly crippled the hope of continuing the war effort. Though Japanese forces mounted a strong defense, they were quickly pushed back. Yet, the supreme council still held on to hope that it could negotiate with the Soviets, refusing to officially declare war. Though the Prime Minister and other civilian leaders now openly declared that Japan should surrender, military leaders wished to continue the fight. Even after the bombing of Nagasaki on August 9th, the supreme council still tried to push for maintaining the position of Emperor, and there was a 3-3 split for three other conditions: war criminal trials would be conducted by the Japanese, self-disarmament, and that occupation (particularly of Tokyo) should be avoided or limited wherever possible. (Hasegawa 204, Frank 291). The short span of time between bombings as well as Allied threats were made to give the impression that the US already had a stockpile of the weapons when in actuality it only had the two. A third would have come ""sometime after August 19, and then the fourth bomb in the beginning of September,"" (Hasegawa 298). It was only until the morning of the 10th that the Foreign Ministry sent telegrams saying it would accept the Potsdam Declaration and unconditional surrender after Hirohito himself demanded the war's end. Even then, there was an [attempted coup](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ky%C5%ABj%C5%8D_Incident) by a segment of the military leadership, which invaded the imperial palace and nearly killed the Prime Minister, as well as other senior officials. On August 15, the emperor officially announced the surrender worldwide. Many pockets of Japanese soldiers still continued to fight, and many military officers chose suicide over surrender. By 1947, a new constitution was written, and while the emperor was maintained as ceremonial figurehead, the Empire of Japan was formally dissolved.

**Contentions in Historiography**


Whether it was the use of nuclear weapons or Soviet invasion that more forcefully led to surrender has been hotly debated between historians. Hasegawa places greater emphasis on the Soviet invasion, suggesting that Japan would likely have stood steadfast under multiple atomic bombings as it had done in the face of firebombing. Asada directly references and disputes his account, claiming that nuclear weapons and the threat they posed to the homeland reflected a much more ""direct"" impetus to end the war rather than the invasion of Manchuria, and offered an easier way out for the leadership. Further, they came as a complete surprise to Japanese leadership, whereas eventual conflict with the USSR was expected. Frank's account, and most other anti-revisionist historians support this thesis.


However, it is the motives behind the bombs' use that has been the most greatly contested aspect of the event. Such works as Blackett's *Fear, War and the Bomb* asserted the now famous notion that ""the dropping of the atomic bombs was not so much the last military act of the Second World War as the first major operation of the Cold War with Russia."" Alperovitz's *Atomic Diplomacy: Hiroshima and Potsdam* similarly asserts that the use of the bomb was for diplomatic posturing opposite the Soviets. Asada notes that viewing the use of the bomb almost exclusively in the context of postwar hegemony over the USSR has been prevalent among Japanese academics. Frank's *Downfall* is itself written in part to counter such ""revisionist""  scholarship that attributes the use of the bombs to political rather than military goals. Other works, such as Maddox's *Hiroshima in History* and Giangreco's *Hell to Pay* are were also written as a response to revisionist histories, claiming that use of the bombs directly avoided what MacArthur called ""a hard and bitter struggle with no quarter asked or given."" (Giangreco 204) Still other historians have focused on other aspects of this debate; Skates in *The Invasion of Japan: Alternative to the Bomb* explains how massive and bloody an undertaking Downfall would have been, but asserts that ""designed as a political statement that German and Japanese militarism would be eradicated...unconditional surrender drove the war to extremes of violence in 1945 and made the atomic bomb seem almost a benign alternative to an invasion."" (Skates 252).

True,AustinTreeLover,,,"I used to work at a program for college students with disabilities. They lived in our dorms and we mentored them and helped them with tutoring and life skills. 

Some of the parents were completely out of line. They did things like call the student a dozen times a day (not an exaggeration), show up outside classrooms, even following kids from class. 

Now, to be fair, these were kids with challenges. However, to be in the program, they had to be able to live safely on their own (they were higher functioning people with Asperger's) and they had access to 24 hour onsite staff. Like RA's. But, we were trained to minimize our presence in their lives and respect boundaries, thus teaching the students appropriate boundaries. That's a hard thing to teach when mom and dad are constantly undermining you with their crazy stalking tactics. 

We had a rule that cell phones had to be turned off in the building. One of the dads called me *screaming*, ""I WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO KEEP ME FROM CONTACTING MY SON AT ANY TIME!"" Never mind that there were thirty landlines in the office in case of emergency or that the kid could simply call him back or flip the phone on in an emergency. The mother of that kid (he was slightly MR, perfectly capable of living on his own) insisted he call her when he left his apt., when he got on the bus, when he got in the class, when he got back on the bus, and then, when he got home again. She had him put the phone up to the door so she could hear it click when he locked it. He had to call repeatedly throughout the day and his parents would often call him in class and tutoring sessions. If he didn't pick up, the mom would cry and say things like, ""I thought you might be dead!"" 

Yes, these kids had delays, but that's more reason to give them a fighting chance at being independent. The parents had often invested so much of their own lives in the kid's life that they couldn't let go. They were terrified all the time that their masterpieces would get scratched. But, we all get scratched in life. Denying them that part of life is arguably cruel. They don't learn coping skills. They're weak and scared, when they needed to be the strongest, bravest of all of us. 

I had four or five students whose parents monitored their keyboards and had tracking on their kid's cell phones. Even had one mother who would instruct her son to put his phone in his pocket while she was still on the line so she could listen in on his therapy sessions. She also paid women to date him. When the kid had to leave the program (we couldn't help him), she said I was doing the typical ""blame the parent"" thing. I was blaming the parent, but it wasn't typical. We know that kids are pretty well programmed from birth on a lot of things and it's not usually the parents fault. Great parents can end up with messed up kids. But, in these extreme — but increasingly more common — cases, the parent is making matters worse. I consider the more extreme cases like these to be a form of abuse. 

These parents typically repeat ""But, I love him/her so much!"" But, their motives are not about love for the child, their motives are about their own peace of mind. Their peace of mind supersedes doing what is needed, but maybe painful, to allow the child to become an adult. That's a selfish act. They *do* love the kid, but their actions are self-motivated. They want to alleviate their own fear and anxiety, which is understandable, but no more excusable than taking too much Xanax for the same purpose. 

In my business, we always ask, ""What are you reinforcing?"", when we interact with a student. These parents are reinforcing ""You are weak and incapable of being an adult and you should be fearful at all times."" That's kinda mean, you know? 

All this being said, sometimes parents just don't know what is appropriate. We take for granted that parents are supposed to know everything. We don't consider any other job like that. We don't assume someone would know how to be a mechanic, for instance, just because they have a car. 

Walking that line between being a respectfully helpful and caring parent and being a helicopter parent is hard to master. So, I ended up implementing a program within the program to educate parents and help them figure this out. We did training, which included role-playing scenarios. We had some hard set rules and boundaries, we referred parents to counselors, etc. It helped a lot, except in extreme cases. Sadly, sometimes the parents were responsible for getting a student removed from the program. 

And as someone who was completely neglected and abandoned by drug addicted, loser parents, I'm not suggesting there aren't extremes on the other end. Neglect is as or more damaging than helicopter parenting, no doubt. Balance is needed and it's hard to find sometimes. 

Edit: I'm going to stop answering questions about this now. It's getting late and I never intended to highjack the thread. I had no idea this many people would read this. I just fired it off, kind of laughing remembering the stories and really only expected five or six people to read it. A few things to clear up: 1) I am not some saint. I was paid to do my job and even though I enjoyed it very much, I'm not some type of Mother Theresa and didn't mean to come across that way. Thanks for the nice words anyway. 2) I am referring here to extreme cases that I saw over many years. I see a big distinction between misguided parents (like I have been at times) and parents who are bordering on abuse in their actions. If mom or dad insists you wear a jacket when you're not cold, that's normal parent stuff and it bothered all of us as kids. 3) I don't want to answer personal questions about family/friends. I'm not a psychologist and I wouldn't want to give someone personal advice beyond really general statements.  

Edit: To those who are worried about confidentiality, I changed some details and this program is not in the city where I presently live and this all happened many years ago. In fact, the examples happened at different programs. To those who asked me for details about the program, this is why I can't give that out.

True,sandwich_witch,,,"I am not excusing rudeness, but here it is from the perspective of a hot young girl:

You go through your childhood without any sexual overtures being made at you (hopefully). You wear jeans with reinforced knees and hair clips. The only thing anyone expects of your looks is to wipe the ketchup off your face once in a while and maybe bathe sometimes. Life is good.

Then you hit puberty and start to sprout lumps and bumps and you have no idea what to do with any of them, but everyone is noticing and commenting and making you very very aware of them. Your clothes stop fitting, your friends are putting black goop on their eyelashes and that awful fruity lip gloss that tastes like microwaved jelly beans, and worst of all, boys are *looking* at you. Not just the old ""ew, a girl, cooties!"" looking. They are looking at your chest and your behind and everything in between. The rude ones will comment and the even ruder ones will get grabby. You feel scared and inexplicably dirty. 

As you grow, those boys will get bolder and pushier. And not just boys-- men, years or even decades older than you. They will look you up and down, analyzing your body like you are a shelf in the supermarket. They yell at you from cars and construction sites and sidewalks, leer at you in class, even insult you online (TITS or GTFO anyone?). You may have your first boyfriend. If you're lucky, he won't pressure you into sex before you're ready. If you're lucky, your friends won't find out and call you a slut or a whore or God knows what else.

You keep growing. You learn caution and who to ignore. You may become a little paranoid-- that nice man behind the checkout counter, is he making small talk or flirting? Did he just look at your chest again? You remember the time you were nice to that boy in class who invited you to a party and then tried to reach up your dress. You have the sinking feeling that the way you look makes you public property, diminishing anything else you might have to offer.

And yes, some girls will get rude, or touchy, or jump to conclusions, because they have been through this so many times it has become a wall, a suit of armor, to protect themselves. Even if they have nothing to fear, they don't know you, and fear is one of the first things women are taught to carry with them. It isn't you-- it's what led up to it.

True,FairlyGoodGuy,,,"Easy: the night we made the decision to keep our two foster boys.

About two and a half years ago we got our first foster care placement. They were two boys: a 3 year-old I'll call Kevin, and a 7 year-old I'll call Johnny. We were told very little about them except that they had been abused and neglected. We already had one son, a 4 year-old, so we had been very clear with the placement agency that we would only take kids compatible with him. The State lied to us (via omission) so that we would take the boys.

Over the following weeks we learned just how messy this placement was. Two different fathers. A drug-addicted, bi-polar mother. Many years in the system. Several prior foster care placements. And if that weren't enough, Johnny had severe behavioral and mental health disorders that were ""under control"" only because his corrupt psychiatrist had him on so many meds that he turned into a drooling zombie by 6:30pm each night. Johnny never should have been allowed into our home, but there he was.

We got along for a while. We adjusted Johnny's meds, started him in therapy, and tried to help him as best we could. Meanwhile his brother Kevin was completely subservient to him. Kevin rarely spoke, but overall he was a good kid. He was scared -- of his new home and his increasingly violent brother.

Things started to fall apart about 8 weeks in. The honeymoon period wore off and Johnny's behaviors started to come out. Have you ever been called a mother fucker by a 7 year-old? It's startling. School started. He tore up classrooms, yelled, hit teachers. At home he damaged his bedroom walls, tried to break his window, and got violent toward me.

It wasn't an every day thing. Rather, it tended to happen once every 3 or 4 days, on average. Sometimes more frequently, sometimes less. We had no idea what to do. We wanted to help these boys, but this wasn't what we signed up for.

Finally one night about 3.5 months into the placement, my wife and I went into our bedroom, shut the door, and had The Talk. We committed to deciding, right then and there, if we were keeping the boys or throwing them out. We wanted to keep Kevin and send Johnny away to get the help he so clearly needed, but the State wouldn't do it. The boys *had* to stay together, they said. Never mind how destructive Johnny's presence was to Kevin. Kevin needed us. He was bonding with us and with our son. But Johnny...

My wife and I talked for a long time. We broke down the issues one by one, analyzed them, weighed the pros and cons. Eventually we sat in silence and we both knew it was time to take a vote. If it was anything but unanimous, then the boys would leave. It was all or nothing. Both my wife and I said ""I'm in"".

After that we went on the offensive. We attacked the State for every damn service imaginable. We forced them to approve a new psychiatrist, new therapy plans, new educational plans at school, a higher monthly stipend, and more. They gave us almost everything we demanded because they knew they'd never find another home as committed to these boys as we were. We committed ourselves to Johnny with everything we had.

One year later we adopted Johnny and Kevin after their birth parents relinquished parental rights. And a year after that, here we are. Kevin is doing phenomenal. He and our first son are best friends and he's smart as hell. He's going to be an engineer one day. Johnny is still Johnny, but we're making gradual progress. He hasn't been sent home from school at all this year, and home life is at least mostly stable, if not idyllic.

So did we make the right decision that fateful night just over two years ago? I think so, yes. Kevin would have been destroyed had we thrust him back into the foster care system. And who knows if Johnny would have ever received the stability he so badly needs. He sure hadn't received it up to that point. This isn't the family I dreamt of. But I'm a stronger, better father as a result of all of this, and my family is happy and healthy. This is the hand we were dealt, and I'm not too proud to say that I think we've played it as best we could.",0,1356717952,,0,False,4,c7ndlns,t3_15kou7,t1_c7ndlns,t3_15kou7,,1430792338,2848,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,2848

From a visual effects perspective, the film was hit or miss, and some of the omissions from the book where hard to swallow, but understandable.

True,jayurbzz,,,"I'm going to drop some information I learned in a wonderful book called Tobacco by Iain Gately along with some other research I've done.

Tobacco's a wonderful subject of study--it comes from a beautiful, spiritual, ritualistic, shamanic use in the Americas (and ONLY the Americas), and slowly devolved into what we know it today: gross, and hardly even tobacco anymore. When Europeans first saw it, there was no word for smoking, they compared it to ""drinking smoke.""

In the Christian days pre-soap, it makes sense snuff was popular: smoke and fire was that of the devil, and in these days of seeing the New World, explorers were coming back with stuff like cocoa and who knows what other snuff-able leaves from the Americas. They were being bombarded with hundreds of different native rituals for handfuls of new substances, and in order to separate themselves from the 'savages,' new subcultures were developed. (Sidenote: nicotine in tobacco plants naturally gets stronger/more concentrated the further north you go in America, thus why in Virginia, Native Americans pass the peace pipe--you need time to recover from that hit--while down in say, the Amazon, it's not so strong and they're puffing on cigars)

Italian priests would administer the use of the smoke only for certain reasons. France believed tobacco prolonged beauty and well-being, Germans found it to be of the devil, while the English used it for pure pleasure. In Prussia, most were forced to use snuff depending on the ruler; not everyone was down with the devil's herb. 

In France during their Revolution, snuffing was more of a royal/aristocratic past-time, so anyone snuffing was beheaded--smoking was the proletariat way of consuming the stuff, as demonstrated in enough visual art of the time (especially in Holland). It was also thought tobacco smoke would fend off the plague, treat syphilis pain, and suppress appetites. It's said that it was normal for a mother to pack a pipe full of tobacco for their children to take to school for lunch. In a time when gluttony was a big deal, tobacco was a godsend (even the Japanese, minimalist Zen, loved the stuff. THE WHOLE FUCKING WORLD GOT ADDICTED TO THIS SHIT!). Let's not forget the Ottoman Empire hated the stuff, around 25,000 suspected early smokers were put to death.

Then a bunch of French artists/writers cruised down to Spain, where it was the style for women to roll *papelotes*. The French being the French, they took it back home where people were down to roll tobacco up in papers (ZigZags, anyone?). The term ""Stogie"" comes from the Canestoga cigar.

It became a parlor game after that--who's got the fanciest snuff box, the nicest pipe, how you blow the smoke out, etc. But there was a huge disconnect between upper and lower classes, and that showed in how you smoked. Most men had smoking jackets and even smoking rooms in their manors.

Then in America, meanwhile, the colonies make the first brand of tobacco to start making more money in the Old World. The Puritans try to ban it at some point, they make ridiculous laws saying you're only allowed to smoke one time per day, and not in public, etc.  American Revolution, anyone? After Ben Franklin seduced the French PM's wife and they agreed to come aid the colonies, we gave them five motherfucking million pounds of tobacco as collateral. FIVE MILLION POUNDS. I don't know what you think about that, but a normal bag of rollie tobacco is like 30 grams. So the UK wants to tax America on its tobacco, and the US says fuck you, and the Boston Tea Party should be more the Tea &amp; Smoke party.

It wasn't until after we were married that she realized that she had a problem.  It tooks years for her to realize that her eating disorder was a means of having some type of control in her life and that her parents neurotic behavior was fueling her disorder.  It didn't help that we were 21 when we married, I was in the military gone on training missions constantly, and that she was alone on a regular basis.  Her parents would call all the goddamn time but would only do it when I wasn't there.  I thought it would be as simple as unplugging the phone... nope.  When they did get a call in, they would send her on guilt trips about not wanting to talk to them, being selfish, fucking on and on and on.  13 years and our own two kids later, they have finally relaxed, a little.  They still try to control and interject but my wife found the strength to draw a line in the sand.  What was weird is when they couldn't control their own daughter they would try to control my oldest.  My wife was concerned about how upset I should have been with the whole situation.  I kept telling her there's not a lot I can do and the only thing that will stop this is her parents change in behavior.

Because my wife didn't return her father's phone calls for six hours and he wanted to talk to me and ask if I knew where she was.

I have been walking on my own two feet independently since I was eleven or twelve. When I moved to a new high school at sixteen, my mother wanted me to take the wheelchair ramp rather than the front three stairs. She begged me to use an elevator to travel between the two levels of the building. She paid for a taxi to take me to school rather than allow me to go on the bus because the bus refused to pick me up outside my door. When I chose to take the bus a year later, she insisted on picking me up at the bus stop in the winter because she didn't want me walking near ice.


I found a pair of shoes that had less than an inch of a heel on them and she would panic whenever she saw me in them. She pleaded me not to wear them to school.


Aside from my walking, she begged teachers to photocopy notes for me because my hands are awkward with a pencil. However, I had a notebook computer that allowed me to type my notes, and that solved the problem.


This mother used to dress me and do my hair for me even in junior high and wouldn't let me learn how to take care of myself. Today, I have a strained relationship with her because I feel like I'm her doll rather than her daughter and that I must always be perfect. 

It is my biggest hope to move far away from home in the upcoming year solely so I can get away from her.

I've had boyfriends, I've learned how to groom myself and apply make up, I can shop for my own clothing, and I can get around on my legs.

True,Alzael,,,"&gt;how can I argue that human freewill to CHOOSE hell is still incompatible with the concept of a hell, OR, is my reasoning fallacious?

Free will is a phrase that Christians like to try and abuse as a means of excusing their god. Unfortunately you're right. The concept of free will is completely incompatible with thei faith, for several reasons.

1.The bible outright tells them we don't have free will. Throughout the entire bible we are told that god decides everything and that everything happens according to his will. At least twice we are told that what you do doesn't matter, god chose who would go to heaven or hell before we were even born. Try it, ask them to point to even one part in the bible where it's said that we have free will.

2.Even if we did have ""free will"" god messes with it all the time. God constantly overrides the will of people in order to make them do things. One of the best examples is in the story of Moses. For those who actually the book you see that Pharoah does not refuse to release the slaves when moses asks. God overrides his will and forces him to refuse so that he would have an excuse to punish the egyptians and demonstrate his power. 

3.What Christians call ""free will"" is simply nothing of the sort. Free will requires that it have no constraints or conditions. But the ability to choose does have a massive condition attached to it. We have to make the choices god wants us to, otherwise we're punished for it. So it's not really ""free"" so much as it is ""circumstantial"". We are allowed to behave as we want only so long as it falls within a narrow margin of behaviour.

4.If god is omniscient then free will simply cannot exist.

5.If god is omnipotent then the idea of free will is ridiculous. As mentioned above god routinely interferes with human free will for his own purposes. This is because nothing can happen that an omnipotent being doesn't allow. Everything can only happen the way that he wants things to happen because anything else would not or could not happen. So our choices are only because he allows them.

There are quite a few other logical problems as well, but those are the ones that immediately jump out. I would also ask them how they decide that god is just.

Turn it around on them. Ask them if their own children or family members could commit any crime so horrible they feel it would warrant eternal punishment. How can a just god justify such actions? God is supposedly an all-loving parent, but when was punishing your child more important to a parent than loving them?

&gt;So in this case, according to them, it is not God that 'sends' people to Hell, they themselves make this decision.

It was their god who created that hell in the first place. It is their god who lets them go (again, would you ever let any of your loved ones go into eternal torment?Would you not stop them). It's god who created them as they are, imperfect and capable of sinning even though there was no reason he had to do it that way. It's god who knew this sort of thing would happen (a lot). It's god who set the rules.

That's the thing with an omnipoten being, ultimately the buck always stops with him. Nothing can happen unless he allows it or makes it that way.",0,1356741351,,0,False,1,c7njtfx,t3_15lezi,t1_c7njtfx,t3_15lezi,,1430795352,15,False,TrueAtheism,t5_2soy6,15

I agree, the cast is best when I'm just ""myself,"" but MAN, I wish I could convey just how tiresome it gets reading the same old negative bullshit that flows through my chat day after day. For a guy like me who tends to wear his heart on his sleeve, it really starts to wear down your mental defenses. Doing an upbeat, interactive broadcast, 5 days a week, sometimes for 10+ hours a day... you're bound to get burnt out. The interactive part is the key. Ever try to stay positive and charismatic while reading comments telling you how terrible you look that day, or how badly you suck at a particular game? Once or twice is fine, I can deal with that. It's just when it becomes a daily routine of reading this shit. One can pretend to not notice these comments only so many times.

The sub-only chat was such a brilliant, albeit double-edged, solution to the chat issue. It got rid of the spammers, the random blatant racist/homophobic comments, and generally made the chat room a MUCH more enjoyable place to hang out. And yes, it also was a huge boost to my channel financially, as subscriber numbers went way up. On the other hand, making the chat room sub-only full time, basically made me into Twitch Hitler in the eyes of many viewers. I received many complaints through email, twitter, facebook, even in other Twitch chatrooms. While watching another Twitch broadcaster, one guy even linked me this wonderful cartoon he made regarding the issue: http://i.imgur.com/qP9Yt.jpg In the end, I decided to get rid of sub-only chat, because of all the excess bullshit it was stirring up.

All I can say is that I'm sorry for not being a more reliable caster these days. I feel like I've plateaued with my broadcast, and I've really let MvG derail from my original vision. With the coming new year, I will be striving to get back to what MvG was originally all about.

True,Formicidae,,,"This game doesn't give you *anything*.

There's no god-damn tutorial in this game.  They tell you what the buttons do, then they give you a fucking huge boss to take down.  And you die almost immediately.  Even the ""easy"" enemies kill you.  You have to fucking struggle with it, try out new weapons, new strategies, and come up with some way to kill even the most basic shit on your own.

But the fucking *boss fights* are stupidly difficult, and there are no clues on how to beat them.  Not even a single, ""Oh, the weak point is *here!*"" to give you a fucking leg up against Huge Asshole.  Oh, just one?  No, we'll make you fight a HANDFUL of (begrudgingly cool-looking) bosses at the same time.  Fucking deaths all the time.  And like the rest of the damn combat, you have to adapt and rethink your strategy *every fucking time* you die, until you finally beat whatever fuck-shit-awful boss you're on.

And then you get invaded.  As if the game wasn't difficult enough, now there are *other players* coming in to wreck your shit for shits and giggles.  Other players that have probably played longer than you, probably have better equipment, and probably know how to fight better than you do.  And you just have to fucking *deal with them*, trying to beat them.

There are no fucking maps at all.  No compass telling you where you're going.  No waypoint marker showing you the correct route to take to get to the boss.  No, this fucking game makes you explore, makes you look around at the (begrudgingly gorgeous) landscape to figure out where you are, makes you fall into traps and get murdered and all kinds of shit.  You can eventually unlock shortcuts, but they're to places you've *already fucking been to*.  By that time, you already *know* how to get around that place, and you just want to get to the *end*.

So maybe you start over, now that you know how to build your stats better and what weapon you like.

And you cruise through the first few enemies, because they seem easier after learning so much about combat.

And you sail through the first boss, because you've learned the right strategy.

And invaders get ever easier, with your combat skills improving.

And as you effortlessly navigate through previously unknown territory, you recognize areas *far* off in the distance that you've already learned how to conquer.

And then you look further, and realize just how much more of the game you have yet to experience.

And you look forward to every second of it.

This game is great.  It's one of those rare games that teaches you how to win as you play, and bombards you with difficult challenges to overcome.  Such a frustrating, controller-breaking, *satisfying* gaming experience.

Changing who you are is not an easy thing to do and for people who happen to have traits which are not deemed attractive it can be a real challenge to get the other gender interested. 

It is more the fact that to ""nice guys"" it seems like dating is a dead end because everywhere they turn they get put into the friendzone.   It is rarely just one girl that ever causes a guy to get down about the friendzone. It's usually a culmination of multiple rejections.  And one of the problems with multiple rejections is that it destroys your confidence which in turn makes it harder to get a girl.  

Probably one of the greatest ironies of dating is that the guys who are the best at getting girls are the ones who have already been through a couple relationships because it is easier to be confident when you are successful.  

I don't think people who haven't had to face large scale rejection can actually understand what it is like.  It's easy to make fun of someone else's problems when you have no frame of reference.

True,MattTheGr8,neuro,Cognitive Neuroscience,"Thanks for the compliment, and thanks to misspixel for the links.

One quick thing I thought I'd note -- in a sense we actually understand the brain very well nowadays, and in another sense we don't understand it well at all (and, to some extent, might never understand it fully). Technology, compared to the brain, is extremely logical, orderly, and simple -- even the most complicated electronics behave in a much more straightforward and orderly manner than any biological system.

The problem, when you boil it down, is essentially mathematical. The number of neurons and connections between them in a brain, and hence the possible patterns of firing, creates a system so vastly complex it is nearly impossible to describe. And there is very little intrinsic organization -- when you get right down to it, you can't really assign a specific function to most neurons in the brain even if you know EVERYTHING about their behavior, because you will find that they fire to varying degrees for all kinds of different situations/stimuli. Let's say it's a cell in a visual area. How do you slap an easy semantic label onto a cell that fires 97 times/second for a picture of Jennifer Aniston, 64 times/second for a picture of your dad, 121 times/second for the number 7 in Times New Roman, 88 times/second for a pink square, and 217 times/second for a particular dot pattern that doesn't look like anything in particular? (That is just a dumb made-up example, but it's not too far from the truth.)

The thing is, in technology, things are simple because we design how information is encoded in a very clear and straightforward way, e.g., if this thing over here has a high voltage, that's a 1, if it's a low voltage, that's a 0, etc. Even if you have very many components, the way information is encoded in them follows a set of relatively simple and unambiguous rules. If a pattern of voltages goes high-low-high-high-low, then that's 42. Easy-peasy.

But in the brain, encoding is not simple. Let's say you want to know how you encode the concept of ""dog."" Well, there might be a few million neurons that contribute to the representation of that concept. But they don't all have to be active to experience the concept. And they don't even all contribute equally -- the likely (extremely simplified) story is that each of those neurons might have a numerical weight associated with it, and if you multiply each neuron's weight by its current firing rate, and add up all those products, you get a single number. And that number might effectively express the extent to which you are experiencing ""dogness"" at that particular time. There is absolutely nothing clear-cut about how the information is represented; in a sense, the concept of ""dogness"" is always present in your mind to some degree, but most of the time the number is very low and only occasionally, when triggered by some other stimulus or thought, does it rise above the threshold of consciousness.

Now this is somewhat conjecture above, but it's very educated conjecture and I think most neuroscientists would basically agree with what I wrote. So it's not about us not understanding how the brain works per se; it's that there is no language to possibly describe how that concept of dogness is represented, except possibly with a very large numerical matrix representing every aspect of every neuron, which you could only hope to fill out with some kind of crazy future technology (nanobots?) that does not come close to existing right now.

And of course, you have to consider the fact that most/all those neurons that participate in the concept of ""dogness"" participate to varying degrees in other representations/processes/memories as well. And there are ZILLIONS of those other representations/processes/memories in the typical brain. And of course, that brain is theoretically capable of dealing with lots of other representations/processes/memories corresponding to new stimuli that the human hasn't experienced yet, and it is basically impossible to calculate the number of situations/stimuli that the human brain COULD process if it encountered them.

And of course, factor in that we already know there are HUGE differences between individual human beings -- so even if we did manage to use crazy technology to record everything going on in one person's head, as well as all the stimuli they encountered and all the actions they produced, and analyzed it with ridiculous computational resources until we had that one person's brain TOTALLY figured out -- the information would not really generalize much at all to another person, or even to the same person if you could clone them and raise them in a different environment.

So, as neuroscientists, the best we can do is come up with some reasonably good generalizations that give a PRETTY accurate description of SOME things going on in the brain that MOSTLY are similar between individuals. And we actually do pretty well with that, and those descriptions get more detailed and accurate all the time. But there will always be limits, not so much imposed by our understanding as by the ability of language itself to describe complex systems.

Being able to describe something succinctly depends on the thing having some kind of regularity and repetition to it. Want to describe how a gigabyte of RAM works? Easy -- describe how a single bit works, then say ""now it's that times 8, times a billion."" But the brain is not so regular -- there are billions of neurons, but no two are identical, or even ALL that similar, in their structure or connections. With systems like the brain that have low redundancy in their structure, you can't describe them accurately with a description any less complex than the thing itself. So you have to either make your description very long, or cut some corners on accuracy.

We'll always be able to make our descriptions longer, and increase the accuracy of our understanding that way. But given our current knowledge, I wouldn't hold out hope for any Grand Unified Theory of brain function (unless you want to count what I wrote above, in which case I'd like my Nobel Prize now).

True,isalwayshonest,,,"I remember my first relationship. Butterflies, fireworks, all that. We broke up and I was convinced there was no one else for me. I felt just as you do-a dull and constant pain. But I'm here to give you the best advice I can : let it be. 

Let it be. Let it be. Let it be. Yes, this is also a song. But it is still my advice. Life is full of chapters and stories. Some are long, some are short. But all have an end. Allow this chapter in your life to end. Shut the book. Life will go on with or without you. You do not want to miss the present because you're living in the past. Just let it be. 

You do not need ""closure"". That is a made up term people resort to when they want to maintain a glimmer of hope for a reconciliation. It does not matter why it ended. Your ex obviously has issues when it comes to treating other people with respect. But I know that I've been there. Looking back on my teenage years, I realized how many people I unintentionally hurt because I had no experience. I didn't know how to articulate my feelings so I didn't always end things in the best way. It happens to all of us. This is a rite of passage. Let it be. 

Let's say your ex reconciled with you the last time you FaceTime'd her. If she didn't break up with you then, she would later. I think you are holding onto this pain because you wonder if there was something you could have done. There wasn't. There is never anything you can do to stop or prevent other people from making their own choices. If she didn't end it this time, it would have been another. No time is better than another time. Take comfort in knowing that you dodged an even bigger heartbreak by ending it sooner rather than later. 

Do not think of this as a failed relationship. Do not blame yourself, don't even blame her. We cannot all date and/or marry everyone we like. Certain people just don't work as a couple. You and your ex were just not a good match. You make disagree and think that your ex was so great-she wasn't. A great person who is a great match for you is a person who stays in your life, a person who communicates and fights for your relationship. The very fact that you two are not together tells me that she is not the one for you. So, let it be. 

You have to believe me when I tell you that you will get through this. I know it hurts, I know it sucks, and it seems unfair. I am not minimizing your pain. But there are many great loves and experiences that await you. After I broke up the first time I couldn't see a new beginning for myself.  But since that first relationship I have learned so much more than I ever thought. I've dated other people with their own set of problems. I've fallen in love and I've been heartbroken.  But we all have to experience hurt to appreciate joy. I promise you that in time, you will be able to look back on this relationship and appreciate it for the learning experience. You will not be sad or hurt. You will have moved on to other things, both good and bad. This relationship will be like an old chapter in a book. You'll remember the story but it won't interest you to read it again. 

If you take nothing else from this, remember that we've all been there, right where you are. It's no fun. It's sad and it seems lonely. But just let it be. Close the chapter, please. You have to let it end or you will keep reliving the last few paragraphs over and over. I promise it will get better. You deserve a real and true love. I know you will experience it.

True,Cenodoxus,asia,North Korea,"We actually don't have to speculate too much about it. While we don't have access to everything that's been written or published within North Korea, South Korea has a ministry that collects North Korean publications and media, and both Korean and Western scholars have been able to establish what the dominant narrative in North Korean culture has become. While it's frustrating not to have every detail, it's fairly obvious how and why that narrative has come to exist.

**What the North Koreans are told:** Kim il-Sung and his band of freedom fighters bravely forced the Japanese to relinquish the Korean peninsula, conducting brilliant attacks from a secret base on the sacred Mount Paektu. During the struggle, the future Dear Leader, Kim Jong-Il was born, and he fired at retreating Japanese as early as age three. Sometime in the middle of all this, the freedom fighters also found the time to carve predictions of Kim il-Sung and Kim Jong-Il's eventual greatness into 13,000 trees in the forest surrounding Paektu. The secret base, chairs, cups, and trenches used by Kim il-Sung were miraculously preserved and are available for tour by appointment. When he had time off from slaughtering the Japanese, Kim also wrote several revolutionary operas that are performed in North Korean theaters to this day.

Foreign visitors tend to have problems keeping a straight face on the rare occasions when they're taken to these sites. Some of the more obvious ""slogan trees"" referenced above were also quietly removed in the late 1990s when a visiting Japanese arborist asked how it was possible for 60-year old carvings to exist on 30-year old trees.

**What actually happened:** This narrative is really only accurate in the sense that Kim il-Sung fought against the Japanese, but I have yet to find any historian -- Korean, Russian, Chinese, or otherwise -- who's argued that he was anything other than a fairly minor figure in a widespread anti-colonial struggle. In fact, he didn't fight in Korea at all, but rather Jiandao province in Manchuria (the northeast portion of China that has a sizable Korean-speaking minority), leading companies and battalions of the Second Corps in what became known as the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army. While not the highest-ranked officer in the Corps, he seems to have been competent, and by 1935 the Japanese had put a price on this head. At that point he'd been harassing them for about 4-5 years, and he lasted another 4-5 before things got too hot and he had to run for it. He sat out World War II and the rest of the fight against the Japanese occupation in a Red Army camp in Siberia. Kim Jong-Il was actually born there in 1942, and not in Korea at all.

**Small interjection:** Most of what we know of this period has been constructed from old Soviet, Chinese, and Japanese records, and Kim wasn't sufficiently important to merit mention at every turn. By necessity, there's some guesswork involved, and we don't have as much information as we'd like about Kim's actual record in (X) battle, or when Kim left Manchuria, etc.

By the time Kim returned to Korea with the Red Army in 1945, he'd been out of the country for something like 20 years and spoke Chinese much better than Korean. He was tasked with giving a speech in Pyongyang -- the Soviets were on the lookout for someone they could install in local government to help control the peninsula, and he seemed like a good prospect because he took orders well and had credibility as an anti-Japanese fighter -- and Soviet Koreans not only wrote the speech for him but had to coach him on pronunciation. This was only the first of many speeches he gave, and both these and the initial run of propaganda (again, largely written by other Soviet Koreans) were heavy on gratitude to the Soviets for their assistance in driving the Japanese off the peninsula and the Chinese for having supported the anti-colonial movement.

**How and when this changed (i.e., we have always been at war with Eurasia):** Now, the most interesting thing about North Korean propaganda is tracing how and when it changes (subtly or otherwise) to reflect contemporary political needs. As far as the NK government is concerned, their history is flexible and can be made to serve whatever ideology they need to push at a given time. This has even extended to archaeologists going on the hunt for ancient tombs in central Pyongyang in order to prove the city's classical importance. But that's not really what you're asking about.

Anyway:

 - **During the early 1960s and Khrushchev's tenure in Moscow, references to Soviet aid before and during World War II start to vanish from both North Korean history books and records of Kim's speeches.** Why? Because Khrushchev was trying to reform both the Soviet Union and its client states away from the Stalinist model (something to which North Korea was heavily wedded), and he also ridiculed both Mao and Kim's personality cults. While Kim had always been the figure of primary importance in the North Korean narrative concerning World War II, he changed from being the beneficiary of Soviet generosity who used resources wisely to being someone who struggled without any serious help from other nations.
 - **References to Chinese aid wax and wane too.** To the best of my knowledge, they, too, have largely vanished from the North Korean narrative of World War II, and they are definitely not acknowledged as the people who were really running the army in which Kim was an officer.
 - **Nothing is said of American or Allied involvement in the fight against Japan in the Pacific.** Unfortunately, I don't know what, if anything, is said about the European theater.
 - **References to the *juche* doctrine start appearing in Kim il-Sung's speeches about 15-20 years after they were actually given.** IIRC, Kim's actual mention of the doctrine dates to 1961 at the earliest, but *juche* starts showing up everywhere in the mid-1960s to early 1970s. Why? Because Kim Jong-Il was starting to build a power base for himself in the government, and needed a concrete contribution with which to be identified; they couldn't really pass him off as a major freedom fighter when he'd been all of 3 as the war ended. So *juche* was it. The actual architect of the policy was Hwang Jang-Yop, who defected to South Korea in 1997, but Kim Jong-Il expanded on it, wrote papers, essays, and books (or, just as likely, had someone write them for him), and *juche* mysteriously started being peppered in speeches Kim il-Sung had given two decades earlier in order to establish an unbroken line of thought concerning North Korea's need for economic self-reliance. *Juche* is not the only idea to have been given this treatment; in fact, scholars ""mined"" Kim il-Sung's speeches for pro-capitalist sentiments when the government needed a way to justify its tolerance of private markets in the 1990s and 2000s.

I'm trying and failing to remember if there's anything else that jumps out about North Korean education on World War II, but I think that addresses the most important stuff. 

**As a TL:DR,** North Koreans are told that Kim il-Sung conducted a brilliant guerrilla campaign from a secret base on a sacred Korean mountain and that he sent the Japanese packing off the peninsula. They aren't told that he wasn't really a significant figure in the anti-colonial resistance, they aren't told that he never fought in Korea itself, they aren't told that he sat out World War II in Siberia, and whatever they do know about Soviet or Chinese (much less Allied) involvement is severely underplayed where it exists at all.

No one said that life isn't hard for us dudes. I don't get why everyone always brings up the ol ""Well it sucks for us too!"" whenever someone says ""This is a problem a lot of women have to face"", cause it's not like they said ""Here's something a lot of women have to go through, and by the way, only girls suffer, not guys!""

I think most of the time people like to use this defense because they feel as if their gender is being attacked and by proxy they themselves are being attacked. No one likes to be accused of being an asshole or a creepy dude, so to show women that they aren't the same, they try to relate to them by saying that they suffer from other problems as well. Think of it as saying ""Hey ladies, women can be jerks too, so we aren't so different after all!""

Instead, all this argument is really doing is changing the subject and making the conversation go sour, and as a result, nothing gets solved. Further more, saying ""Well this happens to us!"" doesn't prove a point or make OPs point invalid, all it does is change the topic.

 Instead of get defensive about what society does (in this case, a lot of men objectify women and see no problem with it), get angry! Say ""Shit, I'm a dude and what my gender is doing is embarrassing and infuriating and I'm not gonna stand for it any more!"". Call your friends out on their bad behavior, stick up for girls when no one else will, etc. This shit ain't going to change if we just sit here complaining or going ""well it sucks that a lot of guys objectify you, but I have my own problems, sorry.""

True,otherwiseyep,,,"Yes and no. 

A common producer trick is to change the key of a song up or down to get a different vocal delivery or texture. People sound different when they are singing in different parts of their range.

- At the upper end of their range, singers often sound more urgent, strained, and ""effortful"", if that makes sense. There is an intensity and opportunity for voice-cracking or ""happy accidents""/""good mistakes"" when the singer is physically working to hit the notes. Singers working near their upper limits often get the most powerful articulation and expressiveness, plus an ""intensity"" of focus that comes from skating close to the edge, so to speak. [Axl Rose is a good example of a natural baritone singing in throaty tenor to get this effect.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IsHLTdoRME)

- At the lower end of their range, singers often ""have fun"" feeling the chest-resonance of their low voice, and sound a little more sultry/authoritative/""smiley"", plus they have a lot of upside range to moan, soar, and change voices for accents or different textures. This is often the most rich and resonant, but also often the most fake/deliberate/affected-sounding vocal range. Some people make the mistake of trying to sing low for seriousness, but the opposite is often true: the lower end of the range is often a place for playfulness, and can have a kind of ""jokey"" sound, when recorded. [A good example of this is Amy Winehouse on ""Rehab""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUmZp8pR1uc): you can hear her range bottoming out at ""no, no, no"", and it makes a pretty disturbing and messed-up lyric sound playful and fun, compared to how it would sound if she were desperately belting it out at the top her range (imagine Axl Rose singing, and the song would take on a totally different, much more sinister/dangerous vibe). 

- Many singers, especially untrained singers, tend to have a ""natural key"" hovering around the pitch at which they typically speak. This is often where their delivery sounds the most conversational, informal, and authentic. This is often where singers are at their brassiest and boldest, and get the ""biggest sound"". It's also often the most ""actor-ish"" range, which can be a good thing or a bad thing. [A good example is Ann Margaret singing ""Bye Bye Birdie""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t3cBTb3xPc)

- Pitching the song up just a note or two above that ""natural"" range often gives a very intimate/emotional sound, slightly breathier and more focused than normal speaking, almost halfway to crying. [Chet Baker singing ""My Funny Valentine""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iQQGBfbB0k) is a good example of someone working just a full-step or so above his natural ""comfort zone"": there is just the faintest trace of ""school recital"" that lends a sense of vulnerability, hesitancy, and deep emotion to a song that might otherwise be otherwise be in danger of sounding boring. (Just imagine Ann Margaret singing this ala ""Bye Bye Birdie"": it would be unlistenable). 

The above is more true of untrained singers than it is of, say, opera singers. But even with highly-trained singers, you still get different textures and emotional signals in different parts of their range. Relative key affects things like enunciation, head-position, amount of ""chest"" or ""air"" in the sound, and the amount and type of audible ""effort"" in the delivery. 

This stuff varies pretty significantly from singer to singer, and can work very differently with men vs. women, but the principle is fairly consistent. Even when dealing with a singer with a genuine 3-octave range, they are apt to give a different texture and emotional delivery depending on where in their range they are singing, although how much difference is heavily singer-dependent. 

Moreover, while the singer is always the most important instrument, it's not the only one, and there are occasionally instrumental/arrangement considerations that matter just as much as the vocal range: [A great example of this is Chris Issak's Baby Did a Bad Bad Thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSIJnSuKyMc). The punchy guitar lick bottoming out the open-E string is not less important to the song than the contrast between the bass-player's growled refrain and Issak's big-range verse melodies. In fact, the whole song is a great illustration of how specific ""sub-ranges"" can create different musical effects. 

**TL;DR: Your ""best key"" can often vary from song to song. The range you are most comfortable singing in is not always the best one, and different keys can sometimes force different emotional effects from the singer, even unintended ones.**",0,1356774877,,0,False,1,c7nql2q,t3_15lqwc,t1_c7nql2q,t3_15lqwc,,1430798589,48,False,singing,t5_2rlcx,48

True,El_Camino_SS,,,"Okay, that's fucking it. As a professional photographer, videographer in news, and a guy that hangs with guys that are professional cinematographers, you need to shut the fuck up.

  A cinematographer's job is to convey the script visually, with a heart of the director's vision.  That shot shows drug effects, and those drug effects work through the plot to the culmination of the story.
  
  You're sounding like one of those people that bitch every single time a movie isn't having dialogue run on a perfect sunset, then it's shot like shit.  Dredd wasn't shot like shit.  It was shot excellently, for what it was designed for.  There are constant idiots, dipshits, and fools that say if a movie doesn't have a 'Hollywood shine' to it, then the cinematographer is no good.  WRONG.  Hollywood movies are a look.  They're high key style.  Over lit, mostly.  You're expecting a high key Hollywood with Dredd?  The first one was exactly that, and it was exactly why it was shit.

  The cinematographer is servicing the script.  Sometimes servicing the script means using terrible lenses and ancient film stocks to look run-down.  Sometimes it means NO LIGHTING.  Sometimes it means bringing in fifteen semi-trucks full of twelve thousand watt lights, and placing them at night, which to the real eye looks like damn near a sunny noon, and then turning down the camera so that you can barely see them so Batman's city looks edgy.

 What it isn't, is cookie cutter.

  This movie shot stereo 3D with dual Phantom cameras at framerates of over a thousand.   Most people have no idea how much light is necessary to get a  working image at 4000 frames per second.  The character in the bathtub?  She was probably wearing sunglasses and getting a tan before the shot.  Yet, here these people are, people who don't understand that photography has come a hell of a long way in the last two hundred years, saying, ""it's crap.""

  Did you see Dredd in the theatres?  It was the first time, in a dramatic film that I can remember, that optical super slo mo was stereo 3D.  It's no feat to do that in a pixar film.  To do that in live action, is a totally different game.

I like to use my wifes shampoo because it smells better and leaves my hair soft. 

I lie to the Toys-R-Us cashiers when they ask if the toys are for my kids. I own around 26 Nerf weapons. When the aliens attack and their only weaknesses are rubber suction cups and foam rubber you will thank me. 

I like watching Jersey Shore because it makes me feel better about the decisions that I have made in life.

I have perfected influencing people without them consciously recognizing it and use this to my advantage every single day. I GAVE EXAMPLES IN COMMENTS BELOW PLEASE STOP ASKING ME HOW AND READ THOSE. If you need more info we have a social engineering subreddit you might want to check out. I'm not the best teacher. There are also plenty of books. 
Also don't think I only do it to be an asshole, mostly just as a tool in day to day life.

I watch MLP:FiM with or without my daughters in the room. Clarification: I'm by no means a die hard fan or anything nor do I look at ""clopclop"" or buy myself MLP gear, I just think it's funny and I like the voice acting and facial keyframes.

I like messing with stuff to get my kids in trouble with my wife. I admit this sometimes, but not always.

I love to text people just to tell them that I am pooping (I'm pooping right now, by the way). 

I sometimes do a cornholio shirt at home when my wife isn't looking.

I think homosexual males are some of the funniest people on the planet and like talking to them (Lots of people around me are bigots and would hate me if I told them).

I like to write mental notes to the devil for the things I bump my pinky toe against (as in a complete ritual).

I like being the little spoon sometimes. Update: Apparently this is called a Jetpack. Thank you.

That 3rd party controller sucks and actually did make me lose, but it's your house and your game so I'll let you have that without saying anything. I like letting you win, until you get cocky at least.

Know that game on Steam called Ricochet that nobody plays? I was once the US's #1 arena player for over two years. Ricochet 2 news excites me. (The FPS not the brick breaker clone).

I love finding and buying items at Target that are on sale, and taking them to Walmart and turn them in for regular price without a receipt for in-store credit. I have probably made around $400 this year alone doing this. It's really awesome when it's a BOGO at Target but not Walmart. NOTE: I'm stopping this one for moral reasons, but honestly noone really loses. Target gets their sale price and Walmart sells the unopened returned items for what they put on my gift card which goes back into walmart anyways. It's not theft, nor fraud as their policy causes this loophole and they have been aware of it for decades. 

I secretly like listening to Adele (everyone here hates her).

Twilight was an OK story aside from the sparkling and Belle being genetic and Kristen Stewart's bad acting.

I want bad things to happen in the world to give me something to talk about. (Update: Didn't know this was common, sorry.)

The new Bill C-11, or ""Copyright Modernization Act"" (I think?), really sets up some new framework for possible legal action, but it also broadens the definitions for educational and fair use. Educational use, and mash-ups are now a lot more protected (yay Girl Talk?). The new legislation also makes it illegal for certain digital locks to be present; this means that jailbreaking is now 100% legal in Canada and it is against the new legislation for any one telecom provider to ""lock"" a device (such as an iPhone) to any one provider. This however does not stop them from charging you a fee to do this (although if you're versed enough in this new legislation and manage to talk to someone in ""Customer Relations"" they will usually try to waive it or give you equivalent discounts provided you don't scream).

As far as individuals being prosecuted, I'll get into a bit of what I understand for that as well. During the period when the bill was being reviewed by parliament, I remember reading a quote from an MP that stated even though this law puts the framework in place, it does so in such a way that it makes it unappealing for companies to go after individuals. The new legislation is supposed to identify the difference between a commercial infringer (someone who makes money off of their piracy) and a non-commercial infringer (someone who just wants to collect and/or watch) and sets the maximum penalty for a non-commercial infringement at $5000. Now, this is where my understanding gets a bit foggy as when I was reading and following I understood that the $5000 cap was for ALL previous infringements - however this may be per infringement, I'm not sure.

Nevertheless, the $5000 cap is a paltry amount to really want to prosecute individuals in Canada for the big companies (easily it's less than the lawyer fees the companies would incur should they follow through). Also, even if companies were to take advantage of this and start prosecuting people, our legal system is not set up to handle the influx of these petty lawsuits and would most likely result in a LOT of cases being thrown out etc. as we see in some cases in the US.

The fact is, as long as you're doing your due diligence in trying to protect yourself, and you're not an idiot trying to profit, you're probably ok right now. That being said, I can't tell the future but hopefully the internet remains un-legislated. As a side note, if you were or in the future are one of the people that receive a letter offering to settle to make any court time go away, my personal advice would be to ignore it and take your chances. Those letters are nothing more than a way to get some extortion money out of you (and as far as I know, are not legal practice until you accept the offer).

I don't see how any of these companies can expect people to pay for EVERY bit of media they consume these days as that would get out of control extremely fast and is just not feasible with our economic model.  With movies in particular, I've always found it amusing that these companies are so litigious these days when the big ones got their start in Hollywood by stealing Thomas Edison's invention and moving out west (EDIT: fix) where he couldn't prosecute them...I guess the word ""hypocrite"" has a different meaning when you have billions of dollars behind you.

With that in mind, please do yourself a favor and try to support the indie scene for music, movies, and TV. Artists work incredibly hard, especially in today's indie scene, to have their projects see the light of day. If you like a movie or music album and you know it was produced independently (not the huge blockbuster's we all hear about) try to pick at least one or two of these projects up when and where you can - just be smart with your money!

Hope this summary helps, and please if someone sees a mistake I've made let me know!

**EDIT 2**: As copyright lawsuits are looming in Canada, Michael Geist wrote an article [here](http://www.michaelgeist.ca/content/view/6718/125/) earlier this month that touches on this. There is a quote directly from the legislation I believe - and here is the text from his article:

""3. The big question is whether Voltage will proceed with actual lawsuits for those that refuse to settle. It is certainly within its rights to do so, however, the government has expressed concern with ""the threat of major penalties that hang over Canadians who infringe copyright for non-commercial purposes."" As I described in detail in a recent column, Canada's statutory damages rules now distinguish:

*between commercial infringement (which still carries liability of up to $20,000 per infringement) and non-commercial infringement, which now features a maximum liability of $5,000 for all infringements. While $5,000 is still very expensive for a downloaded movie, the law permits judges to award damages as low as $100 in such cases. In fact, the law instructs judges to consider ""in the case of infringements for non-commercial purposes, the need for an award to be proportionate to the infringements, in consideration of the hardship the award may cause to the defendant, whether the infringement was for private purposes or not, and the impact of the infringements on the plaintiff.*""

This is just another reason I see not to be particularly worried - just be smart.

True,ReducedToRubble,,,"SRS doesn't exist to further the cause of social justice, or to correct wrongs against minorities. If they were, they would be raising awareness about human trafficking (both abroad, and domestic, such as Coyotes in the Americas) gang-rapes in India and South Africa, etc. There is no shortage of exploitation of the powerless in the world. Instead, they comb over every thread to try and find offense in it, get up in arms about the offense, tell themselves how enlightened they are and how much better the minorities are for having them as protectors, then repeat it all over again. It's basically people who need to feel superior to someone, but because it's not politically correct to feel superior to minorities, they decide to find ways to feel superior to a perceived majority (edit) *and* the minority who they feel needs their protection. (/edit)

This is usually where they bring up privilege.

SRS is also about the second-most privileged people in the world guilting and shaming the first-most privileged people in the world for being privileged. Yes, even the black jewish lesbian atheists on that subreddit are privileged, because *they have motherfucking internet access and can read.* If they were genuinely interested in privilege they would acknowledge [intersectionality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersectionality) of privilege. However, doing so would mean that they could no longer generalize against white men, because of the numerous axis on which one can identify. 

TLDR; SRS is the privileged/oppression olympics, where a bunch of idiots compete to see who has it worse and feel superior to those who has it better.

True,[deleted],,,"I'm sorry but it's very likely that this ""change"" will never happen, certainly not because of these articles. You could use the USA as an example: 1) Columbine 2) Virginia Tech 3) Aurora 4) Connecticut; after every single one of these tragedies people have cried out for change, politicians have ""endorsed"" change, hundreds of articles like this, documentaries, petitions have asked for change. For a few weeks everyone is suddenly so passionate about this ""change"" but then people get impatient when they don't see anything being done and because it didn't happen to their loved ones, and of course because the tragedy is painful to keep in their minds, most of the people forget about it. 

Now, this is in a country that's much more developed than India, a fuckton of less corruption and widespread access to internet/news so it's very easy to keep up the pressure yet most people can't be bothered after the hype has died down.

India is a country that exceeds one billion people and that has a lot of the population living in villages and rural areas where crimes like these probably occur fairly often and never make the news. In a lot of the cases if a girl has been penetrated by anyone other than her husband she is considered impure and encouraged to commit suicide by her own family (which many of the rape victims do) because it's likely that no one will ever marry her and coupled with the lack of jobs for women, she's a burden on them (and of course ""she"" has brought shame on them) or if a girl does have the courage to report the crime, the perpetrator can easily bribe his way to ""innocence"", or simply just get the case ignored if he has any friends in high places. These people then spread out to the cities and take their backward thinking with them, committing the same crimes expecting to get away (which most often they do because the policemen are likely to be from a similar village, with the same thinking), and the process loops over and over again.

So yes, change will never happen if we're not persistent enough. The Delhi protests are the right action to take, I doubt these men would have even got convicted had it not been for those people protesting and getting the case disclosure in the west. Politicians wouldn't want to kill off tourism plus make the country look bad if they didn't take strong action which is the only reason these dickheads are getting charged with murder. 

I really hope that the people in India don't get quiet just because of this. It's good news, some sort of justice for the girl's family, but it will do absolutely nothing if the people think that this will inspire change and don't start/keep pressuring for change themselves.

True,Cenodoxus,asia,North Korea,"This glosses a lot of history very quickly, but I think it's a decent summary, and it's also a guide en miniature as to how you can make a lot of really inconvenient history work for you:

**Political necessity:** In essence, state archaeologists and scholars were ""asked"" (I put this in quotation marks because people who are asked to do things by the North Korean state are being ordered) to find tombs of historic figures in the vicinity of Pyongyang. This was important for propaganda purposes because they wanted to establish Pyongyang's importance as a historic city and the former seat of Korean government. Kim, riding the wave of ultra-nationalist sentiment after the humiliating colonization by the Japanese, wanted to be seen as reestablishing an ancient and glorious Korean nation that had simply been interrupted for 40 years by the perfidious imperialists. 

This was also important to him personally because he spent more than a decade after being installed as North Korea's leader by the Soviets consolidating power, purging inconvenient people, building his personality cult, and kicking out any trace of Soviet or Chinese influence or assistance. When Khrushchev the Highly Inconvenient and Annoying Reformer came to power and eventually started making a lot of noise about reducing idiot Stalinism and personality cults among the nations within the Soviet sphere of influence, Kim was firmly in power and could afford to take great offense at this. 

 - Not much the Soviets could do about this as the North Koreans simply ran to the Chinese if they (the Soviets) wouldn't give them something. 
 - Not much the Chinese could do about it either because the North Koreans ran back to the Soviets if they (the Chinese) wouldn't give them something. 
 - All parties involved knew that failing to support Kim could mean having a unified Korea on their borders, or at the very least a lot of instability and violence, and the loss of their bulwark against the Americans on the southern half of the peninsula. Boo on that.

So! 

While this wasn't a priority of Kim's government until the dust settled after the Korean War (say around the late 1950s or so when Kim had powered through the last of the opposition to his rule and how badly he had handled the war), he had to prove that he was leading the true Korean state, and one that was morally and culturally superior to that rat-infested shithole the Americans were protecting down south. So in the post-Korean War period, you see a renewed emphasis on scholarship in North Korea concerning their ancient period, and the writing of textbooks and official histories that are oddly convenient to what the government wants people to believe.

**What the North Koreans are told:** ""Pyongyang is the ancient and historic capital of the greatest of the Korean kingdoms, and the cultural inheritor of its defining stories and myths.""

**What actually happened:** Pyongyang *had* served as the seat of a Korean government, but only as the capital of one of the Korean kingdoms on the peninsula, of which there were three: 

 - Koguryo (or Goguryo) in the north (a pretty close approximation of what the North Korean state is today, although it overlapped into Manchuria -- you can see its borders around where the modern Korean-speaking population is). The largest of the three by far.
 - Paekje (or Baekje) on the southwestern portion of the peninsula. The smallest.
 - Silla in the southeast and the second-largest. It had the greater portion of territory that eventually became South Korea. (See where this is going?)

Pyongyang had been the capital of Koguryo. All three kingdoms hated each other and spent the better part of six centuries fighting for dominance until they were forcibly unified in the late 6th and early 7th century by a combination of Tang Dynasty China and Silla. Paekje was subjugated first, and then the Tang/Silla forces turned their attention to Koguryo. While Koguryo had been strong enough to repel China at its northern border previously, it didn't have the resources to defend against two attackers at once, and went down like a drunk freshman at a frat party. So the result was that Silla gained control of its two brother kingdoms, spent a decade evicting its former Chinese ally from the Paekje territories that the Tangs wanted as a colony, and then took over the entire peninsula. 

Aaaaaaaaaand you can see how this would become a bit of a nuisance to later North Korean historians tasked with arguing that North Korea is Best Korea. 

Even when Silla's political influence weakened and it was ultimately replaced in the 10th century by the unified state known as Koryo or Goryeo (from which Korea's modern name in the West is derived), the capital wasn't in Pyongyang -- it was in Kaesong (a border city that had been in what was South Korea between WWII and the Korean War, and then North Korea post-Korean War). So Pyongyang had certainly been an *important* city, and it had served as a capital of one of the three Korean kingdoms, but it had never been the capital of a unified Korean state. To Kim, Silla didn't deserve the title of the first unifier of the Korean nation, since the Tangs had kept control over a large portion of Koguryo after the wars.

**Problem.** So North Korean state historians got around this by spending an inordinate amount of time talking up Koguryo and what a brilliant civilization it had been, all but ignoring Paekje and Silla. Their next focus was talking up what a brilliant civilization Koryo had been, and so on and so forth.

**Archaeology, schmarchaeology, just go dig up something useful:** Kim Jong-Il started making serious headway in the government around 1970, and in addition to refining the *juche* ideology and taking control of the NK film industry, he also inserted himself into the academic struggle to portray North Korea as the inheritor of ancient Korea's glories. He did ""research"" on ancient Koguryo and told state archaeologists that King Dongmyeong, the founding monarch of Koguryo, had been buried in the vicinity of Pyongyang. Because the archaeologists could take a hint, the requisite tomb was produced in 1974 and venerated as proof that North Korea was the inheritor to ancient Koguryo.

Now, here's the thing -- the tomb probably *does* date to the Koguryo period, but the non-Korean scholars who've visited it have all said there's nothing to indicate that it actually belonged to Dongmyeong. UNESCO thinks it dates to around 400 CE, which is a bit problematic because, uh, Dongmyeong died in 40 BCE or thereabouts. (I honestly don't remember off the top of my head.) The Koguryo period spanned about 7-8 centuries, so this is like digging up Richard Nixon and thinking he's George Washington. Actually, it's much worse than that, but I just wanted an example that would make sense.

It didn't stop there:

 - **Older and older:** Archaeologists who didn't want themselves or their families to end up in North Korea's flourishing series of concentration camps ""found"" evidence of an ancient Choson culture they named the Taedonggang, one supposedly the equal of Mesopotamia and Egypt. (So North Korea was not only the inheritor of Koguryo, it was also the inheritor of the first true Korean nation-state. Convenient!) 
 - **Furries:** Then they found the tomb of Dangun, the legendary founder of the Korean race and Choson itself and supposedly the son of a she-bear and grandson of heaven itself. 
 - **Unicorns:** And then -- you probably saw this on Reddit, actually -- in the last month they ""found"" the tomb of Dongmyeong's ""unicorn,"" again proving the ancient lineage of the North Korean state. (Again, convenient, given that the government is trying so hard to establish Kim Jong-Un in a position of uncontested power.) Although that story was overblown a bit -- the North Koreans were really just saying they'd found a carving dating to 1100 CE by someone who'd marked the location of its lair. The animal in question also wasn't really a unicorn as Westerners would understand the term.

I think the gospel truth is that most North Korean academics and archaeologists are trying to do an honest job with the resources they've got, but whatever they do has to take a backseat to political ideology when necessary. Stuff the government doesn't really care about -- old Koguryo pottery, for example -- is probably honestly dated and evaluated. But they have to make up a bunch of wild shit for what the government ""needs.""",0,1356801776,,0,False,1,c7nu3m8,t3_15lw49,t1_c7nu3m8,t1_c7nrv98,,1430800244,1460,False,AskHistorians,t5_2ssp3,1460

been elected by the people is being attacked on a daily basis, and its

True,pogeymanz,,,"I don't know why you got downvoted, but let me try to very briefly clarify probabilities.

Take coin. Since there are two sides and no reason for one side to land up more than the other, we say the probability is 50/50 heads or tails. This is for *one* flip of the coin. It does not mean that if you flip it twice, you will definitely get one heads. Look at the possible outcomes:

* Heads + Heads
* Heads + Tails
* Tails + Heads
* Tails + Tails

So the probability of getting at least one heads is only 3/4 or 75%. So, it's likely, but not in any way close to guaranteed. Let's do another example with three possible outcomes. If we can get a 1, 2, or 3, and we ""flip"" it three times, what is the chance of getting a 1? Look at all possible outcomes:

* 1,1,1
* 1,1,2
* 1,1,3
* 1,2,1
* 1,2,2
* 1,2,3
* 1,3,1
* 1,3,2
* 1,3,3
* 2,1,1
* 2,1,2
* 2,1,3
* 2,2,1
* 2,2,2
* 2,2,3
* 2,3,1
* 2,3,2
* 2,3,3
* 3,1,1
* 3,1,2
* 3,1,3
* 3,2,1
* 3,2,2
* 3,2,3
* 3,3,1
* 3,3,2
* 3,3,3

So, 19/27 outcomes has at least one 1. That's only a probability of 70.3%.

Probabilities are calculated by dividing the number of desired outcomes by the number of possible outcomes.

If the script is accessible form the internet, you might also want to change the script so it just die()'s if its not being hit from a certain IP, or add some basic authentication (maybe in your htaccess). 

I would also add a second text log, which logs mysql_error() in the event of a failure to INSERT. This would be invaluable for intermittent errors which might be difficult to understand otherwise.

True,soline,,,"There's a lot of misinformation and speculation on this thread. Here's what you need to know about eggs:

Most birds in the wild are seasonal layers. Chickens used to be wild and only laid one clutch per season. Through selective breeding, humans have created chickens which will layer upwards of 300 eggs per year. People have also bred ducks that will outlay a commercial egg-laying chicken. Something like a Khaki Campbell duck will lay round 300 eggs a year and certain Khaki Campbell hybrids will lay even more. 

Domesticated Geese also lay eggs, some more than others. White Chinese Geese are THE egg-laying breed when it comes to geese. They can lay up to 100 eggs per season. They generally lay from February to June. Domesticated geese do not lay year-round and so their eggs are not available year round unless they have been raised in some controlled environment. Goose eggs are not as popular as duck or chicken eggs, so no one has produced one that can lay all year. 

Which brings us to Turkeys. Turkeys, like all other birds, are originally seasonal layers. The domesticated breeds are also seasonal layers, laying at the same time as Geese. Spring is prime laying/mating season, so this is when most birds will naturally lay eggs. Some domesticated breeds of Turkey will lay more than others. So if someone were to raise a few, once they come into season, they will lay and someone could eat the extra eggs but most people who raise turkeys, hatch those eggs because they are not abundant. 

So part of the reason is availability. The other factor is taste. All eggs taste slightly different. Of the 4 species I mentioned, chickens have the blandest eggs. Bland relative to the other 3 species. This makes them appealing to a wide variety of people. Duck eggs have a stronger flavor and are super popular in asia so of course we have duck breeds that lay tons of eggs. Goose eggs have a pretty strong flavor and are only popular in spring. People don't want them year round. I've heard that turkey eggs don't taste that great and your average person has no interest in turkey eggs so you never see these. In fact, your average person has no interest in any kinds of egg they have never eaten before. I've tried to sell goose and quail eggs where they are not already popular and there is zero interest. So you can imagine where turkey eggs would stand.

I can assure you, however, that if some society decided that Turkey eggs were the best thing on earth, they would breed a turkey that laid year round but that has yet to happen.

True,translostation,,,"&gt;So people for most of human existence didn't have the same natural rights.

You're misunderstanding the philosophical definition of natural rights. Natural rights are those rights to which all humans have been entitled throughout the course of history. Whether a government seeks to oppress (or does actually oppress) some or all of the three core natural rights is a separate question from their existence. They are:

1) Life. I am alive and, simply by the virtue of being alive, am entitled to remain as such until nature (disease, age, etc.) takes her toll and I die. This right has existed since the dawn of time. No one has a right to deprive me of life unless I have deprived another human being of life. Even there, the morality is questionable and depends on the logic you choose to employ. The right to life is unalienable. Everyone has it regardless of the government under which he lives. A government that denies the right to life without just cause (i.e. not as capital punishment for a murderer, etc.) is by definition a tyranny. 

2) Liberty. By virtue of being alive, I deduce the right that I ought to be free to govern that life by my decisions, provided that said decisions do not infringe upon the natural rights of anyone else. This has also existed for as long as mankind. Liberty is the ability to freely make choices about my life without facing a governmental threat - implicit or explicit - in the process. The right to liberty is unalienable. A government which denies its citizens liberty (i.e. the right to choice) unjustly (i.e. not in the case of criminals and those who violate others' rights) is a tyranny.

3) Property. By virtue of my rights to life and liberty, I have the right to accumulate, maintain, and use property as I see fit, provided that my doing so does not infringe upon another individual's rights. Since humans have had 'stuff' (spears? clothes? knives? etc.) we have had property and this right has existed. It is an unalienable right. A government which does not permit its citizens the right to their property infringes upon their liberty and, as such, is a tyranny.

No other rights can be deduced as 'constant' in human history and, therefore, as natural. Things that we now consider human rights (education, healthcare, etc.) have not always been available and are not, even today, essential components of the human experience. They are privileges, not natural rights. The definition of natural rights will not change for this reason. It is a constant principle that hasn't changed in essential components since it was first expounded upon.

&gt;If you have the natural right to liberty, then how can any one, with any justification take that natural right away?

A natural right doesn't mean that you have it. It means that you are entitled to it and any governmental system that deprives you of it is tyrannical. Governments do not have to respect your natural rights - in fact, throughout the course of history most of them haven't respected natural rights. This is one of the fundamentally revolutionary things behind the United States of America (a governmental system with natural rights at its core philosophy) and one of the reasons that we ought to guard our natural rights jealously or else face their deprivation. The only morally acceptable justification to deprive anyone of a natural right is as a consequence of a behavior on his part that infringed upon another's natural rights (i.e. a crime). Murder is justification for the loss of liberty, property, and/or life. Dissenting against governmental policies and actions isn't.

&gt; however, you still haven't said why it would bother you. You personally. How does it affect you if you knew that the govt. is recording this very conversation?

It's morally reprehensible. It violates my natural rights to live my life the way I want without unreasonable governmental interference. There is no reason for the government to watch me, so it shouldn't. The need for a government to watch its citizens carries with it the implicit suspicion of guilty until proven innocent. It stifles my ability to speak freely without concern for my natural rights, to dissent against government action that I find reprehensible, and to reasonably live my life the way I want without concern.

&gt;How side of some grandiose morality, why does it bother you that your natural rights are being violated?

Natural rights are what make us human and free. They are literally the difference between being able to have this conversation and being in a cattle car on a rail line headed to ovens somewhere. There is NOTHING more important than protecting that which makes us human and permits us to live in a free society - our natural rights. It IS all that we have. Without them, we are nothing.

It was very common for Koreans to be told that while China seemed rich, South Korea was much wealthier. The situation was exacerbated by the growing community of people who *didn't* return but still had contacts in North Korea.

EDIT:

1 -- When you close your base very early ( 14 second supply depot) is to prevent the protoss to scout ur base, but when u did this the probe was already in his base, so you doesnt need this, only if u want trap the probe.

2 --Build order, man ALL the Low leagues player has this problem, they dont know how to execute the build, they are lazy.

3 -- Learn to control your army, dont stim all ur bioball only to kill one obs, just stim the units in front.

5 -- The engage at 19 min was just horrible, always make a concave before engage vs toss, if u make this it's easier to dodge storms, the colossus will make less damage, more units will attack and easier to run, and doesnt focus fire the colossus like u did, only make this when the colossus is in front of protoss' army.

6- Always make ghost before maxed even if the protoss doesnt have HT/Archon.

7- You never should have full energy CC with 3 bases, this already means gg, dont forget to use mules..

8 - Never turtle against toss, if the toss get 4 bases, well it's really hard to kill him because he will have gas for everything, and if he gets lots of money even if u have a lot money too it's worse to you because warp gates.

9- Dont make tanks against toss unless you are making 1/1/1 or one timing push because chargelots, the tank splash will kill your army too and when the toss get armor upgrade the tank will do nothing.

10- Well, if u lose the game with 3k minerals 8k gas... when u get maxed just make a lot of CC, expand, make more barrack(more production) to make the units faster when u lose all ur army with the big engage.

11- The viking count was horrible too, 4 vikings against 4 colossus already means gg too if the protoss attack you or yo attack him, because you need at least 3 vikings per colossus thats why u need one second starport to make medivacs( when u lose them) and vikings too, normally the pro players make the second starport if they see the protoss making more than 1 colossus, u shouldn't make one second starport if u dont see more than 1 colossus because they can to be teching to ht very fast, it's a protoss strategy to fool you.

12 - Be agressive vs protoss, especially when u get your 1st/2nd/3rd/4th medivacs, delay his third, make drops if u see that stalkers aren't in position to defend drops, and normally low league protoss players will use all his army to defend one drop, so u can kill his natural at same time, it's all about multitasking.

13 - About the TVP Build 3 rax starpot reactor is very simple, you make 1 rax fe ok, add more two rax, make double gas at 23 supply~~, make one lab tech with the first 25 gas in one of the barracks and research stim when the lab tech finishes, after the next 100 gas make one factory and one engi bay, 3rd gas engi bay research +1 attack, make starpot reactor, 4rd gas well you can to choose between 3 rax with two reactor or 3 rax with two lab, if u make 3 rax two reactor it's very good against ht first , 3 rax with two lab it's good against robo.
So after this u can add more two rax or make a 3rd  cc, if u make more two rax the push will be stronger, and if u make a 3rd cc it's more economic.

14 - Upgrade air attack.

15- Your marine count was too high, the protoss made mass stalker instead of mass chargelots, so u can make more marauders.

As to your question about directions, of course it's going to change cardinal directions, and that doesn't mean it made any changes in course.

True,horrorfetish,,,"Here's exactly how I acted when I was at my worst. Right now you're in a hard place and you're going to throw down every single piece of advice that is handed to you. You are going to make excuses like it's too hard, or I can't, or that's not possible for me right now. I have heard them all come out of my own mouth.

Here's what you're going to do. You're going to stop seeking advice if you're going to tell yourself you *can't*. Start with *I'll try*... and don't tell me you'll try. Tell yourself. You'll get to *I will* and *I did* soon enough, because every time you *try* you're pushing yourself farther.

Your mind right now is a jumble of negatives. Put yourself in the right frame of mind by pushing them aside. When you think *I can't because she might laugh at me*, push it aside. She won't. Nobody's laughing. Tell yourself that. Replace it with a positive thought, even if it's unrelated. *She'll laugh at me*... *no, don't think that. My hair looks very nice today. I did a good job at work today. Yesterday I made someone laugh.* 

Meditate. It doesn't matter how you do it, but you can read up on different styles if you would like. Relax and breathe, focus on your breathing and not on your thoughts. Do it every day..

Find something that relaxes you... for me, it's tea. In a BIG way. I enjoy trying new teas, and sipping the ones my best friend sends me. Tea makes me feel connected with my friend and myself. Video games help me a lot too- when I feel anger or stress or depression boiling up, I turn on a game. Maybe today I'm Cole and I'm gonna zap reapers, or I'm army guy and I'm gonna shoot bad army guys. Maybe I'm Ash and I'm gonna kick ass with Pikachu. It doesn't matter who you are, because for the time you're playing you get to take all your stress out on the bad guys in the video game, instead of yourself. Maybe neither of those will work for you, but think about the things you like, or the things you would like to try. Learn something like knitting or sewing or even making lattes. Just lose yourself in that hobby.

Remember that you don't need to surround yourself with friends, and you don't even need to be in a relationship to be happy. There are going to be lots of people in the world who like to talk to your or enjoy your company, but you don't need to spend time with any of them if you don't want. Spend time with the friends you know intimately, or the people you would like to be close with. Don't stress about being Mr. (or Mrs.) popularity. Just be with the people who you feel safe with.

In the end, you'll want to seek professional help, absolutely. Maybe it's not going to work for you, and instead you'll have to learn to cope yourself, some people do. But reach out and try. Go to a counselor, try group therapy, and if you aren't on any already talk to your doctor about anti-depressants. If anxiety is a cause of your depression, bring that up. 

Focus on you, what you want to do, and what makes you happy. Make short term goals, no long term goals. I could sit here and be depressed all day about how much I'd like to move out of my parents' house and buy my own house... or I could be really proud of myself for getting out of bed before noon, or making breakfast or doing a great job of cleaning. Hell... one of my own short term goals was to keep myself clean. I was in a place where I didn't think I was worth the soap to wash myself. Now I enjoy a nice bath and I love trying out new soap scents. Every little goal is a huge step, remember that.

Most importantly, live for *you*. Live to make yourself better, and to feel better. Live to do what makes you happy and follow your own path to whatever it may be.

True,AKiss20,,,"The following picture helps explain things a bit, but it has all to do with angle of attack.

http://www.insideracingtechnology.com/Resources/loverd.gif

Angle of attack is the angle of the incoming air with the chordline (the line drawn from the two furthest points of the airfoil). You'll notice that in the picture, when the AOA is positive, the streamlines are more curved on the top surface than the bottom surface. Curvature is what causes the air to speed up/pressure to decrease, and as the top is more curved than the bottom, the pressure is lower on the top, and lift points up. At negative angles of attack for symmetrical airfoils, the opposite occurs, so there is lower pressure on the bottom, and the lift points down (or negative lift). This image isn't actually that great for this explanation because the airfoil is quite highly cambered, so you get zero lift at quite negative angles of attack, but it is the only one I could find with streamlines in a 2 second google search.

So you can see that if a plane was flying upside down, as long as the angle of attack was such that lift points in the right direction (away from the ground), it can fly merrily along. The below image is a bit more representative of a symmetric airfoil

True,psychicoctopusSP,,,"Another interesting resource is from the North Korean government themselves: the Korean Central News Agency provides access to dozens of book pdfs. 

It is important to keep in mind, however, that these books portray history **as the regime currently presents it** If you opened a biography from Kim Il Sung in 1956, or in 1970, or now, they would **not** say the same things.

If anyone wants to know more, I can write quite a bit about how official history evolved under the Kims, but it may be boring to most. Broadly speaking, the regime plays to several key themes: nationalism, confucianism (or more accurately confucian traditions), racial purity, Stalinism, and Juche. 

They aren't necessarily mutually exclusive themes, but their uses ebb and flow through North Korea's history, and which themes are prominent has a lot to do with what the regime is trying to accomplish. I'd say there are 3 somewhat overlapping periods in which history is used for slightly different purposes:

1945-1950 - to consolidate Kim Il Sung's rule
1950s-1960s - to eliminate of all remaining domestic rivals (up to 1956), rebuild the economy, and gain legitimacy as the true, independent Korea
1970s-present - to facilitate succession (especially Kim Jong Il's)


Basically, the regime alters and manipulates history differently in these periods. By the late 1960s Kim Il Sung is basically a god-like figure, but his son takes this propaganda to unbelievable heights in order to buttress his own claim to become his father's heir. 

Edit: [Link](http://www.kcna.kp/goHome.do?lang=eng) to Korean Central News Agency 

Edit 2: If you want to find copies of older Korean propaganda (which do NOT reflect what the regime says is the truth now) check out abebooks.com, which where I got Baik Bong's Kim Il Sung: A Political Biography (3 Volume, Published 1969-1970). There's also other older biographies that are really, really hard to find but which would also be really interesting.

For example, my biography by Bong does not even mentioned Kim Jong Il. Why? Because in 1970 he had not been selected as heir. In fact, his brother or uncle was considered to be a more likely candidate than himself, until he began to run North Korean propaganda.

True,curtisabrina,,,"I hope there is not too much confusion with the photos,

to make a long story short:  I fell in love with an amazing woman in the fall of 2011.  

That next Valentines day I gave her two brass keys that I design and machined in a custom box.  I made the keys in anticipation of one day proposing.  I didnt know if or when that would happen yet..

As time went on I began to realize how much I wanted to be with this woman.  I began designing a jewellery box.  The idea was to incorporate the keys I had originally given her as well as an engagement ring.  A small ring box was to be ""hidden"" in a compartment inside the large jewellery box that was to be opened by the ""twin keys"".  A little confusing, but i think you will understand when you see the pictures.  

I have been told I put to much effort in but I think she deserved every hour, every dollar.  I couldnt give her anything that was less than my very best.  

hope you guys (and gals) enjoyed the photos.  Feel free to use my ideas or ask any questions

True,[deleted],,,"If I'm being honest...my mother dying. She was a drug addict and an alcoholic. She'd truck my sibling and I from state to state to keep us away from my father, and we were in poverty for a long time. I remember always being anxious, always being scared. I used to hide toilet paper because I wasn't sure when we'd be able to get some more. 

She died when I was 13. I was finally able to move in with my father who gave my brother and I a stable and caring home. We are there for each other, we love each other wholly. I can't explain how much my life changed for the better because I was able to get a decent education, have a stable home life, a parent who had dinner ready on the table every night and always had a kind word to say or some great advice handy. Her passing got us out of a town where everyone was addicted to meth and into a city that I love and feel at home in. It set me up to make incredible friends, and find love I never thought was possible. 

I love my mother, but I'm sorry to say that I wouldn't change how things turned out if I had the chance. 

EDIT: Thank you all for the really awesome feedback, and while I'm sorry to know there are many of you in similar situations, it's incredible to see how we can adapt and adjust to become strong and resilient people.

True,thisisawkward0711,,,"I volunteer for a charity in the UK that is mostly associated with suicidal callers, though we actually get a lot less than people assume and are really there to provide emotional support to those in distress or despair, feelings that may lead to suicidal thoughts. Anyway, we always, always ask our callers (if we have time, some calls end very quickly) if they are feeling suicidal, even if they sound completely fine, because it can open up a dialogue about suicide, which is still a bit of a taboo subject. It is important to note that not everyone who is suicidal has a plan/time frame; even more so, some people feel suicidal, but do not plan to end their lives, for various reasons. 

If someone is feeling suicidal, or is attempting to end their life, we do not call the police to stop them. The only reason we will call the police is in event of a bomb threat, and we don't take that decision by ourselves. We don't ask people if they have weapons in their homes, but we do ask - if someone says they have a plan - what that plan is. 
 
The service we provide is completely anonymous, to protect both the caller and us - we can't trace calls, we don't know where or who the caller is unless they tell us and we wont call an ambulance unless expressly asked by the caller (in which case, we need their phone number/address), another decision which the operator will not take on their own. Furthermore, if someone does need an ambulance, we always let them know that it will be quicker/better for them to call an ambulance directly, as if we call - as a third party - the police are liable to turn up as well. So, hopefully it shows that we actively avoid involving the police unnecessarily.

Bottom line is, we try to give the caller as much autonomy as possible; occasionally, people make the decision to end their life and are sure they have made the choice that is right for them, in which case we stay with them for as long as they want. Sometimes, they change their mind and require medical help, other times, not. Most, around 85% of callers, are not suicidal, just need a bit of emotional support during a difficult time.

Edited to add: We also don't give advice to callers, or tell them what to do; so, no bargaining, or telling them to not commit suicide, or suicide is not the answer, etc. It may sound harsh or like we don't care (we do!), but telling someone they have made a bad/wrong decision can really alienate them in their hour of need, and they may feel even more alone/misunderstood/unsupported.

True,LatexRaincoat,,,"Just to reaffirm what Joker is saying, here's some additional info from my experiences. A lot of times people don't realize the costs, and what the actual damages are to the store. At my store we were a small mom and pop, so to provide an adequate amount of rentals for our customers we were required to work with a large company which got a share of the rental fees, and also got a share of the actual sale price of the video when it did sell. Technically we don't own their movies. I'll refer to this company as RipOffRent from here on out. RipOffRent had certain agreements with the studios, and these agreements varied by studio and title, but basically we were provided a list of movies and dates when we could first sell them. Id say it averaged around 90 days, but for really popular titles it could be quite a bit longer (6-9 months).

There are two common scenarios where people often didn't understand the fees. The first case is the aforementioned where a person doesn't return a movie. When a movie is out for a certain period of time it is considered by RipOffRent to be a sale. If a sale occurs on a title RipOffRent owns before the specified date then our store is basically charged a ridiculous amount of money for the title. Think of it like a penalty of sorts for selling early. The prices we were charged for this sale were often $100-$200. So every time you keep a movie, because you're too lazy to return it or just forget about it, then our store gets hit with this price tag. It doesn't matter if you ever pay it or not, we still pay it.


The second case is someone returning a movie extremely late, and being surprised at the late fees. I believe generally each time we rented a movie RipOffRent got around $1.25-$1.50. Again, it does not matter whether you actually pay your late fees, we still pay that amount repeatedly for as long as the movie is out. The fees add up, and honestly we can't just forgive all your fees because we're still paying them. Now, on titles we owned we were always happy to work with customers and do what we can (even though it is still a loss to us, just not as large of one), but on titles owned by RipOffRent we don't have much room to move. We're not charging you these fees for funsies, believe me. We don't wanna deal with cranky, or potentially lost customers anymore than you want to pay some exorbitant fee. Whenever possible we would go to Wal-Mart every Tuesday and buy what we could afford to avoid the restrictions of RipOffRent and the fees, but there were still a sizable amount of movies they owned compared to movies we owned. It was a small store where we could only afford so much, and RipOffRent was a necessary evil. Additionally, as the economy tanked we were forced to rely on them more and more. The alternative was having a severe lack of titles to rent, which is in itself extremely detrimental. Pick your poison.


A couple other random bits of info...

* I can't speak for all areas, but in ours a majority of the privately owned stores used RipOffRent. There was little to no competition, so it's not like you could shop around for a better deal from another company. The companies that were available had pretty much the same deals. These companies squeezed the small businesses extremely hard, and had a lot of restrictions. If I had to guess I'd say that most of it is a result of the studios.

* RipOffRent had unrestricted access to all of our systems and rental records. Additionally they could come in our store at any time and go through every single item in our inventory to find one title that is not where the computer says it is. This means possible penalties or loss of our rental agreement. It was not uncommon for them to do this, they're trying to protect their product from crafty retailers skirting the system.

* As far as recouping costs our only recourse was collections (which often were a poor return), and a hit on your credit report, which I suppose can have some consequence in today's society. The police in our area really don't care about movies, even though the cost can be quite large, and we have the name and address of those responsible. In fact, one of our biggest offenders was an officer himself. The difference was he would always pay eventually before it got to the collections part. The only odd exception to police involvement was if they did it with a playstation or xbox. In that case you can expect to hear from Mr. Officer. This is odd because the cost of a lost movie early on, and a console weren't far off.

* At times the fees for a missing movie to RipOffRent may be in the hundreds, yet $15 at your local store. You can't just head over the store, pick up a cheap replacement and check it back in thinking no one is the wiser. If the movie changes, RipOffRent will know.

* Thank you for reading this far. My final comment is that it really really hurts a small video store in these situations when you don't return a movie, or don't pay your fees. So please, be responsible, honor your commitments, and just return your movies. If you return the movie on time, there are no fees, and this whole thing can be avoided. Everyone understands that things come up in life, but...just bring the thing back.

TLDR - Stores don't always own the movies, they often belong to a company who charges stores out the ass. Crazy fees in the hundreds are charged to the store regardless of whether or not you return the movie/pay the fees. You don't pay, store still has to pay, store goes out of business. Simple as that.

True,Astromike23,astro,Astronomy | Planetary Science | Giant Planet Atmospheres,"We can calculate this just by knowing the magnitude of both the Sun and the Moon:

- The Sun's magnitude: -26.7
- The full Moon's magnitude: -12.6

(Note that the astronomical magnitude system is such that the more negative the number, the brighter the object. Also, it's logarithmic, so a difference of 5 magnitudes is an increase in 100 times the brightness.)

The difference between these is (-12.6) - (-24.7) = 14.1 magnitudes, meaning the Sun is 100^(14.1/5) = 436000 times brighter than the full Moon.

Since the Sun provides ~1370 Watts per square meter of heating at the top of Earth's atmosphere, the full Moon should provide (1370 W/m^2 )/436000 = 3.1 milliwatts per square meter of heating. I think it's safe to say that would not have a noticeable effect.

Note, however, we've just talked about reflected light so far. Since the daylight side of the Moon (the same half facing us during a full Moon) is warm, it will also emit infrared radiation as a blackbody. 

We can calculate this, too, using the Stefan-Boltzman Law:

Emitted Flux per square meter = (5.67e-8 W/m^2 K^4 )(Temperature)^4

- Average daytime Moon temperature: 380 Kelvin

F = (5.67e-8 W/m^2 K^4 )(380 K)^4

F = 1182 W/m^2

That's just how much infrared energy is emitted per square meter of daytime Moon surface - we still have to account for how much this flux will decrease as it travels the distance to the Earth. 

Imagine that emitted infrared energy expanding outwards from the daytime Moon hemisphere until it makes a much larger hemispherical surface with the radius equal to the Moon-Earth distance. The surface area of that expanding hemisphere will increase as its radius squared, even though the same amount of total infrared energy has to be distributed over it. That means the emitted infrared energy from the Moon hitting the Earth will decrease as the ratio of the daytime hemisphere area to that big hemisphere area, or equivalently: (Moon radius/Moon-Earth distance)^2 .

- Moon radius: 1,737 km
- Moon-Earth distance: 384,400 km

Emitted infrared Moon flux at Earth = 1182 W/m^2 * (1,737 km/384,400 km)^2

= 24.1 milliwatts per square meter.

That's 8 times more energy than the reflected light...but still not enough to make a very noticeable difference.

**TL;DR:** No. As the Moon is half a million times less bright than the Sun, it only reflects 3 milliwatts per square meter, not enough to make a difference. The full Moon also emits infrared radiation since the day side is warm, and although that heats us 8 times more than the reflected light (24 milliwatts per square meter), it's still not enough to matter.

True,p7r,,,"The traditions of sport in each country is normally very closely tied to the political history of the country. 

For example, nearly everywhere that cricket is enjoyed is a former member of the British empire, or at least has very close/friendly ties to Britain. More recently it has become popular in Rwanda because refugees spent time in Kenya where it's popular - and Kenya, of course, has its history with British imperialism.

America obviously has its own history with Britain and Europe in general and politically tried to distance itself from all things British and European in its earliest years as an independent nation. 

In fact, in 1776 football (as the rest of the World would call soccer), was barely codified, and so it was at a time of high animosity between England and the US when football was emerging as a sport.

Instead, the United States was more interested in creating its own variations on sports. Baseball was a derivative of English folk games (as was cricket), and American Football emerged as a sort of corruption of rugby and association football.

Quintessentially American, their influence spread to places where the US had influence (central America, etc.), much like football and cricket spread to places with British influence, and then to places where *those* places had influence.

In short then, American football is popular in America at least in part because *it isn't British*.

Also, I think the physical geography and media consumption habits has played its part in the popularity of sports in their respective countries in the last 100 years.

Most people in America probably do not live within 5-10 miles of a professional sports stadium. Most people in Europe do. As such, there is far more of a culture of going to see a game of football or cricket in the UK than there is in the US. This means the games that do well take a while to play, have a constant stream of action and are played by teams with long local histories.

In the US, most people are going to consume sports primarily via media. In the early 20th century this meant that for a sport to get a decent fan base it must get carried by radio - and then TV - and for that to happen the sport itself must be open to being interrupted by adverts or for commentators to make reference to sponsors without interrupting actual detailed commentary, because otherwise there's little incentive for the media outlets to carry the sport.

A football team in Europe can survive profitably in the lower leagues quite happily if they never have a game covered live on television or radio. That is harder to achieve in the US so the sports you are most likely to be exposed to at a professional level are those that can be interrupted by adverts.

That means American Football wins out over (notoriously difficult to monetise through advertising), ""Soccer"". A baseball game taking up a few hours of air time wins out over a sport that takes 5 days to play a game in its fullest form (cricket).

I suspect that Twenty20 cricket might actually do well in the US if given a chance - it feels more like baseball but its less a numbers game and more a chance for sportsmanship.

Lastly, there's also the accessibility of playing a sport. In America schools and colleges make their variation of ""football"" accessible, but otherwise it requires a large capital outlay. Soccer doesn't. Nor, in fact, does rugby, cricket or any other sport popular in most of the rest of the World.

If it is going to cost money in helmets, pads, etc. for a couple of dozen people before you can get a game going, you are going up against a steep hill in most of the World in which you can play an alternative game with a tin can, or an old tennis ball and a chalk outline of a wicket on a wall.

A game that is played plenty as a kid, and is still affordable/accessible at an amateur level as an adult is going to have a larger fan base than one that isn't. In the US a lot of infrastructure is there to overcome that with American football it makes little/no sense to deploy in the rest of the World.

To answer your question about the ""feminine"" feel to Soccer in the US, well, part of it is because Americans like to mock Europeans as being a bit feminine in their own right. But there are other reasons.

There is a tactical advantage to receiving an injury in soccer you do not get in any other game. In American Football, if you get winded and are experiencing searing pain suggesting your ankle just got fractured from a failed tackle but you're 2 yards from the end zone *you push through*. You need to be tough. If you're not tough, you're going to possibly cost the team points or the game, or a title.

In soccer if you're inside the six yard box and surrounded by defenders and one of them taps you lightly on the shin in a slightly messy tackle you are probably better off feigning injury than you are continuing the play.

In essence, in American Football your team mates expect you to struggle on. In Soccer, your team mates expect you to exploit the laws of the game to gain a possible penalty and to be weaker than you actually are.

So Americans will see soccer players taking a dive and rolling around and think ""WTF? The guy hardly touched him!"" without realising it's an important part of the tactics at the top of the game. It's discouraged, and the fans hate it, but it's part of the game.

Also, part of the ""stigma"" is that soccer *can* be played by women at no major disadvantage below the top professional levels. Most top-level female players can completely outplay experienced amateur males at soccer. It's just not the case in American football where physical dominance is so critical.

As for Rugby: better type of fans in my experience, rarely any trouble in the crowds, always a good laugh. But it's a silly game that has weird links to the upper middle classes in England (who oddly think it's a common/working class game), and seems to be dominated by an outdated Victorian English sense of ""toughness"" that I don't like. Never enjoyed playing it, never got into watching it. People who are really into it tend to be a bit rabid about it which worries me.

**EDIT: (and apologies this is almost as long as the original post)** Lots of people are taking me to task about the fact that I've said soccer is more accessible to women because women can play it well. Specifically, many of you wish to insist upon me that women can not play it well. I detect an air of sexism, but in my defence I have seen both top women's football and amateur league football and *I personally believe* that the best women playing today could give the men a run for their money. The results of games cited (mostly from nearly a decade ago when the women's game was considerably less popular), suggesting the men will ""always win"" are relatively close score lines seen in professional leagues between teams of comparable standing week in week out. So, can you please stop telling me that in your opinion women are hopeless at sport? Thanks.

Also, a few people have questioned where my sources are. This isn't Wikipedia, so missed out my citations, but you're right to wonder if I'm just making it up. 

So, for those that care: I know a fair bit about the history of these sports because they interest me. I am not an academic who has spent his career analysing their history, but I'm a fan. As a Northern Englishman who has gone to games at grounds small and large across the country for both football and cricket, and whose Father is a naturalised US citizen (so I've been lucky enough to see the 49ers and SF Giants play live), I find the economics and cultural associations of these sports fascinating.

My interest started when I read Kate Fox's book on the anthropology of horse racing in the UK. That triggered a lot of reading by myself into how various sports emerged into the monsters and minnows they now are, why some sports thrived and others withered. I can't cite all that reading easily, but I do know that my opinions formed into something along these lines:

* Participation is a big factor in the success of a sport. I think we can all agree this makes intuitive sense
* If you're taken to see a sport at a professional level as a child, you're more likely to have fond memories of it in adulthood and keep watching it. It's not necessary, but it definitely helps
* Having local access to a professional team to watch a pro team play live is therefore important
* Where local access isn't possible because a geography or league structure prohibits it, you want media coverage and plenty of it. That means your sport needs to ""fit"" local media markets and audience expectations (in Europe subscription channels, in the US free-to-air, ad-supported)
* If you look at where NFL stadia are, most Americans don't live near one so media access is a big part in this. Others in reply to me have suggested fantasy leagues too - a major factor I hadn't considered

Of course a lot of it comes to personal preference. When work allows, I love staying up and watching an NFL game despite my English friends considering it ridiculous. I don't complain when standing in the freezing sleet at the Etihad or Edgeley Park, despite many people thinking such an activity is insane - my Dad used to the warmer climate of South California would certainly struggle to enjoy such a game in January! And I certainly don't whine as I nurse my sunburn and hangover from 4-5 days at the only Old Trafford I care about, the home of Lancashire County Cricket Club and occasional test match venue.

People have been arguing about this for years, but what I gave above is my opinionated answer based on my reading of the histories of the sports. The NFL had some lucky breaks. So did the EPL, which when I was a child did not exist and the English top league was a rough and tumble affair of poorly paid players. Cricket has had to reinvent itself, and to some extent so has baseball as the pros have woken up to Sabermetrics.

There aren't any testable facts here because we can't go back in time and ask what happened if the 1958 NFL Championship game had gone a different way. We can't ask what would have happened to baseball if the codification of cricket had taken a different direction and T20 had been invented 100 years ago. We can't wonder what would have happened to rugby - or the other sports it inspired - if the rules had been tweaked and it had become a little more violent. We certainly can't ask what would have happened if the meeting in Manchester in 1886 that created the modern code of association football had gone a different way - although I often ask myself that question when I walk past the site of the meeting.

We can only guess. And that's what I have spent many years doing, and decided to offer up my reading of what happened in response to the question.

Enjoy your sport, enjoy it well. Remember, football - or any other sport you love - is only the most important unimportant thing in the World. It's not worth calling me (or women footballers) names over ;-)

Considering arranged marriages were dominant for most of human history, it may not be as odd as it seems.

However, the sheer number of entrants will lead to a massive bracket so I propose an initial, region based qualification stage. Ultimately leading to a 32 person tournament.

But let's look at some of the possible entrants...

**President Barack Hussein Obama II - USA**

Age : 51

Strengths : Known for his basketball skill and competitive nature, We haven't yet seen his fighting skills but he'll definitely try.

Weaknesses: On the scrawny side, Probably lacks fighting expertise.

**Prime Minister David William Donald Cameron - UK**

*Note: This choice may be contentious, The Prime Minister is not the Head of State. Queen Elizabeth II may be an alternative*

Age: 61

Strengths: 6th Dan Judo, Black belt karate, Bear wrestling. This guy has all the fighting credentials.

Weaknesses: Old, Corrupt, Martial arts skills may not translate well into a street brawl

**Prime Minister Julia Eileen Gillard - Australia**

Age: 51

Strengths: One of the few women in a field of men, Girl Power, Has braved the Australian outback (this gives her natural resistance to all posions, spell effects and marsupials)

Weaknesses: She's actually welsh (may be distracted by any passing sheep)

**Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un - North Korea**

Age: 28/29

**Chancellor Angela Dorothea Merkel - Germany**

Age: 58

Strengths: Stocky German blood makes her some kind of warrior queen, Fiscal responsibility results in weakening of any opponents.

Weaknesses: She gets really angry if someone calls her a Nazi, After a short burst of anger she has to spend approx. 10 hours punishing herself in private.

**Prime Minister Benjamin ""Bibi"" Netanyahu - Israel**

Age: 63

Strengths: Iron Dome defence system, The US will back him in any fights. Edit: Apparently he's some sort of badass warrior king army man.

A default replace and non-default [hopscotch court made of chalk](http://www.modthesims.info/d/444721). My only problem with this is that it's hardly visible in game unless you're really close to it.

And that's all I have for nursery/kids. Let's see what I have under Misc...

Oh ok. MTS has a [""Barrel o' Fire""](http://www.modthesims.info/d/454765) that can be used as a fire pit. 
[
""Salvaged Antiques""](http://www.b-5studio.com/2011/01/green-room.html) is the name of this one over at b5Studio. They have some very recycled things on that page.

Here's a [laundry set](http://www.modthesims.info/d/426172) from MTS that has a sink as the washing machine and a clothes line.

Edit: Whoops! I wasn't finished and accidentally hit Submit. &gt;.&lt;

Another [washing machine](http://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;hl=en&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;twu=1&amp;u=http://sims3s.ru/objects-washer.php&amp;usg=ALkJrhhSXjq_If4Ob7tD3oBZPm_BsB9YHQ). More retro.

Here's more [laundry stuff](http://www.aroundthesims3.com/objects/room_other_03.shtml) from ATS. The washer and dryer at the bottom look like crap in game, but not in the way that you're looking for. lol The rest of the stuff is nice.

What else? What else? I didn't realize I had so much stuff to make my Sims houses look poor. lol

How about some lighting to go in your rooms?

A [candle](http://www.thesimsresource.com/downloads/details/category/sims3-objects-furnishing-lighting-tablelamps/title/ella-table-candle-/id/1035426/) that sit on a table. A [lamp](http://www.aroundthesims3.com/objects/function_lighting_table_02.shtml) made from a bottle with a scarf on it. [Light switches](http://veronarelapse.wordpress.com/2009/11/11/lightswitches/) that are just for decoration but I figured they could go in this category anyway. 

Some electronics? Scroll down some on [this page](http://www.parsimonious.org/furniture3/pages/all_10.html) and you'll find a retro TV. There's an oldtimey type [radio](http://www.aroundthesims3.com/objects/function_electronics_audio_01.shtml) at ATS. The third thing on this page. There are some radios that look like they're from the 50's. 

Now for some random stuff, I think.

I don't know if you could count this a poor but I like to use it instead of the one that came with the game. Here's an [easel](http://www.thesimsresource.com/downloads/details/category/sims3-objects-furnishing-entertainment-hobbiesskills/title/sil-easel-/id/1047241/) for your starving artists.

Here's some [exercise equipment](http://www.aroundthesims3.com/objects/room_downtown_14.shtml) but I only use the punching bag. I put it in the corner of a basement. 

The top of this page there's a [simplified sculpting wheel](http://www.parsimonious.org/furniture3/pages/all_4.html) that won't look as fancy as the original if you have Ambitions. Also, a gramophone at the bottom if you're interested. ;)

Here's a [table](http://lunasimslulamai.jimdo.com/set-gazpacho/) that is made from a door. (you may need to translate) 

And I'll do paintings/posters now but I think that's the end of it.

Here's some [posters](http://sweet-ambrosia1.blogspot.com/2010/09/you-bought-yourself-new-poster-for-your.html). And some more [posters](http://se-sheet-sims-3.22190.n6.nabble.com/Posters-td77.html) in the same style. Some band [posters](http://www.digitalperversion.net/gardenofshadows/index.php?topic=23708.0). Some[ little pictures](http://veronarelapse.wordpress.com/2010/04/04/wall-clutter-pack-1/) that hang randomly. Here are some [flags](http://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;hl=en&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;twu=1&amp;u=http://sims3s.ru/paint-flag.php&amp;usg=ALkJrhhT7EQKBF9jkZI-2y_r2Bbxyoqahg) (2 US, 1 UK, 1 RU) that hang and are kind of draped. Some [nerdy posters](http://s3me.blogspot.com/2010/09/nerdy-posters-80s-style-clocks.html) that are crooked if you scroll a little bit. More [posters](http://s3me.blogspot.com/2010/09/what-can-i-say.html) with the corners hanging down. A [corkboard](http://r2mcreations.blogspot.com/2012/03/download-scrapbook-for-your-officeroom.html) like the one in-game but I like it better.

True,tlocfym,,,"The roar of the crowd is deafening, the heat of the lights beats relentlessly on the mass of opponents in this ultimate battle royale.  During the pre-fight activity, small groups of leaders break off reflecting traditional alliances.  President Obama and Prime Minister Cameron look around nervously at the other western leaders and for the first time ever fear their countries may lose a fight.  Each combatant was allowed to choose one melee weapon before they were led to the arena by a united populace fed up with their inaction and ineptitude.

The pay per view and ticket sales alone lift the world out of a global recession.  Nearly every citizen sits happily glued to their television, some motivated by sheer morbid curiosity, others out of pure delight.  In the arena itself the smell of sweat permeates the cacophony of a crowd screaming in two hundred languages, and below the combatants mill about uncertainly in their groups, waiting for the bell to ring.

Unfortunately, before the announcer has even finished introducing the nearly 200 gladiators the first victims fall.  King Saud is the first fatality, his old frail body unable to hold up to the heat, the standing, and as he performs his first rakat with the other Muslim combatants, he never rises again from prayer, his heart having failed him.

He is not the only elderly leader to go, and before the bell even rings 23 leaders have already bitten the dust, their weapons quickly scooped up by their compatriots.

Finally the countdown begins, the megatron blinking with giant analog numbers as the world counts in unison....10....9....

Each combatant grips their weapon and prepares in their own way. Somewhere in the block of western leaders there is a primal roar, but it is impossible to tell where from.  Newly minted PM Abe holds a Naginata in his hand awkwardly, so far removed from his warrior ancestry and wishing he had never sought another post in government, but still he tries to center himself with old fashioned Japanese stoicism.

8...7....6...

In the throng of Middle eastern combatants, Bashar Assad and Ahmedinejad rattle their scimitars, burning stares at the tall American president sticking out of the crowd of western leaders.

5...4...3...

The President of China, having trained nonstop since the announcement of the final combat sits by confidently, his shades keeping away the glare of the bright lights.  Though a portly Kim stands near him with a long spear, never before has China felt so small, as even still the group of western powers grows.

2...1....FIGHT!!!!

And the bell rings, a single gong echoing across the world, reverberating through countless future generations.  For one second all is silent, and then the crowd explodes.

The Western bloc hurriedly sets up a defensive position, trying quickly to formulate a plan, but they have trouble coming to a consensus before the small knot of Middle Eastern and Muslim leaders crash upon them with swords, hand axes, cries of ""Allahu Ackbar!"" and ""Ibn el-khada!"".  Morsi, in his haste to prove himself, is the first blood of the day; impaled upon the spear of Fredrik Reinfeldt, Prime Minister of Sweden.

Elsewhere Hu Juntao and Kim stay along the sidelines, preferring to allow  the major combatants to weaken each other before entering the fray.  They soon come upon Putin, who has somehow painted himself in perfect camouflage to match the arena walls, and it is not long before they agree to look out for each other, at least for the time being.

A combined attack of African Warlords and Arab/West Asianers has decimated the Western block, and the leaders of Canada, Ireland, Spain, and France lay among the notable dead; however the West still holds a solid advantage.  Elsewhere another primal scream reverberates across the arena, sending shudders along the blood soaked floor.  President Obama, though wounded in the fighting, leans against his two handed maul breathing heavily, his eyes darting from side to side as he awaits the next attack.

In their haste to regroup, the Muslim and African alliance run headlong into the remaining leaders of Asia, who have teamed up with the small bloc of South American leaders. Screams of pain and anguish are drowned by a crowd drunk on blood and death; limbs and entrails litter the arena floor, mixed with the smell of shit and piss and a sweet scent of fear that is almost tangible.

A small group of survivors, mostly from South America, come through the fighting as victors and led by the once beautiful Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, President of Argentina.  Her left eye is swollen shut, her clothing tattered and torn, in her right hand she holds a small two headed axe, and in the other a slender, razor sharp dagger.

The fighting has been going on for some time now, and now there are only three groups left:  The remnants of the western block, 10 to 15 leaders including Cameron with his two handed sword and Obama with his giant maul, the small group of South American survivors, led by President Cristina, and finally Presidents Kim, Putin, and the leader of China.

170 bodies lie mangled on the arena floor, not all dead but certainly all are dying.  Many are unrecognizable, their faces disfigured by wounds still oozing brain matter and life blood into the sand covered floor.

The once deafening crowd sits in shocked silence as the reality of what they are seeing sinks in, even at home, parents have sent children to bed, wives have turned away, even some men who thought they were tough have left, only to come back a slave to their curiosity, faces drained of color.

Back in the arena, the break is over.  President Cristina leads an attack of her remaining soldiers against the western block.  Chavez, though ill, has been pumped with enough adrenaline and pcp to become a liability, and froths at the mouth.   President Obama, for the first time in 8 years, allows himself to finally become angry.  What starts as a low pitched rumble ends in a lion like roar as he leaps from the center of western powers and into the midst of the South American fighters.  The crowd silently rises, knowing that the end is near.

President Obama lands and immediately lashes out with his maul, popping the frothing mouth of Chavez with the eerie sound of a ripe melon falling on concrete, and before the remaining S. Americans can react another melon pops, this time Ollanta Humala, the leader of Peru.  

President Cristina shrieks with rage, and with her remaining two allies circles the president.  President Obama tries his best to keep them at bay, swinging wildly at first one, then another south american leader; however he is attacked from all sides, and even his superior reach can't stop their concerted onslaught, and soon the first razor sharp knife bites into the back of his leg, the hot sensation of blood oozes down his leg.  He falls to his knees, winded and wounded, one eye completely closed and his right leg bleeding horribly, he looks up with hope to see Cameron leading the small band of western powers to his rescue when they are suddenly set upon by Putin and his cadre.  Pivoting to meet the new threat, help is now far away from President Obama.

He struggles to rise to his feet, and manages to stumble into President Cristina's arms, as she holds him she whispers quietly in his ear, ""Tranquilamente mi Presidente, es hora de dormir.""  and she slips her long dagger through his ribs, twisting until it finds his heart.  A strange, wheezing breath escapes President Obama, whistling through another hole in his lungs, as Cristina eases him to the floor, tears welling in her eyes as she looks at her hands, caked with the blood of too many victims, and she falls to her knees sobbing uncontrollably.

Cameron emerges alone from the fight with Putin, using his knowledge of Putin's back pain to circle and strike him from the sides, and he stalks behind President Cristina, his blade dripping in rage and blood...

""It is the Queen's mercy that I give you Cristina, but the revenge tastes no less sweet for the murder of my friends. I should quite like it if you would not struggle so...""  and without another word his blade flashes in the light, the dull edge of his claymore hacking more than cutting into Cristina's neck, the gaping wound immediately raining blood on the nearest spectators.

Cameron looks around the arena at the death around him, and visibly shakes with the disbelief of his survival.  He walks past mounds of bodies to the exit when that primal scream rises again, muffled under a throng of bodies.  Cameron stops in his tracks, all color draining from his face, and a strange sound grows from a distant rumble into the sound of a thousand angry bees....

Bursting from the top of a pile of bodies, chainsaw leading the way, is an enraged Pope Benedict XVI.  Standing atop the bodies, hat askew, his white robes ripped and drenched with blood, he looks down on Cameron as if to pronounce judgment...

""Dies ist nur der Anfang, wird das vierte Reich in alle Ewigkeit regieren! Ihr Blut ist mein Fest, und mein lieber Freund, ich bin schrecklich hungrig!""

He charges down the hill of bodies, the chainsaw's engine roaring almost with glee.   Cameron tries to raise his sword in a feeble defense, but his arm is awfully tired. *Why didn't I think about a chainsaw?* he asks pointlessly as the first bladed-tooth bites into his shoulder, ripping flesh and cloth alike.

Benedict presses on, cutting deeper and deeper into a body which begins to shake with the rattle of blade on bone, blood and gore showering the Pope, and as he begins to laugh he can't help but look more and more like Emperor Palpatine wearing crimson robes...

""So das Heilige Römische Reich wieder ansteigt.""

**TL;DR the Pope wins because he has a chainsaw**

True,GaiusPompeius,,,"I'm glad to listen, and I do understand where you're coming from.  I want to say, obviously, that political activism and concern about the government is essential for the functioning of democracy.  But the issue is that you're afraid, not concerned.  And unless I miss my mark, I don't think you're afraid of an *outcome*, like the KGB showing up at your doorstep in the middle of the night.  You're afraid of the existence of a system that doesn't respond to you, and yeah, that is pretty frightening.  Don't believe that saying ""it's all in m head"" means the problem is trivial.  Knowing yourself is essential to happiness.

The kung-fu fighting example I gave earlier came from [this blog post](http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2009/03/what_was_the_matrix.html), which is excellent and definitely worth a read, depressing as it may be.  And even if you don't see yourself responding with kung-fu, maybe you're depressed that you don't.  One relevant quote:
&gt; What is called the ""world"" doesn't seem like what you thought it would be.... there's a lack of emotional connection; a lack of highs and lows, of change, of either growth or regression.  No energy.  There's no real love.  Instead is trudging, boredom.... ennui.   There's nothing happening in your life; yet you feel like it's out of control.

The problem is narcissism, which (according to this blog's discussion, whose definition I find very helpful) is something like the belief that you are the main character of your own movie.  You have an *identity*, and things are supposed to turn out a certain way.  You have friends, because as the main character, of course you're supposed to have friends.  And then the whole idea ruptures when we realize just how much is beyond our control, that things which just *aren't supposed to be that way* sometimes are.

What you can do is find meaning outside yourself.  And it doesn't have to be anything grandiose.  Just take a moment and be a supporting character in one of your friend's movies.  Be there for them.  Listen to them and really, honestly *be interested* in what they're saying, rather than just waiting for your turn to talk.  I'm not saying you don't already do this (I don't know you personally).  But most human being I've known could stand to do this more often.  Try it.  Take yourself outside your own movie for a while.

It crosses into surreal magic or dreams depending on how you interpret it.  Hugo was made so Scorsese's kids could finally watch one of his movies.  Both movies are absolutely beautiful, so of the plot drags on you can still get lost in the cinematography and colors.

I would suggest watching both.  Furthermore, check out Brave.  Even if your mom doesn't like kids movies, It is a movie about mother child conflict, and she will be able to relate almost instantly.  Great movie for all ages.  Have her read this post of she doesn't believe you.  Brave has fighting but it is either with bears, or comedic cartoon violence.  Warner Bros type stuff.  It's not like other animated films, the environment is very realistic, and only the people look animated.  Even if she doesn't like pixar, the mother/child themes will make up for it.  It also has an extremely strong and obviously brave female lead.

I might finally add Finding Neverland and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.  Both romantic, but so much more.  They might not be as tame, but should have almost no violence.",0,1356900179,,0,1356900704,1,c7oe2tm,t3_15ojix,t1_c7oe2tm,t3_15ojix,,1430809872,4,False,MovieSuggestions,t5_2sqpa,4

True,BZenMojo,,,"White people outnumber black people in the US 6 to 1 but black rapists are no more likely to target white victims than their own representation in the population, about 10-15%.

One would think a black rapist having 6 times as many white victims to choose from would mean they would naturally rape white victims 6 times as often according to their density in the population.  But the fact of the matter is, black rapists have no interest in targeting whites.

So say the FBI statistics and the NCVS numbers.

So it's correct that the person making the ""black culture"" claim knows nothing about black culture.  They can't even figure out that most of the people raping white women are white men...about 6 times as often, in fact.

That's right.  If you see a black guy and a white guy on the street in the middle of the night, white women, cross the street to the black guy.  He's probably picking up his kids from daycare.  Also, if you meet a white guy at a party, stay the fuck away from him...he might just rape you.

EDIT: Now robbery, yeah, black people rob white people at much higher rates than white people rob white people.  Then again, black people have 3 times the poverty and 1/20th the average net worth, so why the fuck would black people rob black people...that's a lot of hard work for little return.

Doesn't explain why white people commit so many more assaults than everyone else, though.  I blame the kyriarchy.

When I was 15, there was a field behind my house that I would always play in after school.  

It rained hard one night, and the day after I wanted to play in the field, but it was too muddy. So I took off my clothes to go play in the meadow. Looking back on it, it probably wasn't the greatest decision, a 15 year old girl playing alone naked in a field, it's a wonder that nothing terrible happened to me.  I wasn't vary careful when I was young.  I wasn't watching my step, and stepped in a hole.  The rain weakened the dirt enough that I fell in entirely.  It wasn't a very far fall, only about one and a half meters, but it was still disorienting. I layed there with my eyes closed for a few minutes, then I felt it.  Hundreds of tiny bugs crawling all over me.  I panicked and stood up fast, causing the dirt under my feet to slide, and I fell back down.  The bugs were crawling all over my legs and apparently they love warm places, and collectively decided that my vagina was the most hospitable place at the moment.  Centipedes, ladybugs, spiders and the like all crawling into my hole.  Through all my fear, I suddenly found pleasure.  I was growing most causing even more of them to pile in.   I was in extacy.  I looked around for more bugs, and saw a cluster of them writhing around in a hole.  I grabbed handfuls and began to shovel them in.  That was the hardest I ever came.  After climbing back up into the field, I carefully removed them, and went home. From that point on, whenever it rained I would return to the hole, and have the bugs pleasure me like no human could.

Yes, I think there's more to life and reality than what we experience here.

Yes, I was human in those other lifetimes.

I guess you could say we have a 'soul', 'essence', or whatever. There's something more to us than a body.  I call it the 'silent observer'.

I think it's probable that everything has a 'soul'.  How it functions for other forms of life, I don't know.  But, I don't think we are so special that we are the only ones who have this inside of us.

True,[deleted],,,"My son is 12 years old and has a cognitive impairment. I never say he ""suffers"" from the impairment, as he's the happiest child on the earth. When he was 3 years old, no walking, barely speaking anything intelligible and not eating solid food, the pediatrician gave his mother and I the diagnosis. Within 2 weeks, his mother left us. That was about 10 years ago, and it's been he and I ever since.

He has been in special education with selective mainstreaming. He's in 6th grade now, and within his limits, he is thriving. Yet he will always need to live with me. As for sacrifices, I think they are pretty much on par with an average (if that can be said) single parent. My parents have been amazing, as they take him for an overnight on the weekends, so I can decompress a bit.

That said, summers are always a challenge, as not just any summer camp will do. Baby sitters are the same. Not like he needs anyone with special skills, but once they know he is cognitively impaired, their rates double.

As for benefits, I can say one thing is that he doesn't understand fully how badly we are struggling with finances. I have been out of work for 3 years, have exhausted all of our benefits, and are pretty much living off my parents kindness. He only got 5 Christmas presents this year from me, but he still was incredibly happy. I cook him Hamburger Helper with canned veggies instead of meat, and it's his favorite thing to eat (feel free to insert Cousin Eddie reference in here, for those who caught that). So despite all of this, he couldn't be happier.

Would I do this again if I could turn back time? Only maybe, and not because of his disability. His mother leaving him really has had a lasting impact on his self-esteem. I would not bring a child in the world to raise without another parent. But that's just me. I'm playing the hand I have been dealt, and I am doing so with a smile.

Age 10: 
--
It's my sister's 6th Birthday, and my 10th Birthday was mere weeks after, so we (My mum) decided to combine our birthday parties into one. We went to the nearby pool (Indoor, because outdoor pools in England in January?  HAH!)
Anyway, I'm pretty much a fish in water, up until a few years ago, I was in a swim team, but I'm diversing.

Lets just say, I dived underwater, because going underwater is awesome, and when I tried to surface, there was a rather... Large kid on one of those spongy floaty things. After bashing the bottom a little bit, the kid finally realised there was something up and jumped off. I nearly passed out and drowned.

Age 20:
--
This one was kind of my fault. I had an hour to zip to an exporters, exchange some stuff and get back to work on time.. I had 10 minutes left on the last 3 miles - I got this! 
At this pojng, I'm still on the motorway, coming around a rather large sweeping bend at around 60 mph.

My tyre blew out.. I wobbled all over the road, trying to control the car, before another tyre gave way, and I careered off into a motorway lane barriers at 50mph, hit it, span around and completely took out my back end on the barrier again.

At this point, I'm in the fast lane, facing the wrong way. Anyone could come around that corner and completely fuck me and my car over. Luckily, it was pretty quiet and I somehow managed to restart the car and limp it over to the hard shoulder for recovery. No injuries whatsoever, I was a lucky bastard. Just had to pay for the barrier repair, and my insurers covered the car repair.

This one prompted me to have a bit of a meltdown and I shaved off all my hair and closed myself off for weeks, being completely sure I should have been dead.

Age 21 (last year!):
--
Another Automobile accident, this time, completely not my fault.

I used to work as a van driver. I used to drive this wee [Purgeot Partner](http://www.nortonwaypeugeot.com/images/new-vans/large/peugeot-partner-van.png) about for stationary deliveries and such.

I was coming around another long sweeping road, with a 30mph limit. I'm tracked in that van, so I was sticking to the speed limit pretty strictly..
As I approached a junction, As I had right of way, I kept going. A guy just exited it without looking. My van came off better, but it was still a mess. The clash of metal, the screeching of my brakes, and the eventual thud of hitting a barrier brought back some pretty harsh memories of the year before. Everything went white - but that's because the Airbag went off, and the white bonnet had popped up. But my chest was on FIRE. I opened the door of the van and staggered out, clutching my chest, the airbag felt getting a solid punch in the chest.

I staggered over to the other driver, despite bystanders shouting ""Sit down, your chest! Someone call an ambulance!"" to make sure he was fine. He was fine, his car had just span on the spot a little. But I noticed his engine was smoking.. and so was mine. ""Dude, your engine. I'm going turning mine off too."" 

I rang my boss to tell him what had happened, then the police, fire engine and ambulance came.. It wasn't until a bystander said to me ""You are lucky, any faster, you would have gone right through that barrier and into the river.""

I just sat there, completely out of it until the Paramedic came to check on me. I got Whiplash pretty bad and couldn't walk properly for weeks. Got a decent payout too..

Other driver didn't have insurance (which is illegal here in the UK), so he got a ban, I think.

True,ModernDemagogue,,,"&gt;You arguments about Simpson-Bowles are ridiculous.

Oh yeah? Then refute them.

&gt;Social Security is an entitlement program, meaning that even though there is a specific tax for it, it still affects our budget.

So many logical issues in so few words.

1) So what if it is an entitlement program? That doesn't actually mean anything. You know that right? I think you're just using that word as a pejorative because you've heard that entitlements are bad or something. Here's a tip; it was made up by Luntz or one of his lackeys because it tested well as a counter to social safety nets. If you mean the spending related to it is mandatory as opposed to discretionary, well sure, but again, I don't know what point you're making with that brilliant distinction.
2) So what if it affects our budget? I didn't say it didn't. What I did say is that it has nothing to do with the deficit, and both Social Security and Medicare are cash flow positive. If you are worried about future unfunded liabilities, those are completely separate issues which have nothing to do with Social Security or Medicare, and nothing to do with getting spending and the deficit under control in the near and medium term. Republicans try to incorporate them as a part of their starve the beast strategy, but this is pernicious and stupid.

&gt;Extending upon your logic, Medicare does not need reform which is a ridiculous assertion.

What logic are you extending? Your own random speculation? Where did I make that assertion? Oh right, I didn't. In fact, I pointed out that it does nothing to reform Medicare (that isn't already in the ACA). Don't make shit up about what I said; its right there above for you to look at.

&gt;Why should Simpson Bowles raise taxes on the wealthy if it does not need to? 

Actually it does. It raises taxes on everyone and assumes the Bush tax cuts expire on the wealthy. This is part of my point. You don't even understand the plan you are advocating. It's okay, Boehner didn't either. His insane interpretation is the one that doesn't start by raising taxes on the wealthy. Plus, its an untenable position that the wealthy do not need to be taxed more. No credible economist can back that up. But if you really want to get into a debate on what the effect increasingly regressive tax structures have when introduced to a population with already massively disparate wealth, wait, you know what, I don't want to have that debate because its a stupid one and it ends with you being wrong. If you think we can sustain the current burden placed on the middle and lower class, you are nuts.

&gt;The entirety of your argument supposes that only type of good reform is one which raises taxes on the rich, while simultaneously preserving expensive entitlement programs in their entirety.

Not really. My argument has really nothing to do with that at all. My argument is more or less that the American people chose a President who said he would not do certain things, as opposed to the party who proposed the Ryan budget and still clings to it in its deficit reduction proposals. That no one really understans the Simpson-Bowles plan, and that its a fucking bad plan for a myriad of reasons. Krugman can explain to you in more depth if you like.

Funadamentally though, I don't see our social safety net, oh I'm sorry, ""entitlement,"" programs as a problem; well, Bush' prescription drug benefit was a fucking handout to big pharma and pretty boneheaded, but absent that, they were all there under Clinton and were all working fine. The issue is we spent a lot of money we didn't have, moron-ed our way into a recession which cut revenues, and did a whole bunch of other fiscally boneheaded shit which we can recover from through raising revenue, and intelligently cutting spending; but little if any of those savings need to come from substantive cuts to social safety net programs— we can do things which improve efficiency, etc... but we don't need to raise the fucking retirement age, do you know how absurd a proposition that is to sneak in there? That after 70 years every man woman and child now has to work 3-4-5 years longer? You know what the goal of that is? To make people say, well fuck, if I don't get it until 70, why bother even having it? That is the goal. Make no mistake, this is about Republicans hating the new deal and that is greedy, and selfish, and fucking stupid.

But yes, I do believe taxes on the wealthy should go up, and be cut or stay the same for the middle class, because the middle class is what powers our economy; they need money to spend so that we can have the waterfall fiscal multiplier across industries. I also believe we should fix Social Security by removing contribution caps, and I think we should reform Medicare by basically creating a single-payer healthcare system.

&gt;How is Simpson-Bowles a tax hike on the middle class?

A lot of the deductions and loopholes which would be closed in order to raise the revenue are deductions which help the middle class. For example, itemized deductions for mortgage interest. It is simply not viable without increasing the deficit or cutting deductions so deeply as to affect more than the top 1%. Also, having to work three more years before receiving SS benefits is either a benefit cut, or a tax hike, however you want to look at it.

&gt;PS, you know nothing about gerrymandering.

Republican votes for the house: 58,245,122
Democrat votes for the house: 59,611,506

Explain to me how Obama can win Pennsylvania by 5 points, but then Democrats only carry 5 of the state's 18 house seats? Gerrymandering. In fact, there was a lawsuit about PA which was thrown out 5-4 by the conservative leaning Supreme Court.

So please, tell me again how I know nothing about the subject. I absolutely fucking love, love people making random assertions like that without even an attempt at backing it up. Makes you seem real credible. And I'm not saying this is one sided— I'm saying this was one sided this time because of Republican tactics going into 2010.

True,[deleted],,,"Beanie Babies were everywhere in my house when they first came out. My sister probably had them all. She wasn't into barbies or horses, just Beanie Babies. It was her drug. Then I started liking them. Back then it wasn't normal for a cub scout with GI Joe for a father to want Beanie Babies, but I didn't care. My sister's obsession became my own. 

On my birthday my parents asked me what I wanted and so I let them know that I didn't want any more Pokemon cards or any of that classical boy shit. Loud and proud, I asked for my first Beanie Baby. They looked at me funny and said they would think about it. About a week later I turned seven. My birthday had finally arrived and hopefully my first Beanie Baby, too. We had cake and the usual ceremony. I got a helmet for my bike and some Pokemon cards. I showed that I was very glad about the Pokemon cards. I acted happy instead of sad. After waiting a few minutes I asked why they didn't get me what my heart truly wanted. My dad reminded me that I was a boy and that ""asking for one of those things is like asking to be a girl.""

A few hours later as we were all getting ready for bed I went to my sister's room and asked her if she had any old Beanie Babies she didn't want any more. She said if I didn't get out of her room she would tell on me for still wanting girl stuff. Well, I went to my room. I waited an hour for her to fall asleep. When she did I snuck into her room and raided her closet and stole Batty the Bat. I kept him hidden under the sink in my bathroom where my sister couldn't find him. I would play with him only at night because he was nocturnal and that was the safest time to. When we moved I couldn't take him. Maybe he's out there somewhere right now being someone else's favorite toy.

It really feels like there's been an abundance of hatefulness toward women on Reddit lately. I put my foot down when it comes to bashing something we do every month, something that we don't always have control over and something we can't exactly overlook.

I am not easily offended; in fact, the very comments I pointed out don't offend me so much as make me go ""*Really?* &gt;heavy sigh&lt;"" I thought the picture was hilarious and came to the comments for some light-hearted discussion/bantering/puns about feminine hygiene, and there was some of that.

True,Irish_Whiskey,,,"&gt;I can’t see any way to explain that apart from: 1) Multiverse or 2) Rational creator.

A caveman couldn't see any way that fire worked other than spirits, or a strange form of animal. Greeks couldn't see any way lightning worked other than Zeus, or clouds bumping against each other. Only a few hundreds years ago, people thought disease were caused either by demons and spirits, or smells. Only a hundred years ago people thought light and time were static because of an 'ether', and would have considered stories of quantum mechanics and relativity to be nonsensical gibberish.

We are probably further from understanding the origin of the universe (if it has one) than the caveman was from fire. We are discussing what happens when time and causality itself might not exist, which is something it's possible our brains literally cannot fathom. 

""We don't know"" is the only honest answer. Simply because we can imagine a magical being with unspecified and unexplained powers responsible for the phenomenon is no more of a probable answer than it was for fire. It's not an answer at all, because no explanation is given for how God works. I might as well just claim ""philochromes"" are responsible for all mysteries, like the universe, and when asked for an explanation just say ""They are the things which do the things we don't understand, and which we can't comprehend"". That's no better an answer than a God or gods.

All the other points about complexities and laws are just simplification of science made to fit the God story, but not independent evidence. It's not surprising people do these, even knowledgeable scientists, because it appears that anthropomorphizing natural forces and finding patterns in nature we can relate to as beings, is literally in our nature, a biological bias. But it doesn't stand up to objective scrutiny.

Condom situation - it sounds like she said ""I want you to use a condom"", he kept pushing for not using one, and she relented. Not rape. If he'd forced himself in her without one, that would be rape. She made ""encouraging noises"", and that would seem pretty damn consensual to any human being.

Following her into the bathroom is creepy, but not illegal. If he'd kicked the door down or picked the lock, that might be assault.

I understand that my viewpoint on human sexuality may not be popular with some people, but it is what it is. Think about every time you've hooked up with a new person. You flirt, you kiss, maybe you start to put your hands on her. The talking part is pretty much over now. She moans and pulls you closer, kisses you harder. She likes it, right? You move to a bedroom, and you have sex. At any point, did either of us ask ""Do you consent for me to touch you sexually?"" No. Not because it's a mood killer, but because it's completely unnatural and a little bizarre. Maybe she's been traumatized since childhood, she doesn't know how to say no, she doesn't want it, her mind is racing and she shuts down. How the **fuck** am I supposed to know? Maybe I do ask her, and she says yes, but she doesn't actually mean it in her heart. Too bad, looks like I'm a rapist because I'm not a mind reader.

I upvoted you anyway, because you're being cool and you're adding to the discussion. But under this school of thought, I could have possibly raped every woman I've been with, because I've only explicitly asked ""Do you want it"" a couple of times during some dirty talk. Maybe next time I have sex, I should ask ""Are you still cool with this babe?"" every few minutes, just in case she changes her mind halfway through.

I'm glad that we're moving away from pure victim blaming. But that doesn't mean they're absolved of all responsibility.

True,Numbers_Racket,,,"Is sex an inseparable component of love? Most people love many more people than their partner, they just don't have sex with them. Over time, the friendship and companionship you have in your relationship is much more important than your sex life. Desire comes and goes over time. Sex isn't always a perfect union between two lovers. Sometimes it is just physical.

On the flip side of cheating, if you truly loved your partner, you should be able to rebuild trust after almost anything. There are no absolutes in love. No marriage is a fairy tale. Sometimes a relationship burns to the ground, and it is rebuilt better than ever.

People cheat for many reasons. Mostly because humans are humans, and hormones and desire can override all common sense. Those who are compelled to cheat often have deep underlying issues, and a history of betrayal, abuse, or sex shame allows a cheater to compartmentalize their life. Many, if not most, cheaters will say they still love their partner.

I was depressed a lot for most of my life and was always very bad at making friends because of it. I tried my best to just completely forget about it. Every day was a struggle to just get past school and go to my computer, my sanctuary , where no one could really see how sad and what I really looked like. I thought about suicide a few times, not really considering it, but just thinking about it briefly. I didn't know what to do. What are you suppose to do when you are that far in, right? You're already 50, 100, 200 pounds overweight. You are too far in now, you can't just be normal. So you eat more. Go on the computer, try to forget about it.

But then, one day, 6 months ago, I was reading a thread on reddit, just like this one, that inspired me. They told me to just do it. They said that's all you had to do. And so I did. I did what they recommended and got a MyFitnessPal account and tracked every thing I put into my body. Everything. I cut out every drink except for water.

Slowly, baby steps, I read more and more about health and fitness. I checked out /r/keto, and /r/fitness, and realized I really liked those ideas, so I started doing that. More and more I started to go to the gym and do a keto diet. 6 months later, I have lost 70 pounds and have never been stronger. Now I love the feeling seeing my body grow in the good and shrink in the bad. I have never been happier. I still have a ways to go, but you know what? 6 months ago I was thinking, ""I wonder if I will ever be fit, or skinny?"" You know what i'm thinking now? ""In 6 months, I **will** be my goal weight.

True,superpony123,,,"My life is nearly identical to kjolley3's. I spent pretty much all of my childhood feeling like I was unwanted (not true) and my parents didn't love me (not true) because they spent all their time caring for my severely autistic brother. It caused me to have freakouts in sadness and rage as a desperate call for attention. Then when I was old enough to help out, it became my duty to babysit at the instant it was requested.  They never neglected me or anything, I was loved, but the amount of constant care my brother required was astonishing, and I interpreted that as my parents love him way more than they love me. It sucked. I was pretty severely depressed from ages 10-15, and I blame it 100% on my brothers existence. It still makes me feel guilty because it's not his fault he was born that way, but there's nothing in the world that will make me forgive him. Virtually every aspect of my life has been negatively impacted by his condition. I was even bullied throughout most of elementary school solely because I was his sister. It's not like he even went to my school. I don't understand why I was bullied for this, but it made me even more hateful. He was thankfully put in a special boarding school when I was about 10 because he had a bad habit of violently pulling out random people's hair (unfortunately I was one of those people too many times) by the handful. I always begged my parents to give him up for adoption when I was a kid. This always made my parents very sad, which I now understand. He lives in a group home now, but even having him visit for the holidays--even if it's just for a night or two--really just shits on everyone for a while. My mom looks like she's ready to jump off a cliff. I hide in my room or go someplace all day and night. My dad pretends nothing is wrong.

It sucks, and I still wish he had been given up for adoption or something. When he's not home, and he doesn't come up, sometimes I can forget about him almost entirely. Other times I can't, like right now. He was home for two days for Christmas (not like he knows what holidays are, he has the mental age of a 1 year old at best) and brought some awful sickness with him. Only it was just a little cough for him--i cought it and now I've been exceptionally ill. If it were anyone else, I wouldn't be upset at them. But since it's him, and I probably only caught it because he's completely incapable of being a sanitary human being (forget washing hands), I only feel more hate.

True,PepticBurrito,,,"I'll give you a general overview of what I know.

All Spawn areas can be sub divided into multiple sub areas to prevent immediate death upon spawning because there's a guy pointing a gun a a specific spawn position.  It doesn't work very well and you will find that sometimes you spawn and IMMEDIATELY take damage, but at least they tried.  

Kill Confirmed/Team Deathmatch:  The spawns are pretty straight forward and traditional.  It uses proximity based spawns.  There are multiple spawn zones.  When you spawn, it's VERY likely you will spawn on the outside rim of the map.  Draw an imaginary line through the center of the map, that's where their team is likely spawning.  It is possible that they are spawning just across the map, rather than straight though the center.  Pay attention to which direction your team is facing.  They are looking that way for a reason. It is worth noting, both of these games have solid strategy to them.  Most maps have easily defended areas near a spawn.  For example, Cargo, side of the map near C Dom Flag, near water.  There's a crate that acts as a walkway to the top of some containers.  From that walkway, you can see across to the raised platforms where they are spawning.  You can walk over and look at the water.  You can drop down on water side and move into that side container that opens up to a view of the center of B Dom flag and the building with the second story window.  Moving around within that self contained area isn't a bad idea after spawning, there's multiple places to view common paths, and areas you can't see take so long to flank around to your spawn that by time someone has flanked the area, the spawns have moved.

Domination:  Usually straight forward.  There's generally 4 main spawn locations.  A, C, and two sides of B.  Most of the time, you spawn on or near to A or C, which ever flag your teams owns.  There seems to be some element of proximity based spawning that I've seen used by very cohesive teams.  Basically, teams who control both of the flanking spawns and their flag spawn get closer spawns to B.  If your team pushes too far into enemy territory or captures all three flags, the enemy will no longer spawn on their Flags, but on the side spawns.  For example, Standoff.  The spawns are generically A and C, the Gas Station, Tank side.  When you have a triple cap, you can usually contain the enemy team by positioning your team in a way that has someone near A, C and one of the Side spawns.  This gives you far better knowledge about where the enemy team is going to spawn from.  Personally I think trip caps are a bad idea, it is usually better to spawn trap the enemy if your team is strong enough, by not capping the third flag and not pushing fully into their flag position.  They reliably spawn at their flag, well within the view of your team as you gun them down.

Hard Point.  There's at least 4 general spawn areas.  This game runs off proximity based spawns.  There is always one spawn very close to the objective that you want to force the game to spawn the team at, so it's worth setting up a defensive position such that you are guarding the common walk ways from the other spawns towards the HP and the guarded spawn.  This will crush the enemy team.

Headquarters:  Very similar to Hardpoint, with one exception.  When a team captures the headquarters, and the other team wants to destroy it, the team that owns the headquarters won't respawn until the headquarters is destroyed.  This is important to understand.  If the next headquarters location is not next to the previous location, that team that got the previous headquarters cap will get an immediate spawn advantage on most maps.  This is because the team that is still alive is all bunched up around the headquarters and the other team will safely spawn away from them, which may end up being next to the next headquarters.  The extreme versions of this can be seen on Hijacked and Nuketown 2025.  Hijacked being far worse, because headquarters spawns in the ship building and back decks, which is right on top of the new spawn for the team that just got the previous cap.

Free for all: a crap ton of preset spawn locations.  Memorize these and you can spawn straight into a new game with a score streak of your choice but immediately targeting your nearby enemy spawns faster than they can target you. 

Demolition:  Functionally the same as Domination spawns.  One team spawns on A DOM flag, one on C Dom flag.  It doesn't seem to have a strong proximity element to it, but neither does Dom and I've seen exceptions to that in DOM.  I imagine if the team sets up their attack/defense line correctly, it can turn into a stronger spawn for them.  There are emergency side spawns in the same location as in Domination, in case the primary spawn has been overrun by the enemy.

Special Case:  Tact Inserts.  It is possible to DESTROY the spawn system completely in a game by having multiple people on a team using Tact Inserts.  It's actually quite fascinating to see in action.  I've seen it happen in Dom and I've tested causing it on purpose with a group of friends a few times.  Basically, if multiple people on your team tact insert into strongly held enemy territory over and over, the spawns revert to free for all spawns.  It works best on the ""smaller maps"".  This makes playing domination very weird.

How to Learn spawns:  Pay attention to two things, your kill cam and where you spawn.  The kill cam tells you, quite shockingly, WHERE you were shot from.  Odds are, that guy spawned within the past 15-20 seconds, he came from that direction.  When you spawn, don't take your spawn for granted.  If you have the time, look around and take in your environment for a moment.  How many of your team is already near you, where are they already looking, what general area of the map are you in, etc etc.  It doesn't take long to see where all the spawn areas are, there aren't that many of them in the first place.",0,1356936471,,0,1356983467,1,c7onsw9,t3_15oocm,t1_c7onsw9,t1_c7om0l4,,1430814521,8,False,blackops2,t5_2sqqn,8

There was this kid named Brandon in my high school. He was massive, like literally a child in a man's body. He was also the biggest dickhead I've ever met in my life; used to bully EVERYONE, even the teachers were intimidated by him and turned a blind eye when he did something in class. Well one day we had an IT class and he's sitting next to me. I really wanted to get my work done because I had a doctor's appointment later that day and someone was coming to pick me up. He started messing about, shit like turning my computer off, pressing on my keyboard, etc. I persevered and got it all done when I went up to the teacher who was sitting at the front desk to tell her that I was finished. She came back with me to my computer and everything was deleted, and the computer was off. The teacher gave me detention for wasting her time (fucking bitch) and told me to sit back down. She walks away and soon as I try to sit he moves the chair and I fall down. I was pretty pissed already but now everyone in the class was laughing at me as well. I just walked out of the school and went home. Got in a lot of trouble the next day.

Anyway, a few weeks later and my friend told me that there are rumours going around that Brandon's mother was a somewhat famous former porn star. I didn't believe him at first but then I saw Brandon's own friend making a joke about it and the guy got pissed off which made me think it could be true. 

Now, I was still angry at this guy and just generally pissed off at how he treats people so I set about trying to ruin his life. I didn't know his mother's name but I knew his surname so I tried searching every porn site I knew with that and no luck. I searched by our town name and nothing. I was about to give up until one day when his mom came to pick him up. I SHIT YOU NOT I recognised her face from one of the videos that I had come across when I was searching by the town name. She had a COMPLETELY unrelated porn alias to her surname. 

Feeling evil, I photoshoped his head on the body of the guy whose dick his mum was chocking on and printed out about 30 posters. I put them all over the school and in high places, usually the ceiling of the bathroom, top of the classroom, any place where it would be hard to take them down. Massive shitstorm occurred and the school closed down for 2 days while trying to find the person responsible. After it reopened I never saw Brandon again.

True,flacjacket,,,"Here's my perspective as a graduate student.

First the simple question, in the US, it's 4 years for the bachelors then straight into a PhD program (you'll usually pick up the masters along the way). For the PhD, you go until you write your thesis, a lot of that depends on your research advisor, but if everything goes well, that's usually 5 to 5-1/2 years, but it may go as high as 8 to 9. Most international students that transferred into the PhD program at my school got a 2 year masters in their home country. At that point, you can start to diverge, many industry or national lab jobs will take PhD graduates, but to go into academia (and some industry research) will typically require a couple more years (2 to 3) of post doctoral (colloquially postdoc) research before going for tenure track positions.

Job prospects for PhD physicists are very good, with only 2% unemployment a year out of graduation (see [the most recent study by the AIP](http://www.aip.org/statistics/trends/emptrends.html)), but there are many variables that go into that, and you may not end up doing basic physics research in the end. Some concentrations, such as biophysics and condensed matter, will lend themselves more to industry research or other jobs outside of academia than other concentrations, such as astro or particle, but there are always outlets for any skills. 

In that vein, my department has been having careers seminars, where alumni who've gone outside of academia gave presentations on their work, how they got into it, and often a hiring pitch, which has been really good for showing the diversity of applications of a physics PhD. This has included GE oil drilling, ""Big Data"" mining, and Alcoa. One of the main points all the presentations have drilled home is that having a physics PhD doesn't show that you can turn some dials and click some buttons to make X, Y and Z machines work, but they show a set of critical thinking skills that can be adapted to many different situations.

One last point I will make with relation to jobs is that if you go into physics, you should be willing to settle outside of academia. I feel many physicists start out wanting to land a professorship at a tier 1 research school, but landing those positions is almost like trying to become a rock star, and it'll be hard to fight back if you slip too far along the way. The main difference in this analogy being there are many fall backs and other optional paths (teaching, etc) when going for physics.

The day-to-day will vary greatly depending on what job you end up going into and what subfield you go in for. As a grad student in experimental condensed matter, I'm usually doing something related to my experiment during the day (running the experiment, preparing samples, drawing/ordering/assembling some apparatus) and reading journals or doing literature review in the evening or whenever there is down time. Most of the people in my group utilize synchrotron facilities, so they are usually planning data runs, designing new apparatus to use at the facilities or doing data analysis of past runs in between beam time. As time goes along, it shifts from setup and preparation of the experiment to data analysis and paper/thesis writing. On the other hand, one of my roommates is a theorist, and his day is mostly doing calculations and setting up programs to perform simulations or evaluate nasty numerical differential equations.

The daily tasks of professors will vary greatly from one to the next, but there are some constant strains. Professors are typically involved in acquiring funding for and guiding the research of their group. While they aren't typically running the experiments (which falls to grad students), they run the lab and set the agenda of the research. This will, however, depend greatly on the style of the professor; newer professors are typically much for involved and hands on in developing research, and as they become full-time professors will step off the reigns (often leaving it more to postdocs) as they take up roles in other groups and committees. In addition, there is usually some teaching that professors are expected to do and some other services they are expected to provide (serving on thesis committees, refereeing journal articles, etc). With industry jobs, you have a full gamut of what you want to work on and how you want your daily schedule to be structured.

For you, I'd say if physics is something that inspires you, absolutely stick with it. I found my passion for physics in high school watching and reading Carl Sagan, Richard Feynman, and several others. Working though undergrad and grad school will be very trying and I know a couple people that have dropped, but if it's something you're interested in, the work will excite you.

True,IWipeWrong,,,"I liked it for its melee brawling/combo system. 

I'd just drive around town looking for gangs to fight or go into the One thousand cut arena which arms you with a golden knife, I think it breaks once you kill 100 people whereas normal knives break after 3, and right at the start, I'd just drop the knife and beat up/disarm everyone with melee. It's just so much more satisfying tackling a person down and smashing his face in over and over again, then kick his buddy in the knee, take his arm at the elbow, and snap it while everyone else around you become so afraid that you get an attack of opportunity on them (think Jill streaks from Assassins Creed). 

The story however was too linear for me and just felt sped up towards the end of the game. 

Like GTA, there are different districts on the map in which the story missions take place. You get apartments in each part but you spend the majority of the missions in the first and two apartment areas. The other districts just isn't interesting enough to explore except I'd you want to find all the treasure chests, complete the races, or bet in a cock fight. 

You play Wei Shen, an undercover cop from the United States returning to his hometown of Hong Kong to help out the police there. 

You old neighborhood is controlled by the Sun On Yee triad and people from your childhood are in the gang so they are your ticket in. 

Combat moves/abilities are unlocked by gaining ""Face"", a point system where you get points for doing Triad/cop missions and a third branch is unlocked by collecting statues around the island, but a few can only be obtained after certain story missions. 

What i didn't like in the Main story missions was how your police face meter would start out at max and decreases when you do something like ding another persons car, hit a fence/light light like with your car and if your ride gets destroyed, you lose points for stealing a car. The triad value on the other hand starts at zero and can only be increased by doing things like using more combos before beating an enemy, tossing them into environmental finishers like the fan in an air conditioner or pulling a metal grate down on them.  

Hurting people is a lot more fun than making sure you don't damage the paint if someone's car during a high speed shoot out chase. Outside of story missions, kill all the civilians you want. 

Sure the police points don't really matter unless you're a completionist but the only other way to gain police points is by doing the police side missions.

Like in recent GTAs you also get girlfriends. Though its more line you only get one night stands and the girls are only there for you to finish your mission and get the bonus from them. After you're done with them, you never see them again. Well, at least you don't have to worry about the girls calling you up to take them out on some drive by shooting since your interactions with them last only 5 minutes. 

I was confused at why it seems like Wei has some real deep relationships with some of the girls after taking them on one date. The most bizarre one involves Wei stalking the girl and bugging her phone to see if she's cheating on him. After that mission as her character was walking away, I tackled her, put her in a hold, slammed her head into the trunk of her car and stuffed her inside. I drove the car to the pier next to her apartment and jumped out as the car dived into the ocean. 

There was a fisherman watching me. I pushed into the water. 

Water is instant death for all NPCs. 

***
 I was able to complete all the police/triad side missions, the story, all mini games achievement, and collect every treasure/buy every car and clothes, within 30 hours. 

I'd say this game is enjoyable of you like going out and just fisting people into submission but id you're looking for plot or replay ability, wait for a deeper discount. 

Also don't be fooled by all the big name voice actors for this game. Like Patrick Stewart in oblivion, most of their characters don't get more than 10 minutes of interactions.

True,BionicBeans,,,"Alright alright alright, would y'all that don't know like to understand WHY we have our silly cup size names?

I'll take your silence so far as a yes. Starbucks gets its roots in Italy. Italians traditionally drank coffee in about 8oz. When bringing this experience back to America, Bux anticipated that Americans would want something a bit larger, so they made a 12oz size as well. These sizes were called **short** and **tall** respectively. Make sense so far?

Well, America being America, they were still not satisfied with these amounts for their espresso beverages and coffee. Starbucks added two more sizes to compensate, both reaching back to Italy again: the 16oz **grande**, which is Italian (not just Spanish) for large or huge (by Italian standards) and the almighty 20oz (or 26oz iced) **venti**. (Venti simply means 20, since they already exhausted the Italian for large).

The short still exists, though a majority of our customers don't know about it, other than its use as a kids drink cup. 

And now, we have the **trenta** (meaning 30, for its 30oz size). It's volume is larger than the average person's stomach. Have fun distending your stomach with coffee or tea and going to the bathroom several times!

Matrix 4- Matrix Revealed.
We find out that all of the humans are *still* in the Matrix. The Architect and Agent Smith both mention that the Matrix is an imperfect environment. Smith said that Humans rebelled at the ‘perfect’ matrix originally made for them. It turns out that the ‘perfect’ world is in fact the matrix that we’ve seen in the first three movies. It was never disassembled. The Zion level was created entirely for those minds that couldn’t handle the main level of the matrix. People like Neo and Morpheus who could see the glitches inherent in any large virtual world. The Zion level simply gave their mind an excuse to brush off any other inconsistencies they might notice.

This answers many of the lingering issues with the first three films. Neo can control the sentries in the Zion level because *they are still imaginary constructs within the machine he is attached to.* It explains Zion itself, a city with an extremely high level of technology, considering it’s populated by refugees. It also explains the *Nebuchadnezzar* and the other craft that seems to operate outside the realm of established physics. While they showed similar hovercraft in the *Animatrix*, these could be explained away as being implanted memories. Implanted memories would also explain why nobody seemed to recall Zion being destroyed and rebuilt over and over.

It would explain the basic flawed premise of the Zion level itself: The machines would need to supply a huge amount of energy to keep the humans alive, rather than use them as a power source as the Zionists believe.  Even the evacuation tubes used to discard of humans that ‘wake up’ seem out of place. Why wouldn’t the machines simply recycle the body of anyone unplugged, instead of handing them over to the Zionists alive?

It explains how Smith was able to enter the body of an actual human in the Zion level. We know that Smith is basically a virus, hijacking whatever body is convenient. Hijacking is a very common practice in the matrix level, and Smith seemed adept enough to jump levels. We know there was an error in his programming that allowed him to multiply. Apparently the same error allowed him to jump out of his designated environment. 

If you’ll remember,  Cypher met with Smith. Cypher kept talking about how great the Matrix was to him. The food, the lifestyle were so enticing, so perfect, he was willing to betray his comrades to permanently relocate there. 

So the story picks up with all of humanity waking up into a desolate world. There isn’t enough food, shelter, really anything to go around. Riots break out everywhere. Ninety nine percent of the populace doesn’t care about so- called freedom, and they all want back in to the matrix. The Zionists are unable to get control of anything, and Neo faces a real crisis of Conscience. He alone re-enters the matrix in order to seek out the Architect and the Oracle, partly to ask their advice, partly to get away from everyone.  He finds the Architect, but is unable to locate the Oracle. Smith arrives on the scene, though with no humans to hijack he is pretty ephemeral. Because he wants a body back, he lets Neo in on the Big Secret: Neo and Morpheus broke the Matrix (with no small amount of help from Smith Himself) and now everyone is being forced to live on Zion level because the damage is too widespread to fix properly.

Neo jumps out to Zion level, where he soon finds the Oracle and learns he can indeed still fly and control things as if he was in the Matrix. What’s more, he is able to grant this power to others. It seems the Machines aren’t as interested in keeping this reality solid. Neo and his troupe learn that the machines are indeed willing to exist on a more limited level , and have plans on killing every human in existence.

Knowing that Neo is at the heart of this newest catastrophe, the Sentries and other assorted dangers try to take Neo out. During the first movie, the Agents tried to shoot Neo in the Matrix level in order to kill him. Despite all the talk given to the rules of the matrix, it still seems a pretty convoluted way to kill someone. This time, He feels lighting going through him, and through sheer force of will he again keeps himself alive. It seems the machines are trying to kill him again, this time forever, but Neo is actually able to mentally stop them from throwing the switch. Reality starts to bend and distort as the machines do more and more to try and stop him. Neo starts to level jump at will, being chased all the while by various enemies. He jumps to yet another white room, a level unto itself. 

It is at this point that Neo is finally able to break out into meatspace for real. He is the first human in centuries to actually wake up. He finds himself in a huge warehouse, still underground but nothing like the lightning towers shown in the first film. The maintenance machinery has no idea what to do with him, and he is able to finally escape. 

He gets to the surface, and feels the real Sun on his face for the first time. Aside from massive domes dotting the land, nature has reclaimed the planet.  Presently, a robot emerges from the dome he has exited. It is humanoid, but looks like it has not been used in a very long time.  

It tells him that he has won. While the machines did not want him to wake up, It is not the intention of robots to destroy the humans, and perhaps now it is time to try to again live together. The robot says they cannot kill their creators, and if the matrix universe won’t work, then so be it. At this point we see the inside of the nearest dome, where pod after pod shows signs to waking up. The humans are being released.  One by one they stumble into the light, using the pod covers as togas (PG13, of course) The robot says goodbye, good luck, then powers down.

Our view rises into the sky, as we see dozens of domes, with people coming out of all of them. We rise higher and higher still, through the clouds and into space, until we come to see a vast orbiting spacecraft. Lights are coming on, engines are beginning to glow, and the craft is slowly sliding out of orbit.

Our view zooms into the craft, through several bulkheads, into a huge interior filled with a singe massive computer.  We zoom into the computer, down to the chips and circuits, until we see the familiar green cascading language of the original matrix. The Architect steps into view, slowly becoming more and more mechanical. He is greeted by another android. It seems that the robots have been building their own matrix in space. This makes sense considering that the only reason the first robots existed was to serve us in Meatspace. 

The Android asks the Architect if everything went according to plan. He says that we emerged earlier than was optimal, earlier than was planned, but that there are adequate food stocks in the domes for us until we get on our feet, and enough processed metals and materials to get humans on the road to civilization in short time. He also mentions that the climate engineering efforts have gotten the planet on a more secure footing for our re-introduction. It seems that far from enslaving us for these many years, the mechanical populace decided to protect us from ourselves until they could get the planet to recover. Now that we are back out in the real world, they are leaving Earth. Robots never needed a planet in the first place, and most robotic minds were simply uploaded into the mecha-matrix. The other Android, the ‘pilot’ says they are stopping at an asteroid for supplies, then heading into orbit around an outer planet, safe from solar fluctuations. From there they’ll keep an eye on humans, in case they are needed to help their creators again.

TL; DR There was another level of the Matrix, and the robots weren’t totally trying to enslave us.

True,sushirolls,,,"Lost my dad to lung cancer a little more than a year ago; here are some of the things we used to try and keep his weight up:

-Full fat Greek yogurt with fruit, nuts and maple syrup (our local grocery store didn't carry the full fat kind, so we asked them to stock it and they did!)
-Add protein powder whenever you can. Get different flavors depending on what the meal is. Ex. Vanilla to put into yogurt, ""plain"" to sneak into sauces, strawberry for shakes. 
-Add a tablespoon of flax seed oil to meals where possible: have to admit I don't remember the reasoning behind this, but it was a tip we got from a nutritionist who specialized in cancer patients
-Ice cream! Helps with the sore throat, although sometimes it's just not appetizing for them. 
-Have him drink fruit juice or coke instead of water. This is the time to embrace empty calories. 

We got a lot of helpful tips from a nutritionist, which was paid for by insurance. Even if insurance won't cover, a good one who specializes in cancer patients is worth it. 

Also, we learned that my dad's tastes would change almost daily. So foods that tastes OK one day might seems disgusting to him the next. There is a book called ""The Cancer Cookbook"" that had some great insights into making meals where the flavors could be switched up based on the person's tastes. I can try to find my copy and mail it to you. Shoot me a note with your address if you're interested. 

Good luck! It will be frustrating at times. Really frustrating when you prepare a meal and he won't eat it. Really, really frustrating when it feels like you care more about his survival than he does. It's hard to understand what our loved ones are going through, but in the end, it's your time and caring that matters. Don't stress out too much about getting everything perfect. Don't worry about every calorie, every scheduled excersize, etc. Sometimes it's worth it to forget everything and play a board game, or have a really honest conversation, or just sit on the couch and do nothing.

True,Dr_Deadmeat,,,"I have created a small bash script which will do the required job. Just remember that this is a 5 minute thing with the first result on google, and there is probably ways to do this which is much better than my proposed solution. Also beware that this is for the terminal. I know of no tools to do this in a gui. Luckily it is rather simple to use, so it shouldn't be too troublesome to use. This requires the program jhead for usage (apt-get install/yum install/pacman -S jhead for debian(ubuntu or mint)/fedora/arch linux)

    #!/bin/bash
    for i in $(ls $1); do
        k=$(jhead $i | grep ""^Date/Time"" | cut -f6 -d' ')

        year=$(echo $k | cut -f1 -d':')
        month=$(echo $k | cut -f2 -d':')
        day=$(echo $k | cut -f3 -d':')

        target=$2/$year/$month/
        mkdir -p $target
        cp $i $target
    done

This script will loop over every file in the folder supplied as the first argument, and copy the file to the folder specified in the second argument. This will also create the folders if needed. To use this script you simply copy the code text into a filed named anything and launch a terminal in the folder you saved the script. To use the script simply invoke it using the file name of the script, the folder where your images lie, and the folder you want to place them. E.g. 

    imageCopy.sh ""/home/deadmeat/randomImages"" ""/home/deadmeat/sortedimages""

The quotes are only mandatory if you have spaces in the folder names.

Now for the explanation of the script:

&gt; for i in $(ls $1); do

This will loop over every file in a directory. Nothing fancy here. **i** will become the file we are working with.

&gt;  k=$(jhead $i | grep ""\^Date/Time"" | cut -f6 -d' ')

This will launch the program jhead which will give us all the exif data of the file. We are only interested in the date/Time fields, so I filter it on Date/Time with a simple regular expression. Then I cut away the Date/Time string so that we are only left with the date.

&gt; year=$(echo $k | cut -f1 -d':')

&gt; month=$(echo $k | cut -f2 -d':')

&gt; day=$(echo $k | cut -f3 -d':')

These are all the same. I just cut away different parts of the date string.

&gt; target=$2/$year/$month/

This will be the target directory where we will copy or files to. $2 is the second argument (""/home/deadmeat/sortedimages"" in my example), $year and $month is the year and month as read from the exif data.

&gt; mkdir -p $target

We now create the directory where we will copy the file. I could made this a conditional, but it doesn't do anything if the directory exists, so I just kept it like that


&gt; cp $i $target

A simple copy operation from the file we are working on, to the target directory.

Unfortunately I am not available after this post, because I am going away to celebrate new years eve now, so I hope that you will understand all of it, or perhaps someone might help you further if you are stuck. I will probably be back in 14-16 hours if you still have troubles.

I hope this is helpful and what you are looking for. You might need to adjust the ""-f6"" parameter in the script if it is not working, because that might be subject to change in different versions of jhead. Just copy the line and replace $1 with a file, and experiment to you only get the date field. Also I am not sure how different locales apply to different month/day ordering, so you might need to switch which is day and month if your files is incorrectly copied.

Good luck with this =)

Quick edit: I forgot to add a check if the file exists. As the script is now, it will overwrite files with the same name. It is not hard to circumvent, but I doesn't have time to fix that, so hopefully someone else might help you with that if you don't know how to do it yourself.

Another edit: I also haven't done anything about duplicates. It is probably not hard to do, but I only googled how to get exif data from images, and not how to detect duplicates",0,1356971632,,0,1356971967,1,c7osq21,t3_15pzhe,t1_c7osq21,t3_15pzhe,,1430816947,5,False,linuxquestions,t5_2rbms,5

**EDIT 2**: There are a few questions on why we can't feel the gravitational attraction of the sun. We are in freefall around the sun, just as an object in orbit is in freefall around the earth (an astronaut on the ISS doesn't feel the still significant pull of the earth).

In order to move in a circle a centripetal force, that acts towards the centre of rotation, must be applied to an object. In the case of our spinning with the rotation of the Earth, a little of the force of gravity is used to supply this centripetal acceleration and keep us rotating. For an object in orbit, the centripetal force is equal to the force due to gravity.

You can feel this effect when you drive quickly over a sharp crest on a hill (circular motion) on an otherwise straight road. The faster you go, the more gravity needs to contribute to keep you in circular motion over the crest of the hill, and the lighter you feel. If you go fast enough, gravity can no longer supply sufficient centripetal force and your vehicle leaves the road: in which case you would feel weightless until you hit the road again!

True,rrrx,,,"As someone who has been posting in /r/beer through various accounts nearly since the subreddit was started, let me say that there's nothing wrong with liking Bud Light, and that you're very unlikely to be downvoted for expressing that opinion over there. Budweiser and a few other macros have an advantage in making light lagers because they use a product called ""tetrahydro isomerized hop extract"", which completely protects against ""skunkiness"". For that I reason I definitely agree that a beer like Budweiser is more refreshing and enjoyable than something like, say, Stella, which is consistently skunky either intentionally or accidentally.

I think that /r/beer gets its reputation for snobbiness in a few ways.

First, people who post there are, obviously, big fans of beer. When someone mentions that they love Bud Light because it's ""light and refreshing"", it's common for someone to suggest other beers which are also light and refreshing, but which also bring a lot of flavor into the mix. This isn't necessarily meant as a judgement that you *shouldn't* be drinking Bud Light; usually it's just meant to help people discover new beers they'll enjoy. When people mention they love light lagers, I'll often recommend that they give Dupont Avril a try; it's a 3.5% ABV saison which is insanely crisp and refreshing on a hot day, but it also has really interesting flavors of lemon-lime, hay, and spice. I can certainly understand how I may come off as a ""snob"" for recommending an imported Belgian farmhouse ale as an alternative to Bud Light, but I've given bottles of the stuff to a dozen or so Bud Light drinkers who tend to love it. Mind, they still drink Bud Light regularly, but I'm just trying to promote diversity in the appreciation of beer.

Second, /r/beer posters generally *hate* macro breweries. This is in part because of their beer, but it's mostly because of their business practices. AB(-Inbev) and Miller-Coors have been actively attacking the craft beer industry ever since they realized that it wasn't just a fad. They do this in a lot of ways, ranging from crowding out craft breweries from store shelves and bar taps (often through illegal incentives like free kegs), to tying them up with frivolous lawsuits (most famously, AB sued Dogfish Head claiming the beer name ""Chicory Stout"" was too generic), to brewing pseudo-craft beers to confuse consumers (see beers like ""Winter's Bourbon Cask Ale"" or ""Wild Blue"" from AB), to acquiring them outright (AB bought Chicago's Goose Island last year). By far the most substantial weapon they have, though, is written into the law; the three-tier system controls how alcohol is produced, distributed, and sold in the United States, and the macro breweries own it. As a result, even completely independent craft breweries often have to go through the big guys to distribute their beer. AB and Miller-Coors spend billions of dollars every year lobbying for favorable legislation, and preventing any improvements to the current system. A lot of this anger at the business practices of places like Budweiser manifests itself as railing against their beer, and occasionally, unfortunately, against people who drink their beer.

Finally, I think /r/beer has a *serious* inferiority complex. America had an incredible beer industry before Prohibition, but post-Prohibition only a few of the bigger breweries survived, and they consolidated. The effect was that for most of the 20th century, America had terrible beer, and the rest of the world was quick to note it. This started changing around 1979, when Fritz Maytag relaunched Anchor, and 1980, when Ken Grossman and Paul Camusi launched Sierra Nevada. In the past thirty years, America has established what I consider the most vibrant, creative, and exciting craft beer industry anywhere in the world, and I'll defend that statement against all challengers. The problem is that our domestic demand is so high that we export almost none of our best beers, and as a result much of Europe still has the impression that we're only making beers like Bud Light. Thus, craft beer drinkers compensate by openly slamming those beers, to show that *they* don't like them *either*, so *shut up, Europe, you jerk!* To a certain extent this is fine; there's nothing wrong with dispelling myths about American beer. But, of course, one shouldn't go crazy with it.

On the whole, to be honest I think /r/beer tends to overcompensate to *avoid* being seen as beer snobs. The parent commenter in this thread must not have spent a lot of time in the subreddit, because I can tell you that we see very popular threads every week or so with people proclaiming their love for ""lawnmower beers"" like Bud Light, insisting that there's a time and a place for every beer.",0,1356974119,,0,1356975247,1,c7otdm5,t3_15pw0h,t1_c7otdm5,t1_c7osev8,,1430817245,206,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,206

True,shifty21,,Sr. Sysadmin,"This should be a wake up call to everyone who thinks modern RAID controllers actually report disk errors when they don't unless certain conditions of eminent failure occur.  Depending on the manufacture and BIOS of the controller, data scrubbing is NOT even a feature or something that can be configured.  Some SAN (at least the ones I have dealt with personally) have some kind of scrubbing available, but how reliable it is is still debatable.  This is totally unacceptable.  

I have been burned many times with multiple disk failures on traditional RAID arrays and SAN's.  Most, I can point my finger at old hard drives, but the fact that I relied on the RAID controller to report/fix bad blocks burned me in the in the end.  I had a LeftHand shit out on multiple disk failure.  Twice.  When calling their support, they had me run diagnostic commands and low and fucking behold, it came back listing bad blocks on multiple hard drives.  When asking why it did not report the errors, the tech advised that there was not **enough** errors to constitute failure.  ORLY?!  A new EMC VNX 5100 did the same thing, accept it's tolerance to bad blocks was more sensitive and spit out alerts.  But it was not soon enough.  

Soon after, I rethought my approach to data **integrity** and started exploring ZFS and better alerting.  Not relying on ZFS's consistency, I installed SMART monitoring and added that to my alerts.  Any read/write error gets emailed out.  Data Scubbing in ZFS is cron'ed for once a week to help ensure integrity.

True,dauthik,,,"You should post a picture or also give weight/measurements. I identify as trans masculine too, but I doubt my body shape is like yours.

Some general things:

1) start lifting! Even before you go on HRT. It will just make your gains on T even more exciting.

2) I've found it doesn't matter what pants I wear, as long as my upper body and face look boyish enough people always address me as a dude. It's not until I speak that I give myself away. I just wear women's skinnies.

3) For the upper body, wear shirts that fit across the chest and shoulders. That usually means they'll be more boxy down the waist and might bulge out a bit over your hips, but I think fit on the chest and shoulders is most important for looking sharp. If you're self conscious about the shirts looking weird across the hips, get a jacket or blazer.

4) it's all about the confidence. Gotta like yourself and the way you look.

**edit:** Ok, based off of your picture, I don't think your hips are even that pronounced. The key would be to wear less baggy, way trimmer jeans and larger but well-fitting upper body clothing. This de-emphasizes your hips and emphasizes your shoulders. And since you posted a pic of yourself, here is a visual guide of what I mean in my points above, which features, well, mostly me. Plus some additional points I thought of.

* Again, most important is the fit of your shirt [across the shoulders and chest](http://i.imgur.com/arYx3.jpg). Yes, they might end up [baggy on the rest of your body](http://i.imgur.com/btZUo.jpg) and arms, but that will de-emphasize your hips. Your pants don't matter much as long as they aren't really baggy at the hips, although baggy jeans work really well for [some people](http://www.dapperq.com/2012/11/seven-days-of-dapper-shereen-jenkins/).

* Try to wear less t-shirts because of the fabric they're made from. They can [fit fine](http://i.imgur.com/IpOum.jpg), but they can also drape in [really lumpy ways](http://i.imgur.com/esv7z.jpg).

* This is why as I said above, [blazers are nice](http://i.imgur.com/k4rrS.jpg). Hides the lumpiness both in the chest and the hips.

* They work well for button-up shirts too, which you should be getting more of since you want to dress more formally anyway. Here is the same shirt [fitting well](http://i.imgur.com/m5h9p.jpg), and [fitting lumpy](http://i.imgur.com/dH3ic.jpg). Here is that shirt with the [same blazer as above](http://i.imgur.com/sa9QZ.jpg). Here is that shirt also [with a sweater vest](http://i.imgur.com/JIyoe.jpg). Even when they don't quite cover the lumpiness (see [this picture](http://i.imgur.com/ZyHt6.jpg) around the stomach) they de-emphasize it a lot and give you a way bigger V-shape. Layer up!

* Finally, in the summer I like wearing [long sleeves button-up shirts that have the sleeves rolled up and shorts](http://i.imgur.com/Ew86H.jpg). Shorts are usually straight through the leg, which gives the impression of straightness through the body. Again, key point being emphasis on enlarging the upper body and less emphasis on the hips/straightening them out.

True,Ish71189,,,"Okay, so lets start with the description given in the original text.

&gt; **a**, Cre-dependent AAV. **b**, Confocal images of midbrain dopamine neurons. Orange dotted lines, location of fibre optic. Bottom, images of VTA neurons directly below fibre track. **c**, Photoinhibition of VTA dopamine neurons acutely reduces escaperelated behaviour. Two-way ANOVA demonstrates the group-by-light epoch interaction (interaction of the experimental-group factor and light-condition factor in the test), F4,38 53.95, P50.00089; Bonferroni post-hoc test shows reduced struggling in
the eNpHR3.0 group relative to the eYFP group, P,0.05. Error bars, s.e.m. **d**, Inhibition of VTA dopamine neurons does not produce a significant
difference in open-field locomotion; two-way ANOVA did not demonstrate a significant groupby-light epoch interaction, F3,48 51.76, P50.17. Error bars, s.e.m. **e**, Schematic and results of the 90- min sucrose-preference test. Photoinhibition of VTA dopamine neurons acutely reduces sucrose preference; two-way ANOVA revealed that opsin expression has a significant effect, F1,42 56.31, P50.016; Bonferroni post-hoc test revealed
significant differences between groups only in the light-on epoch, *P,0.05. Error bars, s.e.m. Off, light off; On, light on; WPRE; woodchuck hepatitis virus post-transcriptional regulatory element

So the first picture in the article is **(b)**, ""Confocal microscopy is an optical imaging technique used to increase optical resolution and contrast of a micrograph by using point illumination and a spatial pinhole to eliminate out-of-focus light in specimens that are thicker than the focal plane."" ([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confocal_microscopy)) These are pictures of neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) which is where dopamine cells for the mesocorticolimbic circuit originate; they play an important role in reward.  The orange line is the fibre optic tract that is used for the optogenetic portion of this experiment.

The second set of pictures are C, D, and E, we'll go over each of them separately.  The graphs under **(c)** show what happened when VTA neurons are inhibited by the optogenetic procedure.  The orange line is the experimental group which under went the procedure and the grey line is the control group.  During the ""on"" phase (marked by the translucent orange background) the VTA neurons were inhibited (hyperpolarized), preventing them from firing.  What they're showing is that there's no difference before or after the inhibition between the experimental and the control groups, however when the VTA neurons are hyperpolarized, the experimental group shows significantly less time struggling, this is interpreted as a type of anhedonia (lack of pleasure).  The bar graph shows the same thing just in a different way.

Graph **(d)**  shows that inhibition of the VTA did not result in a change in ""open-field locomotion"" which is basically just how much and how fast they're running around given an open field.

Graph **(e)** is showing the percentage of the time the mice would choose sugar (sucrose) over water.  What it shows is that when the VTA is inhibited (again, hyperpolarized) the mice will choose randomly (~50%, which since there are only 2 options, means that they are preforming at chance), this difference is significant from the experimental group.

Now here's the text from the original article for the final set of graphs.

&gt;**c**, Phasic illumination of VTA dopamine neurons rescues stress-induced reduction in struggling on TST in ChR2 CMS but not eYFP CMS mice (P,0.001; eYFP CMS526.8 s 63.5 s; ChR2 CMS528.0 s 62.7 s; ChR2 non-CMS555.63 s 64.4 s; eYFP non-CMS556.0 s64.7 s). Two-way ANOVA revealed a significant group-by-light epoch interaction (F6,134 56.04, P,0.0001) and a significant influence of experimental condition on performance as revealed by one-way ANOVA (F3,67 56.20, P50.0009; Bonferroni post-hoc test). Error bars, s.e.m. **d**, Illumination parameters, as usedin the TST, did not change locomotor activity in
the openfield, with no significant group-by-epoch interaction in two-way ANOVA (F9,152 50.99, P50.4493), and no detectable differences revealed by Bonferroni post-hoc tests on the same timescale. Error bars, s.e.m. **e**, Phasic activation of VTA dopamine neurons rescued the stress-induced decrease in sucrose preference in ChR2 CMS, but not eYFP CMS mice; one-way ANOVA, Dunn’s post-hoc test comparing baseline to light-on epoch, P,0.01 for ChR2 CMS mice, P50.2851 for eYFP CMS mice. Two-way ANOVA revealed a significant group-by-light epoch interaction (F6,62 54.33, P50.001), and a significant influence of experimental condition on performance was revealed by one-way ANOVA (F3,31 53.40, P50.0299); **P,0.01 for ChR2 CMS mice. Error bars, s.e.m.

Okay, so again going to break this down by section.  The first group of graphs were simply testing to see if inhibition of the VTA could induce a depressive phenotype (ie, depressive behaviors).  This group of graphs is actually testing if increased dopamine activity (so this time, optogenetics are increasing activity rather than decreasing it) will help alleviate depressive symptoms.  This experimental has 4 groups, which are as follows: (1) experimental (optogenetic) mice placed in a stressful environment for 8-12 weeks, (2) non-optogenetic mice placed in a stressful environment, (3) optogenetic mice placed in a non-stressful environment, and (4) non-optogenetic mice placed in a non-stressful environment.

Graph **(c)** is showing us that the experimental high-stress optogenetic mice continue struggling during activation, where as the non-optogenetic high-stress mice 'give up' or stop struggling (this is a significant interaction).  It also shows that both low-stress groups continue struggling.

Graph **(d)** again shows that the optogenetics have no effect on open-field locomotion.

Graph **(e)** shows the sucrose vs. water test again, showing that depressed mice (high-stress, non-optogenetic) show no preference to either suger or water, whereas the high-stress, optogenetic mice initially have the same indifference as the depressed mice, the optogenetic induced activation of the VTA brought them up to the non-stress group mice.

I hope this helped!

It was written to be an example of how hacking works, not a technical manual. Third, I know that hacking doesn't explicitly, or even implicitly, mean breaking into a system. A hacker is more like someone who isn't satisfied until he learns exactly how a certain technology or system works and is constantly trying to learn more.  Finally thanks for the Karma and I hope reddit enjoys my explanation.

Edit: Where I learned the little I know
- [Exam cram] (http://www.amazon.com/CompTIA-220-801-220-802-Authorized-Edition/dp/0789749718/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1357085121&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=comp+tia+exam+cram)
- http://www.enigmagroup.org/ 

That is a very complicated question but, I'll see if I can hit some of the basics for you.

First you need to know what hacking is

- Hacking is using or accessing a technology in a way that is contrary to the intentions of, or permissions given by, the owner, operator, or creator of said technology.

So in layman's terms, Hacking is using flaws in technology to gain access to, or change, information on a computer system.What are these ""flaws""? Well, that is when it starts to get complicated. Just know that these flaws can usually be narrowed down to three categories: human, hardware, and software.  I'll try to give a decent example of each.

Human: One of the easiest things to protect yourself from, and one of the most common techniques, is tricking people into giving you access to their systems. This can easily be done on people who have a limited understanding of computer security or people who don't practice proper security measures. This kind of hacking is commonly referred to as ""social engineering"". It is also the kind most often used by famous computer hacker and security expert Kevin Mitnick. If you want to know more about the life of a hacker then google him and read his books.

 Now an example, Let's say I work for company XYZ and my manager  is Mr Man. Well, Mr Man is a douche and I am planning on quitting soon but, before I leave I want to get some revenge on him by hacking his account. So here is what I do. I wait till Mr Man leaves for lunch then sneak into his office and get on his computer. I could access his account from my computer but the tech department would be able to see where I logged in from and realize that it wasn't logged in from his office computer. They would soon know something is wrong, and I don't want to get caught. So, there I am at his computer when suddenly my luck runs out, Mr Man had logged out and I don't know his password to get back in! That's when I remember, the new IT guy started today and they always make the new guys deal with simple or common problems at first. Since this is a new guy I am confident that he won't know best security practices and, I'm certain I can trick him into getting me logged in. So I call the company tech department and say that I forgot my password and can't login. I'm in luck, they hand the phone to some guy and he sounds very nervous. This has to be him, I'm sure of it. So, I tell him that I'm Mr Man and that I seem to have forgotten my password. He is about to ask me what I assume would be a security question when I yell ""Shit, It's almost 3:00. Listen man, I have a very important client that will be here in a matter of minutes and I NEED to get back on my computer. I don't have time for the normal speel. Just get me a new password and let me get back to work or I swear you will lose your job faster than I can say 'you're fired', you understand me?"" Now a normal worker wouldn't fall for this but this guy was new and got scared. He fell for my act completely. Now with the new password in hand, I login to his account and get to work. Let's see... deleting all his documents? Sounds like fun! Download gay porn? Why not! After, a few minutes of this I leave and get back to my station. Now, because they don't have cameras inside they have no way to pin it on me and I quit work the next day and get away free. Mission accomplished!

Hacking lesson - 1) Normal people are ignorant of computer security, take advantage of them.

Hardware:

I want access to somebody's documents on their computer. If I had another computer I could use, I would simply remove the hard drive from this computer and connect it as a secondary drive on mine. I don't though, so instead I have to use my trusty flashdrive with a boot-able version of linux installed on it. However in order to use that I have to change the boot order, which is determined by the bios. I restart their computer and enter the bios setup... or try to anyways. It turns out that they have a password on their bios.Now what? Because of my knowledge of computer hardware, I know that the bios password is saved on the motherboard in the cmos, which has volatile memory. This means that if the cmos loses power, everything resets back to its default state and all passwords and other information (like time, date and boot order) are lost. So I simply open up the computer, find the lithium battery that powers the cmos and remove it. After waiting a minute to insure all the data is lost I put the battery back in and close up the computer. Turning on the computer, I try to enter the bios again. Success! It is no longer password protected. I then go into the section where you determine the boot order and change it so that the usb ports boot before the hardrive. Now I restart the computer again and wait. It worked! The linux login screen is now showing. I login to my account on the flashdrive and get to work. From the linux operating system I can access the info on the other hard drive. So, I grab all the files I want and copy them to my flash drive. I then log out, restart the computer and change the boot order back to normal. If somebody enters the bios they will know something happened when it doesn't ask for a password but, let's be honest. How often do normal people enter the bios on their computers?  Mission accomplished!

Hacking lesson - 2) Software security is useless without hardware security. Lock that shit up!

Software:

Software is much more complicated to explain. If you want know more about this start googling ""sql injection"", ""Javascript Injection"", ""DDOS"", ""bruteforce hacking"", ""URL Manipulation"" and any other term you come across while doing so. Just realize, these concepts maybe be hard to understand if you don't have a basic understanding of programming or how the internet works. I'll try to give a brief example though.

I was playing an MMO the other day and was just about to finish defeating a boss character when some asshole came by and stole my kill. Now, were it a normal monster I would just shrug it off and move on but, I had been trying to defeat this monster forever and was just about to win. I was pissed! So before the guy leaves, I pretend to thank him because ""I was about to die"". I then friend him so I can keep track of when he is online and remember his username. Later that day I get back on the game and check to see if he is on. He's not! I logout of my character and type his username in to the login screen. Using some online bruteforce hacking tools and a little coding of my own I put together a program that continuously tries to login to his account changing the password every time it fails. This program will cycle through all the upper case and lower case letters and all numbers, hitting every combination possible until it succeeds. With people who have long passwords or passwords with special characters this could take a long time, maybe even years. However most people don't use complicated passwords, especially on online games. If this website followed good security practices they would limit the amount of login attempts possible from a certain IP address in a certain period of time or lock an account with to many incorrect login attempts. Unfortunately the creators of this game did no such thing. I head to the kitchen to fix myself some french bread pizza and wait. In a little over an hour I hear a beeping noise, the sound I programmed it to make when it succeeded. I head back to my computer and there it is. I'm logged in to his account! First things first, I open up another tab in my browser and log in to my account on the game. I then trade all of his best items over to my character, along with all his gold and anything else that looks useful. I could have deleted his character but I decided that him seeing the character without all of the items and money he had collected would be much more entertaining. Finishing up, I log out and continue on about my day with a smile on my face. Mission accomplished!

We were on overnights so we were mostly unsupervised and got up to a number of shenanigans that clearly annoyed him (but our employer didn't care because our shift always did every bit of work and had its shit together and they didn't have to SEE us chair jousting in the halls). 

His breaking point was one night when a buddy and I were talking loudly about some book we were both reading and we notice that dude is sitting at his desk doing that angry nerd breathing. That HUNNNNH HUNNNNH HUNNNNNH heavy breathing that angry nerds think is intimidating but really just sounds like wheezing. We ask him what's up and he whirls around and starts yelling at us.

AHHHHHHHHHHHhhhhhhhahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh (muffled by the elevator)...

Then we go to the window and see him running across the parking lot and, faintly but distinctly, we can still hear him screaming through the thick glass of the window until he gets into his car, lays out a long streak of rubber driving away, and tears off down the road.

True,monkeedude1212,,,"&gt;The Bible and other religious/philosophical texts have stories designed to teach morals. I think it's a good thing to communicate these moral-based stories, not necessarily in a biblical context, but for developing young minds.

No, they're designed to teach what *would be* moral behavior on the premise of fear. Teaching someone that stealing is wrong because God will punish you is not teaching moral behavior; but is actually misguiding the youth because its only teaching half the lesson. The reason why stealing is morally wrong is because it causes a breakdown of society; essentially no one can trust one another, and you can't even rely on your own possessions remaining your own in case they are stolen from you. So in order to reduce the harm on both yourself and others, you must all agree that stealing is wrong, detrimental to the group as a whole, and not just on the individual level. 

Because Religion tends to skip that last part; you run into the problem of people betraying the religious code for a variety of reasons: I've already committed a sin, if I'm going to hell, why not sin more? If God can grant me forgiveness in the end, why not sin until I truly feel the need to repent? Or if I no longer believe in God, why not commit these sins?

Thats the basis of the argument; If you don't understand why certain actions are immoral, and are using some externalized punishment to the crime and not the impact and direct consequences of your actions, then you aren't really making a moral decision. You're making a very individualized assessment instead.

True,[deleted],,,"A used Nikon D5000 series off ebay would probably be your best bet. You COULD use a P&amp;S and adapt it, but that's not going to get super results. You want a high-ISO sensor to get the small amount of light you have to work with. Can't beat an SLR.

I'm not sure about the particulars of your scope. They may make a specialized T-adapter that'll fit into the camera hole and mount to the Nikon. Personally I use a cheap-o Meade telescope T-adapter and tape it to my microscope.
