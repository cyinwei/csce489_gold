"LadySmuag","","","Some of the most useful advice my mother ever gave me, was when I was in 7th grade and I had a history teacher that irrationally hated me because she had *taught my brother*. My brother had bad handwriting, so she would refuse to grade my assignments and give me an F. *I* did not have bad handwriting. Bullshit like that.

I dealt with it on my own for the first two months, until I failed the first test of the year because I *hadn't written the date on the paper* in her preferred format, even though the answers were all correct (or, mostly correct. I don't know, she didn't look at it).

Instead of going to the school board and dealing with it, my mother told me, ""Some people in the world are just assholes. And there's nothing you can do about it. But you can still learn from them. Every day you enter her classroom and don't give in to the temptation to become exactly who she thinks you are, you are the better person. And some day you're going to grow up and have to work with people you don't like, and this is good practice for that.""

So I did my best on every single assignment and I was polite to the woman even though I wanted to punch her in the face most days.

"PainMatrix","","","Harry had started hitting the Butterbeer a little harder. First it was just weekends but it soon turned to every day, and from Butterbeer to Firewhiskey, an attempt to quiet the dark shadows of his past. He became more sullen and moody and would sometimes lash out violently during these episodes. One day he went too far and when he emerged from his blacked out state he finds Ginny bruised and battered laying in a heap at the bottom of the stairs. The consequences are swift and brutal. The Ministry of Magic revokes his ability to practice magic and in the court proceedings and subsequent divorce Ginny robs Harry of the vast fortune his parents had bequeathed to him. Harry in a bid to start anew, moves into the city, sharing a dingy room in tenement housing with several refugee families. He is offered a job as part of a work release program at a fast food restaurant where he slowly counts down the days until he can muster the courage to use the Avada Kedavra on himself. One rainy afternoon a familiar face walks into the restaurant... his old friend from a lifetime ago, Fawkes. Maybe things aren't so bleak, perhaps there is hope, a chance at resurrection.

"BBlasdel","","","This is a serious scholarly concept called the criterion of embarrassment. There are a bunch of parts of the New Testament that really don't fit the simplistic version of the Christian narrative, and these are, if anything, parts that we can trust the most. Why would anyone make them up later? In a lot of first and second hand accounts in ancient texts, and particularly the bible, you will often find things that just make too little sense to be fiction - like Jesus yelling at a tree and also the random naked guy running through the Gospel of Mark. Where, during Mark's very condensed run through of the final arrest of Jesus in the garden of Gethsemane, Judas gets with the Jesus kissing, the fuzz shows up, Jesus cops to causing trouble, and then everyone books it, but then something really interesting happens. Some random dude, its not even clear if he was a follower of Jesus, loses his clothes as he tries to flee butt naked. The naked guy adds absolutely nothing to the story, isn't the least bit relevant to the narrative, and if anything detracts from the message Mark is trying to convey; but fuck would that be memorable to an eyewitness. In a time when to be naked was to be dishonored, and to be dishonored was to be less than human in a way that is only really understandable in the abstract in our post-Christian world, that was a pretty big fucking deal. While this would never occur to a fiction writer to put it, an eyewitness talking to the author of Mark would have good reason to consider the tale incomplete without it.

It would be unimaginably awesome if we had contemporary accounts by perfectly disinterested observers to learn about the life of Jesus from, or better yet multiple independent ones, but the contents of the bible really are pretty much the best we've got for figuring out what actually happened. It was formulated by committee in the fifth century, but that committee did a pretty decent job with what they had. Unfortunately, after Josephus' less scketchy of his two brief mentions of Jesus in 90 CE, the earliest undisputed account that we have like this is from Pliny the Younger who, as a governor, writes to the Emperor in 112 CE that there are ""Christians"" about who are meeting illegally and who ""worship Christ as a God,"" all he wants is advice as to how to handle the situation. The next earliest is by Pliny's friend Tacitus in 115 CE in his history of Rome where he mentions that the great fire, supposedly set by Nero, in 64 CE was blamed on ""the Christians."" He seems largely uninterested in the scapegoats, but does mention that they got their name from Christus and that the ""superstition"" spread from Judea to Rome after Pontius Pilate executed Christus under the reign of Tiberius. This is still seventy nine years later. The earlier stuff that we have is indeed pretty terrible by the kinds of standards used to asses modern history, though is importantly a pretty standard level of terrible for the age. The accounts we have are written by true believers, who were not themselves eyewitnesses, who mostly spoke a different language and lived in a different country than the eyewitnesses, they are not free from collaboration (With Mark being used as a source for Matthew and Luke), and they are pretty wildly inconsistent in both details and global understandings. However, there is still a lot we can do to get decent information out of what we've got. Thankfully there is a common thread among an extended community of puzzle solving oriented atheists and theists who FEEL VERY STRONGLY ABOUT RELIGION in a certain way and who have obsessed about these kinds of questions for centuries. Since well before the enlightenment, people have been putting A LOT OF THOUGHT into squeezing just about everything that we possibly can out of the extant records we have. They've found that when assessing the veracity of historical materiel, it is important to keep in mind a few more principles, not all of which are very intuitive,

* First, and intuitively, the earlier the sources that the materiel is found in the better. Twenty years is indeed an awfully long time to be playing a game of telephone, or even for a single person to keep a consistent view. We do have pretty reasonable ways to date even the earliest texts, for example each of the gospels refer to the destruction of Jerusalem (even if it is sometimes as an awfully specific prediction) and so we can reasonably assume that they were each written after that.

* Second, is the criterion of multiple attestation, or the more sources we have that cite or repeat the materiel the better. Materiel found in multiple sources that are independent and contemporary to each other is more likely to be historically accurate. It is pretty intuitive that it would be difficult for someone to make something up and get someone else, somewhere else, to make up a similar thing at the same time. Thus a dozen folks saying something in 75 CE isn't that much worse than someone saying the same thing in 50 CE. For example, both Matthew and Luke talk about how Jesus is from Nazareth but say very different and unique things about how he got there from Bethlehem. Mark also says that Jesus was from Nazareth and so does John, which was written totally independent of the other three Synoptic gospels. Thus, we can pretty solidly trust that Jesus was from Nazareth. However, as we can assume that since both Matthew and Luke were aware of the prophesies that declared that the messiah would be born in Bethlehem, their unique stories of the nativity are probably a result of their common need to explain how Jesus was both born in Bethlehem and from Nazareth. (The traditional Christmas story that most of us get as children is a pretty forced mash-up of the two).  With this in mind, we can also trust that Jesus did indeed come from Nazareth all the more using the criterion of embarrassment. Nazareth was a two horse town in the middle of nowhere that was famous for precisely nothing and recognizable to practically no one, and particularly when the messiah is supposed to come from the birthplace of David, why make that up? Even so, how could you possibly get everyone to agree on it if you did? 

* Third, is my favorite criterion, just making sense. Jesus was an itinerant rabbi in the first century Levant, and any traditions that don't make sense in that context are a lot less reliable. A lot of the later non-canonical Gospels suffer from stuff that is just stupid, but even some of the canonical gospels have some subtle things that don't make sense when you think about them. For example, in John's account of Jesus' famous late night conversation with Nicodemous, Jesus tells him that he must be born again/above. It is a play on words, and kind of a neat one. The words used are gennao (Strong's 1080), which means begotten or born in a formal father oriented sense, and it is modified by anothen (Strong's 509), which can mean either again or from above. The author of John uses anothen for both meanings in different parts of the Gospel and so the effect is obviously intentional, but importantly, neither the Arahmaic nor Hebrew languages that Jesus could have been speaking have an analogous word with both meanings. Whoops.

A little while later, she decided that I was in the wrong and decided to retaliate. Being a perfectly rational human being, she burned my house down. 

Now to explain where this ties in: I kinda knew she was unstable, but was blinded by the sheer amount of sex that was offered.

One of the earliest known instances of this types of joke appears in the early renaissance era (very fitting, given your post content!) This type of art is known as ""accanto a scherzare"", which roughly translates to ""juxtaposed art joke"". The tradition is believed to have started somewhere in Northern Italy when famous traveling french artist Claude Monsoisse painted the first example of this type of joke. In this painting, he painted a local lord standing in front of his castle, and he included two pigs copulating at the edge of the picture. The picture actually hung in the castle for years before someone noticed the obscenity. He continued this comical brand of art until his 48th birthday, when he was finally caught mid-act while painting a portrait. Claude got a little too daring when he included several phallic symbols while painting a retired knight (it was noticed by the knight's squire). The knight challenged Claude to honorable combat. The duel was finished within minutes, and Claude died of internal bleeding several hours later.

Now cats whiskers can pick up electrostatic forces in the air, so when the cat gets close to the banana it can 'feel' the Ethylene gas. Though this doesn't feel nice to the cat (kind of like a small electric shock) it's completely harmless.

"gAlienLifeform","","","&gt;As an example (this rumor has turned up in so many cities, it would be impossible to list them all), in 1995 the closing of two Chinese restaurants in Columbus, Ohio, awakened the sleeping rumor yet again. Calls were fielded, both by the local paper and the board of health, about whispers that these closings were the result of dead cats' being discovered in each eatery's meat locker. Never mind that just the previous day the local paper had run a story about the closure (for business reasons) of all 51 restaurants in this particular chain — the cat meat rumor would not be denied. 

&gt;In 1996, county health department officials in Knoxville, Tennessee, stepped forward to issue a strong denial about frozen cats' being found at a particular local Chinese restaurant. It seemed everyone had heard the rumor, yet no such complaint was on file. Indeed, this particular restaurant had always met Health Department regulations, a claim supported by inspection records. 

&gt;In 1991, after a Burlington, Ontario [Canada] Chinese eatery lost 30% of its trade to this rumor, its owners attempted to combat the talk by inviting the local professional football team, the Hamilton Ti-Cats, to eat there on the house. Due to the loss of business, restaurant staff had seen their work week cut by 10 hours. The trouble had started two months earlier, with its first sign being a phone call from a woman asking if the restaurant was closed. A friend had told her health officials had padlocked the 434-seat restaurant because it ""had been serving cat."" That call was the first of many to the restaurant, the health department, and the media. Callers often said others told them the rumor was on radio or in the papers, but no such reports had been broadcast or published. Again, this restaurant had a good reputation with the health department, but that didn't stop the progress of the rumor and the damage it did to the livelihoods of the small business owners and their 
employees. 

&gt;This legend is a classic example of xenophobia (fear and hatred of foreigners or that which is foreign). Asian culture is markedly different from Western culture, with language but the first barrier to be hurdled. Customs, religious observances, traditions — all are wildly different from their North American counterparts. As with all xenophobic reactions, that which isn't the same is vilified. The Asian culinary practice of making a tiny bit of meat stretch to feed a family by cutting it up fine and making it part of a larger dish of vegetables or noodles is transformed by fear into a vehicle for ""them"" to slip something objectionable into our unwitting stomachs. Likewise, that the Chinese don't as a rule keep cats and dogs as pets becomes seen as a willingness to plop someone else's animal companion into the stew pot. Anything for a buck, says this legend, and if in the process one puts over on the white devils, so much the better.

- The first time she says ""I'm ready"" is just a knee jerk reaction to finally getting her shoes on, she really then has to figure out her jewelry then make a smoothie for the road (even if we're only going to be gone for 20 minutes)...this usually takes 15-20 minutes.

- Second ""I'm ready"" is actually the mirror check. That's when the final primping begins. You know, making sure the hair is right and the ""do I look okay in this top?"" questions begin. This takes about 15 minutes barring any unforeseen wardrobe changes.

- Third ""I'm ready"" is the worst because she actually walks towards the door like it's time to go. Don't be fooled because the great purse swap has actually begun. This is the process of transferring all the crap she might need from one handbag to the next...""do you think I'll need my sunscreen for the movies? I better bring it just in case."" This is the longest 5 minutes of your life because you're standing there with your hand on the door handle ready to roll.

- Fourth ""I'm ready"" usually it means it's time to go...unless she's suddenly remembered she wanted to wear the red shoes instead of the white...then go back to step 2 and repeat the process...ugh.

"KicksButtson","","","My theory has always been that when Kyle Reese fucked Sarah Conner he screwed up the whole timeline and set into motion what is essentially a self fulfilling prophecy of sorts, and kills his boss who is the original John Conner.

To remove the inevitable paradox associated with sending your dad back in time to fuck your mom, let's assume the original John Conner was fathered by a completely different man. John grows up normal and then SkyNet takes over. He learns how to defeat the Machines the hard way. He becomes a general in the human resistance and wins the war. Everything that happens is thanks to luck, hard work, and his own ingenuity.

But the Machines sent back assassins as their last resort before being defeated. John sends back protectors to defend his mother, himself, and his comrades from these assassins. The one who went back in time the furthest to stop the T-800 assassin is Kyle Reese because they assume their best human soldier could easily stop a single obsolete T-800 terminator, even with old school weaponry. Likewise, that's probably why SkyNet sent the T-800 back the furthest, because it assumed that sending the most obsolete model back the furthest would maximize the terminator's effectiveness.

But what John Conner didn't expect is that Kyle couldn't keep his dick in his pants. You can't really blame him because Sarah Conner looks smok'n hot in her 80s perm, and he only got a crash course in time travel technology before leaving. (Technically they could have put him through time travel college for seven years and then sent him back in time with a damned doctorate in time travel technology. When you have time travel technology there's no real hurry to get anywhere.) 

So Kyle Reese either doesn't realize his mistake when he fucks Sarah Conner, or he does realize what he's doing yet thinks that the so-called paradox was meant to be, that this was meant to happen. But by the time he knocks up Sarah Conner she already knows everything that is supposed to come true involving the son she will inevitably have and the war with SkyNet after the nuclear holocaust of Judgement Day.

By pure chance the child that Kyle and Sarah conceive is a boy, and this leads Sarah down a long sequence of events where she fulfills the prophecy Kyle taught her even though the child she has in her womb isn't really John Conner. She names the boy John Conner and teaches him what he is to become, and since Judgement Day and the rise of the Machines is inevitable then the information he is given will inevitably become valuable as well.

The first John Conner was a brilliant and lucky tactician who learned how to defeat SkyNet the hard way. The new John Conner (which I refer to as the ""proxy"") is a shadow of the original man who only succeeds due to the information he was given as a child and the fact that he is following in the footsteps of a greater man who already paved the road for him.

It's as though a time traveler went back in time and fucked your mom and told her she'd one day give birth to a redditor named [insert name here], she would be likely to name the kid after you and raise the child to be a redditor without even realizing that you're not the same kid because originally your dad wasn't a time traveler and you found Reddit appealing by innocent curiousity, not because you were told to. Yet that proxy of you would end up with the same name and be a Redditor and end up reading this same post one day assuming it was meant to be, yet it wouldn't really be you.

**EDIT:** I do not believe this theory in any way represents the actual model of the terminator universe as intended by the creators of the franchise, however I do think it's a good way to view the film and the concept of time travel as an audience member. It kind of helps explain why the characters now seem to be in this never ending cycle of events where nothing really ever is accomplished and the war never ends.

This shit came up a long time ago, and I'll say now what I said then. 

A college degree won't substitute real work experience in *most* fields. The majority of people on this bandwagon are people who graduated college and demand that $60k a year job right out of the gate. Degree holders who didn't even bother working an entry level position in their field or an internship aren't vetted enough for a company to risk hiring them. Especially when there are at least a few people who had internships on the interview schedule.

Almost every single person I know who visibly cared about having a job halfway into their degree got an internship and were employed within 6 months of graduating. You know who didn't? The people with internships who did a fuck all job and the people ending their 4th year without any proof they could actually handle even the menial parts of the field they wanted to work in. Yeah, debt sucks but that's a personal problem. Businesses don't care how much you're in debt, they want to know how much risk you carry.

I have 3 resumes on my desk. 

One has experience and a degree. One has just experience with no degree. One has a degree with no experience. The last person I would pick is the degree holder with no experience. I have 3 with both experience and a degree, 4 with over four years experience, and 5 with degrees. Assuming all the references check out, the 5 with degrees are last on my pick list because I'm not on crazy pills. It's common sense and the reason you can look at a job opening and see ""A four year degree can be substituted for X years of work experience"".

If you're honestly looking for a job, have a degree, but having trouble finding experience go find a job recruiter. If you live in a dry area and there are no jobs, MOVE. Tell them you're willing to relocate and/or work an entry level position to get experience in order to pad your resume. You're an ideal candidate for them. Stay away from recruiters that don't interview you before actually putting your name out there. If you're not willing to work a low level job then you're not one of those guys in the meme above.

I mean even people saying they *just* hate the arrogance aren't even consistent when you realize how many actors,singers,sport stars,etc. are arrogant and don't get a pile of hate every time their name is mentioned. Fuck, some people like Robert Downey Jr. are loved on here for being cocky. 

Plus the fact that It kinda comes with the territory of being a rapper.

And of course when it comes to music. Tastes are completely subjective. So is that any reason to state your opinion as fact? Or much less hate on someone because you don't like the music they make?

Add to all this the fact that Kanye went up as a *joke* and Beck said. “I still love him and think he’s genius. I aspire to do what he does.” afterwards. 

**************************************

Also this:

""I say this to a lot to people.
Kanye isn't in-and-out of rehab or jail. He doesn't carry a gun or associate with gang members. His songs don't promote crime or violence. He's not flashing his balls as he climbs in and out of his sports car for free press... he's not even a man whore. He's had like 2 girlfriends in 12 years, one of which became his wife and the other, he loved so much, that when she left him he wrote an entire album dealing with his broken heart. 

The lyric ""I want to fuck you hard over the sink"" might not be the most romantic sounding thing anyone has ever heard, but it's pretty sweet when you consider, in context, he's singing about how he wants to make love to his wife, whom he's very open about loving, as opposed to all of the other rappers who talk about they want to fuck everyone elses wive because all women are whores who don't deserve respect. Writing a song about how much you love your wife isn't something that should get you persecuted in the media. 

He writes about working hard and following your dreams. He sings about love for his family, falling in love, and starting a family of his own. 

He doesn't sport colors or sag his pants so his underwear shows... he wears high fashion, and tries to look good. He's confident in his ability as a musician and artist and he's open to the world about his innermost thoughts. You can't ever say Kanye isn't 'real'. 

...and yet, the world hates him. Rothesburger raped a woman in the bathroom and people everywhere root for him to win the Superbowl. Kanye says ""be yourself, follow your dreams"", and people hate on him.""

*A dark-haired man is seated in a nondescript office with a neutral background. This is MICHAEL SCOTT, the regional manager for DUNDER MIFFLIN.*

**MICHAEL:** There's been a bit of a scandal at the office today. Uh, I can't... the details aren't really important, but it seems like *somebody* - and I'm not naming any names - doesn't have their priorities in order.

**CUT TO**

*All of DUNDER MIFFLIN's employees are gathered in a small conference room. MICHAEL is addressing them, while making liberal use of a PowerPoint presentation.*

**MICHAEL:** Alright, everybody... so, as you know, we have a new employee, Agnes, and although she's new to the *company*, she's something of an old salt on the high seas of paper piracy! Yarr!

*MICHAEL pantomimes swinging a sword at an old woman. This is ENID, whom MICHAEL has been referring to by the wrong name.*

**ENID:** It's Enid.

**MICHAEL:** That's what I said.

**JIM:** That isn't what you said.

**MICHAEL:** Well, Jim, I think I know what I said, so if you didn't hear what I said, then it's your fault for thinking I said something that I didn't said.

**JIM:** Say.

**MICHAEL:** I'm also pleased to announce that certain members of our office who... who didn't really *contribute* anything - beyond a sense of despair and frustration - will no longer be bothering us.

**DWIGHT:** You're firing Jim?

**MICHAEL:** I'm... no, Dwight, I'm not firing Jim.

**DWIGHT:** Why not? He fits the profile you just described.

**MICHAEL:** I'm not firing Jim! I shot Toby!

*The crowd lets out a collective gasp.*

**CREED:** I would have stabbed him. It's quieter. Less mess.

**DWIGHT:** Michael, as a volunteer sheriff's deputy, I'm afraid it is my unpleasant duty to inform you that you are under arrest.

**STANLEY:** That's murder, son.

**MICHAEL:** Look, everyone just calm down. It's not murder, okay? It was self-defense.

**DWIGHT:** In that case, I commend you for standing your ground.

**JIM:** So, when you say you shot Toby, you mean, like... with a gun?

**MICHAEL:** Ah, yes. Yes, Jim. I shot Toby with a gun. In self-defense.

*JIM gives the camera a skeptical look. MICHAEL activates the PowerPoint presentation, which shows clipart of OSAMA BIN LADEN and ADOLF HITLER alongside a picture of TOBY which has had devil horns drawn on it.*

**MICHAEL:** Following a series of unfortunate events, I found myself locked in a room with none other than Adolf Hitler, Obama bin Laden, and...

**JIM:** (*Interrupting.*) Sorry, ""Obama bin Laden?""

**MICHAEL:** That's what I said.

**JIM:** I know. It's ""Osama,"" not ""Obama.""

**STANLEY:** (*Mutters something incomprehensible under his breath.*)

**ENID:** Enid.

**JIM:** (*With deadpan sarcasm.*) That's what he said.

**MICHAEL:** Thank you, Jim. Now, after finding myself trapped with these three... horrible people... I discovered that I had been given a gun containing only two bullets.

**DWIGHT:** What kind of gun was it?

**MICHAEL:** It was a... a Desert Eagle.

**CREED:** Nah, too noisy. What you want is a Ruger .22. I can get you one for dirt cheap.

**MICHAEL:** So, with only two bullets in my gun...

*The PowerPoint slide changes to show a figure with exaggerated muscles (atop which MICHAEL's head has been placed) firing two shots into the picture of TOBY while BIN LADEN and HITLER look on.*

**MICHAEL:** ... I valiantly defeated our longtime adversary and aggressor! I fired on him before he could do the same to me, thus ending his reign of tyranny!

**CUT TO**

*JIM is seated in the nondescript office. He speaks to the camera.*

**JIM:** So, Michael has been taking cough medicine before going to sleep. Clearly it's been giving him some interesting dreams.

**CUT TO**

*Back in the conference room, MICHAEL attempts to continue his presentation.*

**MICHAEL:** So, no more Toby. I think we can all agree, this is a great step forward for Dunder Mifflin Scranton.

**ENID:** Excuse me...

**MICHAEL:** Yes, Gertrude.

**ENID:** (*Ignoring the mistake.*) You had a gun with two bullets... and instead of shooting bin Laden or Hitler... you shot this man, Toby?

**MICHAEL:** Toby was much worse than those two.

**ENID:** How, exactly? I lost two grandchildren when the towers fell, and my father was a survivor of the Warsaw ghetto.

**MICHAEL:** Toby was worse.

**ENID:** How?

**MICHAEL:** He was worse.

**JIM:** No, he wasn't. Isn't.

**MICHAEL:** Look, guys, Toby was no fun, okay? He... gah, he just... *everything* he did was just so *evil.*

**ENID:** Did he kill millions of people?

**MICHAEL:** Yes. I don't know. Probably! He definitely would have if he'd been given the chance!

*Suddenly, the conference room door opens, and TOBY walks in.*

**TOBY:** Hey, guys... what's everybody doing here?

**CREED:** Shit!

*CREED runs from the room.*

**TOBY:** I thought today was a company holiday.

**JIM:** Company holiday?

**MICHAEL:** (*Shaking his head frantically and making hushing motions with his hands.*) Mm-mm. Nope. No.

**TOBY:** Yeah... Michael was supposed to tell you guys. I only came in to... 

*TOBY notices the PowerPoint. Seeing this, MICHAEL beings frantically flipping through it, giving us glimpses of scenes in which he mangles TOBY's corpse, then rescues a princess and rides off into the sunset on a unicorn.*

**MICHAEL:** Okay, great job, team! Everyone back to work!

**CUT TO:**

*The same nondescript office. ENID speaks to the camera.*

The deeper underlying point is that when people engage in voluntary exchanges, the transaction is *positive sum*. 

Note that most people—including a huge number, if not the majority of people on Reddit—don't actually know this. They believe that trade is a zero sum game: i.e., in order for one to gain, another must lose. That is why many people believe that getting rich is *ipso facto* objectionable because it means taking more of the pie or the total amount of money for yourself. Gaining wealth is to the detriment of others, because less is left over for everyone else. 

On the contrary, the point of recognizing exchanges as being value creating (positive sum) is that when people voluntarily trade, you actually *grow* the size of the pie, because you are producing value on both sides.

There are a ton of other political philosophical implications here, too. I won't go into them in depth, but this motivated a lot of the philosophical underpinnings of the world we have today. The original defences of classical liberalism were all based on this proto-utilitarian observation: that free exchange, free trade and voluntarism (as opposed to coerced or forced exchanges, as governments impose) actually maximize people's preferences, value, and thus wealth and well-being. *All from this little observation...*

Circa 2010, Wikipedia had invited Orange, Watermelon, and Banana. But Wikipedia was hesitant to include Cranberry and Blueberry.

Based on a bullshit botanical technical definition of ""berry"" that even most botanists don't observe, you can kick Banana and Watermelon out, but Blueberry has to go as well (so-called ""true"" berries have superior ovaries, but the fruits of Banana, Watermelon, and Blueberry come from inferior ovaries).

For any reasonable definition of berry (which I'm sorry to say, must include Tomato, but also must exclude Strawberry and Raspberry), Blueberries belong. This reasonable definition would exclude anything with a tough inedible outer layer; Watermelon is a hard-rinded pepo, and Orange is a leathery-rinded hesperidium. Hesperidia and pepos might be considered ""modified berries"", if you really insist.  Hesperidia are superior-ovaried and thus ""true (modified?) berries"". Pepos are inferior-ovaried, so fuck them on the grounds of this ""true berry"" bullshit.

That leaves Banana. Tough inedible outer layer (not a reasonable berry), and inferior ovary (not a true berry). But no special term like pepo or hesperidium. If after all this, Banana is still causing trouble for Blueberries membership, let's just say Banana isn't a fruit at all. The Bananas in grocery stores don't have seeds, and according to definition 1 at: http://www.biology-online.org/dictionary/Fruit, fruits have seeds.

Addiction in any form can cause serious life long consequences. Internet addiction combined with a website like Reddit, that has a never ending supply of new material, can come to completely rule a persons life. Some people start and end their day with the website, for some it's the only comforting thing they have. The problem with addiction is that it is cyclical, and the only cure in the addicts mind is to fuel their addiction. Sometimes people can see beyond their addiction, and wish they could quit, but because you have spent so long habituating yourself with patterns, the task of breaking out of them seems insurmountable. 

The easiest thing to do for addicts is to switch between something that gives them immediate gratification. The internet, gaming, masturbating and sex, drugs or alcohol. When we neglect our fundamental needs for these highs, it can have a disastrous impact on our lives. Introspection, self growth, meditation, helping and sharing with others, are all healthy habits to replace old debilitating ones.

Many redditors may suffer from, or develop symptoms of experiential avoidance with prolonged or obsessive use.

When it's dry, dripped oil from cars and rubber worn off of tires accumulates on the road.  The longer that it's dry (I'm looking at you, California), the more it accumulates.   
When it finally does rain, the rain floats all that crap up out of the crevices and creates sort of a thin slurry.  You can actually see it on the road, because it will make a bit of foam, as if there were soap mixed with the rain.  This shit is slippery.  
Until it rains enough to wash this off the road, the roads will be really slippery.  Be careful out there.
