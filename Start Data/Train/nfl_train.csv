"sand0789","","","I am a believer that the yards that go towards a 1st down are indeed more valuable than those that come after the 1st down.  So this is an interesting analysis.  It could be applied to receptions as well, for both WR's and RB's.  

The author makes an analogy to return yards, which I think makes sense.  But you have to keep in mind that most return yards, or at least those on kickoff returns, are uncontested.  If a running back is eating up second level yards, he's generally earning every inch.  

I think this could be an interesting analytic, but it needs to be transformed in a way that shows data as more of an efficiency metric. The simple thing would be yards/carry including only those towards the down to gain.  But this will hurt backs who get more short yardage runs.  

So maybe it would have to be something like yards/carry towards a 1st down on only 1st and 2nd down, and including only carries in which the back didn't actually get the 1st down.  And then you couple this with a % of runs that go for a 1st down.  

I don't know.  Just some type of metric that shows how workmanlike a back is in keeping a team on schedule with down and distance.  

I mean, just look at the extremes.  If you have a running game that generates exactly 4.0 yards on every run, with no penalties, you will never ever lose a football game.  Perfection.  But if you have a running game that gets one 40 yard gain every 10 attempts, and zero yards on all other attempts, then you are in trouble, even though both situations have the same yards per carry.

I don't really have the answer.  But it does seem like there is potential for a valuable analytic.

"Csplayer55","eagles","Eagles","1. Intentional. They are dropping into typical pass coverage to exploit the right side to 1 on 1 matchups.  

2. The center (fredricks) is stepping back with his left foot first indicating that he wanted to move the centermost defender to his left side isolating the one on ones on the right side. 

3. Absolutely. You can tell by Martin's first few steps how he will be playing Watt. His sole intention is to get him out of the passing lane to prevent the sWATT. 

4. The most likely scenerio brings Tuggle to overload the weak side. You counter this with Murray. Either you lob it to him in the flats or you have him take Tuggle head on. Though I would have blitzed Mercillus and had Cushing cover Witten with safety help. 

5. Ummm JJ Watt? You have a rookie on the DPOY. If you are going one on one, chances are you are looking to offload the ball fast. 

~~---------------------------~~

1. The fact that he is there opens a passing lane for Romo if he wants to go to that side. Had Tuggle blitzed, he may have been looking for an option that way. Had Mercillus blitzed, they would've had it covered. Either way the two adjacent linemen hold their blocks (no defender wants to be double teamed) creating a clean lane for Romo to deliver if needed.

2. I think the play design moreso than the protection played a roll in Reed's inability here. With Murray chipping on the outside, Free overplays inside. Reed still should've gotten his hands up. Bad on him. 
    
3. Martin did exactly what he wanted to do, eliminate JJ from the play (and get away with a hold). He took Watt's momentum and carried it inside. Houston's pass rush was straight up 4 man pressure. Watt cutting inside hoped to draw a double team or beat the rookie 1 on 1 isolating Reed in space 1 on 1 against Free.

~~---------------------------~~

Who do you give Helmet Stickers to for excellent play?

Helmet Sticker goes to both Watt and Martin on this play. Watt did all he could to disrupt it and Martin rode him inside.

Who do you give Extra Laps to for subpar play?

Extra Laps go to Brooks Reed. He needs to commit to the contain and get his hands up or commit to the 1 on 1 and rush. He looked a bit lost. Edit: After rewatching the play, it may be helmet stars for Free for getting hands on Reed's shoulders preventing the swat down. Also, laps for Tuggle, that was ugly. Dropping into the zone and watching the QB's eyes, ok but that route to Murray and how far off of him he was, not ok. ",1428940265,"","1428940577",1,4,"nfl"

Tidbits (paraphrased, but to help people get the gist)


On potential relocation to LA:  
Relocation policy is very clear. There will be at least one, if not multiple votes, among owners before a franchise was able to move. No determinations have been made about any team going to Los Angeles, but several alternatives have been suggested and several teams are interested but trying to resolve their own local issues first.

On lack of games in Mexico since 2005:    
We want to get back there, but it's a factor of stadium capabilities and standards. We are looking at other markets (than London), including Mexico

On potential of conflict of interest, with NFL paying independent investigators and how this affects league credibility:  
I don't agree with that, we hire people who have uncompromising credibility and their integrity is impeccable.

A number of players have been vocal about criticising you. How is your relationship with players and how will you improve it?  
There are close to 3000 players in the NFL, I communicate with most of them privately on a regular basis. We talk to former players and the NFLPA for their perspectives. We won't always agree but I have respect for the players both on and off the field. Their wellbeing and future are important to me.

When Sean Payton was suspended for Bountygate, you said ignorance is no excuse. Will the same standards apply to the Patriots?   
These are individual cases. The Bounty case was unacceptable, and I hold the head coach responsible in that case. We don't know who is responsible in this case, and when we do we will take action against that person.

Will you make yourself available to media every week like with players?  
I'm available to media almost every day as part of my job.

"RaginGreenWurst","packers","Packers","My biggest concern is Bulaga not Cobb. Our offensive line is so damn good right now. We cannot afford to lose Bulaga, period. BUT the rumor is that we may resign Bulaga tonight! Source: r/greenbaypackers and [this twitter source](https://twitter.com/PackerUpdate/status/574247634409410561).. PackerUpdate did report about Sam Shields being resigned at last min and Rodgers being cleared to return to Bears game due to his collarbone injury correctly.

About Cobb, I thought we couldn't afford to lose him. The more I think about it, I was wrong. We still have options at WR with Adams and Abbrederis. It's very likely we will draft another WR in 2nd or 3rd round in this upcoming draft especially drafting Phillip Dorsett to replace Cobb for the future. We must focus on drafting an inside LB during the first round, period.

"rdogg1026","jets","Jets","1) - **Jameis Winston - Tampa Bay Buccaneers (2-14)**

COLLEGE: Florida State

Class: Soph

HT: 6-4

WT: 235

POS: QB

Analysis: The Bucs don't currently have a franchise quarterback on their roster, and while both of the top two QB prospects in this year's class carry with them significant risks (along with considerable talent and upside), it could be tough for them to pass on both. If you factor in only on-field performance, Winston should be the No. 1 choice. He beats opponents from the pocket with very good accuracy, arm strength and anticipation, and his on-field intangibles and leadership are positives as well. The concerns with Winston obviously have to do with his off-field behavior, and any team that drafts him is going to have to trust him enough from a character and psychological standpoint to make him the face of its franchise. That's a big risk, but NFL teams know that they can't win consistently without good quarterback play. And the Bucs could decide that Marcus Mariota's need to transition from Oregon's up-tempo spread offense to the NFL represents an even greater risk -- albeit in a very different way. 


2) - **Leonard Williams - Tennessee Titans (2-14)**

COLLEGE: USC

Class: Jr

HT: 6-5

WT: 290

POS: DE


Analysis: Williams is the complete package -- he can two-gap as a run-stuffer, but he can also penetrate and make plays against both the pass and the run. He'd make Jurrell Casey even better by drawing more double-teams and allowing Casey to do what he does best: use quickness to establish positioning, and disrupt. Having two studs in Williams and Casey on the defensive front would provide a boost for a team that ranked 31st in the league in rushing yards per game allowed last season. The Titans have a huge need at QB and would have to consider Marcus Mariota here, but he's a risk despite his big-time upside because of his lack of experience at consistently throwing with anticipation and accuracy from the pocket at Oregon. 


3) - **Randy Gregory - Jacksonville Jaguars (3-13)**

COLLEGE: Nebraska

Class: Jr

HT: 6-6

WT: 245

POS: DE


Analysis: The Jags' biggest need is at right tackle, and they are looking for competition along their entire offensive line, but there isn't an offensive tackle in this class worth drafting at No. 3 overall. Gregory is a good fit, however. They need a young pass-rusher (Chris Clemons is 33), and Gregory is one of the most explosive edge rushers in this class. He needs to continue to add bulk and strength to his lean frame, but he has the length, violent hands and closing burst to get home off the edge. 


4) - **Amari Cooper - Oakland Raiders (3-13)**

COLLEGE: Alabama

Class: Jr

HT: 6-1

WT: 205

POS: WR


Analysis: The Raiders have to provide second-year QB Derek Carr with more weapons. (James Jones is the top receiver on Oakland's roster right now.) Cooper, West Virginia's Kevin White and Louisville's Devante Parker are the best WR prospects in this class and the only ones who legitimately belong in the top-20 discussion, and Cooper is our favorite of the bunch. He was absolutely dominant in 2014 despite facing top defensive competition in the SEC and dealing with inconsistent play from Bama QB Blake Sims. He has excellent savvy as a route runner, good acceleration vertically and he does a terrific job of pulling down 50-50 balls. 


5) - **Shane Ray - Washington Redskins (4-12)**

COLLEGE: Missouri

Class: Jr

HT: 6-2

WT: 240

POS: DE


Analysis: The Redskins need a pass-rusher -- often-injured ROLB Brian Orakpo is a free agent and not expected to return -- and Ray is a terror off the edge. He is relentless at pressuring the quarterback, combining outstanding first-step quickness, effective hands and impressive redirect skills. He also continues to get stronger versus the run and has bulked up into the 250-pound range. He was incredibly productive at Mizzou, finishing fifth in the FBS with 13 sacks last season. This is another spot where Mariota could come under consideration, but I've got Washington addressing its defense here. 


6) - **Marcus Mariota - New York Jets (4-12)**

COLLEGE: Oregon

Class: Jr

HT: 6-4

WT: 211

POS: QB


Analysis: Mariota could slide even further than this on draft day, but I think this pick makes sense for the Jets given their need at QB and the presence of Chan Gailey at offensive coordinator. Gailey can adapt his scheme to any QB and has a history with spread-formation offenses, so he's capable of providing Mariota with a smooth transition to the NFL from his up-tempo spread system at Oregon. Mariota has rare athleticism for the QB position (including prototypical size) and outstanding intangibles, but his one area of concern -- consistently being able to win from the pocket -- is the most important trait you need to succeed at the NFL level. So how a team caters its approach to him and develops him as an accurate passer from the pocket will be critical. 


7) - **Danny Shelton - Chicago Bears (5-11)**

COLLEGE: Washington

Class: Sr

HT: 6-5

WT: 332

POS: DT

Analysis: It's unclear what scheme new head coach John Fox and new defensive coordinator Vic Fangio plan to run in Chicago -- my guess is they'll use something of a hybrid front -- but if they plan to play any 3-4, they'll need some capable bodies. Lamarr Houston and Will Sutton are best at penetrating and disrupting, and their strongest point-of-attack D-lineman, Stephen Paea, is a free agent. Shelton would provide a versatile, big body along the interior, as he commands double-teams against the run and can push the pocket as a pass-rusher. Arik Armstead is another option here, and the Bears also need help at safety and linebacker. But what will they do at the QB position? 

8) - **Arik Armstead - Atlanta Falcons (6-10)**

COLLEGE: Oregon

Class: Jr

HT: 6-7

WT: 285

POS: DE

Analysis: The Falcons need to improve on defense, especially with their pass rush. D-linemen Kroy Biermann and Osi Umenyiora are both free agents. Armstead was a 5-technique defensive end at Oregon and could play a similar role in the NFL, but he's also explosive enough to be a great fit as a left defensive end in new Atlanta head coach Dan Quinn's scheme -- similar to the role that Michael Bennett played for Quinn with the Seahawks. I've really liked what I've seen from Armstead's tape; he's an excellent run defender who has a lot of upside as a pass-rusher because of his violent hands and ability to convert speed to power.


9) - **Brandon Scherff - New York Giants (6-10)**

COLLEGE: Iowa

Class: Sr

HT: 6-4

WT: 320

POS: OT

Analysis: I think this pick would depend upon whether the Giants retain Jason Pierre-Paul in free agency. If they don't, then pass-rusher becomes a top need and a guy like Florida DE Dante Fowler Jr. might be under consideration. But if JPP stays, I think the smart play here is to continue to solidify the offensive line. Left tackle Will Beatty played better in OC Ben McAdoo's system and 2014 second-rounder Weston Richburg should take over for JD Walton at center, leaving Scherff to start at either guard spot or possibly beat out Justin Pugh for the right tackle job. He is perfectly wired to be a New York Giants offensive lineman. He's durable, tough, strong and nasty. The Giants also have needs at linebacker, safety and possibly D-tackle if Mike Patterson leaves in free agency. 


10) - **Kevin White - St. Louis Rams (6-10)**

COLLEGE: West Virginia

Class: Sr

HT: 6-2

WT: 211

POS: WR

Analysis: The Rams' biggest need is at QB, but there's no way for them to address that position in this scenario. (Remember, we don't project trades in these mock drafts, and there's a big drop-off in this year's QB class after Winston and Mariota.) The next-biggest need is O-line, but the only prospect worth drafting this high is Stanford's Andrus Peat, and he's a pure left tackle who doesn't fit the Rams' physical approach all that well. So, wide receiver makes the most sense here, and White is a complete player with good size and outstanding ball skills. He'd immediately upgrade a group that features several question marks and no No. 1 receiver. 


11) - **Devante Parker - Minnesota Vikings (7-9)**

COLLEGE: Louisville

Class: Sr

HT: 6-2

WT: 207

POS: WR

Analysis: The Vikings need help on the offensive line, but Parker would make a lot of sense here. They need to surround second-year QB Teddy Bridgewater with more weapons, and Parker was Bridgewater's top target at Louisville. Parker would become Minnesota's tallest receiver at 6-foot-2 1/2, and he displays very good body control and competitiveness when the ball is in the air to go along with his size. He had a very productive season in 2014 after returning from injury (855 receiving yards in just seven games, 19.9 yards per catch). ",1423148014,"","1423152131",1,484,"nfl"

"30K100M","raiders","Raiders","1. I think they are prepared for Mercilus, Tuggle and Cushing to blitz. They had Tyron Smith on Mercilus, Murray on Tuggle and Martin on Cushing. Since Mercilus and Tuggle weren't blitzing they ended up triple teaming Watt. I also think the underneath routes by Escobar, Witten and Bryant are designed to exploit the void left by these LB if they blitz.

2. Agree. In Play #1 and #2, he had a more powerful stance in order to explode around the edge, while in play #3 he was squared up against Witten to allow him to perform a wider range of motion against Witten's routes.

3. Yes. Martin added a 3rd hand against Powe which prevented Powe from attacking the A gap and gobble up double teams. This action allowed Frederick to stay one on one against Powe while keeping Martin squared up to pick up the blitz by Cush.

4. I think Reed's stance might have told the OL that he's not going to blitz. I also think that Zack Martin saw Cush leaning slightly forward prior to the snap and he might have gave it away because of that. As a general rule of thumb, I think they're blocking from the inside out so they'll prioritize inside pass rushers first.

5. I think  the advantage goes to Cush. Although Cush is smaller than Martin, he's more athletic and was running full speed at Martin and was able to successfully bull rush him, putting pressure up the middle on Romo.

6. The triple team on Watt is a result of Smith and Murray preparing for the blitz from Mercilus and Tuggle, and since neither Mercilus nor Tuggle blitz they're like fuck it let's just block JJ Watt because why the fuck not.",1429104907,"","False",1,6,"nfl"

"GGerrik","patriots","Patriots","So I have some experience coaching WRs, and here's what I was coached to coach.  

Your top post brings up 3 key things. 

Attacking the opposite shoulder, sinking the hips, rounding the routes. 

Here are some other key things for route running. 

**Firing out** - The receiver wants every route to look the same off the start, usually its the first 3 steps you talk about. The receiver needs to drive forward straight into the DB (usually towards the opposite shoulder, but that can change). The first 3 steps need to be as fast as you would running a fade or a slant (the longest or shortest routes ""typically'). 

**Stutter stepping** - Sort of the antitheses of Firing out, stutter stepping is something that the greatest receivers have mastered. Texas Tech (Wes Welker) also teaches this to all their WRs who use it on every route. Stutter stepping is awkward to explain but it's essentially a quick series of short choppy steps off the ball which then when planting your outside foot to your direction you take off. It's used to get the DB on the wrong foot and was used often by Moss before blowing by DBs on his fades. This can also be used before any break but typically isn't at the NFL level. 

**Nose over Toes,** it's exactly how it sounds, but a crisp route the WR keeps the center of gravity balanced by keeping his Noes over his Toes. This can also be taught during the shoulders forward/down, or simply help with shoulders forward/down. If a receiver doesn't keep his nose over his toes, he can extend a leg too far forward on a plant for cutting and simply slip or be knocked off balance a DB/LB while breaking on his route. 

**Shoulder forward/down** means keeping the body over the toes, it helps with balance on cuts and forward momentum to prevent defenders knocking them off their route. It's most important to keep the shoulders forward when sinking the hips in the breaking of a route. Failure to do this is often called ""getting high"" and it's a tale tell sign of sloppy route running and a key the DBs can pick up on that you're about to make a break on your route and for them to peddle down and get ready to change direction with you. 

**Planting with the outside foot**, you would hope at the NFL this is done correctly, but... well it can lead to problems. To get a nice clean cut, the receiver needs to plant with the foot opposite of the direction he's breaking. By the time that foot hit's the ground a second time you typically want the receiver to be at full speed again (possible if they're using outside foot, keeping nose over toes, shoulders down, and sunk the hips). It allows the receiver to explode out of the breaks and create separation. 

**Hand Play - swimming/ripping** Releasing is a different topic, but outside of keeping balance while running their routes, the Receiver should typically be using a ripping motion while crossing the face of the defensive back on certain breaks, or using a straight arm at the top of their breaks to maintain separation. It's important for the receiver to keep their hands pumping in front of them so that they can quickly get them up to keep a DB off their numbers, and to rip themselves clean for the breaks in their routes. 

**Depth** - A WR needs to run their route to the proper depth, not just to correct yard marker, but also where they're breaking, what their aiming points are, are they over/under backers / DBs, inside/outside release. A receiver can run the wrong route simply by breaking at 8 yards instead of 10, or breaking at 12 and running it flat instead of coming back to 10. Often you want your receiver to be headed back to the ball, so typically it's broken higher than the route is run across the field. This is obviously different for Corners/Post/Slants. Additionally depth means giving the DB a landing strip, typically 2-3 yards of boundry between where your running your route and where the sideline is. A fade can be ruined simply by having a DB squeeze the receiver too close to the boundary, the QB has no space to drop a ball in. Obviously this space can change with elite QBs. 

**Rounding out the route / finishing the route** - Typically after completing a curl or comeback, you want the receiver to continue their momentum in a circle and continue up field. Not stopping and turning back the opposite direction. This keeps the players momentum and speed, while also giving them a better angle for breaking tackles that are closing in from behind (off their break and catch). 

**Balance**, We've talked about maintaining pad height (shoulders), sinking the hips, and nose over toes. This is important for any route over the middle. LBers are always trying to get their hands on a receiver to disrupt their route. A LB can ruin the timing of a play just by getting a hand on a receiver and pushing them a step off their route. Let alone when they chuck a receiver fully to the ground. It's always legal within 5, and can often be done a little outside that without being flagged. Keeping to their route and not allowing a defender to knock them off it is very important to the timing and spacing of routes. 

**Fakes/ Head Jabs**, Another tool to a great route runner are body, head, or even just eye fakes. The best route runners like Jerry Rice, could get a DB to turn their hips simply by faking the wrong direction. Either a hard jab step with their plant foot (outside foot), throwing their shoulders in the opposite direction, bobbing the head in the opposite direction, or the real good ones could simply get people with their eyes staring down a DB and freezing them like a deer caught in headlights. 

[Here is an example of a double move by OBJ](http://i.imgur.com/4hXMcXj.jpg), borrowed from /u/dNYG He gives the false step outside throwing in a head fake which moves his shoulders and exaggerates the step he's taking to the outside. He then plants across the face of the DB and blows past him as the DB has not only turned his hips but is sprinting full speed in that direction. ",1423622513,"","1423633548",1,56,"nfl"

"timeandspace11","patriots","Patriots","Honestly, I'm beyond giving a shit what any other  team, player, coach, ex player, owner, GM or fan says. First of all the Wells Report, specifically clears everyone except Brady and 2 low level staff members. A first round pick, A 4th round pick, and a $1 million fine is absolutely absurd. It was a punishment completely based on how big the public reaction was, not the seriousness of the offense. 

In Vincent's letter to the Pats, he talked about how Brady didn't cooperate fully with the investigation. Vincent says he doesn't hold the Pats responsible for his refusal but that it is significant. What does that mean? Is the organization responsible or not for Brady's refusal? 

The League also said we are responsible for the conduct of our employees. Fair enough, but then shouldn't teams get fined when their players test positive for PEDs. Shouldn't the Steelers have been fined when Tomlinson walked out to interfere with a special teams return by the Ravens? Shouldn't the Jets have been fined when that coach tripped the Dolphin's player. 

Even if you think Brady is 100% guilty, you should still absolutely HATE the way the league has handled this, both in dealing with Brady and the Pats. Look at everything they did wrong. They were warned there might be a problem, but the PSI before the game was not recorded. We all saw how many leaks occurred during the investigation. And now after the NFLPA, Brady's Agent, and Kraft's rebuttal report an alleged bias, Goodell though it was a good idea to appoint himself as the arbitrator in Brady's appeal. 

You may hate the Pats and Brady, but you should hate the way the NFL has conducted itself even more. Eventually, it could be your team that has to deal with this shit. And if you are a good team, watch out. It is going to get blown out of proportion (remember this  is all about 15% or less air pressure in a football in a game that was 45-7) and the NFL is going to want to drop the hammer to make up for its own past sins. They won't be fair.

"Zenryhao","saints","Saints","**OFFICIAL PRO BOWL CHEERLEADER POWER RANKINGS**

1. **Liz** (Houston Texans) - Of the select few without a butter face, Liz is almost definitely the most attractive (one could split hairs over blondes vs. brunettes, but that would be a hotly contested issue). With a first-person blurb almost exclusively punctuated by exclamation points and a left eyebrow which just says ""Really? You're *not* going to pick me?"" Liz is the cream of the crop, even if the Texans aren't.

2. **Sara** (St. Louis Rams) - With a genuinely attractive face that actually looks like a human being rather than a makeup-drenched soulless troll, Sara could easily be elevated to 1(a) but this ranker doesn't believe in copouts like that. Additionally, her first-person blurb actually reads like an intelligent human being wrote it, and she's a full-time student going for a nursing degree which is very respectable.

3. **Katelyn** (San Deigo Chargers) - She's got that certain *je ne sais quoi* to her, by which I mean she looks like a porn star. Call it old-fashioned, but this ranker believes the best cheerleaders maintain an air of ""girl next door""  rather than going full casting couch. If you're a fan of Barbie dolls, though, Katelyn might be your hottest cup of tea.

4. **Nicole** (Dallas Cowboys) - The frizzy hair or whatever that style is called is certainly not flattering, but the slammin' body and cute as a button face are too good to ignore. Hairstyle is readily changeable anyway, so it's not a real issue. This University of Idaho (ha) graduate is set to break into the top 3, if only she could get her hands on a straightener.

5. **Sam** (Denver Broncos) - Rounding out the top 5 is the only cheerleader on this list rocking a short haircut. She pulls it off with all the dignity and grace you'd expect from an actual professional ballerina and also shakes her ass with all the technical skill of, well, a professional ballerina. She has two pet guinea pigs, too, which is definitely a plus.

6. **Alice** (Atlanta Falcons) - It might just be the white outfit on a white background (come on, NFL.com) but there's something about this one just doesn't look *real*. Aside from that certain unsettling quality, Alice defines the standard sexy co-ed look. Holding her back is the decidedly unremarkable career goal of *coaching* cheerleading after being a cheerleader.

7. **Sam** (Jacksonville Jaguars) - Apparently the Jags are better at cheerleader personnel than they are at football personnel, because Sam is way higher on this tier list than any of their QBs ever. The biggest question mark on Sam is whether she actually has the goods or if that's just a bra doing it's pushup magic. If nothing else, she can hang her hat on being a ""clinical research assistant in a motion analysis center"" whatever the hell that means.

8. **Charo** (Washington Redskins) - With a face and body that just makes you wonder, ""What race is this chick?"" it's no wonder Charo cheer-os for the Washington Why-are-we-still-called-this-shits. She does have the same porn-star charm as Katelyn before her, but Charo is more of a ""category"" actress than an all-around star, if you catch my drift. Apparently she also works as a tax accountant though, which is pretty amusing.

9. **Alicia Marie** (Philadelphia Eagles) - The body screams ""YES"" but the face mumbles some counter-arguments while the eyes simply say ""Let's get this over with."" But all that pales in comparison to the simply amazing fun-fact that Alicia Marie ""is the lead educator for"" a program called (I shit you not) ""HEAD for the future."" She's also passionate about breast cancer awareness, but her mouth is only the third-best tool she has for that cause.

10. **Melissa** (Miami Dolphins) - We're back to the first-person blurbs! Looks like Mel majors in Mass Communication which is code for ""getting railed in fraternities"" when she's not cheering on those darn Dolphins. There's not much to say about her physical appearance besides that she isn't Lauren Tannehill. Can we get her on the sidelines? That would be more fun to watch than any Dolphins game.

11. **Melissa** (Seattle Seahawks) - ""Damn, she's hot!"" is what guys probably said 10-15 years ago. She's the only one of the bunch with a husband, and there's a reason for that. That reason can clearly be seen in her knees. But to be fair, Melissa still looks pretty damn good. Can we focus on how her first-person blurb includes the phrase ""only a couple continents left to visit"" though? There are only 7 in the first place, and Antarctica doesn't even count. Settle down with the claims of being a master traveler.

12. **Taylor** (New Orleans Saints) - Taylor is 23 goin' on 13. Seriously, she should consider a career as an undercover cop catching pedophiles or something rather than her actual goal as a crime scene technician. It's so pronounced this ranker doesn't even feel comfortable commenting on her physical traits. No amount of homer-ism would let me rank her any higher than this, but most important is her message to everyone out there: Never give up on your dreams. (Unless you're a pedophile, then maybe stop.)

13. **Michelle** (Oakland Raiders) - Her body is almost perfect, *but her face*. It's a shame the Raiders are actually improving and have a quality young quarterback, because it takes the wind out of most of the best jokes which could be made here. Let's just assume that she totally deserved the Wanetta Horton Award, which is apparently a real thing they hand out to the ""most inspirational Raiderette of the season"" and move on.

14. **Cassie** (Tampa Bay Bucs) - Once again, a rockin' body *but her face*. Like, everyone's heard Afroman's ""Colt 45"" right? If you haven't, go listen to it, then come back. You good? Okay. That's relevant, because there is a good chance Cassie would whip out a dick that was bigger than yours, judging by her oddly manly face. She also ""performed"" at the Republican National Convention, which just, who knows what that means.

15. **Brie** (New York Jets) - The theme is continuing, okay? She has apparently performed ""numerous full-scale halftime shows"" with Lenny Kravitz. Suffice it to say, it's up in the air which of them looks more like a dude.

---------

Alright, the rest of these power rankings would just be too mean and repetitive, so this is probably far enough. I guess there should be a ""Miss Irrelevant"" though, so here's a bonus ranking for last place.

Miss Irrelevant: **Amanda** (Arizona Cardinals) - Amanda is either an amazing cheerleader or a trained CIA assassin who cheers for the Cardinals as part of her cover when she isn't busy dating NASCAR drivers. Those are the only explanations for why someone with that face would be chosen for any sort of all-star event. Seriously, is that a mask? Yikes.

"skepticismissurvival","vikings","Vikings","1. It goes from left to right across the board. Free vs. Reed, Martin vs. Watt, Frederick vs. Jamison, Leary vs. Mohamed, and Smith vs. Mercilus.
1. a) Because Mohamed is lined up where he is, Leary has to account for him in the protection scheme. This forces Frederick to match up with Jamison. b) matching Jamison on Frederick is important on this play because if Frederick were free to move to his right, he would be able to easily stop Reed from coming free on the stunt.
1. It's not particularly convincing. He basically hops in place a little, his foot might move a couple of inches forward. However, his alignment in and of itself is still effective because it forces Leary to step to his left with his first step, which is the opposite of the direction he would want to go. Therefore, the step does not need to be particularly convincing.

---

1. Jamison's job on the play is to contain Frederick and prevent him from moving over to block Reed on his stunt. As you can see from the fact that Frederick fails to disengage, Jamison is successful
1. Watt takes two steps with his hip going nearly vertical, but after his second step he shifts his hip angle and is now angled further away from Romo. Martin's immediate reaction is to try to force Watt onto Free as quickly as possible, because I think he recognizes the stunt.
1. Mercilus' hips stay directly facing Smith. If he truly intended to turn inside, he would also need to turn his hips. By watching his hips, Smith can basically ignore the jab step and continue on with his normal protection.

---

1. Watt's primary goal is to draw Martin away from Romo to give Reed a wide open pass rush lane to exploit. He does this well.
1. First, Reed convincingly starts upfield like he's trying to execute a speed rush. Then, he uses Watt's body to shield himself from Free and also Martin. Since Martin is engaged with Watt, he needs to pass him off to Free before he can attempt to block Reed. Unfortunately for Martin, Reed gets past him, and gets a pressure on Romo.
1. With a T/E stunt, you have one defender ""slashing"" inside and the other defender wrapping around him. In this case, it's clear that Watt is the ""slashing"" defender and Reed is the ""wrapping"" defender. Martin should be picking up Reed as he rushes inside. At the beginning of pretty much any standard passing play, you're going to have a guard blocking the DT (well, DE in this case, Watt) and the tackle blocking the DE (or OLB in this case, Reed). Normally, it would just be one-on-one matchups. In the case of a stunt, you want the player assigned to block the slashing defender to pass him off to the other blocker (in this case, Martin should pass off Watt to Free) and then block the wrapping defender. This is what Martin does, he just doesn't get it done fast enough.
1. This would probably be enough to kill the effectiveness of the stunt. Leary would then be tasked to block Jamison (Frederick would probably throw a hand to help out, or he would at least pass him off quickly). The Martin vs. Watt battle would likely play out the same, but now Frederick would be there to pick up Reed on the stunt.

---

1. Copying what I talked about earlier down here: With a T/E stunt, you have one defender ""slashing"" inside and the other defender wrapping around him. In this case, it's clear that Watt is the ""slashing"" defender and Reed is the ""wrapping"" defender. Martin should be picking up Reed as he rushes inside. At the beginning of pretty much any standard passing play, you're going to have a guard blocking the DT (well, DE in this case, Watt) and the tackle blocking the DE (or OLB in this case, Reed). With an E/T stunt, Reed and Watt's roles would be reversed.

Afterwards, he will have another rematch with his equal &amp; opposite Peyton Manning. The game will be an electrifying display of offensive prowess for both team, accenting Tom's big play capabilities. The Patriots win 45 - 38. Quite possibly the highest rated/most watched AFC Championship game of all time.

But then, the true test begins. The Patriots encounter the Seattle Seahawks in the Super Bowl. The final act of revenge. I originally thought the Giants would need to be here for Brady to truly exercise his demons, but the Giants are not worthy of that title, despite besting Tom twice in the Super Bowl. No -- there is only one team worthy of this type of revenge. The self-anointed best defense of all time. The game narrative is similar to the Ravens game. It's tough. It's a slobber knocker. The Patriots are down by the score of 20 to 24 with 2 minutes left. Tom hits a slant to Edelmen: 11 yards. Tom hits a seam to Gronk: 22 yards. Tom gets a quick out to LaFell: 7 yards. Tom hits another crossing pattern to LaFell: 19 yards. 

We're close now, gentlemen. Can you feel that? Tom lines up under center and the ball is snapped. Seattle brings pressure, but Tom is cool. He steps up through the collapsing pocket and drills Gronk in the center of the endzone for the touchdown with 22 seconds left. Tom finishes the game with 280 yards passing, 2 touchdowns, and zero interceptions as the Patriots win the game.

As the confetti falls, the Seahawks sulk in their misery as they dream of what could of been if they repeated as Super Bowl champs. They laze about, soaking in the atmosphere, remembering this feeling of deep hurt so they can come back harder...hungrier. 

Tom Brady has been here before. When the game ends, he is not yet overcome by the extreme elation. He wades through the sea of media to seek out his conquered foes for post game handshakes. Tom Brady is the consummate professional. He shakes Russel Wilson's hand and tells him he is the future of the NFL. He acknowledges Marshawn Lynch's superb ability as an athlete. 

But finally, he arrives at Richard Sherman. He extends his hand, grips Richard's firmly and shakes it. Tom looks Richard in the eye. ""You mad, bro?""

"vindicatednegro","bears","Bears","It's hard to discuss this subject because a lot of people approach it in bad faith and try to support their own biases with the conclusions presented. One is tempted to put forth a litany of caveats before answering such questions to avoid, or at lest minimize, their statements being misinterpreted either willfully or by ignorance. What I'm saying is it devolves into racist bullshit. But it is a valid question. I'll try to break it down simplistically (so there are gonna be errors for the pedants):

Black people were brought to the United States and other colonies (Latin America, Caribbean) from West Africa. The conditions in West Africa produced people with a high proportion of fast twitch muscles as well as long limbs, especially legs (relative to, say, people of East Asian descent). Needless to say this didn't happen overnight. Anyway, what these traits boil down to in sports is speed. Had slaves been taken from East Africa (say Ethiopia, Somalia or the highlands Kenya), you'd have a bunch of skinny dudes with godly cardio.

The reason OLs are largely white is that the physical qualities required of that position are less about speed and more about size and absolute strength (compare and contrast with DLs who need to be pretty quick and fast). We are talking about a larger geographical range when we speak about the origins of linemen and this complicates the conversation but when you talk about a team like Wisconsin (Badgers fan) or really B1G teams in general, you are talking about regional recruiting in a region of the country with lots of German descent (and Nordic descent when you go up towards Minnesota). Far from all Germans are big just as far from all Scandinavians are big (I've lived in those parts of the world and we Americans would even consider them ""skinny"" nations but that's because the American diet is just so crazy) *but* they tend to have larger frames (especially average height) and more slow twitch fibers (as an overall proportion) than your average West African, not due to diet alone but also due to the same sort of pressures (environmental mostly) that shaped West Africans into speed demons. This means they have massive upper and lower body strength but a different ""power delivery"" profile; they'll squat more weight but, body weight being equal, will not achieve the same vertical jump ON AVERAGE (everything is on average).

The science behind this can be controversial because of history and racism and all that. But if you have been watching football for any length of time, especially NCAA and the combine, you'll know that Florida is the speed state. More generally, you'll know that they're faster and look like Greek Gods by the age of 16 below the Mason-Dixon line. You'll know that the aforementioned Midwest is the cradle of giant-ass, corn fed monsters who bench more than you'll ever squat, all in their sophomore year of high school. And if you've got half a head on your shoulders, you'll know these physical differences (based on averages which mean many people do and many peopled *don't* conform to the ""norm"") represent the most insignificant percentage of what constitutes a human being. And at this point I realize I've been writing this too long and that there are the theories of social push/pull factors which essentially cause people to self-sort themselves to positions according to their ""race"". This is more theory and less biology so much more debatable but not without merit.

The TL;DR as someone else said is that positions are filled by the best qualified candidates in a generally efficient manner (the wall of text above suggests how this sorting might occur).

"skepticismissurvival","vikings","Vikings","1. With the way the pass rush is set up, I think blitzing Tuggle would be most successful but I think blitzing Cushing is most likely because of the safety help over the top to take on Hanna. Mercilus definitely isn't blitzing with how he's head-up on Witten.
1. Powe is lined up at 1 tech shaded left and forces Frederick to move in that direction off the snap. Watt coming across Martin's face also forces him left, which leaves Free on the island.
1. The left side is basically able to maintain the same gap that they started in, but the right side needs to move over one gap to the right.
1. The protection call appears to be ""Half Slide Left,"" which means that three offensive linemen are blocking to the left while the two on the other side are left blocking one-on-one. This is a standard protection scheme and the back is also there to help out on the right side if needed.
1. That's a very good pocket. Romo has all the room he needs. Watt is encroaching a little bit but that's still a ton of space to step up into.

---

1. Leary's responsibility is to help Tyron Smith if he has trouble with Crick (or later potentially help Frederick). If Cushing blitzed it would have been his job to pick him up, but he really wasn't needed in any capacity in this play.
1. The Cowboys have Demarco Murray play Reed's outside shoulder. This allows Free to cheat inside a little and sufficiently neutralize Reed.
1. Martin does a good job of using Watt's momentum against him, forcing him to end up on the other side of Romo. One thing I'm concerned about is his arm placement, with one hand on Watt's back and the other on his opposite shoulder. That's asking for a hands to the face or holding call if he has to block for much longer.

---

1. As mentioned above, Houston's approach is to get Reed on an island with free. They are also hoping Watt can beat Martin across his face because he's JJ Watt.
1. As I also mentioned above, the Cowboys are using half slide left protection, with three blockers on the strong side of the formation and two blockers on the weak side. They also keep Murray to chip to help Free on the weak side.",1428931001,"","False",1,15,"nfl"

Unitas was one of the first pure passers.  He could read defenses like no other QB at the time.  Like most QBs of the time he called his own plays.  What made him so different was his ability to take advantage of what he saw.  

More than this though, Johnny U was the undisputed leader on the field.  Players who stepped into his huddle knew that he was in charge and listened completely.  Tight End John Mackey is famously quoted as saying, *""It's like being in a huddle with God.""* 

The Colts players didn't just play for the team, they played for Johnny U.  The respect that they showed him was well earned.  On one play in particular Mackey dropped a deep pass that he should have caught.  The Colts fans we vocally upset.  When the players got back into the huddle John just said *""Same Play""*, looked at Mackey and said *""Silence the crowd.""*  And broke huddle.  

The result:  Touchdown Mackey.

Also Unitas was tough as hell.  Raymond Berry, said that what made Unitas so good and so different,  *''was his uncanny instinct for calling the right play at the right time, his icy composure under fire, his fierce competitiveness and his utter disregard for his own safety.''*  Near the end of the fourth quarter in the 1958 Championship Game he took the field with three broken ribs. Pat Summerall and the Giants were leading 17-14.  In less than a minute and a half Unitas took the team down field with 7 completions and set up the game-tying field goal.  Johnny then lead the Colts to an overtime victory with an 80 yard drive capped off by a TD run by Al Ameche. 

In another game his nose was bleeding badly.  A ref was trying to see how badly he was hurt because blood was pouring out of his face.  He yelled for the ref to get the hell out of the way so he could call the play.  One of his linemen stuffed his nose with dirt to stop the bleeding long enough for John to throw the game winning TD.

"SMc-Twelve","patriots","Patriots","It's not unethical or sketchy - it's just unusual.

By rule, there are 11 players on the field at any given time.  6 of these 11 are ""eligible receivers"" - i.e., it's not a penalty if they catch a (non-deflected) pass.  (Before people tell you that I'm wrong, because there are only 5 eligible receivers, they're forgetting to count the quarterback, since quarterbacks virtually never catch forward passes, despite being eligible to do so.)

The 5 players who are not ""eligible receivers"" are, intuitively, ""ineligible receivers.""  If they catch a pass, it's a penalty on the offense.  These 5 players must be on (interpreted as within 1 yard of) the line of scrimmage.  Typically, these are your offensive linemen (left tackle, left guard, center, right guard, and right tackle).

By rule, there must be a total of 7 players on the line of scrimmage.  The two players on the line of scrimmage closest to the sidelines are, by rule, eligible receivers.  The other 4 eligible receivers must be at least one yard behind the line of scrimmage.

So a typical, traditional formation might have the 5 ineligible linemen on the line of scrimmage, with a tight end ""covering"" the left tackle, one wide receiver on the line of scrimmage close to the right sideline, a wide receiver just behind the line of scrimmage near the left sideline, the quarterback directly behind the center, with two running backs behind him.

There are strict rules in the NFL about player numbers.  Specifically, players must wear numbers in a range allotted by the NFL to their normal position (for example, wide receivers must wear a number between either 10-19, or 80-89).  Players whose normal position is a RB, QB, WR, or TE (...or, technically, kickers and punters, but special teams formations are beyond the scope of your question) are automatically considered to be eligible receivers *unless they specifically tell the referee otherwise before the play begins*.  Likewise, players who play a position where they would typically be considered an ineligible receiver must report to the referee if they're going to be lined up in the position (and role) of an eligible receiver.

The referee generally announces this over the stadium PA system, and at minimum must inform a defensive captain about this, so they know who to cover, and who they can ignore.

Aside from punt or field goal formations, it's pretty rare for players to switch roles (not many offensive linemen are going to line up as a wide receiver, or vice versa).  The Patriots, however, *have* been doing this a lot recently.  Other teams don't see it much, so they're often confused.

And that's the point.  The Patriots, while doing everything perfectly inside the rules, are trying to catch the other team off guard, and get a big play out of it.

The Patriots had a play last night where they had their big left tackle declare himself eligible, and didn't have any other receivers line up on the line of scrimmage between him and the sideline.  But what was tricky about it was that it *looked* like a normal formation.  But it wasn't, because there was nobody wearing a traditional ""eligible receiver"" type number lined up on the line of scrimmage between him and the sideline. When Brady threw the ball to a 350-lb lineman, the Colts were surprised, since it's not something you see much.  But it was perfectly legal, and the referee *specifically told the defense that it was a possibility*.

tl;dr - the Patriots are doing things *unconventionally*, not *unfairly*.

"daybreaker","saints","Saints","edit: Fine, if yall are going to downvote without even reading:

***tl;dr***  The coaches never admitted to paying for injuries (despite what /r/nfl would have you believe). They said there was a pay for performance pool, which paid for interceptions, fumbles, and yes, big hits - but players didnt get paid if a hit was illegal or flagged. Goodell also never produced any solid evidence to back up injuries - just circumstantial evidence and evidence backing up the pay for performance pool.


---------

Roger Goodell claimed the Saints had a system from 2009-2011 where they would pay to specifically injure other players. He claimed to have several thousand pages of evidence of this, but refused to show it to anyone. Instead, he *said* what *some* of the evidence was, and the media went to town taking his word for it.

The coaches and players never admitted to any bounties - only to a pay for performance program, where you would get bonuses for interceptions, fumbles, big hits, etc. 

But by then, public opinion was easily swayed by the media showing one hit on Kurt Warner, a few hits on Favre, and playing one audio tape by Gregg Williams, over and over and over and over, while *still* not asking to actually *see* any of the other evidence Goodell had.

To further advance the farce Goodell brought in a ""special investigator"" Mary Jo White, who claimed they had received a signed confession from a player, so the case was basically open and shut.

But then the NFLPA leaked the ""confession"" and it wasnt a confession. 

Goodell said he had the bounty ledger, full of pages of a history of payments for ""cart offs"" and other injuries. Except when they released a page that had ""cart off"" payments on it, it was for a game where no one had been injured. The NFL quickly revised their statement saying it was actually for a different game.... that also didnt have any injuries in it.

The NFL then said they had a powerpoint presentation from Gregg Williams to the defense that specifically references bounty payments.  Except the NFLPA leaked that one too, and it was a ridiculous Dog the Bounty Hunter themed presentation that was just creating metaphors for their gameplan to the popular-at-the-time TV Show.

Those are just a few examples. Basically, any time Goodell said he had evidence, and it got leaked, that ""evidence"" didnt say what Goodell said it did.

And yet no one in the media really cared about all the inconsistencies. They kept writing their articles about how shameful all this was. Getting on their soapboxes. Pete Prisco, in 2011, had said the Falcons shouldve injured Drew Brees to keep him from breaking the passing record against them. But then he became the biggest critic of ""Bountygate"".

The whole thing was a giant media shit storm created by Goodell, because the league needed a scapegoat to look like they were ""tough on player safety"" ahead of the retired players concussion lawsuit. And it apparently worked, because the league got off BIG TIME with the relatively small settlement the judge awarded.

Basically, Gregg Williams is an over-exaggerating asshole who uses harsh language to fire up his team. But to this day there is no solid evidence of any payments for actual injuries. The details of the pay for performance plan even specifically pointed out that players didnt get paid a bonus for any illegal hits. And from 2009-2011, the Saints were near the bottom of the league in personal fouls and opposing team injuries.

Now, pay for performance was certainly illegal in terms of violating the salary cap. But the media firestorm and outrage wasnt over the salary cap violations - it was over the injuries. Which were never proven. We had several players suspended for a year, Coach Payton suspended for the year, our GM Mickey Loomis suspended for 8 games, and ou assistant coach Joe Vitt suspended for 4 games. We also lost two 2nd Round draft picks, and were fined $500k.

Paul Tagliabue was later brought in and voided the player suspensions. Goodell also said that if the Saints cooperated, and helped the league start several safety initiatives in high schools, we would get our 2013 2nd Round pick back. Benson never spoke out against Goodell, and was entirely cooperative with anything he wanted. We never got our 2nd Round pick back.

Many people will claim there is proof of a $10k bounty on Favre from Vilma, or that it wasnt from Vilma, but actually from Mike Orenstein (who was in jail at the time and couldnt have actually sent anyone anything). There's never been any proof of these things - these all come from just one source, Mike Cerullo, who had actually been fired from the Saints for several reasons and had to be escorted from the facility by the police. Seeing as how he's the *only* ""witness"" Goodell ever had, it's pretty easy to call into question his reputation.

"madhjsp","titans","Titans","**General Questions**

How would you describe the way the Left side of the OL (C, LG, LT) drop into pass protection compared to the right side (RG, RT)?

* *The most apparent difference is that their first steps take them in opposite directions.*  

Take a note of the Texans' [pass rush lanes](https://i.imgur.com/HtI4Lbz.jpg) and then watch how the play unfolds.  Sometimes, the pass rush scheme is designed to isolate a matchup on an ""island.""  Look at the freeze-frame [Here](https://i.imgur.com/CCFR39H.jpg).  It appears that the Texans do exactly that.  Explain how the rush lanes dictated this.  

* *With Powe immediately slanting to his right (carrying the C with him) and Reed taking a wide pass rush angle (taking the RT with him), Watt is given major room to operate in isolation against Martin.*

Why do you suppose the protection has 3 OL turning to the left, leaving 1-on-1s on the right side?  (Are you really going to intentionally leave the rookie RG in 1-on-1 with Mr. Perfect?)  

* *Poe's pre-snap position outside of Frederick's left shoulder dictated that Frederick pick him up. I would have thought that maybe they'd have Frederick chip him then leave him for Leary to handle while turning his attention to Watt, but in slow motion it doesn't look like it was ever Frederick's intention to do anything but block Poe. He doesn't appear to be attempting to disengage.* 

The Texans only bring a 4-man rush on this play.  Look at this [presnap image](http://i.imgur.com/C3TJZxa.jpg).  If the Texans were to Blitz a LB, which one do you think most likely would be coming (Tuggle, Cushing, Mercilus) and why?  How would Dallas account for Blitz if it were to come?  

* *Blitzing Tuggle behind Watt would seem to make the most logical sense to me. With Poe, Watt, and Reed each occupying a blocker, he ought to have a clear path to the backfield, and getting to the QB would be a matter of beating the RB in pass protection. Indeed, it looks like Murray is checking for a blitz-pickup assignment before he runs out to the flat.* 

[Here](https://i.imgur.com/CCFR39H.jpg) is Tony Romo's pocket as he's preparing to throw.   Romo goes from snap to initial read to checkdown in 2.5s.  Thoughts on why he gets rid of it so fast, esp since it appears that he has good protection.  

* *From the A22, it looks like the Cowboys are trying to get Terrance Williams open on a 10-yard in-route, with Hanna running a clear-out route up the seam. However, Cushing muddles the whole thing up with a powerful jam on Hanna, meaning Williams never comes open as designed. Romo notices this quickly, and with the situation being 1st and 10, realizes that you can't go broke taking a profit and dumps the ball off to his RB to gain what yardage he can.* 

---


**Matchups**

Watch the closeup GFY on LG #65 Ron Leary.  At first glance, it looks like he basically took the play off.  What do you think his responsibility on this protection is?  What effect does he have on his 2 adjacent line-mates even though he does not actually make a block on the play?  

* *I'd imagine his first responsibility is to pick up any blitz that might come from Cushing, which allows his linemates to pick up their assignments without hesitating to read and react to him.*

\#58 LB Brooks Reed (6'3"", 258lbs) v #68 Doug Free (6'6"", 325 lbs).  This matchup would favor Reed in space and Free in close-quarters.  The Texans manage to get Reed with a 2-way go on Free (ie., there is space to the left or the right) which is favorable to Reed.  Explain how the Cowboys' protection counters that and allows Free to (safely) overplay the inside.  

* *After checking for a blitz from Tuggle, it looks like Murray is assigned to get to the outside of the line of scrimmage, help with the outside pass rush if needed, before slipping into the flat for the checkdown. Free knows he has help if Reed takes wide angle, so he sets up to guard against an inside move.*  

All-Pro DE #99 JJ Watt has a 1-on-1 with rookie RG #70 Zack Martin.  That sounds like a mismatch, but Watt does not get any pressure on Romo.  How would you assess Martin on this play?

* *Remarkably, he does not get beat even though he has to change the direction of his slide. Excellent balance. Hard to tell if he gets away with an uncalled hold, though. Kind of looks like he does.*  

---

**Summary, Stickers, and Laps**

Give a quick summary of Houston's pass rush approach on this play.  

* *They rush 4 and drop the linebackers into zone coverage, which seems logical enough against a shotgun formation on first down, where you might anticipate a short pass play.* 

Give a quick summary of Dallas' pass protection approach on this play.  

* *They clearly trust their linemen to handle 1on1 matchups.*  

Who do you give Helmet Stickers to for excellent play?  

* *Hard to pick any individual Cowboys linemen, it looks like they all did their job superbly. Even if Martin committed a hold, he gets the benefit of the doubt for successfully preventing JJ Watt in open space from getting to Romo. Cushing also gets one for successfully interrupting the intended play.*

Who do you give Extra Laps to for subpar play?  

* *Not really sure what Tuggle was doing there. He drops himself into no-man's land, too shallow to affect any deeper pass patterns yet so deep that he essentially gives Murray free yardage on the dumpoff.*

"Glib1","redskins","Redskins","I graduated from high school in 1986. I had attended a military academy in Virginia and had finally left there, headed back to DC, free from the regimentation and rules, a punk rock Lazarus. The 'Skins looked pretty fucking good that year and expectations ran high. We didn't have a first round draft pick that year and apart from a couple of picks, it was a pretty lean draft. The year before, the hated Dallas Cowboys and the New York Giants had eliminated us from the playoffs. Fans expected big things from the team that year as did the media and analysts. Solid, smash-mouth football, behind offensive and defensive  lines that promised to be pretty nasty.

I remember reading about Tuggle in the papers, his fight with his illness, the dream of coming back to football, it was one of those stories that sold papers and had movies made about it. It was fluff, my adolescent brain told me, manipulative media bullshit. But then, I turned on the news one morning and a reporter said that Tuggle was dead. This is not how shit goes, I remember thinking. This is football, the respite from all the bad crazy news about crack and Libya and the Challenger, this is what we watch to step away from the harsh luridness of Reality.

But the guy was dead. My teenage brain couldn't grasp that shit. This guy does all he can do to make his dreams come true, to play football in the pros, and he fucking dies. It was a pretty goddamned awful thing, one of those moments when life turns on the naked bulb in the room and nothing casts a shadow, it is just all there, too real, too awful to deny.

When the Giants won the Superbowl,  I was of course pissed that my team hadn't been there. But there was a moment when Joe Morris had his helmet in his hand and the voice-over was droning on inanely, Morris raised his helmet and pointed at that ""38"" sticker. And right there I realized that football, despite the divisive nature of fandom, was bigger than any one team, any one player, any bullshit analyses. It was a game, yes, but it MEANT something, a metaphor, that hundreds of thousands of people could grasp, even if only subconsciously. It was about fight and resolve and character and strength. It had merit in this insane world, beyond just a distraction. 

Man, I wanted the 'Skins to win that year. But the Giants had something to fight for. They earned it through adversity and pain and resolve. They deserved the label, ""Champions.""
