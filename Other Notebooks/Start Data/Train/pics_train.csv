I see a kid who is pretty awesome. 6th grade. Metalllica shirt? You fuckin' RULE. There wasn't a chance in hell I'd get to wear a Metallica shirt in 6th grade, which leads me to believe your parents were at least slightly awesome. I also see a pair of shoes that are well broken in, probably the kind of thing you look back on and go man I wish I loved getting new shoes as much now as I did then. And that watch -- hold up stud. Some sweet digital action on that thing. Who needs hands to tell you time when LIQUID CRYSTALS can do it so much better...

Yes, sure, we all had our awkward years. But as I get older (same age as you actually) I look back on this shit and realize how great it was. 6th grade is the first time you were finally the big cheese (unless you went to one of those heathen K-8 schools instead of K-6). Sure, the glasses stylistically leave a bit to be desired by today's standards. Sure, the haircut maybe not the euro-trash soccer player look we so covet today. But looking at this pic, you were the kind of kid *I* coulda been best friends with.

It's extremely atmospheric! Everyone lines the edges of the streets and waits for the procession to start. You will know when it starts though because a large feature of the procession is the drums. Each parish gets youngsters and trains them for the year with the drums, the main drums are about 1m in diameter. These drums are extremely loud and you can hear them from great distances. The people who play these drums have to beat them extremely hard and often their hands will bleed. On the drums there are stains of blood. Each and every one of them. (The large drums that is, just to clarify)
When the procession passes the ground will vibrate under your feet, it's quite the experience!

The fact that it's snowing even limits the overall contrast, coupled with the fact that the exposed ground is the same color as the damn trees leaves only one thing left to attempt to focus on (bride and groom).

Those tiny 'betta bowls' and 'betta kits' are 1) the equivalent of locking a German Shepard inside a tiny cold closet for the entirety of its natural life, and 2) a way for big business to keep you shelling out your hard-earned cash for 'cheap' bettas and tanks, since putting a betta in a tiny unfiltered tank reduces its lifespan greatly. They are counting on you not doing the research and just buying new fish every time your old one dies. 

But I have faith in you, Reddit. I know you are not lazy, stupid, and inhumane. If you would really like a betta fish (and you should, they are wonderful pets when treated properly), do an hour of research and invest in a nice setup. Bettas in heated, filtered, well-maintained tanks usually live 3-5 years, and they are fun little fish to have.

"connecticutlet","","","I came into contact with a 1700 Ohm ballast resistor that was live at a potential of 4500 Volts DC. After doing some math, I calculated that approximately 2 Amps of current passed through me over about a second or two. If you factor in the time, around 10,000 Joules of energy were transferred (approximately 30 times the energy of a shock from a defibrillator). The current most likely passed through my heart as it went from hand to hand. 

I was knocked away from the live line and was conscious at the time of the shock. I distinctly remember having the thought ""I just electrocuted myself."" After that I passed out, and was out for about 30 seconds before I came to. Bystanders told me that my breathing was very irregular before stopping for a few seconds, and I looked as if I was dead. 

I was transported to a local hospital and was treated and released a few hours later with minor burns to my hands and no evidence of cardiac damage. 

After doing some research this week, I learned that if the heart is exposed to 2 Amps of current, cardiac arrest is very possible and death is likely. I am convinced (based on what I felt and how bystanders described my appearance) that my heart stopped in between my passing out and waking up, and was able to re-start again on its own.

I had my (very expensive) sound mixer out in the lounge while they were over, and the toddler decided to have a fiddle with all the fancy knobs and buttons. I should also mention this toddler was mid-biscuit, so there were crumbs and snot and drool abound.

After a few moments, I realised mother-dearest would not be dealing with this issue, so I took it upon myself to bring it to her attention:

""Um, would you mind stopping your daughter from covering my mixer in biscuit? It's very expensive...""

""Yeah? Well my daughter is more expensive!""

""That's undeniably true, but my mixer is hardly going to fuck her up, now is it?""

The only way I managed to save it was by getting up and removing the mixer from the room, because mother-dearest couldn't be arsed to spend five seconds re-focusing her kid on something else so as to prevent damage to someone else's property.

The pressure and blackness closed in fast, and my failing heart couldn't pump enough blood through my limbs to swim. My bloated husk would resurface in the next day or two. It would rot and stink and cause children to cry. The Angels don't drag you to heaven. They don't have to. If you saw it you'd understand. They merely show you the path. When you see the splendor- the beauty- you realize the simplicity of your life and all of the relationships in it. Your passions and your hatreds fall seem so trivial. I wish I could say what lead me to turn away was the power of my will, or that my strength of being allowed me to wrench myself away from that which billions of others could not refuse. But in truth, it was pettiness. The ghosts that return to earth are those who could not give up their petulant quibbles with other earthlings despite being presented with the greatest gift that God himself offered unto man. The gift that millions spent their lives seeking: eternity in his living embrace. Perhaps that's why the ghosts in the old stories always seem so upset. I crawled away from those Angels, back toward the inky blackness. They gave me a robe and a lantern to light my way. Those angels. It's true what they say about them. Wonderful beings. Beautiful in every way. I on the other hand- I was horrid. My face was stained with the blackness of the void from whence I came. I crawled upwards, and I found my arms passed through the concrete of the dock as though it were air. As I held aloft the lantern I gazed back upon the world of the living- That world of petulant children and their silly quibbles and hatreds and loves. It looked like a kindergarten playground. The children ran about constructing trifling alliances grudges they believed to be of enormous importance. I didn't care, I belonged here, at least for a while longer.

"translatesarabic","","","Hello, I don't usually comment here but I just had to after seeing this photo. The building behind the cello player is a restaurant called 'Mr Potato' in the Al-Mansour district of Baghdad. I distinctly remember talking to my aunt (who lives in Baghdad) months and months ago and her mentioning eating her lunch at this restaurant. The place specialises in (who'd have thought) potato dishes- particularly from abroad. Things such as gratin and jacket potatoes and foods alien to the people of Iraq during the sanctions in Saddam's time. Places like this cropped up all over the city after Saddam left, I distinctly remember eating in a French-themed restaurant called 'Chef City' in Karrada when I was there a few years back. Restaurants aren't the only new thing. Malls began to open in Baghdad and Iraq, better gyms, better libraries, renovated parks and zoos and gardens.

To many people, these restaurants and malls are just restaurants and malls. Places to eat and meet with friends. To me they are so much more. They represent something more beautiful and more incredible than anything I have seen anywhere in the world. The incredible power of the human spirit in the darkest of times.

I say a lot of things to my English friends that they may see me as insane for. Chief among these is a statement I have made on the city of Baghdad. I have stated and will continue to state, that Baghdad is the most beautiful city I have ever had the pleasure of visiting and (for a short while albeit) living in. 

When I first went, I expected to see disrepair and chaos. I expected to see a fearful oppressed people. I expected empty streets bar military checkpoints and armoured vehicles. Yes there were lots of military checkpoints and armoured vehicles. Yes there were regions of disrepair and chaos. But there was more to this great city of cities.

I saw Baghdad's people. Her youth out in the streets looking for a good time. Teenage boys playing football on a street that had been bombed the week before. Young girls with dyed hair and make-up leaving big universities giggling with each other as they went to buy ice cream. Families walking together in Baghdad's many parks. Friends sat together in coffee shops smoking. There were men and women, cleaning dirty streets, planting flowers in the parks, building new houses and apartment blocks. I saw a people above fear, above the influence of terror. I saw a people who refused to let the bombs control their lives as no doubt the perpetrators of the attacks would have wanted. I saw a unique and beautiful strength in Baghdad's kind and welcoming people.  These were a people besieged by constant threat of attack. No inch of Baghdad is safe in any sense of the word, but they didn't let that control them. They were defiant and strong, willing not to give up hope for a new and better future.

In fact I would go so far as to say that, in its own way, Baghdad has beaten terrorism. The objective of terrorism is to sway public and political opinion to accommodate the views of the perpetrators and it has done the exact opposite to the people of Iraq. Baghdadi Christians still go to Church every Sunday, despite that groups such as IS would have their heads for it. Young women still wear make up and go out without wearing hijab despite that the same groups would stone them to death for doing so. In their own way, I believe the people of Baghdad have beaten terrorism.

This is why there is no doubt in my heart that the people of Iraq, whether Kurd or Arab, whether Sunni or Shi'ite, whether Christian or Sabian or Azadi or Shabaki or one of other thousand religious and racial groups living upon its soil; will come out on top of these crises. Whether in a day, a decade or a century, these continually suffering people will eventually be victorious.

EDIT: Thank you so much for the gold! If you want to support the people who own the restaurant with a kind facebook message telling them that our hearts are with them, this is their facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Mr-Potato/208778729203491

If this [little guy](http://i.imgur.com/ly0ZeSL.jpg) ever pops up in any of those other photographs, will you shoot me a DM? He passed away two years ago, but we still have hope that we'll find some of his ""films"", as he called them, that he handed off to his buddies.

Thanks so much for sharing these.

EDIT: His ""films"" were what he called his 35mm rolls. He would use them til he had a few shots left, and then hand them off to a buddy to finish. He always worried that if he was killed, his family wouldn't get to see any of the photos. So he made sure lots of his friends had some of his shots.

Dogs never die. They don’t know how to. They get tired, and very old, and their bones hurt. Of course they don’t die. If they did they would not want to always go for a walk, even long after their old bones say:” No, no, not a good idea. Let’s not go for a walk.” Nope, dogs always want to go for a walk. They might get one step before their aging tendons collapse them into a heap on the floor, but that’s what dogs are. They walk.

It’s not that they dislike your company. On the contrary, a walk with you is all there is. Their boss, and the cacaphonic symphony of odor that the world is. Cat poop, another dog’s mark, a rotting chicken bone ( exultation), and you. That’s what makes their world perfect, and in a perfect world death has no place.

However, dogs get very very sleepy. That’s the thing, you see. They don’t teach you that at the fancy university where they explain about quarks, gluons, and Keynesian economics. They know so much they forget that dogs never die. It’s a shame, really. Dogs have so much to offer and people just talk a lot.

When you think your dog has died, it has just fallen asleep in your heart. And by the way, it is wagging it’s tail madly, you see, and that’s why your chest hurts so much and you cry all the time. Who would not cry with a happy dog wagging its tail in their chest. Ouch! Wap wap wap wap wap, that hurts. But they only wag when they wake up. That’s when they say: “Thanks Boss! Thanks for a warm place to sleep and always next to your heart, the best place.”

When they first fall asleep, they wake up all the time, and that’s why, of course, you cry all the time. Wap, wap, wap. After a while they sleep more. (remember, a dog while is not a human while. You take your dog for walk, it’s a day full of adventure in an hour. Then you come home and it’s a week, well one of your days, but a week, really, before the dog gets another walk. No WONDER they love walks.)

Anyway, like I was saying, they fall asleep in your heart, and when they wake up, they wag their tail. After a few dog years, they sleep for longer naps, and you would too. They were a GOOD DOG all their life, and you both know it. It gets tiring being a good dog all the time, particularly when you get old and your bones hurt and you fall on your face and don’t want to go outside to pee when it is raining but do anyway, because you are a good dog. So understand, after they have been sleeping in your heart, they will sleep longer and longer.

But don’t get fooled. They are not “dead.” There’s no such thing, really. They are sleeping in your heart, and they will wake up, usually when you’re not expecting it. It’s just who they are.

"mandarin_duckling","","","When I was little, my father would take me to book stores every weekend. I'm Indonesian and back then English language wasn't that well spoken and books written in English were crazy expensive. We weren't rich, but my father would encourage me to pick all the English books. I would grab piles of books,  thinking I would select one final book from those piles. But he would just say 'Is that all? Anything else?' So we ended up going home with piles of expensive English books. He would set limits on what to spend on food, toys, etc, but never books. 

Having learned English on my own from those books, I managed pretty well. I got a scholarship to study Master abroad in Netherlands and now starting PhD in Denmark. I never thought I'd make it anywhere out of my country and always felt insecure about my formal educational background as I know it's nothing compared to first world education. But remembering those weekend afternoons in the book stores with my dad, it convinces me that informal education can really bring you to great heights. 

I hope your daughter enjoys those books. Her face reminded me of how I felt in those book stores. The memories, the resulting love of reading, and where it can take her are priceless.

Contributing to the aircraft entering the stall was a 300 pound bear/dog that decided to sit at the farthest aft station during rotation. The CG shift aft created a nose high attitude, and the resultant stall/spin was unrecoverable at the low altitude. The bear/dog walked away from the accident site, dragging the remains of the pilot.

"ewweaver","","","Why are the estimations all over the place? Use the same reference point for figuring out the distance. And how can he be so specific without measuring anything? Or are we missing some of it?

- White lines on the road are 10 feet
- The shadow of the (tree?) draws a line on the road that ends nearly 1/2 white line length (somewhere between 2-5 feet)
- Front wheel of the car begins approximately 1 white line length from the beginning of the next white line
- Front wheel of the car ends *past* the shadow on the road

That puts 22 feet at the lower end of the estimate. Somewhere around 24 feet would be a more sensible estimate. That gives you 60 feet per second which is 40.9mph.

More importantly the time of 0.4 seconds is only an approximation based on the 2 images. The first image could easily be 12:49:06.85 and the second 12:49:07.2 making the time 0.35 instead of 0.4. That would make the speed 46.75mph. Which is pretty close to what the camera clocked.

You can't round the speed off to 1/10th of a second when you are dealing with such a small amount of time and you can't use such arbitrary estimations of distance.

Not to mention the trig at the bottom is pointless and wrong. None of us know at what angle the radar was or what its working angle is. The diagram doesn't demonstrate any way that changing lanes could make you appear faster than you actually are.

The constant grammar mistakes really don't help either.

**TL;DR** Based on the 2 images 47mph is completely reasonable and almost certainly the actual speed.

**Cheesecake Stuffed Strawberries**

*YIELD:* Makes 16-20 stuffed strawberries

*INGREDIENTS:*

1 lb. fresh strawberries, rinsed and pat dry

8 oz. cream cheese, softened

1/2 cup powdered sugar

1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Graham cracker crumbs, optional

*DIRECTIONS:*
With a paring knife, cut off the strawberry stems. Cut around the inside of the strawberry, hollowing out slightly and creating a well for the cheesecake. (You can also do this with a small melon baller). Cut off a small portion of the pointy strawberry tip, so that each strawberry can stand. Place each on a large baking sheet.

In a medium bowl, with a standing or handheld electric mixer, beat cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla until fluffy, about 2 minutes on medium speed. Place mixture in a pastry bag and pipe into each strawberry, adding a little extra to the top. Refrigerate until thoroughly chilled.

Optionally, sprinkle graham cracker crumbs on top of each stuffed strawberry.

"icwangtw","","","The flight was GE235 of TransAsia Airways from Taipei Songshan airport in Taiwan to the outlying island of Kinmen operated by an ATR 72-600 (B-22816) that was delivered last April. The crash occurred a few minutes after takeoff with the plane ditching into Keelung River which flows through the city, an engine flameout was speculated to be the reason. Weather conditions were normal at the time. Since the river is not under normal flight path it seems that the pilot was trying to attempt an emergency landing and to avoid causing serious damage to the buildings. 

Rescuers said that the cabin was flooded to chest height and has a strong smell of gasoline. Many passengers were still in their seats with their seatbelt fastened and unable to escape. Most passengers that are unaccounted for are located at the front of the aircraft which is submerged under the river. Some are also feared to have been thrown out of the cabin when the plane crashed. It's rumoured that a few bodies have floated downstream.

There are 53 passengers including 2 infants and 5 crew members on board. 12 people are still missing while 31 deaths are confirmed and the black box has been found as of 2030 UTC. 31 of the passengers are Chinese. This route is quite popular with Chinese tour groups since there is a ferry service that connects Kinmen to Xiamen which is a low cost alternative for them to visit Taiwan rather than taking the direct flights.

This is the second crash of TransAsia Airways in the past 12 months with another ATR 72 crashing during approach under horrible weather conditions last July. The government has now ordered all 22 ATR 72 aircrafts operated by both TransAsia Airways and UNI Air to be grounded for further inspection. If the aircrafts are grounded for the next few weeks it might cause some serious trouble to people going home for Chinese New Year that is coming up very soon. 

Local newspaper has reported that the aircraft that crashed suffered engine problems during its delivery flight less than a year ago from France and was diverted to Macau to replace an engine. A third-party certification agency has recommended the airline to not the take the delivery of the plane but the suggestion was rejected. The unnamed pilot that was interviewed claims that there are problems with the certification process done by ATR.

"lazarus870","","","That's a Winchester 1873.  That`s the so-called ""gun that won the west"" and was a super quick cycling rifle due to the toggle-link design.  It had a neat little cover on the top that you could slide over the action to protect it from rain and snow.

That's the gun that's **supposed** to be used in Westerns, the one that would be period correct.  However, in most westerns, including John Wayne movies, the anachronistic Winchester 1892 was used instead, due to availability and I guess it looked more pleasing.  

I'm betting that one is chambered in .44-40.  The gun design was replaced by the 1892 (in you guessed it, 1892) by gun inventor John Moses Browning.  The 1892 never could cycle as fast as the 1873 but it was much stronger with two giant steel lugs that locked into the receiver.  

I have two modern reproduction 1892 rifles in .44 magnum.  Today there are 1873 replicas (made by Uberti in Italy and Miroku of Japan licensed by Winchester).  Compared to other lever guns, they're not strong due to the toggle-link design not having very positive lock-up.  But they're quick so they're used with great success in cowboy-action shooting.

"PuffyHerb","","","&gt;First, what was with that elephant tail? Donald Jr. told me that TMZ didn’t report that **Africans traditionally cut off the tail and make bracelets from the tail hair as a sign of respect for the fallen animal**. And they didn’t report that **elephants are over-populated in the area** the Trumps hunted and so need to be hunted to prevent them from further destroying their habitat.

&gt;Next, Donald Jr. points out, the leopard they hunted in Zimbabwe was not endangered, and they didn’t hunt any of the animals in an unethical way.

&gt;As for the legality of the hunt, the Director-General of the Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority, V. Chadenga, published a letter on March 27 in which **he called the charges against the Trump’s “baseless”** and said, “Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump hunted legally during their visit to Zimbabwe.” He also noted there was never an “investigation” of the Trump’s hunt and that they hunted with a “registered outfitter” and were **accompanied by “game rangers.**",1431041205,"","1431041456",1,1364,"pics"

"ChrisBenRoy","","","A little backstory: My father passed away from Liver/Lung cancer in 1999 after battling it for a year and a half. After so much chemo and medication, he just couldn't take that quality of life anymore and realized it was his time to go. I assume at that point he bought cards for my brother and I's milestone birthdays. It caught me totally off guard and made me so very happy. It felt like he was still there, holding something I'd never seen before that he touched, and signed himself, it was if he had just done it yesterday.",1431456480,"","False",3,4740,"pics"

The gulf spill was an absolute tragedy. But do you know a crazy fact? The amount that spilled into the gulf is roughly the same amount of oil that the US consumes in 6 hours on a daily basis.

Corporations need to be held responsible for their actions and accidents. And we need to sort out our addiction to oil. Things like this should not happen, but our constant and growing demand for oil is what is causing corporations like BP to have to drill deeper and deeper. Cut off the demand and the production will slow down, and accidents like this will be less likely to happen again. It is absolutely the job of the corporations to prevent things like this happening. But we as citizens have a responsibility to decrease the demand so it's not worth companies like BP drilling in such dangerous places with such fragile eco-systems in the first place.
