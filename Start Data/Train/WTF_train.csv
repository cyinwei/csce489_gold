I recommend, if you're open to it, and when you're ready, to see a grief counselor.  And talk.. Even if it's a repetition of things you've already said, and even if it's not to a counselor, to boot. That seems to help.

Next month will mark a year since my mother (and last surviving parent) died unexpectedly. I never thought it would be like this, or so soon (both parents just over 60 at their deaths), or even that time would pass by so quickly. 

I wish I could take all of my own advice, because things still feel shitty. Time softens the edges, but maybe not fast enough for me.  

My outlook on life is different these days. I feel like I put more time into what is personally meaningful, and cut out the bullshit - from both myself and others.  I am trying to enjoy what I can, and not sweat the small stuff - honestly, so much pales in comparison, and I've realized how mundane, petty, and trite certain things can be (and fuck *that*).

"Danbob6","","","I used to work at the Jobcentre here in the UK. One of the many roles I had during my time there was a crisis loan officer. This essentially is where people have had benefits but either lost or spent them before their next lot was due, we could give them some of next times. Really not good economics but you legally can't let someone go hungry. The biggest reason was that they'd simply spent it on drugs so it made me very jaded. 

One day I took a call from a happy sounding guy. This was weird because most people who came through were either genuinely at the end of their tether or had a sob story ready to try and get money from you for more drugs. I asked what his need was and he said that he'd spent all of his benefit. I had a big check list of things to ask him. The first and most obvious being what had he spent it all on so soon. He told me he'd been to the local pound shop where they were selling copies of Jaws on DVD for £1. Seeing an opportunity he had bought as many copies as he could afford - 191. 

191 copies of Jaws. I asked him how it was going. He said he hadn't sold a single one. He was now hungry and had no money for food. We had to give him something so we issued £10 so he could go and get some tins etc. Of course in these situations we had to take whatever evidence they had to justify the loan. I asked him if he could take the DVDs to our counter which was downstairs in the building I was in. Sure enough ten minutes later I get a call from downstairs telling me that he had brought in ""a shitload"" of Jaw's DVDs. I authorised the payment and asked them to put him on so I could go through the standard terms of the loan etc. We finished up and I asked if there was anything else I could do for him today.

Oh god, the smell :C I cleaned up all the puke I could get to, he's been drinking bloody mudslides, kitchen stank of manshit and baileys.

Paramedic came in and managed to get Dad awake, Dad swiped at him and told him to ""fuck off out of my house you cunt"", then apologised after he realised the guy was a paramedic, thanking him for doing a good job. No hospital for Dad tonight. Paramedic can't(or won't) help me move him though, fuck. Stayed up all night making sure Dad didn't roll over and choke on vomit. Yay New Years.

"CrappyInternetGuy","","","A few things I noticed as an employee of an Electric Cooperative.. that was a 1 in a million deal right there.  The line fell ON the cows.  I've seen cows killed by a fallen line that didn't blow a line fuse but never one that fell on top of animals....That line is no more than 7200 volts which is way plenty to kill pretty much anything but the bells on the pole is 7.2kV framing.  Also, just judging by the look of the pole top that was a VERY old pole that should have been replaced several years ago.  Not knowing where this pic was taken I'd say that this pole was set in the late 60s, maybe early 70s at the latest.  It also has a transformer on it to step the voltage down to 120/240 phase-ground/phase-phase as well as service attachments that lead me to believe that this pole had open wire secondary attached rather than the (now) typical aluminum triplex.  Also, it used to be a deadend pole that had a new tap built off of it at some point....The wire on one side looks like #4ACSR, the wire on the other side (where the cows are) appears to be #6 amerductor which where I work hasn't been used since the mid 70s.  The top wire is the energized conductor, the bottom is the system neutral.  Luckily for your dad he took this picture after crews had already arrived on scene and grounded the line (the jumper going between the primary and neutral with the red flag).   I see liveoak trees in the background to the left....Where in Texas are you?  
Lastly, as I have seen in my 20 years in my electric cooperative that looks like about $60,000 worth of cows....Yeah to you they're just cows on property used for ag exemption, but it's amazing how no-count cattle become amazingly awesome breeding specimen who have won countless awards as show cows when they are killed by a power line.

US circumcision has its rootes in the super-Christian victorian days of the 19th century where people like John Kellog touted the genital mutilation of boys and men to stop the ""horrible"" illnesses of masturbation and fornication. It was widely thought it would make sex less pleasurable and thus encourage their ideal of holy chastity.   Curious that Muslims today do a very similar procedure, for the EXACT same reasons today and we call it barbaric.  

And then at the same time that they thought the bumps on your head legitimate gave insight int your health, and the electro-shock butt plugs could cure anything but a lack of kinkiness, they claimed it would reduce the spread of VD's.   

Modern medicine has shown there is little no significant risk of disease or legitimate reason to preform circumcision for health.   There is a very small reduction in the transmission of HIV, but its nothing compared to the protection a good condom provides.  Bascially in the 2000's there is no compelling reason to preform widespread circumcision automatically at birth other than tradition.  

Then it became tradition, pushed by a small number of doctors on infants with no respect to their rights.   Apparently parents are allowed to tell doctors to lop any ol' part off their kids at infancy with no respect to the rights of the child.   

Granted male circumcision is nowhere near as brutal or debilitating as female circumcision.   That still doesn't make it ok though.  The issue at point is that its done often at the moment of birth, and yes it has on occasion destroyed the penises of baby boys.   Any surgery or body mod should be done under informed consent.  

Personally I don't care if you wanna get cut.  By all means.   But it should be illegal to circumcise anybody under 18 who doesn't give informed consent themselves to undergo the procedure.  I can't fault my parents because they didn't know any better, but I now wish I hadn't been myself.  ",1427223420,"","1427223682",1,108,"WTF"

Turtles are resilient suckers, so he may still have hope.  I defer to the plant people to identify the pond plants, but I would doubt rooting in tissue is something plants typically do.

Turtle shell repairs are relatively common in the rescue world.  Unfortunately, what works as a great protection against many predators does not protect against cars, falling structures, and really determined beasties.  Turtles have very slow metabolisms, so healing time is extended.  ""While a fractured bone in a mammal can heal in six to eight weeks, a fractured shell in a turtle can take years to completely heal"" (http://vet.tufts.edu/wildlife/Interesting_cases.html) depending on the size.  In some cases, the shell may never regain structural integrity, and captive life is likely the only response.  That said, turtles survive pretty gruesome injury (see the above source), including breaks that open the body cavity (http://www.kawarthanow.com/kawarthanowguide/2014/06/02/kawartha-turtle-trauma-centre/).  Sometimes they even have to be opened to unbind eggs that get stuck and can kill them.

One reason for this horror is their slow metabolism - turtles don't require a ton of oxygen.  They overwinter underwater!  Also, the lung space get's eaten up by limbs and neck when they cram into their shell - cannot actually breath like this(http://jeb.biologists.org/content/206/19/3391/F1.large.jpg) - partly because of space and partly because they have no diaphram - they need to move their arms to breathe.  They can also absorb oxygen through their skin (mostly their butt and mouth) allowing them to sustain serious injury to the lungs.  Much of this cavity seen was occupied by lung (http://fc04.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2010/288/4/0/turtle_anatomy_by_elizabethnixon-d30swu6.jpg and http://static.trunity.net/files/124101_124200/124155/200px-Turtleresp.gif).  Likely collapsed.  They cannot be very active without breathing through their lungs (which requires arm movement), and usually do best in water to tranfer oxygen through their skin.  I think this explains the plants in the body.

Ok, so what does all this mean for this unfortunate turtle?  It means he definitely needs to see a vet, and one that wants to learn.  This is a special case and will take some creativity.  I imagine step one would be pain med (injected), and cleaning.  Then assessment of lung damage - is the other one ok?  Is this one collapsed or punctured?  Reptile lungs are sac-like (not spongey like ours) - so its hard to tell.  After clean up and assessment/treatment for whatever found, the shell has to be patched, which is routine (http://www.tortoise.org/general/shelinj.html).  Then antibiotics and some serious convolescence.  Only a vet can determine if putting him out of his misery is the right course of action.  I personally think its worth trying to save him - but I'm not a vet.

I'd recommend putting him a tupperware bin with a low level of some cool water (hot holds less oxygen and would increase his metabolism and movement).  This will rehydrate him and allow him to absorb some oxygen.  Make it dark if possible, so he has some privacy and lowers his stress.  Take him to a vet - call the state vet college and get a recommendation of where.  Not any vet will be able to handle this case.  He needs to be out of the wild - something will eat him and not so pleasantly.  Hope this helps.

Also, cooter is the actual name of the turtle - its also a common term in the south for turtles, as dirty as it sounds ^_^.

When he was really young (6-8 or something) his mother no longer had enough to feed him and all his siblings, so she gave him up for adoption in hopes that they would get fed better. 

After a few weeks though a neighbour of theirs secretly gave them a cow, and they were able to keep it in the house and bring it grass from the outside. This way no one knew they had a cow and would not kill them for it. 

Once the cow started to produce milk she decided she could go and grab my grandpa back from the orphanage, but when she went there they just told her he was dead. She demanded to see the body and they took her to the gymnasium that just had a pile of naked corpses in it, one of them was my grandpa. 

when she found him he was still breathing however so she took him home and he got better. 

He also told me stories about how he was chased at night by people wanting to eat him when he visited a neighbouring village. 

Later when my grandpa went to war he came back to every one in his family dead, and his house that he had lived in just a bunch of tank tracks in the ground. 

SURPRISINGLY!!! 

my grandpa was a very kind and good individual and became fairly successful, he had a bunch of kids and they had a bunch of kids and he only passed away a few years ago.

This is a picture of him before he died: http://imgur.com/zwF8Mhd

When my grandfather came back from the war he met my grandma at a train station, he kind of lied to her a bit about where he was headed (because he had recently found out he had no where to go) and told her he had a house in Rostov (the closest big city) she ended up coming out there to visit him and he at the time lived in a horrible apartment. He was emberaced by it and his lie so when they met at the train station he just carried her bags around as he showed her the whole city. Never inviting her home to his house until finally it was really late. She was horrified at first by his living conditions and that he lied to her but then he told her the full story and she decided to stay, and then they got married. They stayed married for almost 50 years until he passed away.

I was doing some garden work at my nans house, it was a hot day and nan was being nan providing me with cold fresh beverages. She came out with a weird drink that tasted like medicine it was fizzy and kinda gross but I downed that shit cause I was thirsty. Finish up things in the garden and head off home. I get in the car and feel a little stomach rumble, meh it's only 20 min car ride I can hold it. 

Yeh..no. 10 mins in I hit traffic and the cramps intensify. They come in waves each cramp is worse than the next. I'd been in situations where I needed to shit in the car before but always managed to hold it until I got home, this was different. I finally got out of traffic and found the nearest street and pulled over. I admit I was freaking out, I desperately searched the car and pulled out a cooking pot from under the seat (theres this gate that has a magnetic strip that you can swipe the pot over to open it up). 

I position myself in the back seat and relieve myself. I see a childrens park across the road from where I parked, there was surely a toilet there but it was too late. I looked down at the steaming pot of shit and gagged. I found a pair of socks and wiped my ass, not very well though they were only ankle socks. 

I was very ashamed in myself, I did a quick drive by shitting by opening the door and throwing the pot of shit out onto the road. It was a hot day. 

Obviously I took a photo and sent it to my friend and told him the story before I got rid of it. This was a mistake. 

A few days later I was in the car with my gf, she looked around the car and asked where her favourite pink socks were. I told her I didn't know what she was talking about. Later that night she was on my phone and found the message I had sent to my friend along with photo evidence.

&gt;This afternoon around 3:30, there was a severe accident north of Jiaxing Haining city Biyun bridge.  A construction truck crashed into a small white sedan during a left turn, and flipped on its side crushing the car leading to the deaths of the two men inside the car.

&gt; **Crushing the sedan**

&gt;Witness Mr. Cai told ZheJiang Online reporter that when he got to the scene, the accident had already occurred.  The sedan was completely crushed under the truck, and the dirt from the truck completely buried the sedan.

&gt; Mr. Cai gave us some footage from the accident.  In the footage, right before the accident, the truck was traveling from south to north through the intersection, and the sedan was turning left from south to the east.  The two vehicles collided in the middle of the intersection and the sedan was crushed in the process.

&gt; **The two men on the car both died**

&gt; ""At the time, the truck was going pretty fast, so after jerking the steering wheel it fell onto its side.  I heard the sedan was just purchased from the 4s dealer (car dealership), but none of us would have thought this would happen right after they drove it out from the dealership.  Recently, the old city is being renovated, so there are a lot of construction vehicles around, and when they enter the city they're going pretty fast from the bridge.  It's quite dangerous"", says Mr. Cai (the witness).

&gt; After the accident, HaiNing Fire Dept. hurried to the scene.  According to the Dept. , after cleaning off the dirt, they found two male corpses.  Both were from JianXi.

&gt; **Footage shows neither vehicle was disobeying the traffic light**

&gt; From the footage Mr. Cai provided us, the light at the intersection was flashing green (means it will turn yellow very soon).  According to traffic laws, neither car was running a redlight.  But under normal conditions, the sedan should have yielded to the truck, but as for the actual reason of the accident, more investigation is needed.

And presumably Mr. Cai is the security guard that was watching the cctv

Suddenly, she sprung to life and climbed through the pinching doors, which pulled down her jeans. I guess she figured ""Well I'm halfway there, Tabernac!"" because she just squatted down and started peeing right there in the front of the train car. She stood, pants still on her ankles, and screamed as we took off.
 
While she shuffled around angrily a beautiful thing happened. Strangers, looked at each other, silently motioning warnings as the pee moved up the aisle. Spreading just a few seats before the icky river, the human spirit showed itself in nods and pokes and nudges and gestures. No one wanted to alert her to their unique presence so this was a subtle game. Feet and purses where silently lifted and as we pulled into Guy-Concordia a communal sense of relief was felt. We had been the perfect faceless crowd and yet spared each other from urine soaked shoes. 

Before having to choose if I should get off or not, two burly STM cops came and wrestled her out. So I stayed in my seat, and warned a new passenger of the source of our small stream.

"mycroftxxx42","","","Family Story Time:

There used to be an airforce base in Houston, Texas - Ellington Field.  It's used by NASA now, I think, but in the 60's it was active in the southeast part of the city.  

Pasadena, Texas, is a suburb of Houston on it's east side, and was mostly strawberry fields at this time (It's now mostly poor and refinery now).  The flight path for airforce craft had them avoiding the small residential area of Pasadena and flying over these fields.  From wherever they were coming from, this was a notable detour and not every pilot bothered.

This irked my 9-year-old father to no end.   One particular craft, the Fairchild C-119 ""Flying Boxcar"" was apparently in common use of the time and the pilot used to fly these prop driven aircraft at exceptionally low altitudes occasionally dipping below twenty feet.  The noise, as you might imagine, was rather extreme.

One day, my father was playing in the back yard with his older brother's bow and arrow.  A c-119 flies slowly over his neighborhood and in a fit of pique, my father raises the bow and shoots at it.  

Imagine his shock when the arrow not only hits, but penetrates the wing and sticks!  After being scared for the rest of the afternoon - fearing not only the government, but an older brother's wrath at losing ANOTHER arrow - my father mostly calms down and forgets about the incident over the next week or so.

A bit over a month later, an airforce vehicle parked itself in front of my grandparents' home and two men stepped out to stand guard while an airforce officer came up and knocked on their door.  My grandmother answered and he asked for my grandfather by name.  Shocked, since she assumed that a family friend who had been using their address while deployed in vietnam had died, she left the officer on the porch and got my grandfather.

Eventually the officer is shown inside and surprises everyone when he asks about my father, who is still nine years old.  My grandfather steps outside and whistles for my dad, who comes inside just as the officer is opening his briefcase to reveal... an arrow.

Apparently my fathers first thoughts  were, after ""CRAP!"", wondering how much a C-119 cost, and how long it would take him to pay one off at his allowance.   The officer asked him if he fired this arrow at a plane and when he shamefacedly concedes that he did, proceeds to tell my grandfather the story.

The pilot was very surprised when a civilian shot his aircraft, and expressed that surprise vocally.  Unfortunately, the cursing and exclamation of ""the little bastard shot me with an arrow"" went out over a live microphone back to the base.  Apparently, the pilot's commanding officer was waiting on the side of the runway when he got the plane down to verify that there was an arrow sticking out of the plane, and additionally cite the pilot for conduct unbecoming an officer, deviating from a flight plan, endangering civilians, and whatever other charges he could get out between laughing at this poor schmuck.  The details of the charges weren't ever really made clear to my dad, unfortunately.

At that point, my grandfather had to do some of the best acting of his life to date not to let on how amused he was at the situation and secretly proud of my father he was.  He was very stern with my dad and nodded along with the officer when he told my father that he was not allowed to shoot at US aircraft any more, and that they would be avoiding his house in the future.

My grandfather did ask for the arrow, but was told that it was going to be used as evidence.  While no details are known as to the arrow's eventual fate, it's assumed that it was kept around as a memento and story-prompt by someone, probably the officer.

One day my dad bought some nice, one gray the other white. He ate the white one no problem but was kind of running away from the Gray. I fell asleep watching and waiting and the next morning, I woke up and started crying. I saw the gray bastard standing on my snakes back and eating him as my snake casually strolls about the cage. A puddle of blood on his back next to his spine. Id say maybe a quarter inch deep. I took the mouse and threw him outside out of rage (I was 13 and stupid I guess). My snake ended up being fine. I didn't have enough money for the vet. So I thought about my options.. Do I cut his head off? Put him out of his misery? I couldn't do that.. So I was selfish and I picked him up. Walked to the bathroom and soaked up the blood with gauze. Then I grabbed some hydrogen peroxide and just poured. . I felt my snake tighten up on my arm and hiss in pain. I felt so bad. I stopped putting and saw it bubble up. I waited and grabbed some neosporin and covered the hole. I noticed my snake had called down. So I started doing it two times a day. I would cover it with a cut up bandaid and then let it breathe a little every day. He's fine now, about 12 years old and strong. He's got a badass scar too. So I guess happy ending.

"iia","","","Somewhere there's a guy with a fetish for this kind of thing. He dreams every night about finding a pretty woman with such an infestation. When he's in bed, he imagines their romantic encounter. 

She'd bend over for him, the tips of the worms barely visible from inside her pink asshole. She would have shaven for this date; she’d want to be in pristine condition. He’d gaze upon his fetish and immediately latch his mouth against her waiting opening. He wouldn’t suck yet. He’d teasingly flick the tip of his tongue around the rim and have it dance across the still-submerged worms. 

Then, he’d apply soft suction. The worms would start to breach from the depths and enter his mouth. They’d wriggle against his tongue and he’d wriggle it right back at them. Once they had birthed about an inch or two into his mouth, he’d carefully press down with his teeth and pinch them. Then he’d pull. They’d slide out of her without much resistance, and when they were out, she would remain open for him. Dialated. 

He’d slurp the worms into his mouth and chew them vigorously, enjoying the juicy pop of their bodies as they burst against his tongue and palate. Still bent over, he'd  see how aroused she’d become, and she’d started to softly masturbate. He'd watch, still chewing.

When ready, he’d move up her body and meet her lips with his. They’d pass the worm pulp back and forth between their mouths as they would fondle one another to orgasm. Having split the pulp equally, they’d swallow - finally content..",1425405371,"","False",1,266,"WTF"

I mean, it's wonderfully and convincingly sculpted, but you're all believing it's real because you think it proves some point about catholicism or whatever.
