"ChagataiChinua","","","FYI, people have been using ""axe"" as word meaning the same thing as ""ask"" for more than a thousand years. Chaucer does it. Shakespeare does it. The roots of the ""axe"" form in Old English were *acsian*, *axian*. This was the literary form in English until the almost the 17th century.

As you are no doubt aware, the mainstream dialect of English in the United States is a branch from British English that does not contain many of the changes from after their divergence; the reverse is also true of course. Well, African-American Vernacular English is also a dialectical branch, one that is likely the descendant of a pidgin of English and African languages that evolved in the context of slave ships, slave markets, and slave workplaces. Not surprisingly, given the forces keeping the language communities separate, these two dialects have evolved separately. 

So while I understand your unconscious bias against her speech as ""wrong"", it's really not more wrong than if she said ""pop"" instead of ""soda"" or ""fan-freaking-tastic"" even though you can't actually insert an intensifier in the middle of a word according to standard grammar. In fact, she's correctly speaking in a long-established English dialect, and the specific speech element you reference simply vanished from the dialect you speak a few hundred years ago. but remained in hers.

I *was* painfully self conscious though.  Try to understand the mindset of a fat person in the gym:  We know everything we are doing looks pretty pathetic.  It is also an admission to you and everybody around us that we are fat (which is a surprisingly tough leap for a fat person to make:  A typical defense mechanism is to self deny).  We are also *used* to people making fun of us.  All the time.  So going to the gym for the first few times is us at one of our most vulnerable states.  We feel naked.  Especially around others who are examples of peak fitness who make what we are struggling at look so easy.

For each basic half hour show there are usually 3 unskippable commercials that are either 15 or 30 seconds long. One at the beginning and 2 during the show. I think the length of the commercials varies based on the popularity of the show, but this is the most common format. A lot of the time, the commercials are hulu advertising other shows on hulu. So that's how the commercials work. 

It has new episodes of shows the day after they air on tv and it seems like they only have the most recent season of most shows. I think whatever hulu doesnt have is what netflix has. Its like they share licensing between new and old seasons and when it leaves hulu it goes to netflix. (I have netflix and hulu both.)

It has a HUGE archive of anime. I love anime so its really a plus for me. Subbed and dubbed both for most shows. Dubbed is usually lagging behind subbed but i dont think thats something hulu controls.

Movies. Let me tell you about the movie selection. It is shit. You will never, ever, in your wildest dreams find a movie on hulu worth watching. Never. OK maybe an anime movie. But you will never even browse the movie section because it is so bad.

There is a spanish section for spanish shows. I know basically nothing about that other than it exists.

**I was born in 1973.** That's cool. I'll wait.

Okay? I am fucking *[geologic](http://masschill.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Granny-Grandma-Internet-old-people.jpg)* in Reddit-years. I lived *most* of my life BSN (""Before Social Networking""). But the problem is, all the things I like are things I'm supposed to fear/scoff at. Games. Nerd-stuff. Internet Jokes. Whatever is happening right [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/fifthworldproblems/). That kind of thing. It's a problem.

In real life, I've never had many ""[friends](http://i.imgur.com/iDoqPHP.jpg)"" (well, any, honestly), but the people I get along with tend to be younger. I think part of this is the fact that for a good dozen years of my life I was tramping around the world in a state juuust shy of that of a hobo, and so these days I tend to have lots of grocery clerk/substitute teacher-type jobs we barely-employable people tend to get stuck in, and so my social demographic is comprised of the *other* half of that workforce, i.e., twenty-two-year-olds.

My point is that in real life, I tend to do pretty well around younger people. My sense of humor just clicks with them or whatever. As an emotionally immature person, my peer group tends to be literally half my age. 

(To the people cringing right now: oh piss off. A), I'm married so no, I'm not in fact fucking my way through the Coffee-bar staff at work, 2), yes I am *aware* that my social life is a direct result of my failings as a person, thank you very much and D), my self-loathing is such that your being creeped out that I'm hanging out with Millennials doesn't even come fucking *close* to hurting my feelings.)

But this does not correlate AT. ALL. in an internet setting. I only discovered Reddit about two years ago (context: about to move back to the States, was told the site was ""a good way to make friends in a new town"".

"Mayor_of_Browntown","picard","","Something similar like that happened at my childhood home. My parents were gone at the chicago auto show, my brothers and I were at home eating pizza in the kitchen, I was in Jr High at the time. We all of a sudden heard a large bang coming from the room next door, I thought our breakfront mystically fell over

The breakfront was in the front corner of our house, I was the first to get up and went into the dining room where to my surprise, no broken china. I quickly noticed a grey sedan outside the windows to my left, it was jammed into the corner of our stone foundation. More surprisingly, out the front windows to my right, 15 feet from our porch, was an upright, but obviously rolled, police car with lights flashing.

For some background, we lived on the corner of a main road, only 25 mph through our part, but people seemed to love crashing outside our house, no one however had actually made it up on the lawn passed the sidewalk. Our home was a 3 story victorian built in 1892, the stone foundation on this amazing house was 4-5 feet tall and at least a solid 2 feet thick, as a result, the grey sedan's hood was caved in pretty deep, windshield smashed to hell and doors flung open. They still had to have been going at some speed.

The police car had made a mess of the lawn, smashed up our magnolia tree a little bit, and, as we'd find out later, the front steps to our porch. As we pondered whether to call the police about the police car in our lawn, more cops from the town over started showing up. There was some shouting outside and we open our door and come out on the porch, there's cops shuffling around the grey sedan, as well as the rolled cop car. 

An officer starts heading our way when another shouts ""Get in side and lock your doors! there's one missing!"", my brothers and I follow his instructions. 10 minutes or so passes, more cops, ambulances, yadda yadda, they find this guy dead under our evergreen tree after a while. We started to smell gas during this, and it dawned on us that the gas line was right where the car hit. A fireman checks and tells us to get outta Dodge, my brother grabs Mr. Bo, our dog, and I carry my rather irritated cockatiel's cage, into our coach-house.

It took a while to get the gas shut off, during which our parents came home. Everything generally got cleaned up after, they towed the sedan but left the police car. The next morning the gas hadn't been repaired, it was Monday morning in February and I had to go to school, so I took the shortest, coldest shower in my life. As I left for school it was pretty surprising to me how many shoes were left on my lawn, there was even a child's.

In the end, we found out a guy ran from a simple traffic stop the town over, with his girlfriend and her kid in the car. Suburban cops decide it was smart to go chasing after them going 60+ on residential roads. Our town's bumbling Law&amp;Order: Convenience Store Unit (seriously there's always a cop there) hurried over from the 7-11 2 blocks down to 'intercept', as in t-bone the fleeing vehicle as it passed our intersection. Sending them spinning over our front yard and into our house.

The girl nor the kid died, they were in the back luckily. I remember the weekend after I was mowing the lawn on our riding mower, as this procession of people come out all with air-sprayed t-shirts saying angel and RIP with this guys face on it. They hung around the parkway for an hour or two in circle, then had the audacity to erect this huge 4' by 4' sign to memorialize him right on our front lawn! The man who killed himself and greatly endangered at least 3 others running from the police. The family never even asked us, even though they had seen me mowing the lawn. 

Since we lived on a main road, people, mostly house realtors, were always trying to advertise their shit on our lawn. If anyone asked we actually would've let em, but few if any ever did, so we'd break the sign and toss it in the street for them to find. People would sometimes argue, but they got the message in the end.

We weren't as crass this time, but my father and I tore that shit down as soon as they left. Some family member came back the next day to try and put another one up but my father was not having it. The man tried to argue, not ask, that he could put the sign up, saying it was public way. The man did not know our lawyer father's history with signage on private property.

And that, my friends, is how we got a new free porch.

As far as the first half is concerned, if it was a lunch shift many restaurants instruct their servers to ask for their order upon greeting them (just part of maximizing turn over and making sure people on break get out in time, it isn't uncommon in the at all for people to know exactly what they want before they sit down). As far as not appearing for 15 minutes afterward, always try to be aware of where the server is, from time to time a server can get caught helping a single table: a large party might need refills so you get them new drinks while the new table thinks of what to order, as you drop off the drinks and start to leave to check on the new table one person calls out saying that they need more soup, which in turn causes the rest of the party to ask for new soup and salad, you walk by the new table and see two people still looking at the menu so you rush to get the soups out but now you must clear the empty bowls from the table, you see the new table is ready but your hands are full, you drop the dishes at the DMO and wash your hands, you head to help the now neglected table but your manager calls that the parties meals are ready, you try to explain that you REALLY need to get to another table but they dismiss your pleads with the words ""hot food go,"" you run the 2-3 trays of food by yourself as none of your service partners claim to have time to help, winded you finally make it to the table and apologize for the wait, they shoot a look at you that tells you that you're lazy and clearly don't care.

Around the year 2000, Metallica had this mega tour with Korn and System of a Down as opening acts.  They were playing football stadiums.

Instead of canceling shows, they still played.  They came out before the show to explain the situation, and they said, ""Tonight, you get to sing for James.""  The crowd sang all the songs, but members from the other bands (like Serg and Jon Davis) came out to sing as well.  Also, some of the guitarists came out to play James' parts, too.  Apparently, Daron Malakian learned to play guitar by listening to Metallica, and he played a bunch.

"Booney3721","","","I love posts like these and my comment will get down voted majorly but it just goes to show the mentality of people these days.   Everybody seems to think that hunters are poachers and that we are not.  Don't hold all of us accountable for the actions of others.  I get horrid looks all the time when I tell others that I am a hunter.  I respect the laws and I buy tags and proper permits to hunt and I abide by both state and federal laws and rules of hunting.  This guy who was killed by an elephant was a major contributor to wildlife management and habitat restoration both in Africa and North America.  I have seen him in many hunting expos giving speeches about restoration of wildlife habitats and how crucial it is for others to be law abiding citizens and do things such as dedicate time and resources so that we, the people, can preserve habitats that way our children and their children can have what we have and see species of animals that if it was for us conservatives, they would go extinct.  We lost a very nice man who probably valued the land and respected it and the animals more so then most people do who are anti- hunters.  Granted you know the risks you take hunting game such as bears, lions, Cape buffalo, rhinos, moose, and elephants.  These animals are considered dangerous game and have been known to kill many a people who have hunted them.  Even still it's sad to see people act the way they have and say that is was good that somebody was killed.  It's tragic but at the same time it's a risk somebody takes.

I do admit its gotten a little easier since my son started Kindergarten. I think it will be easy as shit once he is in school for a full day. But right now this is how my day goes. Wake up at 6:30 make my coffee and iron my sons clothes for school. Wake him up at 7, get him fed and washed up and ready for school. 8:10 out the door to drop him off at school. 8:30am back at home or hit the gym depending on day. 10am start cleaning. One day its bathrooms, another day is mopping and vacuuming, then dusting and other misc, then laundry, etc. I am usually cleaning up until 12:30pm when its time to pick him up from school. Grab him now he is hungry so I have to make him a snack. After his snack its homework time. That is usually an hour. 30 minutes of his HW packet, another 30 minutes of reading. I might chill for another hour then I have to start dinner. Dinner is ready around 5pm which is when my wife gets home. We eat and as soon as we finish eating I start cleaning up the kitchen and doing dishes and packing the wifes lunch for the next day. So now its around 6:30pm we might watch some tv or play with my son for a while. At 8pm its time for the boys shower. Then I put him to bed. My wife is usually in bed by 9pm. When she is in bed I can finally sit and relax. But better not stay up to late or the next day I am fucked.

"baseball_guy","","","I'm pro vaccine, but I don't actually agree with this bill.  
  
The biggest fact that people need to factor into their decision making is to recognize that we do not actually have a wide-spread anti-vaxxer problem of anything like the proportion people tend to believe. The percentage of kids with zero vaccinations is at about 0.7% of the population nationally, and that includes religious and medical exemptions. In truth, the movement of liberal anti-vaxxer soccer-moms that everyone so hates, essentially doesn't exist. 
  
There are lots of *under*-vaccinated kids, but that mostly correlates to poverty. When you see a statistic about this or that school with 20% non-medical exemptions, that's not 20% unvaccinated, that's 20% under-vaccinated, i.e. missing at least one of the vaccinations kids are supposed to have by that grade level. If you look at the [CDC data](http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6334a1.htm), the archetype for the parent of an under-vaccinated kid shouldn't be some wealthy soccer mom... it ought to be some single mother on food stamps.  
  
The bill might force some idiots to vaccinate, but what it will mostly do, statistically, is get poor kids thrown out of school. One might say that's a sum gain of some sort if it improves herd immunity even a little bit, but it really does seem to me more like bowing to hysteria for political points.  
  
But, just for the sake of argument, lat's say that the bill succeed in forcing some parents to get their shit together, and improves vaccination coverage by a few percent. That still has to be weighed against the costs.  
  
We'd be adding a whole new layer of bureaucracy and legislation into medical decision making. At this point, doctors and parents are in charge. The AAP is a reputable organization, but if it were ever corrupted by lobbyists for some big pharma company (Cough! Monsanto FDA), doctors and parents would be forced to adhere. At this point, there are vaccination guidelines which the vast majority of people follow with only occasional variation, but they're only guidelines. Making it strictly regulated introduces a whole new avenue for abuse that we've never had before.  
  
So, the legislation attempts to fix a problem that we don't have (or that would at least be better fixed by improving access to health care), and for the cost of creating the potential for pretty serious consequences if the governing agency in charge were ever to be co-opted by corporate greed. And even beyond that, it would introduce more wasteful bureaucracy to even further distract our school system from attending to the job of teaching.  
  
I mean, I get the idea. Anti-vaxxers are idiots. They are, and if they were 5-6% of the population, I'd absolutely support some sorts of drastic legislation such as this to ensure that we effectively protect against preventable epidemics, but that is simply not the case. There were just enough idiots to put a few on TV for a big ol' media freak out in the tradition of Ebola, and Swine Flu before it, and nowhere near severe enough of an actual movement to justify such drastic legislation. I mean, I can find you somebody who says the moon landing were staged, but that doesn't make it a movement.    
  
If this legislation passes, you can be sure of several things.  
1)School money will be wasted reviewing paper work.  
2)Doctors will waste more time and money creating paper work.  
3)Parents will buy millions of manila envelopes to transfer around said paper work.  
4)Kids with disorganized parents will be prevented from going to school for having lost/misplaced their paper work.  
5)There will be a new dangerous potential for government corruption.  
6)It is possible that some minuscule number of idiots will get vaccinated who otherwise wouldn't have... although they could just go to private schools or home school instead.  
  
Actually, as long as this rant is on a trajectory of degrading into this level of disorganized free association, I may as well point out that, if someone were stupid enough to think vaccines were going to harm their children, do you think they'd just change their mind for the luxury of attending public school? Parents don't act that way. They don't just endanger (in their minds) their kids for the sake of education. The real anti-vaxxers this bill is aimed at would be exactly the sort or people who would be crazy enough to pull their kids out of school to avoid this legislation. It is sure to *only* miss the target, entirely. The only people who really need this law would dodge it, leaving only the poor to endure the additional complications of attempting to navigate the additional bureaucracy this bill would create.  
  
And finally, the thing that gets me the most about all this is Pertussis. It's on the rise... 70,000 cases over the past two years. It kills babies. It's a real epidemic that's re-surging to dangerous levels. The culprit? [The vaccine wears off faster than expected](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-whooping-cough-vaccines-are-wearing-off/)  
  
So, after all of this, the most important thing we could do to improve vaccine coverage would be to require vaccinated adults to get their pertussis boosters. Maybe we could make it a requirement to renew your driver's license? How many would applaud *that* legislation that actually requires personal responsibility rather than just scapegoating a lunatic fringe at the expense of the poor?  
  
Yeah, anti-vaxxers are dumb, but that does not mean we need a dumb bill to take an inefficient effort to correcting a minor aspect of an exaggerated problem. ",1429787857,"","1429789412",1,39,"AdviceAnimals"

I worked for a major music store's call center once, part time, right as I was losing it all and moved my family into a 27 foot travel trailer.  Sharing a pack of ramen and a PB &amp; J sandwich with my wife for lunch every day, so the kids would have enough to eat.

Then on December 18th a lady called in wanting to get a price on a guitar for her kid, I looked it up, Ibanez starter pack, a damn nice once, it retailed for $299.99, she said she needed to get him something and it had been a rough year, she asked me if it was a nice guitar, I assured her it was, it was the pack with the amp, guitar, stand, bag tuner and intro chords book, I would have loved to have it as a starter pack.

I told her the price and she just broke down, I mean, this was real, I get teared up just remembering the sound of it, she said she only had $150 to spend on him and seriously, I got tears in my eyes, I knew what she was going through, it was right before a Christmas I was not going to be able to do anything but feed my kids.

I asked her to wait while I looked for something which would work for her budget, but, fuck that, she was getting her way this time.

So, we had coupon codes listed in the system and discounts for certain zipcodes, etc. etc. etc.  *""Fuck this job, and fuck this world""* I thought to myself, today, the little guy wins.

I started punching in discount codes, I have been working in IT for years by this job, I took it because during the recession I had no choice, there *were* no IT jobs, so sales at a call center.  None the less, I knew systems, I knew audits, I knew I had a chance no one would catch my one call, out of 70 in a day.

I told her, *""Ok, looks like I can get that kit out to you for $63.99 today, did you say that was a Visa?""*  She stopped *""What, what do you mean?""*  I told her *""Looks like you lucked out and that exact system we looked at went on sale* ***unexpectedly!***""

She asked me 10 times if I was sure, I told her *""Seriously, don't worry about it, you will have this in time, and it is $63.99, no sales tax (Out of state orders were all exempt at the time)""*

I got her Visa number and set the kit up for next-day delivery for free, no shipping charge for her.  We had the ability to add notes to orders for gifts as well and I just left ""Enjoy your Christmas ~Your Somewhat Secret Santa""

I never was caught, never heard anything about it, was laid off after the season rush was over.

When my nose is running, be it due to allergies or a cold, or whatever...y'know what? It's running. My head is producing snot on a literally continual basis. Sure, I can blow it. But then, literally within 15 seconds, the same amount of snot appears again, to the point that I'm sniffling.

So, really and truly, what the hell is the point of blowing it out into a tissue *literally every 15 seconds*? Sniff-and-swallow is just more sensible **and also less likely to blast pathogens everywhere**.

And don't hit me with ""it's gross to swallow your own snot."" Maybe it is, but there isn't jack that anybody can do about it. The way the nasopharynx is set up, at **least** half of the snot your body produces goes straight down your throat, without any opportunity to blow it out your nostrils. Look at the pictures on wikipedia, if you don't believe me.

So, again, why should anybody blow their nose? I think it's a useless affectation that worsens contagion, wastes paper, and irritates noses.

EDIT: and if you're talking about sniffling noises being distracting? Ummmm...the sound of people blowing their noses is INFINITELY MORE DISTRACTING, AND YOU KNOW IT. You know damn well, every time you've been taking a test and somebody actually *did* blow their nose, you did not just carry on doing what you were doing, without noticing. It totally interrupted your train of thought in a way that quiet, low-key sniffling sounds never could.

"Aarondhp24","","","My Step-Father was married to his wife, Susan for 26 years. They were madly in love, and had 4 children. About 6 years ago, she was diagnosed with, and died suddenly from breast cancer. My Step-Father started dating quickly, simply because he didn't know how to live alone.

My Mother was the opposite. She had many relationships that never panned out, and was very close to giving up on love altogether. But they met on eHarmony. They fell in love. They got married.

Why am I telling you this? My Mother *knows* she isn't the love of her husbands life. She has come into his world, near the end. He has had his children. She has had hers. We're all grown up.

So she tells him very early on: ""If you want to feel sad, or just cry for Susan, that's ok with me. You never have to hide that you will always love her more than me.""

It's such a bittersweet thing. My Mother needed this man to come around when he did, but that meant his late wife had to pass away when she did. And Mark had to be the kind of man who would allow himself to look for love again.

They are the happiest people I have ever seen. My Step-Father is also the only man my mother ever dated I would call ""Dad"". I'm about to turn 28 haha.

The point is, you can feel sad and miss her. That won't stop you from loving someone else, or get in the way of a new love. You never fell out of love with your wife, she simply left this world, still madly in love with you. 

That kind of love doesn't have the opportunity to die. It can't end. You will always love her, and her you. You aren't crazy for calling out her name. Nothing that was her has left this planet. All her energy, all her warmth, and all her cells. They remain. They have changed form, but they are not gone.

We may never understand what comes after death, but your wife forever changed the way your brain will function till the day you die. Her mark is forever left on the world, in you. Carry that light with you, and be sad if you feel like it. Just don't let it burden you.

"Man_in_the_Suit_1211","","","The effects of weight discrimination (i.e. fat shaming) have been [studied](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0070048), and the following trend was reported:

&gt; Participants who experienced weight discrimination were approximately 2.5 times more likely to become obese by follow-up (OR = 2.54, 95% CI = 1.58–4.08) and participants who were obese at baseline were three times more likely to remain obese at follow up (OR = 3.20, 95% CI = 2.06–4.97) than those who had not experienced such discrimination.

Honestly, I hope our society comes to a point where we realize that shame is, in general, not an effective motivator, but the results as far as weight loss goes are clear: experiencing fat shaming and obesity onset/maintenance go hand in hand.

Really though, it's not surprising. The paper's conclusion isn't just buttressed by the data, but also past research:

&gt; Weight discrimination is associated with behaviors that increase risk of weight gain, including excessive food intake and physical inactivity. There is robust evidence that internalizing weight-based stereotypes [20], teasing [31], and stigmatizing experiences [32] are associated with more frequent binge eating. Overeating is a common emotion-regulation strategy, and those who feel the stress of stigmatization report that they cope with it by eating more [22]. Individuals who endure stigmatizing experiences also perceive themselves as less competent to engage in physical activities [33] and are thus less willing to exercise and tend to avoid it [21]. Finally, heightened attention to body weight is associated with increased negative emotions and decreased cognitive control [34]. Increased motivation to regulate negative emotions coupled with decreased ability to regulate behavior may further contribute to unhealthy eating and behavioral patterns among those who are discriminated against.

So to those who *do* engage in fat shaming, now that you have this information, you either have to stop and think about the consequences of what you're doing and think about better ways to encourage a society of people with healthier bodies, or you have to acknowledge that your shaming has nothing to do with genuinely wanting people to be healthy.

To be clear, I also think the fat acceptance movement is full of shit. Denying comorbidities that are connected to obesity is ultimately destructive, and I'm cool with mocking people who propagate this nonsense. And of course, if someone is rationalizing habits that are not conducive to achieving a healthier body, those rationalizations should be called out. Nothing I've said precludes some ""tough love."" That's not fat shaming.

There are people who recognize they're overweight, but haven't internalized the notion that they're worth the work associated with losing the excess weight that puts them at a variety of health risks. I imagine the situation is much worse if this state of mind is accompanied by something like clinical depression. You know what shaming them for their weight does? It encourages them to internalize the notion that they, as a person, are defined by their weight **when we need to be encouraging them to believe the exact opposite.**

from wikipedia: Typically, airlines will hedge only a certain portion of their fuel requirements for a certain period. Often, contracts for portions of an airline's jet fuel needs will overlap, with different levels of hedging expiring over time.

You will be getting all their work dumped on you and expected to double your output for no extra money, and screw your nights and weekends.

If you don't succeed, it's never their fault for gutting the department resources and they get to use it as an excuse to deny raises, promotions, etc.

You're being set up to fail or burn yourself out for their benefit. Sometimes the only way to win long term is to fail short term.  Don't give them an extra hour of your time to ""make the project work"" or ""be a team player"" because I promise you they do not care.

This goes for you prince charmings too (men and women alike)! A damsel (male or female) in distress will almost always still be in distress.  Don't look to solve people's problems for them if they are doing nothing to solve them themselves. Don't go looking to change someone either, this is damaging to everyone involved.

This applies to friends too! It is fine to have friends help you, but if you are constantly complaining and doing nothing to change, you are being a burden and really just using people.

Back in the early 90's, my parents hit a rough stretch financially. My dad worked in the aerospace industry from the mid 70's through the 80's. When the early 90's came around, the bubble for aerospace had burst, and most places were looking for young, fresh out of school kids, with fresh ideas. Not 50 year old 20 year veterans of the industry. In the course of a year we went from having a home in Orange County, a 5th wheel, and two new cars, to living out of and old yellow Chevy Nova, with our life's possessions stored in a friends barn.

I was only 11 at the time, didn't really fully understand what was going on, but could see the desperation on my parents faces. We slept at a rest area, my parents cozy in the front seat, and me in the back seat.

We would use the showers at the rest area, and when I was at school, my dad would do odd jobs for cash, so we could have enough for the showers, and to do laundry once a week. I only had 3 days worth of clothes, so I constanly mixed and matched my shirts and pants, and had to re-wear some stuff, but never two days in a row, because my mom didn't want to raise anyones suspicion at school.

Every Wednesday we would go by the McDonalds that was on the way to school, and my dad would by me and egg mcmuffin, and mom and dad would have a cup of tea, and a hashbrown.
We did this for a couple of months, and it become our regular routine.

One day, dad came back with is tea, and my mcmuffin, and had a tear in his eye. I asked him what was wrong, and he simply said ""someone decided to bless us today"", and left it at that. When we went to leave, the manager came over and gave me a happy meal, so I could take it to lunch. Usually I just had a cheese sandwhich, so it was a real treat to get a happy meal.

It wasn't until years later that my dad explained to me that, when he went to go pay for the egg mcmuffin, and pulled the last dollar bill out of his wallet, that the manager told him he wasn't paying for his breakfast anymore, because ""your son can eat free"".

Wednesdays became the one bright spot in that very sad and somber 4 months we spent living out of the car. It gave me something to look forward to, and made life feel just that little more normal for us.

It was only an egg mcmuffin and a happy meal, but it made my parents happy to see me excited, and I think the staff there at the mcdonalds knew that, and went out of their way to treat us with kindness.

Now some 20+ years later, it still makes me emotional thinking about it. That someone cared enough to give us a helping hand when we were in a place seemed like we would never get out of.


We did eventually get out of that hole. My dad took a job as an apartment complex maintenance manager, and an apartment was included as part of the pay. And we finally had our own roof over our head, and a place to call home. And for what its worth, my dad found that job sitting at the table, reading the paper, in the mcdonalds on a Wednesday morning, while we had our mcmuffin and tea. Had it not been for the kindness of the staff, we may have never found that job, and my life may have ended up very differently.

So thank you OP. Something as simple as helping people with their food, can sometimes make a major difference in their life that you could never imagine. Thanks for being awesome.
