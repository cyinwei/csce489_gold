"Hannibal_Montana","","","EDIT 5: Replied to this post with a summary of main counter-arguments to my theories. Check the comments.

A lot of wrong in here. I'm an analyst that covers U.S. energy, so let me weigh in real quick. 

First of all, it's nowhere near consensus that low gas prices are hurting the economy, you're obviously reading crappy news. I'm not making fun, I'm not saying nobody thinks that, I'm just saying they're wrong. The ONLY support for that argument, which is not a horrible argument, just a short-sighted one, is that most estimates point to about 0.6% - 1.0% of U.S. GDP growth since the financial crisis came from the explosion in U.S. shale gas. 

That being said, low prices do not affect all gas players evenly. For one, there's a difference between natural gas (""dry gas"") producers and oil and gas producers. Most of the fracking in the northeast is dry gas, just straight gaseous methane, with about 6-10% of the production being liquids, including petroleum. Almost all of them require high prices on oil to offset the high cost of production for relatively low priced natural gas. Those producers are much more threatened by low oil prices than producers who produce predominately crude oil. The majority of oil and gas producers are profitable at oil prices over $60/bbl. 

Now two things: For one, I know oil prices are currently below $60/bbl, however this is not a sustainable price. It does not reflect current supply-demand balances and is an overreaction both to the geopolitics around falling prices, and to a rising U.S. dollar. Both of those things should correct over the next couple of months once the markets settle down, and then we'll be able to observe how the actual supply and demand fundamentals actually play out over the medium term (1-2 years). The second thing, is that the vast majority (70-80%) of producers with substantial debt (those who would be in financial trouble first) are hedged 90+% for 2015 (meaning they have already pre-sold their production at prices back when oil was higher priced) and for decent (20-30% by most estimates) for 2016. So they can weather at least one year of low prices, because they'll be selling at higher prices. 


As far as low oil prices helping the economy, in America this is absolutely the case. Anything that allows the American consumer (which accounts for ~70% of our GDP) to spend more is a good thing. While I have not seen the actual study and cannot attest to its rigor or accuracy, the following chart from an Oxford research paper outlines GDP boost for various countries if oil stays at $40/bbl vs. $84/bbl. 

http://www.bloomberg.com/image/i4W2YOzoccF4.jpg

I think that covers the basics. I'm not going to go into the geopolitics but I've addressed it in /r/investing before so I guess just backread my post history? Sorry about having to scroll through all the comments during the Patriots game last night...

EDIT: Ok wasn't going to talk geopolitics, but please stop saying OPEC as if they're acting in unison on this. It is not. Saudi Arabia has been the marginal producer for years, fluctuating their ~2 MMbbl/day of capacity to control prices. However, prices fell after other OPEC countries refused to help Saudi Arabia support prices by cutting additional production to facilitate oil coming back online in Libya and Iraq. They expected Saudi Arabia (and possibly Russia) to bear the full brunt of it and cut their production. They reached an impasse and decided to revisit the discussion in six months (decision was made 11/27/14). Some theories point to a U.S. involvement in KSA's decision in an effort to put further pressure on Russia. I'll copy and paste a previous comment I made about how there are several other geopolitical motivations for KSA to allow prices to fall beyond any coordination with the U.S.:

1. In the near-term, inflict pain on the other OPEC memebers that have thusfar refused to participate in production cuts to accommodate the return of Libya and Iraq production

2. Destabilizing Iran and Iraq (read: ""Shia""). Low oil prices are a none-too-subtle proxy war waged by KSA on Iran over their nuke program, and also their version of Islam. In Iraq, you're also talking about destabilizing an impotent Shia regime that, if the country were to find peace tomorrow, could begin developing what most estimates believe is 9 million bbl/day of capacity, with a completion date of 2020.

3. Saudi Arabia enjoys its position of power in the context of the greater US hegemony. Destabilizing the Middle East, and slowing the massive capital formation in US shale both serve to keep Western eyes and ears focused on the Middle East at a time when the US continues to shift its foreign policy priorities to Asia.

EDIT 2: Accidentally called it methanol, it's methane. Methanol is bad, you get that from improperly distilled liquor... your body breaks it down into formaldehyde and it kills you. Which is bad. So do yourself a favor and avoid your meth head neighbor's hooch. 

EDIT 3: Well hell, I didn't want to keep editing but for gold (2x?!) I gotta. Thanks for the appreciation. Please know that a lot of this is my opinion but I hope that even in that I've helped to frame the way you should be looking at this... whether you choose to disagree (I question this stuff every day, it's when I stop questioning my convictions that I get most worried that I missed something). Keep reading people! The EIA (www.eia.gov) does a lot of good basic research on U.S. energy (don't take their forecasts to heart though, they're not great modelers), so take an hour and grab an article or two off there if you're interested!

"kailkay","","","My parents had a really hard time agreeing on a name for me, which is really indicative of their *entire relationship together*. My dad has a K- name as his first name. He wanted to name me after himself by giving me a K name. Start a sort of tradition, he figured. Mom, on the other hand, was a big proponent of using 'family names'; she wanted to name me after her grandfather.

Her grandfather was named 'Clyde'. To this day, I feel like if I had been named 'Clyde' I would probably be in prison for murder, or fornication with farm animals. Fortunately, dad had a grandfather, too (two of them, in fact), and declared that if his son's first name was going to be Clyde, then by God, his middle name was going to Dale. Jokes about plows, hay and saddles ensued. From what I understand, it was the first time my mother laughed in *weeks*. Pregnancies used to be hard for diabetics, yo.

So, they bickered back and forth. Dad was absolutely adamant that my name would have to start with a ""K"", because he really wanted to name me after him. They went through dozens of names, each one having some stupid reason for shooting them down. I personally believe I'd have made an excellent Kyle (mom had known a Kyle, and he was an asshole), or an even better Karl (no way, do you want our son to grow up raiding the Norman coast and plundering french maidens?). Hell, I bet if I was Keith I would *never stop getting laid*. But dad went with a name now associated with a kid too stupid to figure out how to eat glue: Dad decided I'd be *Kevin*. And it was the only name mom could agree to.

But it didn't stop there. We have an irish last name, and Dad figured that since Kevin was a decent, irish first name, it needed to be *more irish*. They looked at variants. *Variants*, reddit. And determined that the most *irish variant* of the *anglicized irish name* **Kevin**, was *Keven*. You know who else spells their name *Keven* instead of *Kevin?*

# Fucking *no one*.

When people meet me, the absolutely understandable inclination is to assume my name is spelled, you know, *correctly*. And I get to explain to people that need to write my name down that, no, my name has two E's. No, not *Keevn*, what are you, stupid? *Keven*. I have to enunciate clearly that second ""E"".

This has come up at banks, where I would have to tell them multiple times, ""No, I spelled my fucking name correctly on the form. K - E - V - E - N. Pretty sure I've been spelling it right my whole life.""

My job still has me entered in the system as *Kevin Lastname*. They claim they can't change it at this point. Thankfully I haven't had any issues with tax stuff or with cashing my cheques at the bank.

A funny thing about the place I work is that I'm probably the first Keven *or* Kevin that my manager has met. And so my name is the 'normal way' for said manager to spell it, and thus clients end up entered in our system as *Keven Somethingorother* on a frequent basis. It's small, barely noticeable, but it's a universal comeuppance for me to see shitty *Kevin's* who can't figure out how to get the glue out of the bottle, wonder why their name is spelled wrong.

Oh, and when people see my name for the first time, I am *Keeven*. Briefly, I considered changing the way I pronounced my own name and realized that this would be conforming to the universe. My personal identity is now completely entwined with my first and last name, and I couldn't possibly change either of them. A name is just a name, except my name *means me*. And there aren't a whole pile of people with the same name as me in the world. I get to be one of those unique, special snowflakes.

**TL;DR - Do not fucking do this, for your kid's sake.**

Look, good for you for never having a drug addiction, that's great, you've made some really good life decisions. But that doesn't make you better than addicts or recovered addicts. And it doesn't mean addicts and recovered addicts are better than you, either. You are all on different playing fields.

Everyone is born into different circumstances. The goal is the same; make it through life for as long as possible, but it's easier for some than it is for others. For instance, when a loved one dies, some people cope by remembering all the good times with them, others drown their pain and sorrow in alcohol, others lie to themselves, and sometimes that works, but sometimes it destroys them from the inside.

You can't say you're a hero because your train tracks aren't as rusted as others. And heroes don't call themselves heroes because they don't do what the ""bad guys"" do. Heroes that label themselves heroes are usually wolves in sheep's clothing. You're not a hero because you are good to yourself, you're a hero because you are good to others.

A hero doesn't scoff at addicts and say ""Ha, I've never been there, I'm better than that."" Those are villains. Heroes would be the ones that help the addicts free themselves from the shackles of their addiction.

"keystothemoon","","","I work in early childhood education and this happens all the time except I am the one who ends up saying ""Oh that's okay.""  Why?  Because sometimes what the child is doing is actually okay (and maybe the parent is being needlessly overbearing), and sometimes it shows the child that when someone messes up slightly, we should all still accept and forgive that errant behavior.  

Case in point:  Just today I had a puppet.  A little girl wanted to pet the puppet.  Her mom reprimanded her.  I said it was okay.  It actually was okay.  The puppet was out there to be petted by the children and to interact in a whole host of ways with them.  The mom just didn't know the rule.  She was being a bit overbearing and forbidding her child from doing something that we were actually encouraging.  No big deal.  But the ""That's okay"" is totally appropriate.  

Another case in point: the child actually is executing a social faux pas.  You point it out and someone says, ""That's okay.""  This person isn't undermining your parenting.  He is teaching the child an even deeper lesson.  He is modeling tolerance.  You are teaching the child to behave by society's norms and the stranger is teaching your child to be tolerant when someone doesn't behave by society's norms.  You are teaching your child proper expectations and the stranger is teaching your child compassion.  Both of these are valuable lessons.  ",1424560063,"","False",1,173,"AdviceAnimals"

Friday, she's mad at me for some reason, doesn't speak to me all day - something that drives me crazy but I was at wits end. But understand because recently ( 2 weeks ago) her uncle died due to an accident.. Something that's very sudden and difficult to deal with so.. She's going through a hard time and I'm determined to be there for her every step of the way. - also, I hadn't had any time to buy her any gifts because I've been hard at work at my dissertation 

Saturday - call her - she's still pissed off - convince her to meet me early for lunch because its valentines day and I want to treat her to lunch - she (semi) willingly agrees and gets out of bed. 

Little does she know, I'm already making my way to the meeting place, stops at sainsburys (supermarket for all you non-europeans) pick up a box of lindor chocolate and a cuddly bear. Get to the location and find a card shop. Find a card that say 'we drove each other crazy, but you're the best thing in the world and I love you'... Or something along those lines. 

Remember she asked me, jokingly to bake he a heart shaped cake - see a heart shaped GIANT COOKIE with personalised message - buy that, they make it fresh - stop for a halfpint and write my message in the card... Reminding her that, through rain or shine, I'll be there for you. No matter what. 

Pick up the cookie. Damn, it smells so good. Pick her up, surprising her - annnnddd long story short, we go grab some dim sum - we start walking and she's all looking at me weird  - takes me to Selfridge's , tells me she's gonna buy me a card.. So give her some time alone. Cool, so I go solo . meet her in 20 minutes... Hands me a card.. I read it, and it tells me how much she appreciates me being there for her... I already start swelling up - you know? Its something you don't think twice about - a relationship is like ying and yang - one completes the other. You share each and every burden. That was more than enough.... But reading the card further 'you deserve a little **** from me' I ask her... What does that word say? She says 'gift' .. I look down and see that she's bought me a watch that I've been wanting for so long. MAN I LOVE THIS CHICK. Its the little things, you don't need constant reassurance, just those one off little **nudges** that you both appreciate everything you do for each other.. Those things that are easily forgotten, but never absent. 

Sorry, just had to get this off my chest. I dropped her off, I went into uni myself to do some more work, and now stopped off in a pub on the way home.

In the same breath they are saying ALL of the protestors aren't rioters just because SOME are.

We also train them to remind cursing or inappropriate patrons that this is a family facility and saying rude comments like that will not be tolerated. The employed staff does not have to be a grumpy parent's door mat and we encourage all friendly interactions between the lifeguards and children. It shows that the staff care about the patrons and helps keep them compliant to the posted rules. It has an even greater impact to the parents within earshot who want to say something but also stay uninvolved.

"Javin007","","","I love that this is getting so many upvotes on reddit.  As a bee keeper that would LOVE to get a free hive of bees that are acclimatized to the local area, I will gladly collect a swarm free of charge.  I also don't charge if the hives are easily accessible.  I will, however, have to charge for any sort of removal that requires a ""cut-out"" (or cutting away of material to reach the bees) just due to the danger involved.  There's also a contract to sign that says that any damage done to the property is the responsibility of the owner to get repaired.  (Having done small scale construction, I do at least know enough to do the least amount of damage humanly possible).  

There's other reasons not to spray the bees, other than the obvious fact that it kills perfectly friendly and important honey bees:  You ever smelled a bunch of rotting brood in the summer?  Imagine that scent going into your house every year.  Not to mention that you may be able to kill off the hive, but after that poison eventually dissipates, other bees will find the hive and rob it.  So for at least a short time, you'll end up with more bees flying around, and you won't know if they're moving in to set up shop, or just stealing the honey.  Then there's the fact that an established comb is an attractive target for more bees (or wax moths, cockroaches, etc.) to move in and set up shop.  Presuming you seal the hole up well enough, you still have to contend with the scads of ants that will eventually find the old honey/brood.  

There's plenty of reasons to simply have the comb professionally removed.  Even cut-outs tend to be very cheap in the scheme of things.  

But PLEASE let me make ONE suggestion.  Before you call a bee keeper to remove the hive/swarm, *get a picture of one of them*.  Even a blurry picture is easy enough to identify for anyone experienced with the critters.  

[This is a yellow jacket.](http://www.pesticide.org/Alternatives/phase-2-solutions-for-consumers/YellowJacket.jpg)  Not a honey bee.  These are highly aggressive, and can sting multiple times (until their venom runs out).  This is the single most common call I get.  Their nests are made of paper, and can range from ""[normal and small](http://img.thrfun.com/img/018/855/yellow_jackets_nest_s.jpg)"" to ""[sweet holy Jesus burn the whole town to the ground.](http://www.pestid.msu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/YellowJacketNestInCarInterior.jpg)"".  They will build nests *anywhere*.  Inside trees, hanging from trees, in bushes, in garages, in the ground, doesn't matter.  Worse still, they are carnivorous, and I've even witnessed them *eating my bees*.  I can't describe how much I hate these things.  They are an [invasive species](http://cisr.ucr.edu/german_yellowjacket.html), and I would recommend anyone that sees them stock up on RAID and do your part to help these bastards go extinct.  Worse still, an estimated 1 in 1000 are deathly allergic to their venom (compared to anywhere from 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 50,000 allergies to honey bees.)  

The [Honey Bee](http://www.atlanticpestsolutions.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/honey-bee-md.jpg) is furrier, cuter, and friendlier.  They can only sting one time before dying, and they know it.  Typically, they will ""ping"" you (bounce off of you) as a warning if you get too close (seriously close, like within 3-6 feet) to their hive.  The vast majority of people that get stung each year are stung for reasons that have nothing to do with aggression on the part of the honey bee:   

1.) The bee got tangled in hair, and people panic and start swatting instead of letting it untie itself and fly away.   
2.) The bee landed on someone (they'll drink sweat) and they panicked, and smashed it, getting stung.  
3.) The bee was just checking you out because you looked interesting (they like bright colors) and you panicked, and swatted it, causing it to land on someone else, or inside of your own clothing.  
4.) The person stepped on them bare-footed.  

I don't have statistics, but I'd personally estimate that (if you take domestic bee hives out of the equation) that would probably account for 99.99% of honey bee stings each year.  Even ""Africanized"" honey bees (which are far less frightening than the media makes them out to be) don't go out and hunt people down.  They only respond (with lethal force) to people disturbing their hives.  

So rambling aside, honey bees are generally friendly, wasps are not.  Honey bees you can seldom, if ever, see the nests, wasps you can ([mud daubers](http://pestcemetery.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/picture-42.png) are another common nuisance wasp, but not nearly as aggressive as the yellow jacket).  

Then there's [carpenter bees](http://natural-japan.net/photos/Xylocopa_appendiculata04.jpg).  These idiots are the ""Scrappy Doo"" of bees.  The females have stingers, but they tend to be docile, and hide out in their holes.  The males, on the other hand, are *very aggressive* and will fly around in your face all scary-like, despite the fact that they don't have stingers at all, and the best they can do is bump into you angrily.  While they're harmless to people, [the damage they'll do to your house](http://www.pestid.msu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/LarvaeInGalleries.jpg) makes it important to exterminate them on site.  

But all of this said, bee keepers will *only remove honey bees*.  We are not exterminators.  But we're usually glad to come out and pick up a free hive (they cost us close to $200 a pop to get a hive shipped to us) and in a perfect world, we'll find a [swarm](https://planbeeproject.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/bees-swarm-bicycle.jpg) that hasn't established itself yet.  (Swarms are lazy, gentle, and not at all interested in stinging anyone.  They are far more interested in finding a new home than in attacking anyone, as they're full of honey they loaded up on for the trip.  They look scary, but they're the *least* dangerous thing you'll find.)

[Their financial statements  can be found](http://ww5.komen.org/AboutUs/FinancialInformation.html). Susan B Komen is not only for cancer research. **It's mission is ""to save lives and end breast cancer forever by empowering others, ensuring quality care for all and energizing science to find the cures.""** Their mission is on their website so I hope you read the mission of any charity before you give to it. 

In 2013-14, (their fiscal year ends in March 31st), their budget of $318M was divided up as follows: 

38% on education and awareness.
20% on cancer screening.
18% on cancer research.
7% on cancer treatment.

**Only 17% went to Administration and fundraising while a whopping 83% went to their mission. The gold standard in NGOs is for 85% to go to the mission, so Susan B. Komen would get an A-.**

Checking the last few years, they are consistently between 75% and 85%, meaning that they range from a B to an A-. 

**You may ask why I used their budget, not their received donations. The reason is that money isn't spent as soon as it comes in.** Almost every NGO engages in longer term projects and Susan B. Komen is no different. This means their budget has more to do with donations in previous years when they committed to the projects that they are funding today. No NGO is judged by current year donations otherwise you will get the bizarre situation of an NGO donating 200% of donations when they are shrinking. 

Edit: This comment got way more attention than I expected. I am doing my best to keep up with replies, but there are a few interesting ones that come up repeatedly, so I will reply to them here:

**1) Isn't ""education and awareness"" just marketing?**

No, it shouldn't be, but obviously this is one of the biggest grey areas with this type of organization. Learning about prevention, detection, and treatment can save lots of lives and reduce healthcare costs. Furthermore, for most of my life (i'm 30), there has been a social stigma against chemo and certain surgeries (notably breast and testicular). Reducing these stigmas is of real value. 

**2) Why spend so much on awareness of something we are already aware of?** 

Excellent question. The battle seems to be mostly won. Why is almost half of their mission budget going towards this instead of research and treatment? I don't know. I would be more comfortable with this number if it were closer to 20%, not 38%. From my little experience in NGOs, however, they are slow to change. If the battle was won five years ago, the strategy might not fully adapt for another few years. 

**3) If they are truly working for the cure, why do they sue other charities over intellectual property?**

Again, this seems pretty nefarious, but remember that NGOs have to take care of their brand quite carefully. Every so often, somebody creates a ""charity"" that looks a lot like a more famous charity in its branding. They tend to divert a small percentage of their donations. Sometimes these ""charities"" are actually scams that simply pay 90% of their funds to the director and donate 10% to some other organization. These guys go to jail and sometimes the story gets written up in the newspaper. This heavily taints the brand of the larger organization because some people get confused. Larger organizations defend their intellectual property heavily and yes, sometimes it seems heavy-handed.

**4) Why do we care about the percentages used for different things. Shouldn't we care about results?**

Yes, absolutely. There is a growing movement to ignore these percentages and some organizations, such as Wikimedia (the people who bring us Wikipedia) don't even publish it because they think it's a bullshit way to judge organizations. We're really interested in the impact that the organizations achieve. In NGOs, this is referred to as ""Results-Based Management."" This is, without a doubt, the correct way to measure NGOs. For example, if one NGO spends 20% on administration and fundraising but cures a person of cancer for every hundred dollars donated, which of those numbers matters more? When choosing who to donate to, I encourage you to look for results. 

**5) Nice try, Susan B Komen**

I have no affiliation with them nor have I ever donated money to them. I have worked for Oxfam and WWF, both fine organizations. I have also donated to Red Cross and MSF (Doctors without borders) quite regularly and Care and Wikimedia are next on my donations list. Anything I say about *those* organizations can be suspected of bias. 

**6) Why is your spelling and grammar off?**

I am mildly dyslexic and high as a kite on pain killers after having my appendix removed. I apologize if any of this appears as nonsense.

"HatGuysFriend","","","Here is the story.

In high school, I had a pottery teacher, who we called Mr. T, or T-Rex.
He was the collest guy ever, and genuinely cared about his students and his craft. 

He was the kind of guy that would come out and play hacky-sack with the students. I remember one time a teacher came out and yelled at us for throwing a football outside during lunch. As soon as that teacher went inside he ran out yelling for us to throw him the ball. Good natured and loved to laugh. He auctioned his pottery off every year for thousands of dollars for the benefit of our schools fundraiser to help those in need.

One day we had a substitute teacher in class, and instead of working, many students decided to be on their cell phones. Hearing this the following day, it irritated Mr. T that students had been so disrespectful to the substitute.
After class, I was just bullshitting with Mr. T, as I often did, and mentioned that I had found a flip phone (yes this was during the time of the razors and flip phones) and that it would be so funny if he took the phone from me and broke it in front of everyone. 

He absolutely LOVED the idea, and was so excited. We plotted the the following class period on Friday we would execute our plan.

That Friday, the clock winds down towards the end of class, and the end of the school day. Mr. T walks by and subtlety gives me a nod. A minute later I pull out my phone and begin ""talking"" to my friend.

Loudly, Mr. T comes over and demands that he should have my phone, which catches the attention of my classmates. Although I protest, I eventually relinquish the device. Mr. T holds up the phone and says ""this is what will happen if I see another cell phone in my class."" With those words, he hurls it violently across the room against the cinderblock walls, where it shatters into a hundred different pieces. The silence in the class was deafening. My acting skills were barely enough to stifle my laughter much less seem angry, but I was able to feign shock at what had happened.
One person, a notorious ""valley-girl"" and repeat cell phone violator, with whom I had no friendship, rose to my defense and argued with my teacher about the atrocious grievance that had occurred, to which Mr.T only demanded that she give him her cell phone as well.

The bell rang, and school was out. The following weekend the school (of nearly 2000 students) was absolutely abuzz with the news. *Mr.T* was called to the principals office, and asked if he had destroyed a students phone, to which he replied that he absolutely did, and would do it again in a heartbeat. 

I had many people ask me if I was ok, and that they were sorry for what happened. We allowed the story to go for several days before we came clean, but I'm sure many still believe what happened.

I saw Mr. T six months ago for the last time, selling his pottery at the fair, and we recalled this story, and spoke like old friends.

Mr.T lost his fight with leukemia several months ago. I never thought I might be his favorite student, but I attended his funeral, as he was my favorite teacher. His ashes were within a pottery jar of his own making. When I heard this story told, it brought so many tears to my eyes. He knew he was dying, so I think he wanted this story told at his funeral. Nothing could have meant more to me, and I still cry sometimes knowing that he's gone.


**Edit:** the phone was a ruined, waterlogged POS that wasn't even found at the school.

I think feeling ""desperate"" for that connection after the most important woman in your life just left is no less appropriate than a hungry person seeking out food. It's just what people do, and it's OK.

"Lumos_de_Fortuno","","","So this is meant to be reassuring, but when you first read it I'm just going to sound like an asshole, my apologies.  You don't get into art to ""make it"", not really.  If you'd really wanted to be rich, there are plenty of nearly guaranteed paths to wealth (dentist, plastic surgeon, hedge fund manager, international drug dealer, etc.).  If you'd really wanted to be famous there are loads of jobs that will make you famous (porn, reality tv, etc.).  If you'd really wanted to be respected and well admired, there are tons of jobs that guarantee that (missionary/priest, social worker, dedicated teacher, civil rights attorney, nonprofit organizer, etc.)

Now I don't know your personal reason for making art, but mine are that I want to make the world a more beautiful place to live in and I want to change the way the people who look at my work see the world.  Would being rich and admired rock? Totally! Famous? Fuck no I'd hate that.  I'm an artist because I want to make art and I feel dead inside when I'm not making it (like right now, because of shit living arrangements).  

So Forbes had an amazing article about what it takes to make a living as an artist without essentially winning the lottery, and I have to say I really agreed with the article.  Now I can't remember everything they said but the one thing I agree with the most (their most important thing), it stuck with me because I realized that it was 100% true of all the artists I know who make a living from their work.  The number 1 thing to do if you want to make a living as an artist is to own your own brick and mortar gallery that shows your work, that you sell work out of.  To begin with, the key to selling a piece is exposure, if enough people see your work, eventually someone is going to want to buy it.  Even the woman who was the first person to get kicked off work of art got enough exposure that she was able to develop a following.  If its just your work, and your gallery is somewhere that people are going to walk by on a regular basis, people will see your work and someone will fall in love with it.  No one is going to see your work if its sitting in your studio.

Secondly, most galleries take between 50-90% of all sales.  If you're able to make ends meet with that 10% price, you'll be able to price work more competitively to sell and be able to keep a larger profit margin.


The third thing, is get as much exposure as possible.  Start a daily blog where you talk about your work and take pictures of what you're working on.  Start a youtube channel about your art, your shows, invite people who love your work to come on an talk about it, whatever.  Post videos of time lapse photography of you doing a painting from start to finish.  Apply to every juried show, residency and grant you possibly can.  TAKE EVERY SINGLE GRANT WRITING CLASS YOU CAN!!!  If you can get an art career manager.  When you've got a show coming up, if you can pull together the scratch, take out a full page ad in the local artsy free weekly. Be sure to have some pieces that will fit on someone's wall and are within you average joe's price range.

"ag11600","businesscat","","Cottonelle wet wipes.

Now, there is a good side and bad side of the wet wipe. One side is a bit rougher and more textured which will help scrub and clean the muddied area. The smooth side is not as good for cleaning. I suggest a pilot trial to understand how the two sided wipe works. You'll want a poop that is solid and manageable and not to messy to start with to come up with an SOP.

I usually start by going dry for one or two wipes to assess the situation at hand. From there I will deploy the wet wipes, alternating usually dry and wet.

That is unless you have full out butt pee. Then you're gonna wanna absorb with a few dry to really soak in the butt pee, then really use a few wet in a row and scrub that area like standard radiation decontamination. Keep in mind, it's best if you flush no more than 3 or 4 wet wipes at a time. So flush early, flush often. The last thing you want to do is have to abort and plunge. Then you'll be like, he was right. Should've flushed early and flushed often.

There's also very unique situations which men of hairry asses can incur. The problem child. You get some of it, but that problem child really didn't come out, and he could be stuck in the hedgerows. You can wait, jiggle a bit. Or apply a full on butt offensive and go dig it out. Wet wipes will be clutch to your success here. You may want to double up, spread the cheeks and dig that bastard out.

I will always finish on a dry wipe because I don't want my butt wet after, it's terrible finishing with a wet wipe.

Cottonelle ones are also very lightly scented which really helps I've found. Buy the one that comes with a plastic case once and save it. After that buy the big pack that's for refilling, better value. Better butt to wipe ratio.

"Darth_Cosby","","","As a lawyer, I can tell you that they are asking you to come in early tomorrow so they can have you sign something that releases them of responsibility for damages due to defamation and wrongful termination. Whether you want to keep your job there or not, do not go in without an attorney present. Given the chain of events in the case, I think it likely that you can find an attorney that will work on contingency. Check with your state bar association and they will be able to refer you to someone competent in your area.

The good news is that right now the HR director who fired you/corporate office is shitting their pants.

Edit based on what I've seen or answered elsewhere: 

1. Stop sending e-mails to the company. They will be entered as evidence in any lawsuit. Your attorney will be your intermediary and will ensure that you won't inadvertently hurt your case. Your company's legal counsel will absolutely be advising the CEO and HR head about any correspondence with with you.

2. I don't work employment law, so someone may contradict me, but if you need to take a personal day tomorrow rather than attend the meeting alone, you should do so. I think in this situation, it would unreasonable for the company to demand that you are back tomorrow. Just know that this will tip them off that you are most likely exploring your legal options. Like I said, someone more knowledgable in the field may contradict me. Follow your attorney's advice about this more than mine.

3. Try not to contact coworkers about the firing and realize that they may be reticent to testify in your favor despite being on your side for fear of professional harm. Your lawyer will take care of this, but until then you may be saying things that could come out later in court and at the very least putting your friends in a difficult position.

**Final Edit** (while I'm on lunch):

People are chiding OP for selling out, which I think is unfair. OP reached a resolution that gave him personal closure and helped provide for his family. A lot of people (and some lawyers) would say take them to court for every dime you can but they probably haven't seen the toll of drawn out cases, heavy attorney fees and years of financial insecurity until cases reach resolution. Nevermind that defamation suits are far from a sure thing and he'd be up against a hard hitting legal team. If he's satisfied with what they offered and an apology then hopefully he's off to a better, happier future.

My advice is to pay down your debts, look into the best way to make that money work for you, and take your family/counsel out to a nice dinner. (Attorneys do eat, sucking off the teat of society isn't enough for us /s).

When I look at my facebook/twitter feed I see people on each side of the political spectrum totally getting bogged down and losing sight of the issues and/or conflating the issues all together. 

I see people on the conservative end going on and on about ""thugs"" and making statements like ""Oh wow burn down your own neighborhood real fucking smart."" They focus only on the looting and not the global scale. Hey guys, didn't you see the video a week ago of a dude getting shot in the back 8 times as he casually walked away from a cop? Have you not noticed the pattern of police brutality that has gone on and on and now with video is even more glaring and ridiculous? Stop focusing on just what you want to focus on and admit there is a bigger picture!!

Then I see my far left friends who put up article after commentary after news clip about the police brutality and about privelage and about how there are really only a ""tiny percentage of looters"" and how it's all about the media portrayal. And I'm thinking yes these are all issues but don't deny the decay of inner city culture (across all races) and how poorly these folks respond to a lot of things (from disobeying and arguing/fighting with cops in the first place to looting and rioting). These people aren't all angels who are being picked on. They certainly have reason to have issues with police but if you all stay home and don't start burning shit down you'll have much less of a police problem I promise you. Either way, again the folks on the left also focus on one part of the issue that THEY WANT to focus on and ignore the whole picture. 

We're human beings. We're intelligent. Why the hell can't we all be honest about the immensity of these issues and actually discuss them all without defending our politics by focusing on one corner of the argument? It doesn't make sense.

"JBlitzen","","","Some of the Fedoras in here are saying that you shouldn't help out in an accident without being a doctor or otherwise being licensed and specially trained.

**They're wrong**.

Doing nothing isn't noble, it's pathetic.

First off, if you're really that concerned about hurting someone, the American Red Cross runs constant classes all over the country on basic first aid and CPR.  They're short, inexpensive, and always filled, because quite a few jobs require them, like lifeguards and babysitting and coaching.

Secondly, even without that basic knowledge, about the only way you can make the situation worse is if you move someone's spine around, or mess with an open wound or fracture and open it more or fracture it more, both of which would take a pretty conscious and stupid action, barring good reasons like an obvious fire or drowning risk.

Third, here are ways you might have to help, which won't hurt anything:

1. Applying pressure to a bleeding wound.

2. Directing traffic safely around or away from the accident to prevent additional accidents.  Flares and other signals can help, or do it yourself or grab other bystanders and have them do it.

3. Checking on the other occupants for the driver, like children and pets.

4. Talking with the victims and offering comfort and hope, in part because it's important, and in part because it can reduce physiological symptoms of shock.  This includes distracting scared and crying babies with toys or jangly keys or whatever.

5. Providing a blanket or coat or umbrella or water or food or other immediate needs, like if if the weather isn't perfect.

6. Witnessing comments and actions that may help later on, like if one driver runs off before the police arrive.  You could provide them with a description of him or her.  And if you witnessed the accident itself you should always speak up.

7. Helping a victim get unstuck from the wreckage if it's a danger to them.

8. Performing CPR if a victim isn't breathing.

9. Organizing other response efforts like making sure someone has called 911 and that people are helping direct traffic and prevent additional accidents and that nobody has better medical training than you.

10. Calling a victim's family or employer or something for them, if they're busy.

Etc.

**NOBODY** in this thread should be telling bystanders to stay away from an accident or to do nothing beyond calling for help.

If nobody's doing it, and it has to be done, then it's your job to get it done.

I could have friends over but no one ever wanted to come over and i wasnt allowed to tell them i had drinks unless they came over. So i got used to staying in and drinking alone or with grams watching the ball drop and usually passing out around 1am. First person who ever joined me was a at the time girlfriend who is now my wife and we used to until our kids were born keep the tradition going.

My grandmas point was always a lot of people drink on new years, i know you will if you leave but if you stay ill get you what you want to drink so your not out putting yourself in danger so i can sleep better tonight.

Woodchuck cider was on of my favorites back then. Grams has since passed away, but some of my best memories of her are just hanging out on new years, me getting drunk and us just having a good time shooting the shit waiting for the ball to drop.

"TheStranguh","","","You know what man? You have no idea how much I needed this. 

I dated this one girl for about three years. The relationship was the best, and the girl was amazing. Everything was great until eventually I hit a rut of depression but hid it so it seemed like I just didn't cate about the girl or the relationship. I struggled with my emotions and ended up losing the woman I planned to marry. 

It's been 3 years, almost to the day, since she broke it off with me. I was left a broken man and feel into an even worse depression. Within the last year I've finally been able to fix myself, overcome my problems, and feel happy again. 

Today, though, I made a poor decision. A mutual friend of mine and hers asked if I was free to hangout, and I said yes and cleared plans. Once I did, I learned that my ex was coming. I didn't know what to feel. I was happy, because I hadn't seen her in years. But I was also terrified because I haven't seen her in years. And to top it off she is moving soon and had been in another relationship for years. 

With all that in mind, I decided to go through with it. And everything started well enough. But soon I saw her smile again. Heard her laugh that she hated but I loved. Caught a passing smell of her hair which was wonderful and I realize may sound weird, but once to fall truly in love you'd understand. 

All I wanted to do tonight, after time passed, was to ruin my fingers through her hair again. Seriously, not longing thoughts of wanting to kiss her, but wanting to have that connection again that you only have after years together. 

And right now I'm laying in the basement on a couch because I'm not fit to drive, add she and the other girls sit upstairs conversing and talking about the past in a much different way than I am stuck thinking about it. And only now, that I'm alone for at least a short time, I had time to process the emotions running through my head. 

Just to try and clear my mind I hopped on reddit, for destraction, and I see this.

Somehow this put me in better spirits. I am still in a sort of pain, but this gives me the hope I need. To realize that in not the only one forced to rough it right now, and that maybe soon I'll be able to move along. 

I thank you, even though this comment may never be read, and if it is I may attract some sort of ridicule. But this little bit is something I needed, dearly, and you have my sincerest gratitude. It showed on my reddit page at just the right time. ",1427608836,"","False",1,84,"AdviceAnimals"

There are a hundred thousand topics that are objectively more important and more interesting than the perception of the colour of a dress.

A free and neutral internet is a place where endless debates about the colour of a dress, or the merits of horse-sized ducks and duck-sized horses, or whether a creature is a seal or a sea lion, or whether OP and Jenny are fictional, can *thrive*. These are the things that people apparently want to talk about, and nobody is trying to limit their ability to do so. Net neutrality ensures that whether you want to watch Netflix, or watch Xfinity, or read about how Obama's a Muslim, or read about how Ted Cruz is crazy, or circlejerk in favour of Occupy, or circlejerk against Occupy, or fight about the colour of a dress, *you can do that.*

When the Allied soldiers went into occupied Holland in WWII, the soldiers were throwing chocolate bars off their trucks into the crowds, and the crowds were providing them with flowers by the armful. There were more important things to bring to the newly-liberated citizens - like medicine and basic nutrition. And there were more important things to bring to the military - like intelligence from the resistance movements. But those gifts of chocolate and flowers celebrated the fact that now there was freedom to enjoy chocolate, and now there were soldiers worth giving flowers to. Fighting about the colour of the dress *is* Reddit's chocolate and flowers. Embrace it and enjoy it, brothers. Today is a good day.

"CalvinDehaze","","","Latino here. The whole ""they have to learn English"" stance has always annoyed me, so let me play devil's advocate for a moment.
  
Let's say that the US has become a dystopian wasteland and people are leaving the country to find work to feed their families, and this includes you. The superpower with the most work is now China. So in order to not only scrape by, but provide a better life for you and your family, you, an American, have to move to China. You don't speak Chinese, or have even been to China for that matter, but you're willing to go where the prosperity is, and you're willing to learn the language and customs.
  
After spending what little you had saved on the trip for you and your spouse and child, (and not even knowing how all this will pan out), you make it to China. For the purposes of this hypothetical lets say you already have some family there. They live in the ""Little America"" section of Beijing, where other Americans have gathered and created a little nook of America in China. This is awesome for you because China is a completely strange land, but now you have other Americans you can make friends with, buy stuff from, and help each other out.
  
Now you have to find a job, but since you just got there, you haven't even started to learn Mandarin. Since you can't speak the language of the land, and you're not a citizen yet, the only jobs available to you are the lowest-level with little pay and really long hours. You already have people going ""you're in my country, speak Chinese!!"" and you agree, but you just got there, it's going to take some time.
  
You find a menial job working your ass off for shit pay for 12 hours a day. During your job no one is trying to teach you Mandarin, or talking to you in a way where you could pick some up. There's probably one supervisor who speaks English, but he's only going to speak to you enough to get you to do the job. He's not there to teach you the language. During your lunch break, your Chinese co-workers may or may not be friendly, but it's hard to even talk to you because you can't speak Mandarin.
  
You go back home every night to ""Little America"", exhausted from the 12 hours of labor you put in, and you want to spend time with your family before you have to go back to bed and do it all again. So, maybe, you'll get a half-hour of free time to start to learn the language and customs to a country you know hardly anything about. So maybe in a few years you could start speaking Mandarin, but until then everything is inaccessible to you outside of Little America. Want a drivers license? Medical insurance? Advice on whether or not you're being exploited at your job site? All the things we take for granted are now harder to learn, obtain, and maneuver, which takes more time out of your already stressed day. And the whole time you're there, there's always someone saying ""why can't you just speak Mandarin?""
  
Learning a new language and customs is not impossible, but it's not easy for most of the immigrants that come here who are working class. Are some of them lazy?

""Grief""

""Alright, here goes. I'm old. What that means is that I've survived (so far) and a lot of people I've known and loved did not. I've lost friends, best friends, acquaintances, co-workers, grandparents, mom, relatives, teachers, mentors, students, neighbors, and a host of other folks. I have no children, and I can't imagine the pain it must be to lose a child. But here's my two cents.

I wish I could say you get used to people dying. I never did. I don't want to. It tears a hole through me whenever somebody I love dies, no matter the circumstances. But I don't want it to ""not matter"". I don't want it to be something that just passes. My scars are a testament to the love and the relationship that I had for and with that person. And if the scar is deep, so was the love. So be it. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are a testament that I can love deeply and live deeply and be cut, or even gouged, and that I can heal and continue to live and continue to love. And the scar tissue is stronger than the original flesh ever was. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are only ugly to people who can't see.

As for grief, you'll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you're drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it's some physical thing. Maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it's a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive.

In the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what's going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life.

Somewhere down the line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O'Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you'll come out.

Take it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don't really want them to. But you learn that you'll survive them. And other waves will come. And you'll survive them too. If you're lucky, you'll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks.""",1421879149,"","False",1,343,"AdviceAnimals"
"raging_asshole2","","","i was a pretty happy only child at 4 years old when my little brother came along and ruined everything.  suddenly the world wasn't all about me.  it was about this gross little baby, everyone cooing and fussing over him, obsessing over his little eyelashes and such while my lifelike drawings and awe-inspiring stories went unheeded.  my towers of blocks were suddenly ""unsafe"" instead of admired.  my place in the big bed was lost.  all in all, i was pissed.

so i decided to level the playing field.  a day came where my mother and aunts could not stop talking about how he had the longest eyelashes of any baby that anyone had ever seen.  they were so glamorous and amazing, these eyelashes.  they were the center of my mother's world.

what if, i asked myself, he didn't have those eyelashes anymore?  surely nobody could love such a noisy little lump without eyelashes, right?  it would be the perfect crime, and it would vault me back into the spotlight.

the plan formed, i bided my time and waited for nightfall.  the house was quiet.  my parents had retired, and my brother lay snoozing, defenseless in his crib.  from under my pillow, i pulled the deadly sharp manicure scissors i had secretly lifted from my mother's dresser.  i crept to his crib and dropped the side wall, oh so slowly, oh so carefully, making sure not to risk waking anyone.

his chest rose and fell slowly, and this hateful little demon that had stolen all my attention away was mine for the taking.  his eyes closed, those perfect beloved eyelashes resting gently on his cheeks.  with the slow steady hands of a bomb squad technician, i brought the scissors to his face.  i opened the blades, and ever so softly rested the bottom jaw on his cheek.  i glided forward, gathering all the lashes i could in the throat of the scissors.  and with a smooth, decisive squeeze, i closed them, snip, and his lashes tumbled away onto his face.  

emboldened by success, i brought the scissors back up and down again near his other eye.  a murmur rose in his chest, and i yanked the scissors back, took a step back, head whipping around and eyes darting, sure that i was caught.  false alarm.  just a regular nightly stirring.

suddenly gripped with the notion that maybe, just maybe what i was doing was wrong, i knew that it was time to commit or flee.  a baby with no eyelashes was something to ignore, but a baby missing half his eyelashes?  that was suspicious, that was a question waiting to be asked, that was **trouble**.

so i doubled down.  i stepped in, i slid the scissors into place, and snip snip, the rest of his eyelashes fell away.

silently, i crept back to my room.  i lay down and looked at the ceiling, then at the deadly little scissors still clenched in my hand.  it was done.  the attention stealing was over.  i had bought my parents love back.  and with that thought, i drifted off to sleep, a smile on my face and scissors clenched in my grasp.

until the next morning.  i was rudely jolted from slumber by the sound of my mother screaming my name from across the house.  the tone of her voice told me that i had perhaps made a miscalculation in my plan somewhere.  but i knew better than to keep her waiting.  i ran to her at a sprint, into my brother's room, and gave my best casual, ""hi mom.""

""WHAT THE HELL DID YOU DO?!"" she screamed.  ""WHAT ARE THOSE?!"" she demanded, pointing at me.

i looked down, and there clenched in my little hand were the manicure scissors.  betrayed by my own hubris, i had never thought to hide them or even put them down.  ""uhh..."" was the only response i was capable of.

but my mother was a genius.  she put it all together instantly.  the creeping, the planning, the removal of the eyelashes.  i saw on her face the horrible knowledge, dwarfed only by fear.  she turned back to my brother, her face pressed to his, looking for the smallest nick, a cut, an eyeball bearing a poke.  but he was fine.  not so much as a scratch.  not a single mark on him, but not a single eyelash either.

i'll wrap up this tale by saying that this stunt absolutely got me tons of attention from all kinds of family members (and child psychologists) - just not the kind i expected.  i certainly never handled anything sharp for a long time, and i found things i had never wanted to touch before were now clearly out of reach.

and now, nearly 30 years later, that little bastard STILL has the longest eyelashes you've ever seen.  my mom still comments on them.  and she still uses clippers instead of manicure scissors.",1431721550,"","False",1,110,"AdviceAnimals"
