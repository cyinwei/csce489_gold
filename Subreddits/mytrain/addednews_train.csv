CMDunk,,,"So a brief post about Leonard Nimoy.

When I was in middle school, I was bullied every single day. One of the few things I looked forward to during this time was surviving school and getting home to watch reruns of In Search Of... This show opened me to two very big things: myth and skepticism. It was entertaining and provided comfort that I very much needed, and it helped my brain to start critically thinking about the world, how facts are presented, and how to research them on your own to search for the truth. In the next few years, Mr. Nimoy started to host Ancient Mysteries (a modern take on In Search Of...) and was just as much fun to watch. There's no way I can express how much he helped shape my mind and approach to life, nor can I thank him for being a bright spot in a dark time. While his role as Spock is iconic, his contributions through these shows are what made Mr. Nimoy a hero to me. Here is my favorite episode, which STILL scares me when it's late at night, and all the lights are off smile emoticon

A classroom of 30 children, on tax-free property, paid for with ultra low-interest long-term bonds, working only 3/4 of the year, 6 hrs per day costs taxpayers **$300,000 per year**.  Even if you pay the whining flunky who is teaching skills ostensibly learned in 4th grade to 4th graders $100K per year, that still leaves $200,000 per year profit on each room to the enterprise.  Nice business if you can get it.

Another way of looking at it is that **we pay each student $130,000-$260,000** to get from kindergarten to 12th grade.  This is **enough to buy outright a modest house** for each poor slob who likely will never afford a house in his/her lifetime, just like his/her renter parents.

I spent years on steroids and a long list of meds to treat Crohn's, ended with me losing a large chunk of my insides. I wont claim cannabis cured me but the difference to my life is, well - life changing. Don't fucking target people for nothing more than trying to live as best they can.

EDIT2: Cheers mate, no idea what to do with it :)

For those asking how Cannabis helps I can only answer from personal experience, Crohn's is an auto-immune condition that can manifest almost anywhere but as noted most often it kicks us in the ass, or near to it.
For me I lost about 1/3rd large intestine and a few feet of small. The daily effects (from years of crohn's, crohn's meds and surgery) are pain, nausea, vommiting, bad drops in appetitie, spasms, feeling like you have been kicked in the nuts really hard etc Pretty much go down the list and cannabis helps, I could use the 'real' medicines but for most the impact on me is far worse than pot - the nausea meds for example leave me in near stupor for near 24 hours.

To all my fellow ""ass warriors"" - hang in there, been about 4 years since a bad episode and not a twinge in 2. If you are going to self medicate though please be smart, small doses is all that's needed and don't suddenly stop existing meds ffs, that can kill ya. Hopefully soon the added worries of criminality will be removed from the equation.

mikeappell,,,"[Here's the video, for those who haven't seen.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0gxbCg5_jk)

Having watched it, I can understand why the police officer felt his life were endangered enough to fire his weapon.

Was he justified in doing so? That's up to the grand jury and eventually regular jury that will presumably hear this case. But from what I've seen and read:

1) The officer who fired had arrested Reid in the past, and presumably recognized him. And that Reid had, thirteen years ago, been sent to jail for shooting at police officers, something which the officer was presumably aware of as he knew him personally. So the officer was aware that he had a history of violence against police.

2) The officer saw a weapon in the glove compartment, and reached into the car to pull it out. That was visible from the video. So it was established that there was at least one, presumably illegal (since Reid or the driver never stopped to mention that he had a license) firearm in the car.

*Edit:* I'm told that in many states you don't need a license to have a firearm in your vehicle, and that it isn't required to tell an officer if you do [though other people have told me that in Jersey, firearms in vehicles must be kept in closed cases, and not directly accessible.] Nonetheless, the officer being aware of Reid's history of shooting at police officers combined with knowing there was at least one firearm in the vehicle makes it understandable that he was extremely tense concerning his own personal safety.

3) Reid apparently disregarded the officer's orders to keep his hands where they could be seen, and apparently continually made motions like he was reaching for something. I say this because for nearly a full minute, the only interactions between Reid and the officer were the officer repeatedly telling him to stay still, and keep his hands in sight. I have a hard time imagining the officer repeating this order 10 times if Reid had simply put his hands on the dash and stopped moving completely.

*Edit:* Several people have pointed out that the officer at various points gave conflicting instructions: get out of the car versus stay still and keep your hands visible. However, the instructions to his partner to ""get him out of the car"" were given all the way at the beginning of the altercation, and every subsequent instruction to Reid was ""don't move"" and ""show me your hands."" Logically, Reid should have followed the later orders, but logic doesn't always win when somebody has a gun thrust into your car window.

4) Reid then got out of the car, on the same side as the officer was, against orders. When Reid exited the car, he was within three feet of the officer, and close enough to rush him if he decided to. I completely understand why the officer felt threatened by Reid as he exited the car.

5) From the video, it seems like the officer tried to prevent Reid from exiting the vehicle by pushing with all his weight against the door to keep it closed. If so, that's a pretty clear indication for Reid to not leave the vehicle. However, I've had other people suggest that the officer was trying to pull the door *open*. Now, every single verbal order to Reid was to stay in the car; however, if the officer were trying to pull the door open, it's somewhat more understandable for him to exit the vehicle.

All of this, to me, adds up to a very understandable reason as to why Reid ended up shot. But I'm not on the jury, and they'll presumably have access to far more information than I do right now. My point is that, to me, this is clearly not an open-and-shut case of ""officer shoots unarmed man without cause.""

*Le Grand Edit:* I'm not arguing that this is a clear cut case. I'm not saying that the officer was clearly justified in shooting Reid. I'm trying to remind people that it's very easy to come into a situation with a preexisting bias, and due to recent events in this country as well as the various media circuses surrounding them, a **lot** of people are stringently anti-cop or pro-cop. But each situation like this needs to be taken on its own merits, and it's important to weigh the facts as they're presented.

To me, it's far too early to conclusively say that the officer was justified in shooting Reid, or even whether he over-reacted to the situation he was presented with. However, and I recognize these things are subjective, it seems very clear that the officer was sincere in his feeling threatened by Reid, and that the reasons for that stand up to scrutiny, and so I'm inclined to give the officer the benefit of the doubt.

goalposts,,,"I'm going to have a quick go at explaining why I think this 'exhibit/contest' is really fucked up. Please remember that in no way am I saying that the shooters were justified, or something fucked up like that. **Of course they are not**.

The first problem is that this kind of event is designed only to inflame and offend people. It is a demonstration of free speech, sure, but it is does nothing to actually further the cause. There is no threat of a new law criminalizing drawings of Muhammad. It is not designed to create any change in government policy, aside from perhaps anti-immigration, which is only tangentially related to Islamic issues, in the case of the USA.

The next issue: while the people at events like these believe that Muslim people should adopt 'U.S. values', the event accomplishes exactly the opposite. Because the contest foremost exists to inflame, it actively pursues the goal of alienating (and potentially radicalising) Muslim people. It is an attempt to expand, not reduce, the divide between the two groups. Imagine how you would feel if you were walking down the street (in your hometown or abroad) to see some people setting your country's flag on fire. You go home that night, and the media tells you you're not trying hard enough to fit in with the flag-burners.

Burning flags is a very good parallel, I think. Even when it's legal to burn the flag, it's fair enough to say that nobody is burning the flag to keep themselves warm. People burn flags to communicate things to the people represented by that flag. In the USA, this is in fact the Supreme Court interpretation of the act. Honestly, setting aside the rhetoric, what is being communicated in these drawings?

It's also important to point out that 'U.S. values' at their core are just as much about freedom of speech as they are about simple kindness. If you have reverence for the work of the Framers, the amendments, and so on, you should also be able to recognize that the spirit of these laws is to improve the lives of the citizenry. The contest does nothing to accomplish that. In fact, it gets pretty fucking hard to pursue happiness (your inalienable right), when your neighbors are hosting competitions whose purpose is to make you unhappy.

Finally: for fuck's sake, the contest prize was $10,000. Can you imagine how far that money could go toward ameliorating divisions between people in the USA? Baltimore is **rioting** because of these kinds of divisions. Why not attempt to foster peace?

*Reports of the raid being a 'no-knock raid' as I had written are unconfirmed eyewitness accounts only. Granted, those eyewitnesses were inside the house, but there is no official report indicating such.

**EDIT: Just to address a few things:** 

I commented below, but for anyone curious, Derek Cruice had two prior arrest records in 2009 and 2010. Both times were for possession of marijuana. One was a felony charge (over 20 grams), which was dismissed by the prosecution. The other was a misdemeanor charge (under 20 grams) to which Derek Cruice pleaded 'no contest'. There had been nothing in the 5 years since then, although the official police statement says they had been organizing this raid for some time. (Information via a [link to the county records](https://app02.clerk.org/cr_inq/) provided by /u/Afboy365)  

Whether he was dealing or just smoking himself, a judge in a court of law wouldn't have sentenced him to death, and he should not have died for such a crime. Marijuana possession is legal in some parts of our country, and will likely be legal in Florida within some years.  

Lastly, DO NOT ATTEMPT TO FIND OR MAKE CONTACT WITH DEPUTY TODD RAIBLE. His part in this is done, and if there is justice to be had, he will have his day in court. It's more than he gave Derek, but it's the way we have to do things. Violence should not beget more violence, no more than this should just be swept under the rug.

YeastCoastForever,,,"&gt;We need to work with our students, to change the perception that the police are the enemy.

Yeah I think that change will happen by itself when the police stop acting like the enemy. Yes yes, only a small percentage of cops are brutal dickheads, but if someone baked you 50 chocolate chip cookies and told you that one of the cookies had little bits of shit instead of chips, you're not gonna eat any of them are you, even though the chances of getting the shit-cookie is 2%.

EDIT: Ok I'm getting a lot of angry people in my inbox, pointing out that this basic analogy can be applied to validate racism/bigotry what have you, and I see how it's worded and you're not wrong, it's a big blanket statement. So I think I should expand on my opinion. First of all, I wouldn't say I advocate ""police hatred"", more like ""police caution"". Someone brought up an ad that used a similar analogy comparing poisoned M&amp;M's to men, and that also seemed like it was saying ""Hey, there's a few sick bastards out there who wanna rape you, so be smart and exercise caution ladies,"" not ""AVOID ALL MEN THEY'RE GONNA RAPE YOU LIKE A 10%-POISONED HANDFUL OF M&amp;M's WOULD"".

Secondly, no, I do not think that the shit-cookie analogy should apply to any grouping of people, probably even shouldn't be applied to most groups of people. Some people are shitty, that's a side effect of humanity, not due to their race or gender or religion. However, I think there are certain exceptions, such as the police force, other organizations of powerful people whose actions can have a huge impact on us normal peoples' lives. When you take a position of power like that, you are taking on a solemn responsibility to not be a doucherocket, to hold yourself above the moral standards of your average joe. Sure, mistakes will be made, everyone's human, but we should be able to detect them more easily and hold officers more accountable; furthermore, these said errors should not be grievous moral missteps that end with a body and a 2 month paid leave.

beleca,,,"I think it's pretty obvious what happened.  This girl was an art major.  She had to do her thesis, and she came up with the mattress idea, which, honestly, is perfect given how the art world works these days: its salacious, controversial, easily explained (e.g. in a newspaper article), requires no real technical proficiency, deals with a favorite pet political issue of the modern art-buying left, and lends itself well to the kind of hype that sells art.  Theres even mattress-based precedents like ""Everyone I've Ever Slept With"", which is a defining work of the YBA period, and was hyped by Saatchi and Tate until it sold for millions (but if I was a struggling, talented visual artist, I'd look at this and call it hack, cliche, all the stuff good thought-provoking art isn't supposed to be).  



The only problem was that she hadn't been raped.  She knew she couldnt just pick a random guy to accuse of rape; that'd be too easily disproved.   But the idea was too good to pass up, so she thought ""well, I did have sex with him, and he was kinda shitty to me, and no one can really prove that he didn't rape me, so if there's a little collateral damage,  who cares?  Bigger picture: I get to be an artist and rape culture makes the news.  Everyone wins.  Except maybe the guy"".


If there was any more thought put into this in the planning stages,  it wasn't much more.  And she figured that worst possible scenario, hes found to be innocent in a year or two, but by then I'll already have commissions coming in and speaking engagements and work as a professional artist.  And she wasn't making the accusation to a cop, she was making it ""in her art"", so the worst thing she could get sued for would be slander or something related to his reputation, and suing her wouldn't even be worth the cost of the lawyer.


So she wins.  There are absolutely no consequences for what she did, and even if it gets proven false without a shadow of a doubt,  there will still be hordes of feminists defending her.  When people talk about ""raising the price"" of intentional false rape claims, the refrain from feminists is ""but that will discourage real victims from reporting for fear that if they cant prove it, they'll go to jail"".  Unfortunately, thats a risk we're going to have to take.  How much is a man's reputation worth?  How about a year in jail?  Or an expulsion?  Rape is horrible and real rapists need to go to jail, but there has to be some competing risk that will make a woman think twice before ruining a man's life with a false accusation.

fucking_hate_peta,,,"I worked in wild animal rehab for three years.  For those of you who don't know, the ultimate goal of rehabbing wild animals is to get them to the point of being able to be released back into their natural environment.  The point is NOT to make friends with the animals, because if they become human-friendly they'll almost certainly be killed, or become dangerous to humans.  If an animal does become too human-friendly it can't be released and the only thing you can do is euthanize it or make it into a demonstration animal.  We went to great lengths to make sure this didn't happen unless the animal was already non-releasable (e.g., a bird with a missing wing).

PETA members were a pain to us in two different ways.  First, the less extreme members would volunteer but had no actual interest in doing any real work.  They were there to demonstrate that their 'special relationship with the Great Mother Gaia' would allow them to charm any animal into their arms, as if life was somehow a fucking Disney movie.  Of course, the animals were wild and therefore having none of it, and the stupid PETA cunts would invariably wait until they weren't being monitored, sneak into a cage, corner a damned animal (which at this point was scared shitless), and then they'd get attacked.  This happened EVERY SINGLE TIME.  They honestly believed that their special snowflake status would work some weird voodoo on the animal, who would then become their best friend.  Instead, they'd get bit/scratched/torn up and need treatment which we could ill afford, and this after doing their best to avoid anything that smacked of actual labor.

Best part?  Almost every time these dumb motherfuckers would go ballistic and blame US - yes, US - for the animal being hostile.  They'd say that we ""brainwashed"" or ""tortured"" the animal, and they knew that because - ta da! - the animal would never have attacked them otherwise.  We'd done something horrible to the animal, which is why it couldn't tell some random nasty human apart from a sacred PETA butt-boy.  As much as we loved volunteer labor, we eventually added a question to our interview process that asked folks if they were part of PETA, and if they answered affirmatively we'd say we already had enough volunteers but we would be sure to get back to them when we had an opening.

The second kind of PETA member would try to sneak onto the property and open cages to scare the animals out.  We're talking about badly injured animals, or orphans, who'd be dead in a few days, if that.  Fortunately we had a couple of ""attack lamas"" and some very territorial dogs, and they'd always raise a ruckus when these assholes came around.  I gotta say, it was fucking hilarious to see some PETA dipshit running full bore, screaming, with two pissed-off lamas on his heels.  Note:  the lamas were generally mild-mannered, but for some reason they'd go nuts if anyone who wasn't on staff, or with staff, tried to open a cage.

Aside from seeing a PETA freak chased by lamas, my best moment was seeing a passle of PETA (three, iirc) trying to deal with a great horned owl in the hospital section of the center.  The great horned owl is a large bird, and this guy was a monster for his species.  They opened his cage, he objected to them trying to towel and grab him, and he flew out (not far, his wing was injured).  They thought that they could talk him into calming down (PETA magic), but the owl had already decided they were assholes and any time they'd get near he'd spread his wings (very impressive for this guy) and shriek.

I walk into the hospital to find the owl loose and three PETA types babbling at him, they tell me they ""don't need help"".  Sure you don't, which is why the owl is loose, flying around on an injured wing, and screeching - which is something they only do when they're really distressed.  So, I hold out my arm, wait until the owl is focused on me, and say ""here"".  The owl takes off and lands on my arm, careful not to tear it to shreds with his massive claws as I'm not wearing a glove.  Great horned owls are bloody smart birds.  PETA pricks are speechless, then become almost savagely angry - the jealousy is obvious, as a worthless meat-eating 'prole' has somehow managed to outdo them in the space of a few seconds.  I'm senior on staff, so I order them out of the hospital, telling them I'm going to cover the rest of their shift.  They object, I tell them to get the hell out or face the consequences with the center owner, and they finally leave.

What they didn't know is that when I was young I worked on farms and was a bona fide animal charmer.  Only kids are real animal charmers - it wears off once you hit puberty - but I still had some of the mojo.  Because of this, the animals at the center were much calmer and far more cooperative with me than anyone else.  When the owl came in he took an instant liking to me, so I'd let him out of his cage will I did hospital rounds, sitting on my arm or shoulder.  He was always very careful not to turn my body into hamburger with his claws and grateful to get out of the cage to stretch his wings for a bit, so it worked out very well all around.  When the owl saw me he instantly took up his usual place because we'd done this before and he most likely saw me as a protector against the crazed PETA predators who were trying to eat him.

The three I kicked out were tossed from the volunteer program.  They went and complained to the owner of the center, who told them to get lost and never come back.  That was the final straw in terms of us deciding to reject any volunteer who was affiliated with PETA (i.e., they chased an injured animal around the hospital rather than get help as they were trained to do, lengthening his recovery time and putting him in danger of sustaining even worse injuries).

DickWhiskey,,,"We discussed this recent decision in some depth at /r/law and I think that it's appropriate to explain it a little bit here. There is an important distinction in this opinion between stating *scientific fact* versus stating *religious opinion*. 

In this opinion, the judge essentially ruled that it is consumer fraud to state as a *scientific fact* that homosexuality is a mental disorder or that it can be cured (e.g., ""Scientists believe that homosexuality is a disease and our program cures it!""). But the judge finds that it would not be fraud to state that you, or your company, has the *opinion* that homosexuality is a mental disorder or can be cured (e.g., ""We believe that homosexuality is a disease and our religious program cures it!""). 

In doing so, the court is able to punish false statements concerning conversion therapy but still allows protected First Amendment speech regarding opinions. The opinion also made some other findings - one was that a conversion therapy program couldn't state that it had a success rate without some sort of data to base it on (the company claimed a high success rate but never collected any data to support it). You can read in more detail about it (including the opinion itself, at this /r/law thread [HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/law/comments/2vjh72/new_jersey_judge_rules_that_socalled_conversion/). 

EDIT: There's a bit of misunderstanding that I didn't anticipate. Some people believe that the judge is making this determination himself. To be abundantly clear, he is not. In a civil case like this, both sides present expert witnesses who testify as to their positions. The judge acts as the ""gatekeeper"" - he determines whether the opinions are scientific and reliable. There are whole treatises on how that is done properly, but to keep it short, in New Jersey the judge is required to determine if the opinions are based on techniques that are in general acceptance in the scientific community (also called the Frye standard):

&gt;In New Jersey, reliability of a scientific technique can
be proven in most cases by showing its ""general acceptance in the
particular field in which it belongs."" Frye v. United States, 293
F. 1013, 1014 (D.C. Cir. 1923); Windmere, Inc. v. Int'l Ins. Co.,
105 N.J. 373, 385, 522 n. 2 (1987); State v. Harvey, 151 N.J. 117,
169-7 0 (19 97). 

&gt;General acceptance of an area of research or
expertise can be established in one of three ways:
(1) by expert testimony as to the general
acceptance, among those in the profession, of
the premises on which the proffered expert
witness based his or her analysis; (2) **by
authoritative scientific and legal writings
indicating that the scientific community
accepts the premises underlying the proffered
testimony;** and (3) by judicial opinions that
indicate the expert's premises have gained
general acceptance.

In this case, the judge heard from several expert witnesses on both sides, who submitted reports and testimony in support of their opinions. He published a previous evidentiary opinion on this issue, which can be found [HERE](http://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/downloads/case/jonahopinion.pdf), and expressly relied upon that opinion in the one linked by OP. The judge found that some of the experts on the defense side did not meet the expert standards. In addition, he outlined a number of reasons why he concluded that the *scientific community* (not himself) does not believe that homosexuality is a mental disorder:

&gt;""The court also relies upon the **numerous studies** attached as exhibits to the Bensman Certification in support of Plaintiffs' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, which support the contention that **homosexuality is a natural variation of human sexuality**.""

...

&gt;Countless organizations have
followed the APA's lead in removing homosexuality from its listings
of mental disorders; these include the World Health Organization
(WHO), the Royal College of Psychiatrists, the APA, and the
American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. See
Certification of Lina Bensman, Exhibit 75. That scientific
conclusion also has been embraced as part of the public policy of
the State of New Jersey. See N.J.S.A. 45:1-54(a) declaring that,
in light of scientific community's finding, **""[b]eing lesbian, gay,
or bisexual is not a disease, disorder, illness, deficiency, or
shortcoming. The major professional associations of mental health
practitioners and researchers in the United States have recognized
this fact for nearly 40 years""**); see also King v. Governor of the
State of N.J., 767 F.3d 216, 238 (3d Cir. 2014) (affirming N.J.S.A.
45:1-54's prohibition against providing [conversion] counseling to minors
and noting that 'legislatures are entitled to rely on the
empirical judgments of independent professional organizations that
possess specialized knowledge and experience concerning the professional practice under review, particularly when this
community has spoken with such urgency and solidarity on the
subject""). JONAH hardly can argue that all of these organizations
-- including a federal appellate court -- were the victims of
manipulation by ""gay lobbying"" groups. Regardless, it is not up
to this court to decide that question. . . .

&gt;In contrast to Rubanick, the theory that homosexuality is a
disorder is not novel but -- like the notion that the earth is
flat and the sun revolves around it -- instead is outdated and
refuted. Homosexuality was listed as a mental disorder in the DSM
until its removal in 1973. Although the DSM has added newly
recognized disorders as a result of evolving understandings of the
medical field, this case presents the opposite situation: **the APA
removed homosexuality from the DSM upon concluding that it was not
a disorder.** JONAH has not identified any case that provides a
standard for the admission of obsolete and discredited scientific
theories. **By definition, such theories are unreliable and can
offer no assistance to the jury**, but rather present only confusion
and prejudice. . . .

&gt;The existence of a
minority of conversion therapy proponents does not and cannot
negate the fact that **the DSM and its exclusion of homosexuality
are generally accepted in the mental health field.**

So, to summarize, the judge did not find any scientific fact himself. He relied upon the DSM, statements from the APA, numerous other organizations that have followed the APA's determination, as well as laws passed in NJ, to find that it is generally accepted in the scientific community that homosexuality is not a mental disorder.

tristemono,,,"I honestly couldn't even finish the article. By the time the author had suggested that putting her child on a gluten-free diet had made a difference, she had lost all credibility for me.

I have several close family members &amp; friends that suffer from ADD and ADHD. It is not a fallacy. It is a mental disorder that affects every minute of their lives. It varies from person to person, but my sister has straight Fs in school right now because she can't focus in school, can't remember where she put her homework, can't finish the homework, and forgets to turn it in. She takes extra time to finish her tests, and often doesn't read the questions thoroughly enough to pick the right answer. But when she takes her (very carefully measured) medication, it's as if her mind and her body - formerly trapped at different, frantic paces - can finally catch up to one another, synchronize like two gears, and then slow each other down to a normal, balanced level. She still struggles, but she can manage her life so much better.

While I understand that America has a very real dependence on the pharmaceutical industry which needs to be corrected, it's a logical fallacy to use anecdotal evidence to make the sweeping statement that ADHD (and its spectrum) is not a true disorder. I agree with the author's point that other countries, with their longer recess times, have lower numbers of diagnoses. But the fact that other countries still diagnose individuals with ADHD should, in and of itself, show that ADHD is a real issue! By proposing that ADHD symptoms can be fixed by joining sports or avoiding artificial colorings, the author is doing a disservice to all of the individuals that suffer from the disorder and aren't helped by an extra half-hour on the playground.

Let me be clear: I am not saying that I believe every diagnosis of ADHD is correct. I'm a huge supporter of tightening the boundaries for an ADHD diagnosis, because when your diagnosis rests on the idea of being excitable or inattentive you're basically describing every 4-year old I've ever met. And I've met several people that have convinced their doctors to give them a prescription because they're ""sure they have ADD"". All of these things are issues that need to be fixed in order to give credibility to the very real disorder that affects people's abilities to live their lives. But to call ADHD diagnoses a war on childhood and boyhood, and to imply that parents are pumping their children full of mental steroids and speed, is so gross that I can't even finish my rebuttal.

I'm pretty shocked that this author got published.

Edit: missed an apostrophe

Edit 2: Like I said in a comment: the idea that the discoverer of ADHD (Dr. Leon Eisenberg) had renounced the disorder on his deathbed is a hoax. The original interview can be found [here](http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-83865282.html) if you read German. Otherwise, I'll explain: Google Translate, as an automated process, mistranslated the man's words (who was not on his deathbed, but making coffee in his kitchen 2 years before dying). He had expressed concern that it was over-diagnosed, but never said anything to imply that he had fabricated the disorder to make money. Please stop throwing this hoax around in the comments; the guy who spread the hoax makes money off of claiming that doctors invent disorders.

I was in this exact situation fifteen years ago (throwaway for obvious reasons) I was sitting on my porch this time with a knife when the police came up and asked me what i was doing. I told them i was going to kill myself. They asked me to put down the knife but i didn't. Instead of shooting me they just asked me to sit cross legged (i guess they wanted me to slow me down in case i went crazy and wanted to attack them). Then you know what they did? The office got a lawn chair (from my neighbors house) and fucking TALKED to me for two hours. 

He threw me a coke a couple times during those hours and and three other squad cars showed up. You know what they did? They asked if i wanted a burger (i didn't). Meanwhile the first cop kept talking to me and asking what;s wrong. I cried like a fucking baby as i explained to him why i wanted to kill myself. Finally I got up and threw them the knife like they asked and they took me to the hospital. Didn't even cuff me after i gave them the knife. Just asked me to get in the back of the squad car. 

Where the fuck did those cops go? These cops that shoot people aren't the cops i remember. Whatever happened to the good cops? 

Gawd fuck. I feel so bad for this guy. If the cop that came to me came to this guy. I;m 100% sure he'd still be alive and in 15 years he'd be telling this same story.

WhynotstartnoW,,,"The Keystone XL pipeline is a made up political controversy, and virtually no one debating it knows what they are talking about.

Facts: Bush+Cheney and the respective congress approved phase one of the project, and Obama+Biden and the democratic senate approved phase two and three.

Phase one through three of the Keystone XL pipeline travel from Alberta to Port Arthur and Houston on the gulf coast of Texas.

Phase three was completed and commissioned in January of 2014. The pipeline has been pumping tar sands crude from Alberta to refineries on the gulf coast for *A WHOLE YEAR NOW!*

What the current phase, phase four, being 'debated' in congress right now will do is shorten the developed length of the *currently operational* pipeline by several hundred miles by bypassing Manitoba, Saskatchewan, North Dakota and most of South Dakota by instead passing from Alberta to Montana to Nebraska(instead of the current path which travels east through Manitoba and Saskatchewan then south through ND, SD, and Nebraska).

The pipeline currently being *debated* in congress will not increase or decrease the amount of crude being pumped through it, the same amount will be entering everyday at the injection sites and the same amount will be exiting at the refineries. The proposed bypass would simply make it slightly cheaper per barrel to push through. 

**Again: The Keystone XL pipeline is currently pumping at capacity and the proposed bypass will not change the capacity at all.**

Everyone will ignore this like they do every time this subject comes up, they will just remain in their fantasy land of massive made up political controversies without even bothering to do a google search on the subject, not a single person in this thread should not know that the pipeline is currently operational and pumping yet all the top comment threads are all people talking about how we shouldn't let them pipe through our country as if it already isn't.

Approving or not approving of this pipeline will not affect how much crude is transported by truck or train in the slightest, idk where people are even getting that argument from..

Also if you're not a member of the Teamsters, The United Association of Pipefitters, or the International Brotherhood of Electricians or are not affiliated with the AFL CIO, you're not gonna being seeing one of these positions on the pipeline.

This is probably the most frustrating political topic of the decade so far. Seriously, why did no one care when Bush and Obama approved the actual pipeline, but now everyone is up in arms about a small little section of it which will have virtually no affect on anything at all. If Obama and the Democrats actually cared about this why are they making their 'stand' at this point instead of doing it when it might have actually stopped the oil from flowing? seriously....

Edit: From the environmental standpoint: This proposed bypass will pass over the same aquifers that it is currently pumping over, but the foot print of the pipeline over those aquifers will be significantly reduced.

NoJustice_NoPeas,,,"A lot of these comments are pretty bad. To assert that the letter is fake without any evidence is on par with asserting that a rape accusation is fake, without any evidence. It's classic denialism and victim blaming. And there is no basis to assume it isn't real, except for anterior motives that would predispose one to make that claim.

The fact is that the United States is a country with an exceptionally bad problem in respect to racism. Not only slavery, but racist laws that have persisted *up until this very day.* It isn't a shock that people still receive this kind of harassment. And it isn't uncommon, either. I'd wager that most people who have said it isn't real, though, have never experienced this kind of racism and harassment because they are not minorities.

My last case ever was from a drug raid on a friends house I had visited after work. They took my entry into the house as a drug deal, and chose that moment to kick the door down, storming in with 12 police officers, 6 DEA agents, and 2 FBI agents, shooting the owners two dogs, and arrested everyone in the house for a grand total of a blunt roach worth of weed.

##Ladies and Gentlemen,  

##My fingers are tired now.  Thank you for following and thank you for the Gold!

##There is a right way and a wrong way to police, govern, report and discuss.  Many mistakes were made on all sides.  

##No other nation would have allowed or withstood that which our nation has had the freedom to do in just 24 hours!

##It is because of what started long before 1776, and those who fought before us and those that formed the U.S. Constitution that we have the right to freedom of speech, freedom to assemble, freedom of the press and the freedom to bear arms...and yes, water that tree of Liberty every now and then!!

##THIS! This that you just watched and read, is what makes America ""The Greatest Nation On Earth"".

##May she heal and may we learn from this.

##Goodnight and God bless,

Making someone feel shame for outwardly expressing joy in a way is a silent violent act and can do more damage to a person than any physical act of violence.  Shame and emotional harm is held within where no one else can see how much damage was created.  Some people are so hurt by silent violence acts you could equate it to crashing into a wall without a seatbelt or an airbag.

I'm seeing a lot of comments saying things like ""oh he's only doing it for his own reasons"" or ""he shouldn't do this, it's only going to perpetuate poverty"" and my response is, who the fuck cares what his reasons are? This may be a little presumptuous for me to say, because I can only afford minimal donations, but I have done an extensive amount of volunteer work, started and organized literacy programs, and lived in developing nations. In the end, none of the people he's benefiting are going to give a shit about what his personal reasons were for giving the money. People don't realize how desperate some individuals are for help, because there is no way for them to help themselves.

You could hear the guy in cuffs in the back slide across the metal bench and slam so hard into the metal wall separating him from the guards that the van shook. We all heard him scream in pain.

The regulations will help prevent unfair practices from stifling competition. It prohibits telecommunications companies from creating paid prioritization for companies that can afford it and pushing companies that can't into a 'slow lane' connection. This is beneficial to you as the consumer because it ensures that when you go to ANY (legal) website, your path to the site will not be blocked, rate limited, or impeded in any way. This also removes the restrictions enacted on a state level that has restricted competition. There are state laws that block municipal broadband because bigger telcos have the money to fill the coffers of local officials enough to vote in their favor. So the next Google Fiber site or local community can now vote for municipal broadband without worrying about a state law that prevents them from building their own.

I say this after having worked for some of the biggest ISP's in the world for over 12 years. We make money, LOTS of money. Interconnect fees are cheap in comparison to the profit generated per customer (residential or commercial). We have emails floating back and forth literally gloating how much profit we'd made. I've also been part of projects that throttle traffic, not because we didn't have the infrastructure or bandwidth to support the hub site, but because we wanted to squeeze more out of the customer. 

As someone who has a lot of experience in the industry, this is a long time coming.

bearchyllz,,,"If the dogs were violent, or killing livestock, I would have to stand by his choice to put them down. My grandparents used to own land with a lot of chickens and it was in rural Arkansas, animal control didn't give two shits about the fact that these basically feral dogs (the man who owned these dogs had around 25 that ran together and were incredibly violent to people and animals alike) and didn't do anything to stop them. My grandpa warned the man at least ten times to keep them caged up. Then when one almost attacked and would have surely killed me, my grandpa started cleaning house. Anytime one came in the yard, he took out his .38 and shot it in the head. I LOVE dogs. I love all animals. However, there are circumstances in which this kind of action is needed. As for posting on social media, he is obviously a fucking asshole. My grandpa took no pride in killing these dogs and buried every one of them, and called the owner every time to tell him. All in all in about 6 months he had killed all but two, the only two that came in the yard and were friendly and didn't kill the livestock. He actually adopted one and it sadly passed away a couple years ago.

This is Islam. Branches formed out of Islam are different. But this right here, this is Islam. What you as a human being can make out of this pile of shit is your Islam and that's it.

Islam is an oppressive, beyond ridiculous religion that wants you to smite infidels and cut ties with any non-muslims while making sure your women (because why not have 7 its not like they arent cattle lel) wear headscarves because other dudes might see your wifes hair and get a boner and suddenly fuck them because they can't control themselves. I won't argue these points and how culture affected them and whatever. In its core, this shit exists and it exists because it's written in the book.

Yes sufism is different in that Mevlana only cares about reaching Allah by himself. See the difference? No books, no medium between human and God. Only the experience of reaching God. That's a different thing.

Yes, at the age of 18 google taught me how a woman has a baby.


So as you can imagine I wasn't around a ton of girls, except my older sister, younger sister (Rachael), some at church, some hot babes at pokemon, etc. Rachel was especially close to me and in my mother's words ""she was your shadow"". I did everything with them, hell we even bathed together. I unfortunately remember a time when I was bathing with Rachael and I had her lay down in the bath tub and I tried to get on top of her. Thankfully, she didn't let me. Also, another time while she was on the computer I got on her chair and had her sit on my lap. I was trying to get her to sit on my erect penis (through my shorts and through her clothes so absolutely no penetration). We were probably both teenagers at the time and I absolutely cringe and am ashamed when I think of it and I can only hope she doesn't remember it. But as I said, I did not know that was wrong, I didn't even know exactly why I was doing it. I was just horny and she was a girl who was my best friend.



There was another time when Rachael and I were laying down together and we made up a ""game"" where she had to find a ball under the covers. Turns out that was just so she could get under the covers and dry hump me. After playing it for a couple of minutes I called her out on it so she stopped and left the room. I wouldn't call her a sexual pervert and I don't think anyone else should. I don't remember our ages but she probably wasn't even a teenager at that time and neither of us really knew what we were doing, we just knew it felt good and was exciting. And if you're wondering, my sister and I did NOT ever actually have sex of any kind.



There are a couple more stories similar to these and I regret them all. I am her older brother and I should not have done them, but that's what you get when you mix zero sex knowledge and isolate kids. I wouldn't call myself a pervert as I don't believe my past actions, when I was an ignorant and isolated kid, should by held against me now. As for this Duggard boy, I don't know exactly what he did and or what he knew about sex, but I can only imagine his upbringing was similar to mine. I feel sorry for him as I doubt he knew what he was doing and I can only imagine how much he regrets it. I don't regret my parents home schooling me and I am still a Christian. However,  I think they could have handled sex education better but who knows maybe I'm just a pervert. All in all I think before anyone casts this man as a sexual predator and calls for his crucifixion, I kindly ask that one consider his upbringing and try putting themselves in his shoes.",1432331377,,1432345203,1,690,news,True,False,580,0,Afternoon,61+,12,50,"{u'probability': {u'neg': 0.855270921607466, u'neutral': 0.8168438682053581, u'pos': 0.14472907839253404}, u'label': u'neutral'}",0.855270921607,0.144729078393,0.816843868205,neutral,"{u'tone_categories': [{u'category_id': u'emotion_tone', u'tones': [{u'tone_name': u'Anger', u'score': 0.142188, u'tone_id': u'anger'}, {u'tone_name': u'Disgust', u'score': 0.495879, u'tone_id': u'disgust'}, {u'tone_name': u'Fear', u'score': 0.134677, u'tone_id': u'fear'}, {u'tone_name': u'Joy', u'score': 0.176946, u'tone_id': u'joy'}, {u'tone_name': u'Sadness', u'score': 0.56231, u'tone_id': u'sadness'}], u'category_name': u'Emotion Tone'}, {u'category_id': u'language_tone', u'tones': [{u'tone_name': u'Analytical', u'score': 0.604819, u'tone_id': u'analytical'}, {u'tone_name': u'Confident', u'score': 0.0, u'tone_id': u'confident'}, {u'tone_name': u'Tentative', u'score': 0.858564, u'tone_id': u'tentative'}], u'category_name': u'Language Tone'}, {u'category_id': u'social_tone', u'tones': [{u'tone_name': u'Openness', u'score': 0.483901, u'tone_id': u'openness_big5'}, {u'tone_name': u'Conscientiousness', u'score': 0.002389, u'tone_id': u'conscientiousness_big5'}, {u'tone_name': u'Extraversion', u'score': 0.238211, u'tone_id': u'extraversion_big5'}, {u'tone_name': u'Agreeableness', u'score': 0.935953, u'tone_id': u'agreeableness_big5'}, {u'tone_name': u'Emotional Range', u'score': 0.124728, u'tone_id': u'emotional_range_big5'}], u'category_name': u'Social Tone'}]}",0.142188,0.495879,0.134677,0.176946,0.56231,0.604819,0.0,0.858564,0.483901,0.002389,0.238211,0.935953,0.124728

zleepoutzide,,,"In 1973, prisoners took control of Walpole State Prison as part of a strike and it ran smoother than when the guards ran it. Civilian observers were let in and many said that the prison guards should never come back.

""In protest of their loss of control, the guards walked off the job. They thought this act would prove how necessary they were, but embarrassingly for them, it had the exact opposite effect. For two months, the prisoners ran the prison themselves. For much of that time, the guards were not present within the cell blocks, though state police controlled the prison perimeter to prevent escapes. Civilian observers were inside the prison twenty-four hours a day, but they were trained not to intervene; their role was to document the situation, talk with prisoners, and prevent violence from guards who sometimes entered the prison. One observer recounted:

""The atmosphere was so relaxed — not at all what I expected. I find that my own thinking has been so conditioned by society and the media. These men are not animals, they are not dangerous maniacs. I found my own fears were really groundless.""

Another observer insisted “It is imperative that none of the personnel formerly in Block 9 [a segregation block] ever return. It’s worth paying them to retire. The guards are the security problem.”

Walpole had been one of the most violent prisons in the country, but while the prisoners were in control, recidivism dropped dramatically and murders and rapes fell to zero. The prisoners had disproved two fundamental myths of the criminal justice system: that people who commit crimes should be isolated, and that they should be recipients of enforced rehabilitation rather than the ones who control their own healing.""

Rathadin,,,"Wow.  Buckle up Reddit, story time.

I grew up in this city.  My mother still lives in this city.  Just this past weekend I drove up there to see her.  When I was leaving to drive back home, around 8 p.m., at a fire station on Cleary Road in that town, two of those Dodge Charger police vehicles had pulled over... you guessed it... a young Black kid, in a nice car.  After all, he's black, and he's young, and he's driving a new $30,000 car.  Must be a drug dealer, right!

I drove down on Friday, May 15th.  Saturday morning, I was helping my mother move out a lot of old junk she didn't want, so we took it to the Richland City Dump. What did I see parked there?  A 2012 Dodge Ram 2500, painted black &amp; white, with the phrase on it that makes me want to actually kill these fuckers... ""Tearfully donated by a drug dealer.""  You mean, ""Illegally seized without adequate proof from a private citizen.""

This kind of shit really bothers the fuck out of me because of my military service.  Service is a tradition in my family.  My father served in the Army during Vietnam.  My grandfather served in the Navy during World War II in the Pacific theater.  I served in the Navy during the Iraq War.  To see so many rights trampled on, consistently and with alarming frequency really makes my blood boil.  Folks, you need to wake up.  You need to wake the fuck up.  Your freedoms are being stripped from you left and right, and if you don't start fighting back, its going to be too late.

I drive back and forth between where I live and Central Mississippi consistently, probably 2-3 times a month.  I drive through Richland all the time, and usually I drive through at night, because I like to avoid traffic on my way back home.  I don't even think I could count, just in the past seven years, that I've seen Black people pulled over by Richland police, usually with two or three patrol cars behind them.  And its **always. Black. people.**  Always.

This doesn't just happen in Richland either, it happens in Florence as well, which is a small town directly south of Richland.  These cops are crooked as shit too.  My mother has lived in Richland her entire life, and she knows all the dirt behind it.  Its a pretty sad state of affairs honestly.  They know where a lot of meth houses are, but they apparently won't bust them.  They'll wait for the meth heads to try to take the cash somewhere, then snatch it up!  ""Civil forfeiture!""

After all, why *stop* the production of drugs, when you can indirectly profit off of it with a nice new cushy police station and a new cruiser for yourself!

&gt; Dear ___________,
&gt; 
&gt; Consider the following statement by John Kerry in his farewell speech to the Senate —
&gt; 
&gt; ""The unending chase for money I believe threatens to steal our democracy itself. They know it. They know we know it. And yet, Nothing Happens!"" — John Kerry, 2-13
&gt; 
&gt; In a July 2012 Gallup poll, 87% tagged corruption in the federal government as extremely important or very important, placing this issue just barely behind job creation. According to Gallup, public faith in Congress is at a 41-year record low, 7%. (June 2014) Kerry is correct. The popular perception outside the DC beltway is that the federal government is corrupt and the US Congress is the major problem. As a voter, I’m a member of the only political body with authority over Congress. I’m demanding reform and declaring a voter’s rebellion in a manner consistent with Jefferson’s description of rights in the Declaration of Independence. As a member of Congress, you have three options.
&gt; 
&gt; 1.	You may pretend corruption does not exist.
&gt; 
&gt; 2.	You may pretend to oppose corruption while you sabotage reform.
&gt; 
&gt; 3.	You may actively participate in real reform.
&gt; 
&gt; If you’re considering option 1, you may wonder if voters really know what the 'chase for money' is. Your dismal and declining popularity documented by Gallup suggests we know, but allow a few examples, by no means a complete list. That these practices are legal does not make them right! Obviously, it is Congress who writes the laws that make corruption legal.
&gt; 
&gt; 1.	Dozens of major and very profitable corporations pay nothing in taxes. Voters know how this is done. Corporations pay millions to lobbyists for special legislation. Many companies on the list of freeloaders are household names — GE, Boeing, Exxon Mobil, Verizon, Citigroup, Dow …
&gt; 
&gt; 2.	Almost half of the retiring members of Congress from 1998 to 2004 got jobs as lobbyists earning on average fourteen times their Congressional salary. (50% of the Senate, 42% of the House)
&gt; 
&gt; 3.	The new democratic freshmen to the US House in 2012 were 'advised' by the party to schedule 4 hours per day on the phones fund raising at party headquarters (because fund raising is illegal from gov’t offices.) It is the donors with deep pockets who get the calls, but seldom do the priorities of the rich donor help the average citizen.
&gt; 
&gt; 4.	The relevant (rich) donors who command the attention of Congress are only .05% of the public (5 people in a thousand) but these aristocrats of both parties are who Congress really works for. As a member of the US Congress, you should work only for The People.
&gt; 
&gt; 1.	Not yourself.
&gt; 
&gt; 2.	Not your political party.
&gt; 
&gt; 3.	Not the richest donors to your campaign.
&gt; 
&gt; 4.	Not the lobbyist company who will hire you after your leave Congress.
&gt; 
&gt; There are several credible groups working to reform Congress. Their evaluations of the problem are remarkably in agreement though the leadership (and membership) may lean conservative or liberal. They see the corrupting effect of money — how the current rules empower special interests through lobbyists and PACs — robbing the average American of any representation on any issue where the connected have a stake. This is not democracy even if the ritual of elections is maintained.
&gt; 
&gt; The various mechanisms which funnel money to candidates and congress-persons are complex. It happens before they are elected, while they are in office and after they leave Congress. Fortunately, a solution to corruption is not complicated. All the proposals are built around either reform legislation or a Constitutional Amendment. Actually, we need both — a constitutional amendment and legislation.
&gt; 
&gt; There will be discussion about the structure and details of reform. As I see it, campaign finance reform is the cornerstone of building an honest Congress. Erect a wall of separation between our elected officials and big money. This you must do — or your replacement will do. A corporation is not 'people' and no individual should be allowed to spend hundreds of millions to 'influence' an election. That much money is a megaphone which drowns out the voices of 'We the People.' Next, a retired member of Congress has a lifelong obligation to avoid the appearance of impropriety. That almost half the retired members of Congress work as lobbyists and make millions of dollars per year smells like bribery, however legal. It must end. Pass real campaign finance reform and prohibit even the appearance of payola after retirement and you will be part of a Congress I can respect.
&gt; 
&gt; The states have the power to pass a Constitutional Amendment without Congress — and we will. You in Congress will likely embrace the change just to survive, because liberals and conservatives won’t settle for less than democracy. The leadership and organization to coordinate a voters revolution exist now! New groups will add their voices because the vast majority of Americans believe in the real democracy we once had, which Congress over time has eroded to the corrupt, dysfunctional plutocracy we have.
&gt; 
&gt; The question is where YOU individually stand. You have three options and you must choose.
&gt; 
&gt; Sincerely,
&gt;

gofokurself,,,"Been thinking about accretion: That comet looks like 2 different pieces have come together. How come the comet isn't a ball by now? After however many millions of years, there is still no complete ball formed. From what I can tell of other comets, they never really form a ball. 

I'm wondering if dense accretion can only occur near the center of the solar system?  As the rock passes magnetic objects, the iron in the comet becomes compressed and causes the comet to further compress, but as the comet leaves the center of the solar system, that magnetic force weakens and thus the comet stops compressing. As the comet only passes the sun a few dozen times in it's life, it never really gets a chance to fully compress and become dense.

millchopcuss,,,"Spoliation by Federal Officers should be a felony, in ALL cases. Destruction of documents by one officer of the government should not be taken to mean that said destruction is government policy. It is normally undertaken to thwart the work of other arms of government, and should be treated as a systemic threat to America.

Spoliation and perjury have made a mockery of our Police forces. It is fortunate that they heap so much honor and glory on themselves; I can no longer honor cops that I don't know personally, because as a group, spoliation and perjury and a thriving prison industry are all that they represent. Draconian laws have undermined all our communities, so they can't really claim to even be doing what they are supposedly *for*. I used to defer to the word of the Police; now I assume in all cases that charges of 'resisting arrest' and 'assault on an officer' are lies meant to thwart off attempts to hold them to account. This is a dishonorable state of affairs. It saddens me that they have pissed on their own brand like this, because I am a strong advocate of law and order. Still am, hence this rant.

If the system truly cannot: a.) resist locking up innocent persons, and  b.) succeed in locking up criminals acting under color of authority, then we will be seeing the whole notion of 'American Justice' come under wholesale attack. And rightfully so. The 13th amendment gives the US the authority to keep slaves. At present, it looks like that is all the system is for.

It gives me some bemusement to notice that wholesale surveillance is proving to be more of a problem for our authorities than it is for average folks. I'm not sure that the shoe wont be on the other foot eventually, but at this moment of our history, cameras everywhere really are bringing a pressure to make the country better.

The trouble is, it is DAs that drive the problems; DAs that work the system to, say, have a murderer cop exhonorated by bringing erroneous charges (I don't believe that was an accident, and why should I?). No DA has been meaningfully held to account for their role in undermining justice in our country, and so we are unlikely to see anything improve. It is THEY who tolerate 'testilying'.  It is they who engage in spoliation of evidence where it really matters. It is they who collude with police to enshrine violence as a normal policing tactic. We need to find a way to put the onus on *them*. We have placed them above the law; above judges; above holding to account in even the stinkiest of circumstances.

Dear ___________,

Consider the following statement by John Kerry in his farewell speech to the Senate —

""The unending chase for money I believe threatens to steal our democracy itself. They know it. They know we know it. And yet, Nothing Happens!"" — John Kerry, 2-13

In a July 2012 Gallup poll, 87% tagged corruption in the federal government as extremely important or very important, placing this issue just barely behind job creation. According to Gallup, public faith in Congress is at a 41-year record low, 7%. (June 2014) Kerry is correct. The popular perception outside the DC beltway is that the federal government is corrupt and the US Congress is the major problem. As a voter, I'm a member of the only political body with authority over Congress. I'm demanding reform and declaring a voter's rebellion in a manner consistent with Jefferson's description of rights in the Declaration of Independence. As a member of Congress, you have three options.

1. You may pretend corruption does not exist.

2. You may pretend to oppose corruption while you sabotage reform.

3. You may actively participate in real reform.

If you're considering option 1, you may wonder if voters really know what the 'chase for money' is. Your dismal and declining popularity documented by Gallup suggests we know, but allow a few examples, by no means a complete list. That these practices are legal does not make them right! Obviously, it is Congress who writes the laws that make corruption legal.

1. Dozens of major and very profitable corporations pay nothing in taxes. Voters know how this is done. Corporations pay millions to lobbyists for special legislation. Many companies on the list of freeloaders are household names — GE, Boeing, Exxon Mobil, Verizon, Citigroup, Dow …

2. Almost half of the retiring members of Congress from 1998 to 2004 got jobs as lobbyists earning on average fourteen times their Congressional salary. (50% of the Senate, 42% of the House)

3. The new democratic freshmen to the US House in 2012 were 'advised' by the party to schedule 4 hours per day on the phones fund raising at party headquarters (because fund raising is illegal from gov't offices.) It is the donors with deep pockets who get the calls, but seldom do the priorities of the rich donor help the average citizen.

4. The relevant (rich) donors who command the attention of Congress are only .05% of the public (5 people in a thousand) but these aristocrats of both parties are who Congress really works for. As a member of the US Congress, you should work only for The People.

1. Not yourself.

2. Not your political party.

3. Not the richest donors to your campaign.

4. Not the lobbyist company who will hire you after your leave Congress.

There are several credible groups working to reform Congress. Their evaluations of the problem are remarkably in agreement though the leadership (and membership) may lean conservative or liberal. They see the corrupting effect of money — how the current rules empower special interests through lobbyists and PACs — robbing the average American of any representation on any issue where the connected have a stake. This is not democracy even if the ritual of elections is maintained.

The various mechanisms which funnel money to candidates and congress-persons are complex. It happens before they are elected, while they are in office and after they leave Congress. Fortunately, a solution to corruption is not complicated. All the proposals are built around either reform legislation or a Constitutional Amendment. Actually, we need both — a constitutional amendment and legislation.

There will be discussion about the structure and details of reform. As I see it, campaign finance reform is the cornerstone of building an honest Congress. Erect a wall of separation between our elected officials and big money. This you must do — or your replacement will do. A corporation is not 'people' and no individual should be allowed to spend hundreds of millions to 'influence' an election. That much money is a megaphone which drowns out the voices of 'We the People.' Next, a retired member of Congress has a lifelong obligation to avoid the appearance of impropriety. That almost half the retired members of Congress work as lobbyists and make millions of dollars per year smells like bribery, however legal. It must end. Pass real campaign finance reform and prohibit even the appearance of payola after retirement and you will be part of a Congress I can respect.

The states have the power to pass a Constitutional Amendment without Congress — and we will. You in Congress will likely embrace the change just to survive, because liberals and conservatives won't settle for less than democracy. The leadership and organization to coordinate a voters revolution exist now! New groups will add their voices because the vast majority of Americans believe in the real democracy we once had, which Congress over time has eroded to the corrupt, dysfunctional plutocracy we have.

The question is where YOU individually stand. You have three options and you must choose.

Sincerely,

Lana_Phrasing,,,"Ok, I understand that people want to be outraged, as it's the fashionable thing to do nowadays, but has anyone actually bothered to [read the damned bill?](http://webserver1.lsb.state.ok.us/cf_pdf/2015-16%20ENGR/hB/HB1125%20ENGR.PDF) Much, if not all, of this outrage is completely manufactured bullshit. 

It is my understanding that none of the things listed in this story are actually what the bill is about, or actually does. It doesn't attack atheists or homosexuals by preserving state marriage licensing for the theistic heterosexual, nor does it make religious figures the only ones that can issue what would otherwise be a ""marriage license"". It does none of that.

What it really does, is take the state out of the marriage licensing game altogether, and instead allows for marriage certificates to be created by *either* ordained ministers of any denominational church or judges (sitting or retired). These certificates ***do not specify*** ""man"" and ""woman"" in the name fields of the statutory marriage certificate, instead labeling the fields ""first/second party"" and ""first/second spouse"". ***It does not define marriage along gender/sex or sexual orientation lines in any way.*** 

&gt; Section 7.A. Except as provided in subsection E of this
section, marriages must be contracted by a formal ceremony performed or solemnized in the presence of at least two adult, competent persons as witnesses, by a judge or retired judge of any court in this state, or an ordained or authorized preacher or minister of the Gospel, priest or other ecclesiastical dignitary of any denomination who has been duly ordained or authorized by the church to which he or she belongs to preach the Gospel, or a rabbi and who is at least eighteen (18) years of age.

&gt; ....

&gt; E. Marriages not contracted by a formal ceremony pursuant to subsection A of this section may be acknowledged by filing an affidavit of common law marriage with the court clerk. The affidavit of common law marriage shall be signed by both parties, notarized with official seal affixed and include:


The bill also, in its current iteration, allows for the filing of an affidavit of common law marriage with the clerk, which the bill decrees shall serve as the same proof of marriage or identification that a previous marriage license would.

&gt; Section 9-B. Any entity requiring proof of identity or marital status
shall accept a certified copy of the marriage certificate or
affidavit of common law marriage that has been filed with the court
clerk. Any reference in the Oklahoma Statutes requiring a marriage
license as proof of identity or marital status shall be interpreted
to include a marriage certificate or affidavit of common law
marriage executed on or after November 1, 2015

***EDIT***: To the people clamoring about ""clergy-only marriage"" or ""select-clergy-only"", stop.

&gt; Section 7.D. Marriages between persons belonging to the society called Friends, or Quakers, the spiritual assembly of the Baha'is, or the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, ***or other assemblies*** which have no ordained minister, may be solemnized by the persons and ***in the manner prescribed by and practiced in any such society, church, or assembly.***

and

&gt; Section 8.A.6.  provided further, that all marriages solemnized among the society called Friends or Quakers, the spiritual assembly of the Baha'is, or the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, ***or other assemblies which have no ordained minister, in the form heretofore practiced and in use in their meetings shall be good and valid.*** 

There would be perfectly viable routes to marriage for everyone under the sun in Oklahoma.

This is all well within the rights of the Sovereign State of Oklahoma under the 10th Amendment. Marriage is not a power relegated to Congress, the President, or the federal Judiciary in any way, and it is thus up to individual states to regulate how they see fit.

mugwump3,,,"Why are Nash equilibrium's important? 
Put simply: they help us rationally approach matters of life and death, success and failure, wealth and poverty. 

In the late 40s into the 50s, there was a massive surge of young intellectuals into the fields of physics, math and engineering -- anybody with a Ph.D could get a fantastic government job.  Public enemy number one was the Soviet Union, which, the North Atlantic powers feared would outsmart, out-maneuver, and out-engineer a victory to the cold war.  This was the zeitgeist that John Nash came from, and it has been argued that his insights helped stave off nuclear catastrophe. 

Before Nash, ""classical thinking"" on competition heavily employed Lanchesters Equations -- a set of mathematical tools that accurately model how military forces clash... that is, unless they have an atomic bomb! 

Nash showed that in a game with vast, but not endless, strategies and vast, but not endless outcomes (such as war) there exists a set of strategies and outcomes which are not optimal for either player, but represent the least risk of catastrophic failure.  In other words, Player A is fighting for the best outcome (say, complete disability of their opponents ability to wage war) but if Player A runs through all the possible moves of Player B, and cannot lower their risk of failure by changing strategy, then their current strategy is best.  This set of strategies is known as a ""Nash Equilibrium.""  

In a game, you can use it test if your strategy is optimal, as well as if your opponents strategy is optimal. 

You can see this concept applied to the classic game ""The Prisoner's Dilema
 https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/microeconomics/nash-equilibrium-tutorial/nash-eq-tutorial/v/prisoners-dilemma-and-nash-equilibrium

During the cold war, Nash Equilibriums radically changed the thinking of military strategists who frequently consulted the intelligentsia.  I've heard it convincingly argued that the runaway spending by the US and the USSR during the cold war was, indeed, a Nash equilibrium.  

Today, Nash Equilibriums are used by strategists of all kinds: military, social, psychological, corporate, and especially financial.

""Greetings, gentlemen. It has now been almost 240 years since the birth of the United States. If all has gone according to the plan, you will by now be recovering from a second civil war, pitting the oligarchic forces that were necessary to the rise of American dominance in the mid-20th Century against the newer, more liberal ideals that began their rise during the 1960s.

""With the collapse of the socialist Russian Empire during the 1970s, The United States was able to expand its power base and undergo a shift away from the intensely capitalistic, fear-driven attitudes of the standoff during the thirty years following the Second Great War of the 20th Century. By the middle of the first decade in the new Millennium, the clamour for change reached fever pitch and war eventually broke out, confined largely to the region surrounding the capital. The Liberal forces were victorious and the old system overthrown.

Averagejoeqpublic,,,"I wrote this last night, but I'm leaving it here now. Pretty much sums up what I think of the whole Spectacle. 

Like most, I was not surprised when I heard HRC threw her hat in the ring. What did surprise me was the tepid response her hat received. I may be an outlier, but my Facebook and Twitter were almost silent. So was reddit, digg, and other aggregators. Hell, even HuffPo cribbed the enthusiasm. In short, it seems that, excepting cable news, no one gives a shit. And there's a good reason for this. 

Hillary, it's not us. It's you. 

Remember 2006? How the entire country was sure you'd be the next president? How it seemed the nomination was merely a formality? And then here comes this young whippersnapper. Talking a good game. Saying what we wanted to hear. And everything changed. 

Except, it didn't. We all still want the things that Obama promised but rarely delivered. Though it's taken a severe blow, our hope is that we can pull ourselves out of the partisanship, the corporate favoritism, the us-vs-them mentality. We hope that we can restore the American Dream and the middle class. And there is nothing you can say to make us believe you feel the same. 

Hillary, you have treated the presidency as if it was your right. As if you are entitled to it and that surely the masses must elect you. After all, how could they vote otherwise? Well, it's because we are tired of the bullshit. We are tired of a system that forces us to vote for the person we dislike least. The reason you lost in 2007 is because we wanted anyone but you.  Your solution to this? Make sure that this time no one runs against you. 

My generation has been advertised to our whole lives. We can smell bullshit a mile away. And I can smell what you're selling through a TV screen. 

The plain truth is that you will probably win. While the GOP does its best to out-crazy itself, you should be able to build a winning ticket. A winning vote coalition. But the country won't be celebrating. We won't be as hopeful as we were 8 years ago. Rather, your nomination will disillusion us more. And the sad part is that things for most of us won't be bad enough to make us, as Americans, as citizens, demand and enforce real change. The road we all walk ends with Huns at the gates of Rome.

E: Now I will say this (since people think I am a piece of shit just for being a cop), if I have someone who is clearly drunk just sitting in their car. I, unlike some other officers, won't charge them with occupying a driver seat while intoxicated. The people who realize they can't drive a vehicle due to how intoxicated they are and just are trying to sleep it off are people I have respect for. I usually call their friend or family member for them or I give them a ride home myself if it's in my beat (and no I don't tow their vehicle.) But I stand by what I said. If someone makes the decision to drive drunk or under the influence of something else than I will arrest their ass. I would really rather not work a death scene of the driver or someone they hit and killed. I am not just looking out for other people, I am looking out for the offender too. Is driving under the influence worth risking yours or someone else's life? No.

HBombthrow,,,"Some context for those who don't read articles:

The courts have ruled that the Office of Administration is not subject to the FOIA.  The other offices of the White House have long been exempt from the FOIA.  Keep in mind these are White House offices, not the executive branch; that is, the offices that directly advise the president.  These records are exempt from the FOIA because they have a huge volume of sensitive information and because the office of the presidency needs some room to operate privately when determining choices of action.  The Office of Administration has more or less been voluntarily answering FOIA requests until this order.  (Edit:  I'll add, the Office of Administration is a very un-sexy department, it handles the ""office-y"" things about the White House, like facilities maintenance, HR, printing color power points, etc.)

The records don't disappear -- the White House is subject to the Presidential Records Act.  Under this rule the records are released after a few years.  Keep in mind, too, that outside of the national security and law enforcement context, where things are secret anyway, there's not much the president can officially do without his actions being subject to scrutiny.  For example, we might not have real-time access to Obama's deliberations when formulating a memo on immigration policies, but if that memo leaves the White House to go to the Department of Homeland Security, it's now a Homeland document subject to their FOIA requirements, and he can't take any official action based on that memo without going through very public steps.  In other words, this really covers the internal documents of Obama and his close team.  (""Close"" is relative, there's still hundreds and hundreds of people working in the White House organization.)

Why would the White House not want to open these records? Think about a public company.  Say you're Pepsi.  The board and officers answer to investors, and there is a great deal of disclosure that has to be made to investors and the SEC.  You give periodic updates, host calls, issue annual and quarterly reports, file 10ks, and have all sorts of requirements on preserving certain documents and making them available.  But imagine if beyond all that, any investor could sit in on any meeting.  The CEO and the CFO couldn't send an email without the investors being able to see it the next day.  How do you think that would affect the leadership's ability to do it's job?  What if the investor didn't really understand how the job worked, and was constantly misinterpreting the situation?

Think about Benghazi, and in particular how much mileage certain circles have gotten out of the most meaningless emails about talking points.  More than ever before, there is a professional army of nitpickers poring over every action of the president for the purpose of political gain.  These are people who do not have the country's interests at heart.  Do you think it would help or hurt the presidency if his office couldn't discuss farm subsidies internally without Daily Caller telling you that Obama hates farmers based on the tone of an email between two aides?

Also, keep in mind that with ESI there are orders of magnitude more documents than in prior generations.  Email means that what used to be 1 document might now easily be 200 (think of a memo that goes through several drafts circulated to 10 people -- each comment, each draft, in each person's account is now a document).  It's one thing to store and release with the presidential files, another to continually review millions of documents for the thousands of requests the Office receives.

Now, this isn't a statement on the president's stance on whistleblowers generally.  But this move is not nearly as big a deal as people here are claiming.

I'm not shaking, I can sleep fine, and I'm not driving around Atlanta to try to get a fix. My grandpa on the other hand is a two pack of cigarettes a day smoker.

GetOutOfBox,,,"Just to cut the bullshit here, because I'm seeing it on both sides;

1. The Senate ultimately ratifies treaties. So yes, what they say in the letter is true. That is not what is being criticized however.
2. The President is the ""face of America"" and negotiates treaties. He communicates officially the American government's position, and in turn receives communication from other countries. This is done solely through him, so as to present a cohesive front for the country, which makes sense.
3. The Senate is not allowed to conduct an official negotiation, or interfere in an official negotiation with another entity, under the banner of their office or the government. As individual Americans they are free to do as they see fit and spam another countries PR department with complaints, however they may not use their office while doing so, as the law applies to their office and positions as Senators.

This. Makes. Sense. It is insane for a country to have one branch saying one thing, and another branch saying ""No, no, no! Don't listen to him, we're getting rid of him soon listen to us!"". It not only makes America look weak, it inflicts a serious blow on it's credibility and could very reasonably prevent any future negotiations.

Here is how an international negotiation is normally conducted by adult, law-abiding members of government:

1. The President meets with another leader. They discuss concerns.
2. The President discusses with his cabinet, and then the issues are fielded in Congress.
3. The President knows that he can't offer anything that Congress won't agree too, because if he does, they'll block it, and he'll look like a fool and will be lampooned as one in the media. There would likely even be legal consequences possibly reaching as far as impeachment.
4. After much back and fourth within the country and with the other country, either a compromise is reached, or no deal is made.

The reason why all international negotiations go through the President is to insulate other countries from this exact kind of thing. Internal debate is normal, however it's deleterious to international relations to force other countries to contend with it directly.

What these men have done is conniving, and was most likely done to deliberately sabotage these negotiations with the express purpose of adding to their next election campaign.

novictim,,,"Obama: ""It is important for us to align ourselves with 99.9% of Muslims...""

Better look at the polling data of what Muslims say they believe, Mr. President.  As Muslim populations grow (and they grow fast) the secular state is under threat by immigrant groups and their children who reject the values of their host countries.  Here is why:

""... solid majorities in most of the countries surveyed across the Middle East and North Africa, sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia and Southeast Asia favor the establishment of sharia, including 71% of Muslims in Nigeria, 72% in Indonesia, 74% in Egypt and 89% in the Palestinian territories.""

http://www.pewforum.org/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-exec/

If entire Muslim countries favor replacing Civil law (judges/juries/civil jurisprudence) with Sharia (Religious leaders applying religious law based in Koranic interpretation) we *should* have a problem with this.  And know that Sharia requires that strangers in dispute go to religious clerics for justice, regardless of their own beliefs or lack of belief.  And this kind of justice is NOT blind as it mandates Muslims give deference to fellow Muslims.  Atheists and homosexuals, mormons?  Forget about it!

Now, you will hear Muslims in the USA say ""Oh, yes, but I favor Sharia just as it applies to my own life.  I would never apply it to others.""   Don't believe it. follow what current events tell you and what history confirms.  The Ottoman empire instituted Sharia courts at its founding.  No one could claim to be ""outside"" the arm of those courts.

You will also hear people say that Sharia is not implemented today...despite the declaration of countries like Saudi that they *are* implementing it.  The mystery resolves itself when one realizes that Sharia is based on interpretations of  inconsistent religious texts (ya, that was redundant).  So if you don't like the particular interpretation of Sharia being applied by Saudi Arabia, you can claim it is not Sharia.  But that denial is just saying that religious law is good, just not the Saudi version.  

But religious law is NOT good.  It is filled with bias against one group or another and prone to manipulation, corruption, hypocrisy.  And at its core, Sharia is a rejection of the ethical secular principles that seek to place fairness over all else.  

You can say that civil courts get this wrong sometimes, that Western Justice is imperfect, but you 'aint seen nothin' until you see the bearded cleric state just how and when you can rape your slave.   

Also, one should realize that religious laws really cannot stop at borders, right?  When you have the perfect word of Allah to work with, borders are meaningless.  Get it?

If the Majority of Britain's believed that Sharia should be the law of the land, Sharia *would be* the law of the land, agreed?  Do you accept that as true?  Well, 40% of British Muslims do poll favoring Sharia Law.  Are you disturbed yet?

This is the kind of problem that deserves and requires a very heavy hand to address IMO.  Unless you are a completely irresponsible person, one must admit that some policy of significant deportation of Muslim immigrants is called for in Britain. Where else is this needed for the ultimate survival of Western Society? 

How inhumane is it to deport a group of people who wish to overthrow your secular laws and institute a theocracy?

thisisdjjjjjjjjjj,,,"This actually happened to my cat last year. The nutty PETA woman in the neighborhood would complain whenever we were sitting outside that our cat is too old (14) and that she demanded he be either put down or inside during the day. We live in southern California, and the weather was beautiful at the time. Our cat loved being under an umbrella and hanging out outside with a blanket for him to lie down. Every night we always brought him in. One day we come outside, and appeared a giant cat castle with a note threatening to keep him inside or else. We knew where she lived, and returned the cat castle. A week later, the cat disappeared, and rumor has it that she picked up a few cats in the neighborhood and had them all euthanised. I'll be in disgust and in mourning for the rest of my life.

Please understand something.  Writing an *entire browser* is a *huge* undertaking.  Microsoft is not building a new browser.  They are forking their browser into two code bases.  One will be the ""backward-compatible"" code base, which is intended mainly to support legacy web sites, which are mainly intranet web sites for companies.  This will still be called ""Internet Explorer"".

*Separately*, Microsoft is building a ""cleaned up"" version of IE.  It is derived from the same code base as IE, but it is literally a fork of the code.  This gives them the opportunity to finally toss out all the backward compatible bullshit that makes IE so awful.  This is what ""Spartan"" is.  No one knows what the official name of the product is -- probably not even the IE team knows yet.  ""Spartan"" is just a code name for that.

Again, except for experiments / toys, no one is building a new browser these days.  The only possible exception is Servo, which is being built in a new language (Rust).

I'm not saying you *can't* build a new browser -- of course you can, anyone can -- but building a new browser that supports *all* the modern features (DOM, CSS, CSS animation, SVG, WebGL, 2D canvas, web workers, web sockets, the list goes *on and on*...) at a level of performance that is competitive with Chrome / Firefox / IE is a *huge* undertaking.

Microsoft is not doing that.  They are essentially finally breaking backward compatibility (in a fork of IE) so that they can finally catch up with web standards and performance.

Something almost IDENTICAL to this incident happened to me right before the end of last year. It's been more of a hardship than I can express through words. 

In my case, it was $17,000. There were illegal items found during their search as well, but aren't charging me with anything, as that would make this a criminal matter, and place the burden of proof on themselves. They decided it would be a better option to pretend to be 'cutting some slack' for me, and keep things in civil court. Apparently they had admitted to my lawyer that I was unlawfully searched, so the charges  would be dropped. 
It's still ongoing, recently I had a ""pretrial hearing"" which turned out to be yet another extension, drawing things out a little further.
It's seriously frustrating that they KNOW their case is weak, and still are playing hardball. My lawyer advised that I make them some sort of settlement offer, which I did ($2k) ... They declined. They made a counter-offer of 50% of the seized currency, which is RIDICULOUS.

I'm looking to now put forth motions for not only a trial by jury, but a jury of 12. Also, I'd like to request a change in venue, as the same people who seized the property, are the same ones who are overseeing the prosecution on this case, as well as the ones who stand to gain from a win on their end.  

The current laws that are in place are NOT SERVING US. Before this, I knew nothing about things of this nature ever even happening. It's sickening. The place that this has put me in makes me feel helpless, like I'm sitting at the front row of my own funeral. SO ANGRY!!!!!

Anyway, I'm sure just like anyone else that this has happened to, I'm hoping for the best and am striving to educate myself in this area, so that I can be as equipped as possible to fight this extreme battle.

He wrote three papers in two years that could have been nominated for and won the Nobel prize in the field of Economics. It's not even remotely hyperbolic to state that he is the foundation which modern day Game Theory is built upon. Solutions in non-cooperative game theory are noted as ""Nash equilibria"" he is that ubiquitous with the subject

Yet, that could be considered his *second* biggest achievement. He was decades ahead of his time when it comes to his work on encryption techniques and cryptology. He analysed the distinction between polynomial time and exponential time computation ten years before people realised it was the issue. A distinction that forms the basis of computational complexity theory.

Go on /r/exmuslim, talk to people who live in Pakistan and are listening to their neighbors fire guns in the air celebrating the attacks.

If you go on /r/Islam right now, you will see hundreds of people talking about how 1) Muslims are the real victims here, 2) free speech is fine but insults to the prophet aren't acceptable, and even a few claiming 3) the Jews are really behind this.

Moderate Islam is not analogous to moderate Christianity.  It's barely analogous to extremist Christianity, given that many ""moderate"" positions like death for apostasy are actually enforced throughout the Muslim world. **Moderate Islam is a dire threat to civilization.**  Reddit is full of people falling all over themselves to display how tolerant they are, without realizing that the ideology they think they're tolerating has nothing to do with the reality of Islam, just the whitewashed version the West hears from hand-picked ""scholars.""

Appletard,,,"God damn it. They're missing the whole point here. I have a 7 year-old with Autism, not saying that makes me an expert in the matter but it needs to be pointed out that some of these kids like to be overstimulated. This little boy asking for a ""squeeze"" may not necessarily be asking based on emotional needs, but the need for physical stimulation. Some kids are just the opposite. The school district fails because it expects these kids to be treated exactly the same as neurotypical  students, but they have different needs, hence ""special"" needs. They are also not being considerate of the other children, having him suspended like this is an interruption to their routines, which anyone with any experience in dealing with things like Autism would understand how important routine is for these children. School boards need more representation from people who have a better understanding of what ""special needs"" really means.

This isn't anything fucking new, as a matter of fact it happens a lot. I have worked with at least thirty teenage girls in my eleven odd years that were stuck in similar situations. One boy I worked with, was locked up in a closet in between sex sessions while mom shot up. When her ""client"" was ready, she would sit on her sons face (yes, mom) while the client raped him; went on for two and a half years. The boy also happened to stab his dog to death in the same closet, and also found that he LOVES setting shit on fire (wonder why). This is kind of upsetting, how much of this shit happens and it is all swept under a giant fuckin' rug. And the scary part, is that my job security increases every single damn day.

DocQuanta,,,"For those wondering, the stage uses grid fins as control surfaces to help guide the rocket's return.  The fins are powered with an open hydraulic system so hydraulic fluid is lost every time the fins are adjusted.  The last attempt failed because they underestimated the amount of fluid they would need and so when they ran out, the no longer were able to control the grid fins.  That left the thrust vectoring of the stage's engines as the only way to guide the rocket and they proved insufficient to both get the rocket to the barge, get it oriented vertically, and get it decelerated enough for landing.  They got the stage to the barge but it landed at an angle and too fast.  For this attempt they've increased the hydraulic fluid they are carrying to hopefully avoid this issue.

On the other hand though, because the DSCOVR satellite is going to the Earth-Sun Lagrange point and not LEO the first stage will be traveling much faster on return than the SpaceX CRS-5 stage.  So it should in principle be a more difficult attempt but with hopefully sufficient hydraulic fluid they may succeed.

ParasitusGubermintus,,,"What a conveniently-worded statement, almost as if it were purposefully written just for reddit. Probably because there's a good chance it was, so to say.

The one thing that's truly remarkable about ISIS is that they have a *really goddamn good grip* on the fundamentals and functionalities of modern social media: youtube, facebook, twitter, memes, etc. They *get it* as a system for disseminating propaganda, both to increase recruitment and to dishearten their enemies, as well as understand the close relations between individuals, social media and contemporary news media and how one affects another which in turn affects the other.

Part of ISIS' goal is to stratify the world populations and inflame tensions between the various sects to the point where extremists on all sides start acting out, in turn pushing borderline extremists over the edge and into action, who in turn repeat the process. So for example, they look at social media and the way people are talking about things - in this instance, the oh so popular ""Religion of Peace™"" line - and co-opt that for a message. News and social media repeat and spread it, and eventually some dipshit gets so incensed with it that he goes ""Let's hold an event *designed to specifically antagonize and piss off Muslims!*"". *That* gets spread around, and ISIS is going ""Look at how the West is specifically attacking Muslims, this is why you should fight them!"" while some other dipshits go ""Let's *shoot up that event designed specifically to antagonize and piss off Muslims!*"" That spreads, ISIS goes ""Look at these guys who were brave enough to stand up to the West, be like them!"" and elsewhere some [dipshit congressional candidate starts thinking of how he can kill a whole bunch of Muslims](http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/nation/2015/05/16/former-congressional-candidate-planned-to-attack-new-york-mosque/27453961/), which I'm sure is going to make its way into ISIS propaganda sooner or later and will lead to some dipshit doing something shitty in retaliation.

So ultimately this is just another link in a chain of a bunch of dipshits doing things to rile up other dipshits into doing things to rile up the first batch of dipshits, and both sets of dipshits are carefully considering what they're doing to maximizing impact and inflaming, as both have a stake in dividing people as much as possible.",1431895158,,1431895427,1,79,news,True,False,380,0,Afternoon,61+,5,0,"{u'probability': {u'neg': 0.49751266033640174, u'neutral': 0.1923784447729102, u'pos': 0.5024873396635983}, u'label': u'pos'}",0.497512660336,0.502487339664,0.192378444773,pos,"{u'tone_categories': [{u'category_id': u'emotion_tone', u'tones': [{u'tone_name': u'Anger', u'score': 0.436869, u'tone_id': u'anger'}, {u'tone_name': u'Disgust', u'score': 0.201047, u'tone_id': u'disgust'}, {u'tone_name': u'Fear', u'score': 0.461224, u'tone_id': u'fear'}, {u'tone_name': u'Joy', u'score': 0.160443, u'tone_id': u'joy'}, {u'tone_name': u'Sadness', u'score': 0.49568, u'tone_id': u'sadness'}], u'category_name': u'Emotion Tone'}, {u'category_id': u'language_tone', u'tones': [{u'tone_name': u'Analytical', u'score': 0.220353, u'tone_id': u'analytical'}, {u'tone_name': u'Confident', u'score': 0.0, u'tone_id': u'confident'}, {u'tone_name': u'Tentative', u'score': 0.784766, u'tone_id': u'tentative'}], u'category_name': u'Language Tone'}, {u'category_id': u'social_tone', u'tones': [{u'tone_name': u'Openness', u'score': 0.8653, u'tone_id': u'openness_big5'}, {u'tone_name': u'Conscientiousness', u'score': 0.333802, u'tone_id': u'conscientiousness_big5'}, {u'tone_name': u'Extraversion', u'score': 0.846015, u'tone_id': u'extraversion_big5'}, {u'tone_name': u'Agreeableness', u'score': 0.130617, u'tone_id': u'agreeableness_big5'}, {u'tone_name': u'Emotional Range', u'score': 0.438979, u'tone_id': u'emotional_range_big5'}], u'category_name': u'Social Tone'}]}",0.436869,0.201047,0.461224,0.160443,0.49568,0.220353,0.0,0.784766,0.8653,0.333802,0.846015,0.130617,0.438979

I think he knows EXACTLY what 1000 lashes would do to him, but is still brave enough to offer himself up for a couple of reasons.

1 - It's the right thing to do. If I had the influence to be heard, I would offer to share some of the lashes. Maybe not 1000, but enough to show solidarity with this young individual who's only crime is his personal belief's. 

2 - He knows the probability of him taking a single lash is very low. That doesn't mean he is unwilling or ignorant as to the effects of a lashing, it means he is realistic. He knows he won't be lashed, so he is safe to offer himself up. In doing so, he not only improves his sense of self-worth, he also looks much more heroic in the eyes of his peers. On top of that, he has managed to bring some attention to the matter, from a different angle than just reporting on the lashes themselves. 
Maybe he thinks that, as is the case with most Americans, it takes the pain and suffering of ""one of our own"" for people to care and speak up. 

So I find it highly unlikely that he has no clue what he's getting himself into.
