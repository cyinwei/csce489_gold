"meatwad75892","","","I was addicted to 90's country as a kid/teen, and I still am today. But I've all but given up on country beyond early this decade because it's turned into redneck-stereotype-driven generic pop with rap wannabes and uber-patriots sprinkled here and there. There's a small amount of good country around, but it's hard to weed through the crap.


There's little soul in the music anymore. Country used to be about learning lessons, dealing with the heartache/regret, or professing love in a better way than ""ayy gurl, shake dat ass up in them there jeans"".  Also, I want mullet-equipped Toby Keith back.

The police showed up, and before I knew it my dad wasn't around anymore. The main problem though was that even though he was ""around"" he wasn't helping my mom support their 3 children, he would rather play World of Warcraft or whatever computer game. All I remember is just sitting in the living room play a sonic game while they told the cops what happened, I was so oblivious at the time.

"c01e","","","I used to have a friend id hang out with every day and we would always see hot girls with fat guys. He would always joke about how that guy has life figured out and we should get fat so we can snag one of these girls. Maybe this is a thing in the south but I see it every day. My brothers pretty big (i wouldnt say hes fat by american standards but in any other country im sure he would be a ""fatty"") He has a pretty attractive and extremely fit gf (she teaches gymnastics) I have no idea how this works but it does. Me and my other brother are normal size Im on the skinny side if you overlook my small beer belly but i mountain bike 4-5 days out of the week. Girls on the other hand , well this isnt as common. Ill probably catch shit but usually the big girls out here who have a SO are with a black dude or another fat guy. Im not sure ive seen a fat girl with a guy whos in great shape. In all seriousness our country does have a huge problem with obesity and I think a lot of people do accept fat people. Most people really only have a valid reason to rage when its directly effecting them. i.e being between 2 ginormous people in an airplane. THAT makes sense to me. Blind hate is stupid though buuut fat people jokes are pretty funny and a lot of fat people tend to have really great senses of humor.

"Belletrix","","","This was an excellent video to me. I saw this back when this debacle was playing out in ""real-time."" What jumps out at me, is the fact that Park had her belief structure toppled with a simple challenge to the parameters of her game. SJW's main method of controlling discourse and raising the hackles of a legion of online keyboard warriors is to define the game in their terms, to draw the lines where they want, and to move goalposts when they need to.

Park's downfall was believing that  her online reality, where she has surrounded herself in that echo chamber of insanity, was that the Host would just crumple, and give in to her SJW dogma. While there are certainly structures in society and other issues still dogging this country, she shot herself in the foot with that half-wit comment. 

First of all, don't come onto an interview expecting to be able to quash someone from talking or offering opinions about something. It's this guys job to travel those avenues of thought, to ask those questions, and to probe your arguments for weak spots. And furthermore, you don't ever just tell someone they are disqualified from speaking about something in ANY capacity. There's a difference between saying: ""You don't understand what it's like to be a person of color and a woman."" and ""You aren't allowed to talk about this because you aren't a person of color, or a woman.""

Social Justice is all well and good, and I'm a strong advocate for introducing more equality and understanding into this country, and world at large. However, there is certainly a right and a wrong way to do these sorts of things. And if you can't tell, telling people to be silent, and disregarding them on the basis of their race, their sex, their orientation, their blahblahblah... is the ANTI-THESIS of your movement.

She's absolutely right. That's why I don't go picking fights with guys at the bar that look like they could crush a brick in the palm of their hands (then again, I don't really care to pick a fight with anyone). If you feel the need to physically strike someone, you better be ready to finish the fight, whether they're equal in strength or not. You started it, you should be ready for the consequences. Lessons from dad--""you may not start it, but you better be ready to finish it.""

Not condoning anyone hitting anyone, but if you're male, female, or otherwise, and you throw the first punch... you should have no reason to expect that the other person will not return the aggression.

EDIT: Thanks for the gold kind stranger! First time gold for me. :-D

EDIT 2: Some commentors seem to be under the impression that I'm advocating for men to face-stomp women if they're assaulted (or any combination of genders in the fight). Not the case. As I've said above, ideally, no one should be causing anyone physical harm in the first place. Even after being hit, in an ideal world, the situation would be defused without escalation. However, that's not how things tend to work, so one should not be expecting special treatment in a fight for any reason, and thus should not be surprised when a punch or slap is met with a similar strike, regardless of gender, size, or most other factors.

If nothing else, look at it from an education standpoint. I would be doing my future daughter a massive disservice (and would be potentially putting her in dangerous situations) if I told her that she could strike a man and expect him to just take it because ""men shouldn't hit women."" As Whoopi has pointed out, if she hits a man (or anyone else, for that matter), she shouldn't be standing there aghast if a fist comes back at her.

Last week we had a pretty big ice/snow storm. There are two handicap spots in our apartment complex, and we are the only tenants who have a plate/hangtag for disabilities of ANY kind. So there should always be at least one spot for us to use, right?

Wrong. There is always somebody parked in both of them illegally. Last week after that ice and snow hit, I had to park at the bottom of the hill. When I realized I couldn't get her adapted stroller (it's basically a wheelchair) through the snow, I put it back in the trunk and had to carry her on the slick, icy parking lot road. 

Carrying a preschooler with a medical device implanted on their brain is pretty much terrifying when you nearly fall every few steps. By the time I finally got to our apartment door I was bawling my eyes out. I was so scared we were going to fall and she would crack her head on the ice and bust her shunt up. 

People who park in handicap spots without a tag or plate are the worst kinds of people. We've confronted people like this before (politely) and it never EVER goes well. The kind of folks who are willing to do this aren't going to respond kindly to a ""hey, can you please move?""

He shows minor clips in his favor but when you watch every episode, he's actually the one going around harassing everyone, and making problems for everyone involved. He started by yelling at this neighbor for making too much noise at 10 PM on a Friday, seriously 10 PM on Friday. Then, he starts calling the police at 8:01 PM (because the lease technically says to be quiet at 8) for a noise compant in OAKLAND! Then, he's suddenly surprised when they don't take his calls seriously. And when he confronts the property manager, the manager asks him to wait one minute so he can record it too, then throws a hissy fit when the manager isn't fast enough (wasn't even 20-30 seconds). He starts insulting the property manager's mother, then his girlfriend.  He insults two women at the main headquarters when trying to pay rent (who were being extremely nice considering someone just barged in and starts making a huge scene in a quiet office). His whole pattern throughout the videos is everytime the conversation doesn't go exactly his way and people don't do exactly what he tells them to do, he throws a tantrum, flips off the wall, starts insulting anyone and everyone, then wonders why no one involved has any respect for him.

"SixBiscuit","","","This is actually a wonderful demonstration of the way that certain concepts, videos, etc. are framed and how people respond to that framing. I remember seeing the original video, the subsequent video from the girl who debunked him, and now this video. 

His first video was implying that he'd found some hidden knowledge that had been lost for generations. In his rebuttal video, for the most part, he drops that whole schtick and focuses on being just a normal, reasonable, self-effacing guy. 

Look at the difference in the way he talks about the arrows in hand technique: 

[Just look at this segment from the rebuttal.](https://youtu.be/8iLTA43MBuA?t=2m27s)

[When guns started replacing bows... this technique was forgotten.](https://youtu.be/BEG-ly9tQGk?t=3m41s)

So this rebuttal is a bit of a bait and switch. In the original video it was this overly dramatic voice-over. In this video it's him just speaking. The tone is completely different. 

The other thing is that the original video makes a point to speak about draw pulls and how this stuff can penetrate armor, etc. It's made to give the impression that the entirety of the video can be applied to heavy bows including the arrow catching. The criticism from the skeptical girl is also somewhat misstated. She acknowledges that he's a well practiced trick shooter. 

It's a lot like in reddit comments where someone will come out with a post whose tone is say, abrasive, then when someone responds by taking their points apart one by one the original post responds in a completely pleasant tone asking why the poster is upset, etc. 

He's using tone and framing to deflect the overall criticism into the exact specifics about what he said and not really responding to the completely over the top tone and claims made in the first video. After all, the original video was shared because people enjoy watching truly unique things, especially techniques that were used in the ancient world but are now forgotten. The entire video is framed and presented in a way that tries to show him as recovering techniques, like the arrows in draw hand technique, that had been ""forgotten"".

I worked my way from being a mudlogger (reads gas and looks at drill cuttings under a microscope and creates a log detailing drill rate, gas amount and different formation tops.) to a thread rep (casing pipe thread inspector and supervisor for casing installation procedures)

I learned a lot and met some cool dudes. Heard some wild stories. Saw some shit. Made money. But, it wore on me. While my last job was cushy as fuck, I had to be there. Living out of a truck. Away from home. Permanently on call. Christmas? 3 am and sick? Motherfucking ice storm? To bad. Get to work. Now. 

But, you gotta pay the bills, right? But, I started driving through West Texas and seeing shit. The un-repaired infrastructure that gets crumbled by thousands of 18 wheelers loaded to their max with iron equipment and pumps and shit. Oil pipelines every where. Every fucking where. A blown out giant oil storage tank at the Big Springs TX refinery. No explanation. No report. No news. At least, I didn't see it. There is obviously evidence of a very violent hydrocarbon explosion on the side of I20. The way the tank is shredded, it would have had to be huge. Righands are just spraying rigs down in pure diesel fuel to clean off the oil based drilling mud they have to use to drill lateral wells that they have to drill to get oil from dense, non porous oil shale. Just wanton wide open not give a shit. 

You don't just turn a formation two miles deep into pea gravel and remove millions of barrels of volume while relieving tens of thousands of PSI from the formation and have zero side effects. That's not how physics works. So, even without all the obvious fucked up shit, the very exact shit they're doing in the most clean, small footprint leaving way possible is still royally fucking up shit. They aren't even doing it that way though. They're horribly fucking shit up underground and horribly fucking shit up on the surface. 

Oh, and guess how oil shale drilling was funded? Wall St loans. Guess what Wall St did when they heard ""oil will be over $100 a barrel forever""? They took out derivatives on the oil loans. And guess where Saudi Arabia is keeping prices by flooding the market? Under $50 a barrel. Guess what happens when oil companies can't pay loans and can't drill shale because of low oil prices? They default. On billions. And those derivatives based on those loans? Well, I'll let yall figure the rest of this one out this fall, but you might be bailing some people out. Srry bros.

No one was at the gate because they were sending the flight off. She began banging on the jetbridge door, screaming, and crying. I honestly thought she was going to break the glass door. 

After that was unsuccessful, she walked behind the counter and started talking on the radios (to our airline operations who have no idea who the hell was calling them) and making PAs over the entire terminal of a huge, major metropolitan airport. She was clearly having a serious breakdown.

It was funny like this video is, but upon further reflection, I have no idea what's going on in these peoples' lives. They may be going to a funeral or they just ended a lifelong marriage after they were cheated on. We just can't know. It's no excuse for behavior like this, however.

In Russia (in video you can see cyrillic text) in major cities with central hot water supply (system without local boiler), 2-3 times a year hot water is being switched off for servicing (district by district - not full city).

During that time faucet begins to suck in some cases, and it's totally OK.

Edit: And by saying central watter supply I mean central for all city. They are pumping hot water through all the city.

Edit2: Thanks for Gold! And please upvote. People must know truth.

And to explain why water is switched off:

From time to time water services are making hydrostatic tests. On the time of such test, all apartment buildings, that are connected to central supply (we have 3 central heaters in our city, so 1 heater at time) are being switched off from hot water supply. We have special valves somewhere near houses, underground (it's easy to find them, just search for 3-4 manholes in same place).

After apartments are switched off, they are beginning tests by putting water tubes under stress (more pressure, more tempereture).

It's just the white version of hip hop, except every now and then a hip hop artist with something to say actually gets popular.

In reality, what people HATE is Bro Country. Bro Country is indefensibly shit. It has little to say, and what it is saying is shitty. It erodes the listener's taste in music. It's the height of vapidity in popular music right now. POP has far more depth than Bro Country right now.

Country on the whole still has plenty of gems, like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NJqUN9TClM). Fantastic lyric writing and perfect musical accompaniment. That's what Country is capable of - Something that feels distinctively American, relatable, and heartfelt.

"Mangekyo11","","","He is actually an alien that is in fact made of water, who takes over human beings by sneaking inside while they're on the toilet. They have and will do this until the promised day, when they will rise^up like a great tidal wave from the world's oceans, the place where they have been patiently waiting for ages. Watching, always watching(ever wonder why there's more water than land on our planet? Wasn't always that way!). On that day, the great one will rise from his slumber, deep down in the dark, his sunken citadel.. The old one has been gathering his power, biding his time until the day he can slither his way above the surface and take this planet for his own. These water beings have, since before the dawn of written history, taken over portions of the population. Using their meat suits as the perfect disguise to sow discontent and chaos throughout the globe, weakening the already tenuous grasp that human kind have on mother earth... or as they will call it, *Splish Splash*.  Unfortunately not all of them have the ability to pass for true humans and this is a good example. Although we totally just thought he was tripping out so we messed up the one chance we had at figuring out their horrid machinations before it was too late.

"WhyDidILogin","","","Reminds me a lot of Cavil's speech from BSG which is my favorite speech from my favorite show ever. I am sure it was inspired by the Blade Runner scene. 

Transcript:

&gt; **Brother Cavil**: In all your travels, have you ever seen a star go supernova?

&gt;**Ellen Tigh**: No.

&gt;**Brother Cavil**: No? Well, I have. I saw a star explode and send out the building blocks of the Universe. Other stars, other planets and eventually other life. A supernova!
&gt;Creation itself! I was there. I wanted to see it and be part of the moment. And you know how I perceived one of the most glorious events in the universe? With these ridiculous gelatinous orbs in my skull! With eyes designed to perceive only a tiny fraction of the EM spectrum. With ears designed only to hear vibrations in the air.

&gt;**Ellen Tigh**: The five of us designed you to be as human as possible.

&gt;**Brother Cavil**: I don't want to be human! I want to see gamma rays! I want to hear X-rays! And I want to - I want to smell dark matter! Do you see the absurdity of what I am? I can't even express these things properly because I have to - I have to conceptualize complex ideas in this stupid limiting spoken language! But I know I want to reach out with something other than these prehensile paws! And feel the wind of a supernova flowing over me! I'm a machine! And I can know much more! I can experience so much more. But I'm trapped in this absurd body! And why? Because my five creators thought that God wanted it that way.

"freet0","","","Koalas are the worst animal. Let me tell you why.

1) They eat almost exclusively eucalyptus leaves. Because they are ill equipped to digest these leaves (which are already low in nutrients), koalas have to eat a ton of them. Their lives are almost all sleeping(digesting) or eating or shitting.

2) Speaking of shitting, baby koalas eat the poop of adult koalas. Because as bad as the adult is at digesting these awful leaves, the babies are even worse. So the only way they can get anything out of them at all is to have them pre-digested.

3) Koalas are incredibly stupid. They have the smallest brain to body size ratio of any mammal. Their stupidity can be seen easily by taking a few of those terrible leaves they love and putting them on a plate. The koala will not eat them because it is too stupid to realize they can still be food if they're not attached to a tree.

4) They sound like demons. See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8oLu7znwQ0.

5) That eucalyptus plant, in addition to being a terrible food, also makes them high. All the time. Like, there is probably not a single moment of a koala's life that its already incredibly stupid brain is not in the grip of this drug masquerading as food.*

6) Most of them have chlamydia. Not like, some special koala version of the disease. Just regular chlamydia which they can give to humans. And thanks to the disease they are always pissing themselves.

So there you go. They're shit eating retard demons with STDs and a drug problem.

*edit: its been pointed out that #5 is a myth and their behavior is just due to the low nutrition of the leaves. Thanks disgruntledpenguins",1430007459,"","1430034902",1,2936,"videos"

Look. Having a conversation about the shitty way that women and minorities are treated in society is great. We should absolutely be having these conversations. As a female I've been catcalled since the tender age of 12, told I do my job **really well**- for someone with a vagina, and gotten into a bar fight because I told a guy I wasn't interested and he, upon learning that my lack of interest was because I purely wasn't interested and not because I had a boyfriend, decided that trying to fondle me was okay. 

What bugs the shit out of me is the ad hominem invective that is generally used to have these conversations. Calling someone racist or sexist or whatever ""ist"" or ""ism"" you want to use does nothing to get the other side to listen to you and drive the social change you want to see. Personal attacks have this funny way of actually shutting down the conversation and increasing tension between the two parties. Then it just becomes a contest of who can yell the loudest and longest, rather than trying to articulately solve the core of the issue. 

I would still pay good money to see a hardcore SJW have a debate with Bill O'Reilly though. Pretty sure I'd need ear plugs to survive.

1. The future he was talking about in the beginning of his talk has happened, is still continuing, and is still evolving. Mass donations to good causes happen regularly and many times, injustices around the world are quickly made viral. I'm not sure why he's downplaying that.

2. He provides this statement with no evidence to support him: ""That wasn't happening in 2010 [referring to arguments online]. Not with that speed. Not with that viciousness. Not with everyone getting in on it. Small communities sure, but the whole web? Eh, not so much..."" Is this dude really saying that large groups of people weren't arguing online as quickly as there are now back in 2010? FOH

3. He interrupts his talk to pointlessly live stream and make a joke about it. So far, he hasn't taught anything and he hasn't provided any facts beyond funny things that were widely talked about online.

4. Next, Tom Scott continues to talk about current events (by talk I mean remind us that they happened) and explains the brilliance of a video camera on our phones. Then he sums it all up with... nothing.

"PiggyBankofDespair","","","I can't quite tell exactly to what extent this guy is joking, but I will say this is something I run into all the damn time and it is seriously the most horrible feeling in the world. Hell, just today I was approaching the line at a McDonald's and the woman in front of me saw me over her shoulder and immediately started trying to reel her kid in, as though if he'd gotten more than three feet away I was going to snap him up and she was never going to see him again. I don't even really have a problem with children, but I am absolutely terrified of people's kids because of what people might do to me if I somehow interact with them. It's heartbreaking to live in a world where more and more kids are being raised to see men as monsters.

And the way some women look at me when I'm in public, my god. I know there are assholes out there who treat women like crap and because of those assholes many women are on guard in public spaces. I sure as hell don't blame them for it. It's one thing to be on guard, but it's another thing entirely to just stare down a total stranger who isn't doing anything. When I'm minding my own business and some lady is making me feel so self-conscious with her constant glaring that I feel like I need to bathe in boiling water to feel clean again, it's pretty goddamn hard to think to myself ""Oh, right, even though I'm doing nothing wrong and I'm being made to feel disgusting and unwanted because of my sex, I'm actually not the victim here."" Over time, it starts getting to you. Any time you go somewhere by yourself you wish you could just be invisible. You start to think, ""Am I actually doing something wrong? Is there something wrong with me? Why do people keep looking at me like that? Is the way I'm being treated actually somehow my fault?""

And I think the worst part is that you're made to feel like you're not allowed to talk about it. Some people tell you more-or-less that you're full of shit and need to ""man up,"" while others might celebrate the ball of anxiety you've developed in your stomach as some sort of ""male awareness."" A small minority might actually step up and say ""Yeah bro, I know this and it sucks,"" but you're just as likely to encounter someone who tries to justify someone else making you feel like the biggest piece of shit on the planet by reminding you that the glaring and the sideways glances and the blatant disgust and the friendships you've lost to distrust, all of which have completely eroded your confidence, happened because you are guilty by proxy of actions you've never had anything to do with.",1423021073,"","False",1,251,"videos"

One of my all time favorites from Disney!

**EDIT FOR THE LAZY:**

... He believes that the actions he takes are truly just. He does not see himself as evil, he sees himself as a savior and the instrument of God to help purge the world of evil. If you were see the world through his eyes, he is the tragic hero who in the end failed just before his moment of triumph due to betrayal by the man at his side. This should sound familiar to another well known Christian story (Judas).
Even more so, in the song Hell Fire (which he best known for) the Latin chant in the background is the Confiteor which is a Catholic prayer for admission of guilt and wrongdoing. Furthermore, Frollo sings:

""It's not my fault / I'm not to blame / It is the gypsy girl / The witch who sent this flame / It's not my fault / If in God's plan / He made the devil so much / Stronger than a man""

Yet, almost ironically the hooded figures provide the counter melody of ""My fault"" in Latin. This scene is extremely powerful as the hooded figures are most likely NOT heavenly beings condemning him, but rather the duality of the dialog is Frollo wrestling with his own guilt and conscience. However, the most critical thing to remember here is he's not wrestling over his cruelty, but his lust and his personal struggle to give into lust or do the ""right"" thing. In this case, the ""right"" thing is to purge the evil that plagues the city, IE the gypsy woman who has made him question his actions.


So yeah, Frollo is a crazy awesome villain, but more so anti-hero.

**Edit 2:**

For some biblical reflection that stands out to me in this scene - 

""Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters,a whenever you face trials of many kinds, because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance. Let perseverance finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything. If any of you lacks wisdom, you should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault, and it will be given to you. But when you ask, you must believe and not doubt, because the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea, blown and tossed by the wind. That person should not expect to receive anything from the Lord. **Such a person is double-minded and unstable in all they do.**"" - James 1:2-8

""Blessed is the one who perseveres under trial because, having stood the test, that person will receive the crown of life that the Lord has promised to those who love him. **When tempted, no one should say, 'God is tempting me.' For God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does he tempt anyone; but each person is tempted when they are dragged away by their own evil desire and enticed.** Then, after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, gives birth to death."" - James 1:12-15

""**Those who consider themselves religious and yet do not keep a tight rein on their tongues deceive themselves, and their religion is worthless.** Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world."" - James 1:26-27

""For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh. For I have the desire to do what is right, but not the ability to carry it out."" - Romans 7:18

""**And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner,** when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster box of ointment, And stood at his feet behind him weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment. Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw it, he spake within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him: for she is a sinner. And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And he saith, Master, say on. There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty. And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. **Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most? Simon answered and said, I suppose that he, to whom he forgave most.** And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged. And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head. Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet. My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment. Wherefore I say unto thee, **Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much:** but to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little. And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven. And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also? And he said to the woman, **Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.**"" - Luke 7:37-50

""For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith--and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God-- **not by works, so that no one can boast.**""  - Ephesians 2:8-9

"SirT6","","","I liked this video a lot. I empathize with the speaker, and I agree -- it is both heartbreaking and infuriating to watch media coverage of peaceful protests against police brutality get brushed aside to cover violent protests instead.

At the same time, however, I wonder if we have fallen victim to a master narrative regarding race and rioting. Too often the stories of rioting that we have seen coming from Ferguson and Baltimore have been juxtaposed against black culture (whatever that even means), with the implication being there is something fundamentally flawed with the black community because of their inability to peacefully assemble.

And frankly, this idea infuriates me. It isn't rooted in any sense of reality as far as I can tell. People judge the black community in Baltimore because some of its members robbed a convenience store. [Here are white people wrecking private property because they were angry that Joe Paterno, a man implicated in a child abuse scandal, was being fired](http://i.imgur.com/FP9alJl.jpg) -- yet that protest wasn't somehow conflated with white culture (a term that no one even tries to use because it sounds so preposterous). 

Hell, this country was founded when a group of marginalized white men gathered their muskets, ransacked a tea-ship and shot some British police officers. Yet, while they are revered, acts like the one we see in Baltimore are reviled. It speaks to a double standard; and the idea that there is something wrong with the black community in Baltimore, or anywhere else, because black people robbed a 7-11 is absurd.",1430183596,"","1432146028",2,688,"videos"

"EclecticDreck","","","I think the single most surreal part of US Army basic training was the grenade range.

You spend a morning going through the motions.  You throw many dummy grenades.  You are given a simple block of instructions at tremendous length.

The task you are given is simple - prepare a grenade and throw it over a wall.  That's it.

So after a day proving you can toss an object with fair accuracy at various things they file you into a bunker and one by one you are handed a real honest to god M67 - an object perfectly capable of killing everyone inside the bunker if it happens to explode inopportunely.  

You are told to hold it tightly in both hands to ensure you have positive control.  I have never gripped any object as hard in my life.  You walk to the firing line which is nothing more than 3 walls of reinforced concrete.  Inside is a Drill Sergeant who repeats the final set of instructions.  You prime the grenade.  You throw the grenade.  The drill sergeant will tell you if the grenade went outside - in which case, duck, or if it went inside in which case you jump out of your bunker and take shelter just behind it.

The task is simple enough.  This is a short wall.  The grenade is heavy but certainly something you can pitch quite a distance.  The device has a few steps but is pretty simple.  And yet the bunker is sunk into the ground about a half meter and the inside is pocked and scarred by fragments.  Someone has clearly managed to fuck this up before you.

And so you tightly grip the grenade and at the instruction of the Drill Sergeant you remove the safety clip while still holding the grenade with both hands - basically you slip it off with a thumb.  Then you put your finger through the ring - the first time you've only had one hand on a live grenade in your life most likely and are told to pull.  And so you pull the pin and still grip the grenade as though it will try and squirm away any moment. 

And then you are told to ready the grenade and so you take a silly stance you've been shown.  And you are told to throw and so you throw the thing as hard as you can well above the wall not caring where it lands as long as that where is on the happy side of your little wall.

You are told ""Grenade out of the hole"" and so you crouch and cover as you were shown and wait as an eternity ticks by in 3 or 5 seconds.  You might not trust their interpretation of events.  They might be mistaken.  These might be your last seconds on earth.

Then the grenade explodes - it isn't a sound but a force.  You don't hear it - you feel it in your bones.  Since there is no searing pain or enveloping blackness you begin to hope that perhaps all is well.  You are probably yelled at to get the hell out of the bunker.

"willo77","","","I am a little perturbed by the amount of anti-Islam notions on Reddit recently. 

Anybody is ignorant to think they can understand the religion of Islam simply by someone typing a quote from the Qu'ran, or by someone posting clearly biased statistics from the internet that support their point, and they are also ignorant to judge the 1 billion+ muslims on a tiny minority of people who resort to violence. 

But of course, a lot of redditors right now think they understand the religion of Islam perfectly - its all about killing people, right!?

And what's even worse is I'm going to be downvoted to oblivion just for voicing another opinion. This is one of the bad things about Reddit.

EDIT: Excuse me for writing ' I'm going to be downvoted to oblivion'. I wrote this as I genuinely thought I would be downvoted to the point where people would not be able to see my comment, as when I first checked the comments section there were 6 or 7 comments all in support of Islam/against Islamophobia. I then wrote this as I hoped it would deter some users from downvoting my comment so my opinion could still be heard. I apologise for this.

EDIT 2: I find it curious that the majority of you presume I am a Muslim. I suppose maybe it sounded like it but rather, I am an atheist who, after doing some research on the world religions decided they didn't really like the concept of religion at all. However I do like the concept of treating people on an equal basis and not judging people on the actions of others, which are wholly out of their hands. 

I think it is important that when attacks like these happen we must remember not to generalise the entire religion of Islam and not talk about Muslims as though they are all responsible. 

A touching example of this was after the horrific Sydney Siege when the hashtag ['I'll Ride With You'](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-trending-30479306) was trending on twitter.

"xcomv01","","","There is more to the story than what you see here. Chevron has never operated in Ecuador. Texaco Petroleum (TexPet), which became a subsidiary of Chevron in 2001, was a minority partner in an oil-production consortium in Ecuador along with the state-owned oil company, Petroecuador, from 1964 to 1992. After TexPet turned its remaining share of the oil operations over to Petroecuador in 1992, pursuant to an agreement with Ecuador, TexPet conducted a remediation of selected production sites while Petroecuador committed to perform any remaining cleanup. The government of Ecuador oversaw and certified the successful completion of TexPet’s remediation and fully released TexPet from further environmental liability. Petroecuador, however, failed to conduct the cleanup it promised and has continued to operate and expand oil operations in the former concession over the past 20 years.

"mcanerin","","","Just so we are clear, there is a difference between true urban Chinese and rural Chinese. I know this sounds like a no true Scotsman speech, but hear me out.

You know how, almost without fail, that whatever country you happen to be living in right now, there is a backwards, less educated area where people seem to have missed the whole ""civilization"" memo? Often it's rural, but sometimes it's certain areas of big cites. They are usually uneducated, poor, racist,and if they are religious they tend towards an intolerant version of it. Often they drink or take drugs too much and are proud of it. I know you know who I'm talking about, and I don't even know what country or city you are in right now. 

The problem is that this area of China is currently MOST of the damn country. It's extremely aggravating to native Hong Kong, Shanghai and Beijingers, because these cities tend to get swamped by these folk arriving for jobs and ruining it for everyone.

A few years ago, only wealthy Chinese could travel, so you never heard about ""Chinese tourists"". ""Chinese tourists"" ruining things simply wasn't something that happened before the Beijing Olympics. 

Now, travel is becoming more open and suddenly all these, let's call them hicks, who can now buy tickets and visit countries. But these are not just any hicks. No, they are hicks that are MUCH more important than the other hicks back in their village. In their own minds, of course. 

So, arrogant, elitist hicks. That can travel. Result: suddenly, we have Chinese Tourist memes. The same thing happened when the American middle and lower middle class was first able to afford to travel - we ended up with the stereotypical ""ugly American"". They weren't ""normal"" Americans, they were hicks with tickets.

I know it doesn't seem like it, but this is actually a good thing in the big picture - it shows in very real terms the rising wealth and freedom in China. Yeah, it's the ugly side of it, but it is an important part of the process.

Here on the internet, we got the same thing when AOL users first got access to the internet (if you are old enough to remember it). We see a bit of it every fall when University starts. It eventually works itself out, but it takes a while because there is a new crop of hicks coming through over and over. But eventually the people returning, and embarrassing stories, start to have an effect on them.

Today, I don't see the ""ugly American"" tourist anymore. Sure, there are a few idiots, but in no more numbers than most other countries idiots. It took about a full generation to do it. Actually, of the WASP-type tourists I see being jerks, the baton has mostly been passed to Australians in Asia. Bogans with tickets.

The Chinese will eventually become normal travelers, but it's going to take a while. Just don't assume that every Chinese traveler you meet is a hick - usually the ones traveling solo or in small groups are pretty normal - it's the tour groups of people who are clearly new to the whole travel thing, and have never really had to actually deal with other cultures, races, religions, or history in their whole lives before - they often actually don't know any better, as sad as that sounds.

From the non-Chinese tourist destination perspective, we can probably do everyone a favor, Chinese or not, by educating them properly. Through gentle education if possible, and ruthless shaming if not.",1426530435,"","False",1,190,"videos"
