TRUE,ainrialai,,,"&gt;It's not really relevant, you didn't buy and sell slaves, I didn't buy and sell slaves, people did that hundreds of years ago

This is true, of course. No one alive today is in any way responsible for the Atlantic slave trade or the actions of their ancestors. However, the reason black slavery is still relevant is not only the social implications it's had on American society (and I mean ""American"" as in ""the Americas""), with respect to racial attitudes and discrimination, but also the direct economic effects that exist today. 

Take the United States for example. For centuries, slave labor was a major contributing factor in powering the economy of the country and its colonial predecessors, enriching an entire owning class. When slavery was abolished, the owning class retained ownership of the land made profitable by the slaves and the generations of profits produced by the slaves, while the erstwhile slaves were left nothing but their persons. They had to turn around and sell their labor for a cut-rate wage, often to their old owners. It's as if the slaves had been pushing the owners for generations, building up centuries of acceleration, and then, from a standstill, had to start running to catch up with them. But, in reality, the only way to make any progress was to continue to push them, just under different terms. And, in 1865, they found themselves destitute in a society that had started centuries before by people who had come to claim small plots of their own land. Even non-slave-owners who had some form of property had a big advantage over the freed slaves.

Of course, there were many poor and dispossessed white workers at the time, who were often treated just as badly as the former slaves by bosses and owners. The history of these oppressed workers also echoes to the modern day, with the white poor outnumbering the black poor, though the *rate* for the latter is higher. But it is still important to note that, while social mobility is a daunting and often unrealistic prospect for the poor of any race, it is somewhat easier for the white poor. The economic descendants of the past owning class, the modern capitalist owning class, are still largely white, and still biased towards their own ""in-groups,"" which has been documented in studies showing intense hiring discrimination based on race. The effects of slavery even hurt white workers economically; at the time, slavery lowered wages, and later, the racial attitudes built up by the white owners during the slave period were used to keep white and black workers divided, helping the owners break unions and keep down wages for all workers.

So you see why black slavery in the Americas is still an important thing to understand, I hope, and why efforts to make people ignore it or think it's not really relevant anymore are harmful. In an economic system in which wealth is heritable and property ownership is the main engine for economic profit, an entire group of people starting out at a massive disadvantage can never be expected to just correct over time. The playing field was never leveled, as property ownership has continued to be passed on in uninterrupted lines within the capitalist system, and so a black worker born today is still economically disadvantaged with respect to a white worker of similar economic standing, though of course both are in shit positions in comparison to the owners, and have much more in common with each other than with owners of their own respective races. White people in general don't need to answer for black slavery, but rich owners of productive property are tied up in systems of repression that date back to the institutions of slavery.",0,1388534600,,0,FALSE,1,ceefv8b,t3_1u48ce,t1_ceefv8b,t1_ceee6d6,1427910672,98,FALSE,AdviceAnimals,t5_2s7tt,98

TRUE,skftw,,,"I fully agree with you. Mind numbing work isn't fun, and everyone should aspire to go far above and beyond a job like that into a meaningful career. I moved into the IT field from where I used to be and I wouldn't go back even for a raise.

I guess my point was that it's the absolute minimum, because it's (largely) unskilled labor. Give it a few years and that job could be replaced with a Roomba.

This of course doesn't apply to everyone or every company, but I personally feel that my ""minimum"" lifestyle is achievable at the minimum wage. We can't let people starve, but they don't really *need* to be able to afford large apartments to themselves and bigscreen TVs when they can live comfortably with others (also likely in similar financial situations at low level jobs) while buying a TV at Goodwill for a buck (was dropping things off there yesterday, 30+"" CRTs are only $1). Even a working car can be found on craigslist for under $1000 if you're careful. It won't be pretty, but it's enough to get by.

This is just my relatively unpopular and rarely voiced opinion, but a minimum is pretty much only there to get you by. I will say that some of my feelings on this come from me being pretty handy -- I would buy things that needed work for cheap and use them for as long as possible. I understand that many aren't comfortable buying used or less-nice things because they can't fix them if anything happens. I still try to remain as objective as possible but no one can experience minimum-wage living from every angle so I'm likely not considering all possibilities, such as a low paying job while supporting a family.

So when OP strips out the victimhood of many african peoples by combining them with a whole fucking continent of other african peoples' he's doing a massive disservice.

Prior to colonial slavery there was no large scale systemisation of slavery, slaves were never considered chattel or anything other than human. Yes it existed, but thats like comparing, the early ford car with oh i dont know a Toyota pick up truck. bad example but you get my point.


Its a very colonialist mindset to simply label africa as 'doing it to itself'. They were provided the tools, the impetus, the financial backing and crucially the forts and order numbers to supply the demand for slaves on the plantations, which was all headed up by, you guessed it, colonials.

Then people cry racism, and say its religion. bullshit. Aside from that one skewed reference about ham being punished, there's no reason in there for mass production line slavery.

You could look at early [pre slavetrade] european paintings of africans dressed as civilised without any exaagerated features or much differentiation with white peoples and see that no, a racism mindset did not play a part in colonial slavery.

Rather, slavery caused racism [or a lot of it] rather than the other way round. Reasons and justifications were backdated using theological, faux scientific [think django -leo dicaprio philosophies], faux geopolitical, and many other reasons which all are largely bullshit to keep the economic presses rolling.

People identified by *religion*. This is where Islam is. If you get an influential figure and they say about Americans; ""Yeah, you guys are all fucking stupid. I hope your soldiers step on an IED over there in Afghanistan, it's all you imperialistic fucks deserve"" - this is guaranteed to piss off Americans, except a few who have some really thick skin. 

This is what you do when you mock Islam. It's like calling a black person a nigger. They identify themselves as *black*. It is what they are. They were born that way, raised that way, they *live* that way. If you tell them to go back working in the cotton fields where they belong, you, again, get a really angry reaction from black people. 

Progressive, Westernized Muslims don't care if Islam is made fun of. That's because they're *Westernized*.

&gt; It is important to understand the definition of unconditional love to be able to give it, it is the kind of love that expects nothing back, places no limits, and does not set any ideals or conditions on what it should be.

Translation: You are being unreasonable, setting boundaries and expecting me to abide by them. If you *really* loved me, you would let me do whatever I like, and do whatever I ask.

&gt; When you love in this way you do it without expectation of reciprocity and with no preconceived notions of how or if they will express love back to you.

Translation: Your expectations that I love you back are wrong. If you truly loved me, you wouldn't need me to love you back.

&gt; This is the kind of love you see exhibited by parents and children, brothers and sisters, true friends, and the best of romantic relationships.

Translation: You're my child, so this is how you should love me, without expecting anything in return.

&gt; When you love someone unconditionally you do not set limits or boundaries on that love, not circumstances that would cause you to withdraw it, there is nothing that would cause you to not love the person.

Translation: You are a bad person for cutting contact with me and refusing to give me all I want just because I'm an abusive monster.

&gt; Even if the other person does something that you feel is intentional, it is overlooked if you are truly committed to unconditional love.

Translation: You need to overlook anything I did that you didn't like so we can get back to the important task of telling you everything that you're doing wrong with your life.

&gt; You do not try to control the actions of the other person, nor do you tell them that you will not love them if they act a certain way or do a certain thing. When this kind of love is present both partners feel more secure and neither of them seeks to control the other.

Translation: Don't try to tell me what I can and cannot do with your life, and I won't try to control you, so long as you do everything I tell you to.

&gt; Since there are no boundaries or conditions the people in a relationship of unconditional love do not have to worry about the other person leaving or not loving them over a particular situation or behavior. Siblings in most cases are a good example of this, even though they may have quarrels and disagreements throughout their lives the bond between them remains unbroken and their love continues through any and all conflicts.

Translation: I OWN YOU FOREVER BECAUSE YOU CAME OUT OF MY BODY.

&gt; If you love someone unconditionally you will want whatever is best for them and you will always give them the freedom to seek out the things that really give them happiness. You will let them learn things for themselves and explore situations and experiences that they feel will make them happy, even if you think that you know what is best for them. Although they may make bad choices and do things that are wrong you will always be there for them and never judge them if you truly love them unconditionally.

Translation: I love you even though you are a failure who is doing everything wrong with your life.

&gt; Can you see room for improvement in your relationship? Do you place restrictions and limitations on the one you love? When you truly love someone unconditionally, you place their needs and their happiness above everything else, including yourself.

TRUE,cityoflostwages,tax,Big4 Asset Mgmt Audit/Tax (US),"First of all, it's good that you're looking ahead and considering careers you may be interested in. I'll try to answer some of your questions:

1. Not really. I wouldn't worry about reading ahead on accounting as you'll have plenty of time to do this in college. In highschool try to get involved in some business related activities, leadership positions (student gov or student clubs), or volunteer. Keep a high gpa and work on extra curriculars!
2. For California the top school is USC(top 5 in the country), you can get a job pretty much anywhere coming out of Leventhal. I'd put UCLA as #2 for southern california recruiting and CAL for #2 if you're aiming for NorCal. SDSU is a good third option for the SD market. SJSU is also recruited at in the bay area and UCR/UCSB. FYI this is just my opinion regarding the schools as I'm sure other people here will have a different opinion or recommendation. That 3.5 gpa you are referring to is your cumulative university gpa, not your highschool gpa.
3. Audit, Tax, Advisory are the three in public accounting. Private accounting is different and can vary. You should be able to google for differences or use the search feature here as it is a common question.
4. This can vary. Big4 tends to be 50-60k starting, mid-tier firms are roughly competitive to this, and more regional firms are slightly less. It will also vary with audit vs. tax. versus advisory positions.
5. Some would say yes, a lot of the people here would say no. In tax I sit at my desk most of the day, answer emails, talk to clients, and do a ton of work on my laptop with excel and other accounting applications. The physical effort involved is very similar to computer programming, just a different skillset and knowledge-base that you are learning and working with.
6. I can't really say what sort of college you should be looking for. Go to one with a strong accounting program and good recruiting(see california schools listed above). After that it will be a personality fit with what school feels the most comfortable. Don't worry about what classes you should take until you get into college, most full accounting majors are very similar in their curriculum.
7. This is a great idea if cost is an issue. USC and UC schools are very transfer friendly and work with community colleges to setup transfer programs. SMCC in santa monica for example feeds a ton of students to usc/ucla. However, 4 years in a university is a great experience and would be much more enjoyable if you can afford it. This also gives you 4 years of recruiting with firm recruiters on campus instead of only 2.
8. Public accounting firms generally don't hire interns unless they are juniors in university as they want to hire them full-time afterwards for a post-graduation start date. You are better off finding some small businesses that need help with basis accounting work to get a feel for it. Most people don't have accounting work experience prior to university but you'll have plenty of time to build it during your 4 years.
9. First and foremost, a great gpa. It doesn't need to be a 4.0 but many accounting firms have a gpa cut off between 3.0 and 3.5 so you want to do great in highschool and great in university as far as academics go. Next is either job experience(part-time is fine or even on campus work) or volunteer/leadership experience. Try to get involved in student government or become an executive board member of a student club or become heavily involved in a hobby you are passionate about. Recruiters want to see someone who is well-rounded and who can maintain a high gpa while being a leader on campus or in their community. All of the above schools should have accounting student organizations you can join.

TRUE,rsdancey,,,"The United States is finely balanced between two blocs of voters:  People who want to use wealth redistribution schemes to level the economic landscape, and people who are ok with the idea that there are people on the extreme high and extreme low ends of the economic spectrum.

Through a quirk in the way our politics developed there is a sizeable group of voters who SHOULD be in the wealth redistribution bloc based on their household incomes and their needs, but who ARE in the winners &amp; losers bloc.  This quirk has troubled political observers for 50 years.  It is primarily due to the fact that there are a lot of poor evangelical Christians in the United States that care more about abortion than their personal household checkbooks.  Strange, but true.

To keep the government from creating a European-style national health system the forces that don't want one have boxed single-payer healthcare into the idea of ""Socialism"", and have defined ""Socialism"" as Anti-American.  They have spent 100 years telling anyone who will listen that the outcome of a single-payer healthcare system will be a reduced quality of care, rationing of healthcare services, and a lack of choice about who your doctor will be or what treatments you can receive.  They are effective with this line of argument because it is all true - every national health service in Europe, Canada and Japan does these things.  There's no effective advocate for the other side of that argument, that helathcare costs have spiraled out of control because of the unique economics of healthcare (you'll pay anything to stay alive), and that universal care, even if rationed, is better for society than having 20% of the population live in fear of getting sick, and with healthcare costs triggering bankruptcies for many households where someone suffers a catastrophic illness like cancer or chronic heart disease.

In the last Presidential election, 52% of the voters picked the candidate that represents the wealth distribution bloc, and 47% picked the candidate that represents the winners &amp; losers bloc.  But it was just 8 years ago that the election went the other way, and there's good reason to think that it's a tossup now based on candidate personalities and campaign discipline who will become President.  Due to our strange Electoral College system who becomes President is now determined by a sliver of voters (less than 300,000 out of 330,000,000 residents) in 5 states:  Ohio, Florida, Virginia, New Mexico and Nevada.  With elections decided on these kinds of slim margins, there's an all out war to fight for a few voters who may change from Republican to Democrat in any given election.

The theory is that if enough new people are enrolled in some kind of new government mandated insurance plan, a batch of these ""swing voters"" will be captured by the value of the plan - once they have it, they'll never give it up (see: Social Security).  Those voters will forever after vote Democratic to protect that healthcare insurance, effectively locking in Democratic Presidents barring a personal meltdown or a major event like a war or another 9/11.

So the Republicans and their operatives are fighting with everything in their power to convince people to kill healthcare expansion before the lock-in occurs.  Worse, they're worried that once there's a lock-in, it will enable the Democrats to go for a full-scale single-payer national healthcare system: a system they cannot get with the current divisions in the electorate (which is why we didn't get one in 2008 even though there was a Democratic House, a Democratic Supermajority in the Senate and a Democrat in the White House).

For the GOP, this is literally a life or death struggle.  If they lose, there's a non-zero chance the Republican Party will become so marginalized that it will break apart (which is how the Republican Party was born in the first place; when the Whig party tore itself apart over the issue of slavery in the 1850s)",0,1388543611,,0,1388544088,1,ceeiqxo,t3_1u48ku,t1_ceeiqxo,t3_1u48ku,1427909329,22,FALSE,explainlikeimfive,t5_2sokd,22

The facility is immense, and spans across an entire planet placed at the edge of a series of black holes. Eli soon finds a way, via a cloning lab, to resurrect himself a new body and transferring his consciousness into it.  It succeeds, but unfortunately now he is physically at the command station instead of Destiny, as due to the ship's power constraints he is unable to establish a stable gate connection, but he is able to help the ship remotely in unique ways as he discovers new technologies and features of this command station.  All the while he slowly creeps into a depression, sulking over the death of Chloe, and ultimately pondering his ending up alone in this vast structure.  
  
  This command station is eventually discovered to be a center of operations, with ""broadcast stations"" throughout the universe, all connected at this hub. Soon it is shown that this is the staging area for not just sending seed ships and what not, but it can directly dial into alternate, adjacent parallel universes where a group of ancients is still alive and well.  The entire command station tunnels through multiple universes, tapping into them to power the reactor, like a large multidimensional ZPM. It is revealed that this is the origin of all stargates in the universe and the source behind the transmission of Zero Point technology.  
  
  Eli is soon able to establish contact with this group of ancients in an adjacent dimension and after some convincing, is able to get information about the command station and Destiny. It is eventually found by these surviving ancients, who have forgotten their history and are delving into what is considered their lore, that there are dangerous implications of the technology in the command station and the ""Signal"" that Destiny is traveling to is essentially some sort of interference from the command station's power reactor, a side effect of tearing through universes that balances the energy out, but it is growing unstable and could cause an unraveling. 
  
  It is revealed that this was known by the ancients and spurred the solution to use destiny, and a hidden device on the ship to detonate and ""Seal"" the rift to ensure it doesn't collapse and take with it our entire universe.  The ancients in this other reality were suppose to return and complete the task but due to them forgetting and also utilizing technology to adapt to their reality over many generations they can no longer safely transverse back into our universe. The shutdown has to occur together, with Eli initiating a shutdown from the command station in conjunction with Rush on Destiny, in order to complete the process.   
  
  The crew reacts strongly to the premise of dying with Destiny and there are frantic efforts to get off the ship. As Destiny approaches the destination, Eli is finally able to establish a gate connection with Destiny and evacuates the crew to this command station. As part of the final solution, Destiny's gate then autodials into the command station's power reactor, locking those gates in sync. Being pressed for time, he is unable to connect to any stargates anywhere, except for one mysteriously erratic gate. With limited options, as once the shutdown is complete there will no longer be any power in the facility, they connect to this gate and the crew steps through. This gate is revealed to be located behind a waterfall embedded into a long lost, overgrown structure, with the crew being thrust out the gate, shot down a long moss covered water-slide like formation, rocketing through the waterfall, and splashing into a beautiful pool of clear water. Eli stays behind to initiate the shutdown process, which will cause him to be stranded at the edge of the universe.  
  
  The final moments are with Rush, at the Helm interfaced to the detonation device. Destiny approaching a glorious sight which is the signal. The device launches and the explosion occurs, tearing apart space and time, plunging the ship into the rift causing it to vanish. The shutdown happens, the command station power reactor powers down, leaving Eli stranded by himself in this darkened silent facility, alone, as he contemplates his fate. It turns out the explosion melded Rush with the rift, him becoming one with the edge fabric of the universe, and ultimately reaching a God-like existence, able to transcend and travel through space and time at will. And due to this, he is able to reverse some action in the past and take Eli home, ultimately restoring the universe to how it was meant to be.  
  
  The series ends with Eli appearing in a beautiful field, Rush by his side near a group of the rest of the crew.  It is a typical reunion of characters but stepping out from behind the crowd is Chloe, alive and well. It is revealed Rush was able to travel back in time, go to the Destiny and repair her cryogenic chamber to prevent her death. The only ones that remember her death being Eli and Rush, shielded from those temporal changes due to the entire shutdown process. It is then revealed Rush's Omnipotence was a temporary side-effect as he fades away into the background noise of the cosmos, his essence being utilized by the ancient technology, as the seal, the ascended guardian of the rift. The entire cast tearfully says their goodbyes and makes amends as he slowly disappears, with the final shot showing Rush's eyes wide opened, in joyful awe, as his last echoing words are ""I can see it! I understand!"" 

After he vanishes, someone says ""Where are we?"" The camera then pans away and pulls back, showing the group in this field, surrounded by dense jungle, as it slowly zooms skyward you can see the temple structure, and the outline, and it reveals that it is not a traditional temple, but the remains of a large, seed ship, crashed long ago and overgrown with jungle, hidden over time. It appears to be Destiny, thrown back into the distant past through the rift. With possibly some help from Rush, or maybe the ancients, to give them a gate to escape to.  The camera continues to zoom out revealing that they are in fact on Earth, that they have made it home.

That's incredibly low.

As for the threads themselves, it has everything to do with curating content, and (almost) nothing to do with people just being mean.  Downvotes on posts are (usually) nothing personal, but simply the way the community, (namely those who browse /r/starcitizen/new specifically), helps dictate what rises to the top and is subsequently seen by those who only browse /r/starcitizen with the default 'hot' sorting, or who only see posts from here when they pop up on their own front page.

Daily duplicates of the same half a dozen questions do not belong near the top; sorry, they just don't.  But they do deserve to be answered, and if you'll notice, 99.9% of the time, they are.  There's a surprisingly large number of us who answer questions from newcomers on a daily basis, and have been doing so for... well, a very long time.

If a question comes up that I think the community as a whole needs to see, I'll definitely try to help push it towards the top, but if it's something that's been answered three times this week, I'll make sure it's been answered, and then let it fade into the black.

Instead of encouraging newcomers to make four new threads in just over 24 hours ([wink,](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/1tz0um/does_rsi_have_plans_to_prevent_the_goons_from/) [wink,](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/1u02oc/ive_fallen_in_love_my_freelancer_is_all_the/) [nudge,](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/1u4gbo/how_will_insurance_fraud_be_detected/) [nudge...](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/1u4rl7/meta_why_is_there_so_much_negativity_on_this/)), maybe we could encourage people to use the [**'New player Q&amp;A + FAQ'**](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/1step3/new_player_qa_faq/) to ask their questions; it's been stickied to the top, in one form or another, for almost a month now. :)

TRUE,[deleted],,,"It is good that all of these emotions and areas of personal value are coming up! When we hide from or ignore our issues it festers and grows. When these issues grow stories of fiction and fantasies are created by the mind. From there we lose sense of who we really are and make rash decisions on a mind obsessed with fictitious story we made up! Be aware of what is real and what is not real. 



If I were in your shoes, I too would have these concerns and desires. I would definitely think about ending a relationship over unsatisfied sex. As much as I love a person, there is still the fact that I am a man and I have a penis which can overcome logic and common sense. 


My advice is clear communication. Be wise about your approach to the conversation, this is not an interrigation and a meeting to decide who is right or who is wrong. This is a conversation to RELATE with eachother and talk about something that could end your partnership together. 


Express yourself with sincerity and avoid ""YOU!"" statements. Don't be accusing or come off as the enemy. Anytime we say ""because you do this"" or ""it is your fault"" we become an attacker and destroy the bonds of love.


Use ""I"" statements such as ""I feel that..."" or ""I would like you to...""  You don't have to avoid the ""you"" just make sure that the statement is coming from an ""I"" priority.  example ""I would like us to be close and would like us to be happy together. Therefore I feel it is important to tell you something that has been on my mind. I respect your choices and I would like to you to hear me out about how we go about sex""


Don't expect instant results or an instant turn around! After a conversation that burdens the ego, a person needs time to settle and digest the experience.


In the end, one of you has to accept, give in, be willing to change, be willing to ask, be willing to be open and forthcoming, or meet somewhere in the middle. Maybe she will not fulfill all your sexual desires by next month, but maybe she will take steps to get there.



Also consider that there could be an emotional memory from a trauma that happened in her past that might make he resistant to sex. I know I've dated some girls who were sexually molested and raped but had not known about it until they had a memory flashback in their adult hood. Perhaps it was the upbringing....


It is important to come at this issue with a willing spirit and ask your partner to do so as well..


Always end on a positive note too (always start positive and end positive... the ending feeling is what a person remembers about the experience anyway).... ""... and I feel if we work together as a team on this that we can really grow closer as a couple and open up to new possibilities for us. You are my partner and I would like you to be my partner in this.""


And this is true, you really have to work as a team and talk about this stuff. You can't conquer it on your own and neither can she... You need to be supporting of her as she opens up because when someone opens themselves up to you like that they are fragile and need nourishing loving vibes coming from you. Amd her part in this is to be willing and open to new things.... Explore options with her... even ask her what is needed for her to do this... or what you can do to help if she needs it... Express that you don't want this for you, but for us... That you want this to also be a positive experience for her!



Hope this helps, blessings ;)



and don't take everyone's advice on reddit at face value, not even mine... a lot of negative people who have had similar experiences will side with the part of you that feels ""justified and right"". I've seen many relationships crumble because someone listened to the advice of a ""friend"" who was looking out for them when they were really just angry with their own past and taking it out on the guys girlfriend.

TRUE,Xelif,,,"More specifically... the liquid iron-nickel outer core surrounding it.

Let's start from the top, actually. Assume you're digging in the middle of North America - say, Kansas. First you'd dig through rock. Lots of rock: 50 km of it. At 12.2 km deep - the deepest humanity has dug through continental crust, at the [Kola Superdeep Borehole](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kola_Superdeep_Borehole) in northern Russia - it would already be quite hot, 180 degrees Centigrade or so. It would just get hotter from there: just 3 km later, it would be 300 degrees Centigrade.

At about 15 km, the rock would transition from brittle to ductile - instead of shattering, it would deform, like very, very hard putty or Play-doh.

At 35 km or so, you'd hit the Mohorovičić discontinuity, or ""Moho"" for short. Congratulations - you've just hit an important scientific milestone! You're still in the *lithosphere*, or area of solid rock - no magma yet. We know what the Moho is - it's an abrupt boundary between basalt and peridodite/dunite. We're just not quite sure what mechanism creates such a smooth boundary.

When you hit maybe 150 km deep, the temperature will be around 1300C, and the rock will finally kinda-sorta liquefy. You've hit the *asthenosphere*! This is the ""ocean"" of kinda-sorta liquid rock that the plates move around on top of. I say kinda-sorta liquid because it's not liquid; it's a very ductile solid - the asthenosphere has roughly the consistency of honey. It's still composed of rock, though - you'll find ""ultramafic"" (rocks comparatively rich in magnesium and iron, and poor in silicon) rocks uncommon at the surface like peridotite, dunite, and eclogite.

You dig some more, and around 350 km deep, suddenly everything's solid again! Or, at least, relatively more solid. (At this point, I've given our dear readers who study rheology - the study of deformation and flow of liquids and ductile solids - multiple aneurysms with my fuzzy terminology.) The vast majority of the mantle is actually quite solid, because it's under incredible pressure from all of the stuff above it.

Now it gets boring for a while. You descend through another ~2500 km of solid mantle. There are some features that might be interesting to a geophysicist, but that's about it. You'll dig through the remnants of the Farallon Plate, which has almost entirely subducted underneath the North American Plate. (The Juan de Fuca Plate off Washington and British Columbia is a small leftover piece; the margin will eventually violently rupture, causing a huge offshore earthquake which will cause a tsunami which will be funneled down Puget Sound - bye-bye, Seattle!)

Around 2900 km deep, it starts to get more liquid and more metal. You're getting close to the liquid outer core: a ball of molten iron and nickel. By 3100 km deep you're in a vast ""ocean"" of molten metal.

Finally, after another, even more boring 2000 km, you bang up against the solid inner core - at this depth there's so much pressure that, as with the solid mantle earlier, the iron and nickel is solid, despite the temperature. 1200 km of digging through solid metal later, you've reached the center of the earth.

More realistically, you'll be devoured in a fiery explosion of lava somewhere between 30 and 150 km deep. Remember the recurring theme of ""this is solid because pressure""? Well, remove the pressure, and the rock will instantly melt.

When rendering things really far away, the computer stores Z-distances as floating point numbers (decimal approximations in digital form, they are not accurate decimals because a computer can't store accurate decimal points). 

A key note in this point is the fact that objects farther away from you have less and less decimal accuracy. So when you zoom in with a 40x scope and you're seeing randomly ground and objects are flickering back and forth. Why is this happening? Because at that distance the computer is having a hard time telling the difference between 501.98734 meters and 501.98733 meters. 

So Z-fighting is what happens when two objects flicker back and forth because they think they are occupying the same ""Z-space"".

TRUE,UTclimber,,,"You didn't ask for an opinion, but tell your wife to skip VS and go to Macy's.

VS is over priced and very poor quality. Despite the super sexy models and commercials, their bras warp, twist, bend, shrink, stretch, or do any number of things. Hand washing does little to prevent the demise and destruction of VS bras and panties. Their garments are poor quality, and over priced. I have spent years dealing their their flowery, sparkly, shimmery, and scratchy as all hell booby and coochie death traps before my body and my wallet called it quits. 

I sucked up my pride and went to visit the old ladies in Macy's lingerie department. While I may have been embarrassed as an old women poked and pulled and prodded, and rushed into my dressing room while my bits were on display, I walked away with the most form fitting, comfortable, and supportive bras I have ever known in my whole life. The pain of fitting was temporary. The enjoyment of a REAL undergarment was worth it. I bought five bras and a bag full of undies (in my defense it was a sale, and I had a coupon, but that's incidental information here)

It's been two+ years since I payed that traumatic visit to Macy's, and I don't regret it in the least, as I have yet to wear ANY of my VS undies, and I wear my Macy's every single day. 

So there's my unsolicited advice for the day. 

TL; DR, VS is only for ""Show and Tell"" if you get my drift. Tell your wife to go to Mayc's.

The author's claim is wrong because reaction mass ejected from a rocket has both mass and velocity, and therefore also momentum.  By imparting momentum on the reaction mass in one direction, the rocket gains momentum in the opposite direction.  It doesn't matter what state the reaction mass is or the medium it's released into.  Even in the case of a gaseous reaction mass, Graham's law of effusion shows that gas escaping a pressurized container through an opening has velocity.

The author's analysis is flawed in two ways.  First, the principle of free expansion only applies when gas can expand into a vacuum in all directions; in a rocket, it can't do so until after it exits the nozzle.  Second, he assumes the pressure of the system is zero in his work equation, while ignoring the fact that rockets operate at extremely high combustion chamber pressures.

TRUE,Ghost404,hornet,Hello mobile users.,"Against my better judgement, I'll take the bait.

Instead of focusing on 90% of what I said, you chose to focus the bulk of your reply on the one good-natured snark about you posting so much as the self proclaimed new guy.  So let me explain to you, one possible option, as to why people are having an issue with this post in particular.

You've come into a sub that's existed for well over a year, taken a quick glance around over the course of three days, and decided we're not doing a good enough job.  You've looked at a handful of the *thousands* of posts over the past year, and taken it upon yourself to tell 17,500 people, how they should be voting.

Let me explain something fundamental to you: This sub and it's subscribers, have been doing an amazing job at being friendly to newcomers, and as a community, is fucking amazing.  Let me say that again, since you may not have heard me:

**This community is fucking amazing.**

So for you to come in and tell all 17,500 of us that we're harboring such negativity, and that we shouldn't curate what little content we have the same way we have been for over a year, is wildly condescending, and a giant slap in the face to those of us who have been working so hard to help shape this community into what it is today.

So maybe next time you find something new, instead of coming in and shitting all over it, you should hang around for more than a few days before you decide that you know better.

But what the hell do I know about it.

If you truly love a woman's beauty you're going to do your best to initiate and interact with it IN REALITY, not DIGITALLY. This is coming from the guy who can have multiple O's, I understand what it feels like to have a truly strong appreciation of the female body, but trust me, it's a lot better when you are more interactive and less of a voyeur. That would be showing true love for a woman's beauty, not going for the pixels but the real deal.


I mentioned in my other thing that I occasionally have fantasies but those come and go and give me a different feeling than porn, and even softcore pics I know give me the same tastes as porn, except with the mild exception it's like I can try to make excuses and that is already a problem that I know to avoid. You're already trying to do the same thing with porn, except the only difference here is you are looking at a more 'covered-up'/censored version.


I don't think it's just up to us that's trying to say ""No"" here, you are probably saying No to yourself as well.


Edit: I know that the OP here has said a particular subreddit that may cause others to relapse, but come on.

&gt;The devils went down to Georgia and they were looking for a bowl to steal

&gt;They were playin out of their mind, put TAMU way behind, and had em beaten under their heel

&gt;They came across a young man throwing that football and running it hot

&gt;and ole Cutcliffe jumped on a hickory stump and said boy let me tell you what

&gt;I bet you didn't know it but I got football players too


&gt;and if you care to make a dare I'll make a bet with you

&gt;now you play some pretty good football boy, but give the devils their due

&gt;I bet a chicken platter of gold against your soul cause I think we're better than you

...

&gt;The boy says my names Johnny, and right now it looks like you might win

&gt;but I'll take that bet you're gonna regret cause I'm the best theres ever been

TRUE,webb34,empty-xbox-day-one,,"No. You can't just throw shit into the ""Turn off"" menu. That is breaking the own systems rules and it doesn't provide anything for the user. That menu is *specifically* harder to reach than normal because it contains ""non-forgiving functions"".

In UI design you try and make it so the user can make mistakes. Click a menu? Press B to back out. Accidentally start making a message? Press B to back out. Accidentally press the jewel? Press A to jump right back in because you start out highlighting the game itself. And so on.

If you turn off the system, that's it. There is no coming back from that. You have to turn the console completely on again. Anything you were doing is now gone. The same applies for turning the controller off.

That's why they have to make *absolutely sure* that you want to get into this menu.

There is literally no point in throwing anything else in there.

But you want to simply throw in various sections of a particular app into this menu? No. Absolutely not. You aren't fixing a problem. You are routing around it in a horrible fashion that breaks several rules and guidelines, that are backed up because it would *definitely* make the UI harder to work with.

By old dashboard, do you mean ""Quick Guide""? The menu that popped up when you hit the jewel on the 360's controller? Because also no.

The current system, believe it or not, is actually *vastly* superior. Look at the dashboard on the Xbox One. It is *constantly* running in the background. You press the jewel and BAM there it is. No waiting, no hesitation, no loading, it's just there.

From that one button press you now have *immediate* access to potentially 10 things within a single button press. You have the game itself, whatever you currently have snapped, the option to unsnap it, a full selection of all your games and apps, the disc tray controls, the Friends app(which I will get to in a second), and 4 other apps that are your most used.

What did you get on the 360 within one button press? The option to go to the dashboard, and ""Friends"". 2 things. Clearly inferior, especially when you combine it with the fact that the guide isn't constantly running and takes a while to come up, sometimes upwards of a minute.

You've already acknowledged a major problem:

&gt;Right now the way to get to friends/achievements/party is kinda a hassle and this could make it easier.

**So why are you trying to jury rig some workaround for it? That never ends well. You need to fix the core of the problem.**

How do you fix it? Well, you already have the app right there. When you click on the large tile to the left of the main app tile, it opens up the ""Friends App"". This app is the problem, as you said. 

So what about it do we change?

Well I actually covered this about a month ago and made some mockups for potential alterations to a couple sections of the UI.

You can find I'd go into them here, but there was a lot. Instead, you can find it here:

http://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/1s798d/potential_improvements_to_the_ui/

Notice how in my alterations(for the Friends app at least), I never break the established rules of the system. I'm simply changing the organization of information within that app to be more efficient.

As for some of the other alterations, I didn't break the rules. I *changed the system.* There is a major difference.",0,1388557585,,0,FALSE,1,ceemh27,t3_1u515l,t1_ceemh27,t1_ceem639,1427907493,1,FALSE,xboxone,t5_2xbci,1

TRUE,rainbowblight,,Destructo Girl,"Oz may have come across as a one-dimensional character, but he was just deep and introspective.  Just because he didn't demonstrate any extreme emotions on a regular basis doesn't mean that he wasn't experiencing them (i.e., ""Earshot"", ""New Moon Rising"").  What I saw between Oz and Willow was instant chemistry.  They just understood and trusted one another.  Guided each other.  I loved the moments when Oz was clearly head over heels in love with Willow before he knew her, Willow's cluelessness while she was blinded by Xander, and their adorable moments once they were together.  I just loved the effortless flow of their love story, and the abrupt way in which it ended has always rubbed me the wrong way.

Additionally, while making Oz a werewolf was probably unnecessary, couldn't you argue the same for making Tara a witch?  In a world where the paranormal is normal, I thought introducing a werewolf character was inevitable.  Why not a regular character, and why not as someone we would have to see struggle with it on a regular basis?  Granted, they probably should've waited until they had the budget to make a werewolf not look so... awkward...

Seeing different relationships on television is an essential part to entertainment and definitely helps to promote diversity.  I am absolutely not arguing that fact, and I'm very happy the Willow/Tara relationship was an important factor in your personal story.  However, I think it deserved to be told better, perhaps with a counterpart to Willow as dynamic and compelling as she was/is.

The only commonality is the near constant smog and the sickly spectrum of neon lights. The streets are metal, old and rusting, and encrusted with the filth of five-hundred years of commerce. The buildings tower above like impossibly tall trees, sprouting walkways, vents, pipes and cables, all tangled together to form an industrial canopy. 

Certain alleyways are so densely covered that no light reaches them. In fact, the city has grown so that there are almost two distinct levels, upper and lower. The upper level sees the sun, built about half/three-quarter ways up the towers (though this varies by location), upon sheets of metal and long bridges. Some bridges are wide boulevards, built by the city engineers, sturdy and reliable, complete with railings, walls, and even buildings. Others are little more that planks of wood on rope, swinging hundreds of feet above the underworld . 

The lower levels are the base streets. Damp and dark, lit only by artificial lights, these areas are home to all things nasty, and a haven for criminals. Not even the city's famously brutal police force dares go down there unless severely prompted. Illegally bored tunnels, and thieve's dens built into crumbling structures from a different time. Shacks and shanties, grottos of murky seawater and collapsed sinkholes-made-bazaars. The lower levels, and below them the sewers, are two worlds better left unexplored.

At the center of the city is the Citadel, a monolithic fortress with no windows, only doors. Fifty stories tall and a mile in diameter, it is the administrative center of the city-state and acts as the capitol building, central jail, military headquarters, treasury and temple. No one knows how or when it was built, only that it contains thousands of rooms and holds some of the greatest treasures in the world. Though the city has been besieged seven times, the Citadel has never once fallen.

II. Commerce 

The Grey River runs through the badlands like a shining stream of silver in a plain and ugly rock. Beginning in the mountains to the south, it is the final stop for badlanders looking to peddle their wares or buy exotic items. The mountains are rich with minerals, Tagrium and Ozillium, gold and iron, copper and jewels. Shan Zi holds a monopoly on the trade of these highly sought-after materials. The Gods' Metals specifically–Tagrium and Ozillum, alone nothing special, but together they form an unbreakable alloy, lighter than steel and more flexible than aluminum. 

As the only major hub in an otherwise desolate desert, it is the destination of all travellesr passing between the fertile kingdoms of the East and West. The city is fabulously wealthy, but—due to its unfortunately scarred surroundings—highly dependent on food imports. A city of fifteen million does not feed itself, after all.

Its 3 major exports are: machinery, godsteel, and automatons. 
Its 3 major imports are: foodstuffs, textiles, and spices

III. Famous People

*The Voice –*
	
The Voice is an Impossible–a biosynthetic humanoid, a thinking, living machine. But not only that, the Voice is the leader of these peoples. Imps (as they are dubbed, sometimes disdainfully) are most majorly concentrated in Shan Zi. Since they are superior to both men and the other races in nearly all ways, there have been numerous consecrated efforts to eradicate them. They have persevered however, and made Shan Zi there home. 

The Voice speaks for the Consciousness, which many Impossibles believe to be the collective embodiment of the will of their race. What makes the Voice unique is that she has lived for more than a thousand years, since the fall of humanity and the dawn of the New Era. She is one of the few beings to remember the old days. 	

She is immensely influential. A single word from the Voice can mobilize the great majority of Impossibles to war. She can cut of all trade to the outside world and strangle the Grey River. She possesses ascendent psychic powers, and is said to be the only being capable of challenging the Allsight—omnipotent god-emperor of the Eastern and Western Kingdoms. The Voice is feared and respected by subjects and enemies alike. Though the Council Assembly makes most decisions in Shan Zi, she is essentially the de-facto ruler. 

The Voice is rarely seen. She spends much of her time atop to Citadel, in a specially made monastery. 


*Kulur the Unyielding –*
	
Five hundred years ago, the forces of the Allsight came down upon Shan Zi in full might, intent to wipe the Impossibles away permanently. Kulur was chosen to be champion of the Voice. What was unusual about this, was that he was a man. A man of enormous stature, power, and ability, but a man nonetheless. Still, with the city besieged by God and the world, very few Impossibles complained. In the three years the city was under siege, it is said Kulur killed over ten thousand attackers, including seven Grand Marshals, six Dukes, three Archmages and two of the Allsight's earthly avatars.

In the final battle for the city, the Allsight transcended realms and crossed into the Waking World, for the first time since the days of old. For six days Kulur battled the Allsight, the physical manifestation of god on Earth. Each day he was slain, and each day the Voice resurrected him to fight again. On the seventh day of the battle, Kulur—his body so warped by the waters of the river Styx that it was virtually unrecognizable—stepped onto the field to fight once more. The Allsight, seeing that neither the Voice nor Kulur would yield until they were ground into oblivion, and taking pity on the tortured champion, withdrew his forces on the stipulation that Impossibles would never again leave the Badlands, or the ports of his trading cities. 

The Voice agreed, and the war ended. To this day, Kulur is feared among the subjects of the East and West Kingdoms, and revered by humans and Impossibles alike, as a symbol of resistance against the Allsight.

*King Shadow –*

Only one organization has openly opposed the Allsight, within his own borders, and persisted. The Cabal is a crime syndicate with frightening power and influence, and he is their leader. Dubbed King Shadow by his enemies, there is little known about him, other than the fact that he has supposedly lived as long as the Voice, and has never once been seen. Does he even truly exist? Both the Voice and the Allsight believe so, as they have both tried to eradicate him and his forces from their domains. But they have never been successful. Though no one knows King Shadow's place of birth, nationality or race, it is believed that his headquarters is somewhere in Shan Zi.

IV. Unique Items

Godsteel is an alloy of Tagrium and Ozillum, two ores found only in the great unnamed mountains in the southern Badlands. They are mined exclusively by the citizens of Shan Zi–made almost exclusively in Shan Zi, and sold almost exclusively in Shan Zi. Still, the Cabal runs a lucrative Godsteel black market, selling to the Two Kingdoms, and the various other client states of the Allsight.

Godsteel is unbreakable, light, and flexible. Though it must be molded before reaching its final form, it is still easy to manipulate and is used for a variety of things—from the tiny parts in automatons, to the gears which power the Allsight's great machines of war. It does not rust, but also cannot hold an edge. Oddly, when left out to the grey sands of the Badlands, it tends to deteriorate. No one knows why.

- - -

V. Ruling Body

The Council Assembly is an elected body of officials. It creates and passes all the laws in Shan Zi. Made up of one hundred representatives, it is generally evenly split between city-dwelling humans, Impossibles, and an array of various miscellaneous New Races. 

Council members are reelected every five years, though this is a fairly recent development, as of the last three centuries or so. Before that, only highborn could take seats in the Assembly, and once they were there, they were there for life. In those days, it consisted of nearly a thousand members, and was very inefficient. The Voice was, on multiple occasions, forced to make decisions that would otherwise be below her. 

Eventually, she grew fed up with the Assembly's constant stalemating and infighting. She disbanded the old Assembly, barred previous members from sitting on it, and held elections in which any free citizen of Shan Zi could run or vote. The old members were outraged, but after a crackdown by the City Enforcers, their voices were silenced.

Though chaotic at first, after several decades of careful guidance, it has become a semi-efficient governing body. To pass a law, they must have the approval of 65% of the committee. Laws can also be struck down by the Voice if she deems them harmful to the overall development of the city. She rarely intervenes, however.

TRUE,Oh_Fiddlesticks,,,"Fasting (nothing passing the lips, water only, or a certain food, etc.) has been done by humans since time immemorial for personal, spiritual or practical reasons. It is as much a psychological process (If not more so) than a physiological one. People, especially in this day and age, like to extract hard facts from everything around them and anything that cannot be quantified or catalogued is to be razed to the ground. Don't mean to get all high minded on ya, just framing the discussion. People (for and against) think juicing is 'Dr. Zamfram's Magic Elixir of Goodness' but it's pretty basic in its premise. 

As stated in this thread, researching juice fasting is not 'sexy' enough for foundations with limited grants and funds. There have been studies done on medical liquid diets such as MediFast, OptiFast, etc. but are not the same. There are some basic/common sense (For some) things to consider though. 

Crash dieting in any form is bad; it is not the same as fasting or whatever word you wish to use. It's not the same because the stated end goal/result is not the same. People drinking the Hollywood Grapefruit 6 day wonder diet want to lose 10 lbs. for vanity and vapidity. Fasting is done for inner/personal reasons for the purposes of some goal of renewal or a transformation of one's life (Again, this is more mental than physical); if you do it for weight loss alone, you've already lost the battle. You'll run to Papa John's right after you slam that last glass of juice down. 

It's true that, physically, you will not drastically change your body in a week or two after punishing it for decades; and after you are done with your fast, the body will have either expended or expelled the nutrients you drank. Aside from the mental aspect, juice fasting helps point you in the direction of food that will be better for you so that you continue a life sea change. A diet (contrary to the American definition of something one does 5 days before a wedding) is sustainence that a being eats steadily for their LIVES. It has to be a permanent change.

Detoxing/cleansing is another misnomer; the body is always detoxing and cleansing. If it did not, blood poisoning and other nasty things would occur. What is different when juice fasting, is that you are intaking much more fluid which helps speed things along. Almost everyone is dehydrated; your thirst signals only kick in when you are already about a quart low. If your piss isn't clear as glass, you aren't hydrated to the optimum levels. It's similar to running an engine that is rated for 5 quarts of oil but you only have 3 in it. Sure it will run; but the pumps may not be able to lubricate the top of the engine, leaving critical parts exposed causing premature breakdown, overheating etc. EVERYTHING in your body, and just about every process requires a liquid of some type. So, naturally, when you are drinking tons of fluids, you will feel better. It takes about 7 years for your body to entirely replace all the cells it has to become a whole new body; you aren't going to turn into Adonis with 1-2 months of juicing. A note though; you better wash your produce if it's not pesticide/chemical free (And wash it anyway, e. coli sucks) because if not, you'll be drinking all that pesticide with your kale. Kinda ruins the whole detoxing bit eh? 

They (people who are questioning you) will also have the misconception that juice is fruit only and that is bad for you; duh, don't juice fruit only for a fast unless you are vying for the land speed record of ""person who got type 2 diabeetus the fastest"". Vegetables for a base, fruit to taste. 

The other thing people will knock is that you will be deficient in some way from juice fasting; news flash, unless you are a dietician/nutritionist or have your diet planned out by one, I'd bet a month's worth of pay that you are deficient somewhere. And anything is better than the average American diet. This is not a diet in the sense that it will be the new way you eat. It is a temporary event to re-adjust you (So chill out with the 'ZOMGZ WHERE SI TEH PROTEINZ!!!1!). You won't die; the human body can 'run without oil' for a while; trust me. The body will adapt and pull what it needs from less than optimal sources to complete its jobs (Think adipose tissue; lots of good stuff stored in there. and if you are already weigh a buck fiddy, raise calories; don't want you wastin' away). If the guy that runs Soylent didn't die drinking his concotion (Although he got sick; became iron deficient, etc.) then you should have no problem drinking what the good Earth provides as long as you follow proven recipies others have done. Now would I recommend doing two months like some do? Probably not unless you were especially knowledgeable in particular deficiencies for the specific types of food you were juicing and could compensate for that. And the time limit is also a safeguard against idiots pounding kale/spinach and ending up with renal issues after two months due to oxalates. After about a month, I would start blending and introducing nuts, seeds, diary and other food types to start to plug the gaps from the previous month because by then, the juicing has done it's job with resting your digestive tract (You won't need to worry about any of this if you are only doing a week or so juice). Hell, I've heard of people doing water fasts for more than a week which is just insane to me; they must have horrible stomach pains. 

Above all this stuff though, it's mostly mental. It puts you in a different frame of mind. Retrains your palate so you don't pine for that cheeseburger; you instead desire the bed of romaine w/ red peppers salad of luciousness. And it makes more accessable, and you accept,  these strange new alien foods in a way that is easier than eating a 4 lbs. plate of them (Like some people like to say 'just eat the real thing' pfft yea ok). And to those that disagree that juicing helps rest your digestive tract; brother, you don't have Bruce Lee machine gun punching your gut every 10 minutes while you're digesting food like IBS does so let me just stop you right there 'kay?). 

PubMed.gov has some papers on liquid diets, nutrient dense diets etc. nothing specifically on the efficacy of juice fasting that I could find; Vanderbilt did a study on liquid diets that I'll link below:

Start taking notes in a notepad. When he states something material to your job, rephrase what he says to confirm you understand and write that bitch down. 

&gt;Even worse, he does not let me (or anyone else) make any decision in my team on my own.

Try to aim for a middle ground then. Hear our his solution first if possible. Then present a much more outlandish version of your decision.  Make your decision seem much more detailed and extreme than it actually is, but pinpoint the areas that you *actually need* to put the company in his better spot. Keep parts of what he presents and mix in his ideas with your decision - choose your battles to fight and argue. \

&gt;His main problem seems to be that I dare to disagree with him

Pretty much what I said above. Pick your fights and wars - at the end of the day, he holds the trump card. Make your version of things work with his. Compliment his ideas, even if they're bad ones. It'll make you appear to be on the same page. 

&gt;All in all we both expected something different from my promotion. He needs me at the moment because our department is understaffed

If he keeps shutting you down, try to at least get one of your ideas used and presented forward for each project. Keep insisting. If you present a list of 10 things and narrow it down to only 2-3 you want to actually use, it'll be much easier to get those 2-3 ideas forward. Become a fucking brainstorm - present so much shit, argue so much shit. He claims you're in the disagreeing role of the work relationship *use it to your advantage.* Point out the flaws in all of your ideas, but also point out the flaws in his. Seem indecisive with your ideas and show him the thought process from point A to B while eliminating the ""dumb ideas."" You concede. Not every one of your ideas will be used. Let's say you have 2 things you want/know the company needs. If you present 2 forward, you cant expect to ""get your way every time."" But if you present 6 forward, eliminate 4, agree with him on why 4 are bad ideas, then you can much more easily get your way on the two. It'll make him feel right and give him power 66% of the time. In reality, your 33% is the 100% you want approved. Illusion of control.

TRUE,King_of_Avalon,,,"It's not necessarily that it's too small for America. Here's how it works:

In most of the planet, cars are made to international safety standards called the UNECE standards (United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, although it's now international and has little to do with Europe). Just about every country on the planet is a signatory to the ECE standards, and those who aren't will still accept them, *except* the US and Canada.

The US has got its own incompatible safety standards called the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. In many cases, the FMVSS is actually worse than corresponding ECE standards; the rest of the time, like headlamps, it's just arbitrarily different. Canada has the Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, which are basically just the US FMVSS copied and pasted into Canadian law. 

Aside from the differences in design specs like bumpers, headlamps and certain car interior finishings, the main difference between ECE and FMVSS is that ECE parts must all be type approved and tested individually before a car can be certified. This means that every single part on a car must undergo testing to ensure that it meets ECE standards in one of the member states before it can be used. One it's approved by one member state, it's valid in all others. On the other hand, the FMVSS requires no such type approval. Manufacturers simply have to 'promise' that their parts meet FMVSS standards, or else face fines and consequences if too many people start dying because one of their parts fucks up.

As a result of this, car manufacturers wishing to sell a certain model worldwide have to make three versions of each car:

* ECE left-hand drive
* ECE right-hand drive
* US/Canada FMVSS/CMVSS

As a result of the large costs involved in retooling a car only for the American/Canadian market, most manufacturers won't even dream of spending all of the money to rebuild a model unless they think that it will be a reasonable success in North America. Consequently, the US and Canada actually have a shockingly low number of car models available compared to most other places. [Here is an article](http://automotive.about.com/od/AutomotiveTrends/a/We-Investigate-Why-Certain-European-Cars-Are-Not-Sold-In-The-States.htm) that also explains why this happens. 

It's entirely possible that if the US had access to the enormous lines of subcompacts that the rest of the world does, they might actually be modest sellers in major cities, and the car companies would break even. At the very least, they could decide to only import a few to sell just to test the waters and see what happens. But until the US opens up and starts allowing ECE safety standards, we'll never know. 

**EDIT**: Just to add a bit more information for those interested, [here is the Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Forum_for_Harmonization_of_Vehicle_Regulations) about the World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations, the relevant body of the ECE that makes the international standards. You can see under the section for 'North America':

&gt; The most notable non-signatory to the 1958 Agreement is the United States, which has its own Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards and does not recognise UN type approvals. UN-specification vehicles and components which do not also comply with the US regulations therefore cannot be imported to the US without extensive modifications.

This is the law that trips up all those people wanting to import JDM Skylines into the US; according to US law, only cars older than 25 years may be imported if they don't conform to the FMVSS. In Canada, it's only 15 years or older where they don't have to conform to the CMVSS. It's also worth noting that Canada is currently negotiating a massive free trade deal with the European Union, and that deal will include Canada recognising all ECE regulations in addition to FMVSS-compliant vehicles, so it's a good time to be Canadian. 

Another thing that's worth pointing out for those of you interested in economics is that this is a prime example of a [non-tariff trade barrier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-tariff_barriers_to_trade). Of course you're free to import whatever vehicle you want, but of course, [it has to conform to *our* standards only](http://i.imgur.com/dnBIPlA.jpg) (this is in effect a non-monetary way to subsidise the US automotive industry). This is further compounded by other non-tariff barriers such as the [Buy American Act 1933](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buy_American_Act) and the Buy America provision (s. 165) of the [Surface Transportation Assistance Act 1983](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buy_America_Act_%281983%29#Section_165:_.22Buy_America.22_Act); in case you were wondering why all American police cars are Chevy or GM or something like that, there's your answer. Another great example would be the [Fair Packaging and Labeling Act 1966](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Packaging_and_Labeling_Act), which in effect forces the repackaging and labelling requirements of all products sold in the U.S. and is a huge source of contention between the EU and the US. It's also had knock-on effects on Canada's metrication programme that linger until today. In fact, in many ways, the US is internationally infamous for its levels of non-tariff barriers (the lack of use of the metric system being another huge one that has enormous effects on construction/engineering/building materials and paper products, to name just a few examples). Even things that seem as innocuous as [electrical mains voltage and frequency](http://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/d/db/800px-Map_of_the_world_coloured_by_voltage_and_frequency.png/400px-800px-Map_of_the_world_coloured_by_voltage_and_frequency.png) (AC, such as that supplied to most homes) has massive implications on what can and cannot be sold in the US. Electronics manufacturers have to pay close attention to voltage tolerances in their products, and completely rework any spinning motors due to frequency differences; these are especially important for any device designed to heat up, or which has a motor inside that spins. Another example would be mobile phones; there are two issues at play here:

* North America uses [different frequency bands](http://cion.us/cvimg/chinavasion-world-gsm-frequencies-map-500.jpg) than the rest of the world. Therefore, only phones that can operate on three or more bands can actually 'roam' internationally. The rest of the world uses 900 and 1800 bands, North America uses 850 and 1900.
* There are two main types of mobile telephony technology: those based on GSM, and those based on CDMA. The entire planet uses GSM (your unique subscriber information is held on a removable SIM card), but North America and Japan also use CDMA (a non-removable chip inside the phone carries the information). In the US, AT&amp;T and T-Mobile are GSM; Verizon and Sprint are CDMA. Therefore, even with the differences in frequency, if you're a GSM customer you'll probably have no problems roaming internationally if your phone is quad-band, as most smartphones are. If you're a Verizon customer, you'll have extremely limited functionality abroad unless you go to Japan or Canada.

In short, if you're in the US, virtually everything you see around you is made to entirely different specifications; nothing you have could likely be sold abroad, and vice versa. This is by design, and it gouges the American consumer both in terms of price and choice. And for the Republicans to be the free-trade shills that they are, it strikes me as interesting that they're the primary proponents and creators of such barriers.

TRUE,Enchanted_Bunny, points,3∆,"JIf you are arguing on the basis that a fetus is a human being with the full rights of any human being, you cannot justify a rape exception. The fetus has no control over the circumstances of its conception. Since we do not penalize people for things they didn't do, then this argument requires that rape be irrelevant to the situation, which negates the ""they freely chose to do this"" argument.

&gt;as a modern society we generally try to afford individuals as many freedoms as possible provided they aren't infringing upon the rights of another human (current or future)

An unwanted unborn child is infringing upon the rights of its mother. Let me give you an example.

I decide to take a drive one day. I know the risks involved with driving. I know that many people die in car accidents every day and that I'm taking a risk. I do things to mitigate that risk. I wear my seat belt, keep my car in good working order, etc. 

So I go out and I get a text while I'm driving. I know better than to answer it, but something just doesn't click for me that day, and I start typing. I never see the woman with the van-load of kids. I slam into them. Dazed, I wake up in a hospital bed. A doctor and a policeman are talking to me. They're telling me something...something about some ""new procedure."" They know I was texting and that it was my fault.

Next thing I know I wake up but I feel very weak. I look over to my left and there's a woman. A doctor is in the room and he explains to me this is the woman I hit with my car. Since we are of the same blood type, they have joined our circulatory systems together so my heart can pump blood for both of us. This puts strain on my heart and makes me very weak. The doctor says I will have to remain like this for 9 months until the woman recovers. I tell him I didn't consent to this. He tells me I should have thought of that before texting and driving. He says if I remove any of the needles or tubes I will be charged with murder and thrown into prison. Then he leaves the room.

Here is the million-dollar question: is what happened to me in the above example just? Notice that leaving myself hooked up would most definitely be the *right* thing to do. I am not questioning that at all.

But, should I be *forced* to give up my bodily autonomy in order to support another human beings life? To go back to reality and get rid of the fictional dual-circulatory-system, should I be legally required to donate an organ to this woman? The phrase ""legally required"" is key here.

Right or wrong is irrelevant to the law. The law allows many ""wrong"" behaviors and actions, because not allowing them would be repressive. We know it's wrong to lie, but it (usually) isn't *illegal* to lie. We have to face the consequences of lying on our own.

My pro-choice argument is that the preservation of freedom *requires* us to have bodily autonomy. People only have a legal ""right"" to life if their bodies can support life on their own. Forcing other people to sacrifice their bodily autonomy for the benefit of others is over the line. We regularly allow people to make end-of-life decisions for others who are in a situation where they cannot maintain their lives on their own. The question of right and wrong here is irrelevant. What really matters is the legality.

Bodily autonomy is essential to freedom and human rights. That is why I support the legality of abortion.

TRUE,myWorkAccount840,,,"Both drives are already full of data.

One of the drives is filled with structured data that represents electronic files that have been stored onto it (the ""full"" drive), while the other drive only contains random data (the ""empty"" drive).

Both drives contain the same data-holding equipment, whether it's a rotary hard disk drive, or a solid state drive. Think of that equipment as a series of on/off switches. In the ""full"" drive, all the switches are set deliberately, in the pattern of the data that we want. In the ""empty"" drive, we haven't set the switches to anything, so they don't contain ""real"" data, they just happen to be set a certain way, that doesn't mean anything.

In either case, though, you've still got the same set of switches to store the data, so they weigh the same. Adding data just means flipping various switches, not building more switches to flip.

Going deeper into things, though, there are two parts to storing data on your hard drive. The first part is the ""switches"" I've already mentioned. They store the data you've put onto the drive.

The second part is a big list that tells your drive where all the data is stored. So adding a file to your drive involves two parts. First the drive flips all the switches it needs to store the data, then it adds to the list that tells it where all of the files are stored.

This means that in order to ""delete"" data, all it needs to do is to erase the data from the *list*, so that it knows those switches aren't being used for anything any more. Once the data no longer appears in the list, the drive doesn't know it's there, it only knows that there's new ""empty"" space it can use to fill with more data.

In this case, the data that you asked the drive to store for you is still there, in the position of the switches, but the drive no longer knows about it, because it no longer appears on the list. If you asked the drive to store the data for you again, it couldn't simply say ""Oh, I remember storing that once, let me just put it back on the list"", because the list is the drive's *only* memory of where the data is. Once the data is out of the list, the drive forgets about it, and if you ask it to store the same file again, it will just make a new copy of the data and add that copy to the list.

What this means, though, is that we can actually run software that can ""undelete"" files for us by looking at areas of the disk that the disk itself believes are empty. Many file types, such as pictures and sound files, begin with what we call ""header"" data, which gives basic information about the file such as how long the audio lasts for, or how many pixels wide and how many pixels tall the picture is. We can use disk-scanning software to read the empty areas of the disk and try to use this information to piece together files where we know enough information from the file header to make a guess at what the file looks like on the disk.

Guess what, that CO detector is going to be FAR less effective than one put either on the ceiling or about a foot down from the top of the ceiling on a wall (this is the same thing for smoke detectors you need to mount them a bit down off the ceiling when they are on a wall otherwise they will sit in an area of low/no air movement and will be less effective at doing the job they were designed to do)

TRUE,CursoryComb,brown,1,"Ok, I'm with you 100% on this, and this stupid argument that we didn't have competent QB play, like QBs are some stock material guaranteed to get you X number quarterback rating.  So I went through and looked at some differences using QB Rating (not the best but easiest to find) which isn't the best, so I also put in Team Pass Success Rating.

Team (+/- wins) QB Rating - '13 - '12 ([Pass Success Rate Rank](http://wp.advancednflstats.com/teampage.php)):

Bills (=) - 75 - 82.2 = -7.2 (29th) *New Rookie QB

Jags (=) - 71.8 - 74.7 = -2.9 (24th) **Same as previous year**, Chad, Career 75 Rating, Henne

Bears (-2) - 96.9 - 80.4 = +16.5 (5th) Tresmen was able to work McCown into above average play (3-3 majority snaps), **but same QB situation as last year**

Cards (+5) - 83.9 - 63.1 = +20.8 (9th)  *Brought in an average veteran (to Campbell's 76)

Chargers (+2) - 105.5 - 88.5 = +17 (2nd) **Same exact QB as last year**

Eagles (+6) - 102.7 - 78.6 = +24.1 (16th) **Same exact QB as last year**

Chiefs (+9) - 88.6 - 63.8 = +24.8 (18th) *Brought in an average veteran

**Browns (-1) - 75.7 - 73.6 = +2.1 (32)**

Here's what I get from all this information.  It was probably a good idea to get rid of Chud and Norv.  Four of these teams had the same exact QB situation and 3 of them got a huge increase in performance for those same exact players.  Two others brought in ""average veterans"" and, instead of relying on them, used balanced offenses to cope with average play.  Alex Smith's rating went way down, but the team didn't need him to be great.  Carson Palmer stayed at roughly the same rating but the defense played lights out.

The mistake the Browns made was relying [solely on passing the ball](http://i.imgur.com/YaE7OwY.png) more than every other team in the NFL!  Maybe we had below average QB play, but all mistakes are magnified if all you do is pass.  You have about the same number of mistakes per throw, but since you throw so much those mistakes happen much more often.

**We had an INT rate of a fraction more than 2% which is almost dead middle, average.**  Andy Dalton by any measure would be an awful QB if he didn't have a successful defense and ungodly amount of talent around him.

My whole point here is that competent QB play most likely stems from some combination of coaching, supporting cast, amount of use, and the player themselves.  Of course every player has a ceiling, but we really did get average QB play. 

I'd throw my blame 60% Front Office, 30% Coaching Staff, 10% QBs.

I'm 34 now.  As a teenager I worked every day after school and every weekend--I never had any fun.  In college I lived at home and commuted, worked most nights and many weekends--Never went to a single party, never took a trip, etc... Graduated and spent my early 20s living at home, worked salaried but spent 60+ hours per week at work, my weekends were very low key, basically a hermit.  I watched the friends I had in college pair up with girls, take trips, live in interesting places... I was at home.  

In my late 20s I met a great girl, we were together 5 years, but I was always planning and worrying... she was more a free spirit (but responsible).  She wanted to take a trip, I calculated exactly how much we'd have to save each month to be able to do it and then that would become a wet blanket over other things because I wanted us to save for a house and be able to be single income parents... We got the house, but she left because she just wasn't really happy, I think I wasn't exciting enough and was too worried about the details of life and money.

I've spent the past 2 years trying to discover who I am, and I'm realizing that I'm just a boring person... the only interesting things I've done have been with my ex's... 

I am 34 now, and I refuse to wake up one day after my 40th birthday and realize that I spent what are arguably the best two decades of my life worrying about money and avoiding fun because of the cost.

The whole purpose of earning a living is to live.  Sometimes people are in a circumstance where their lives are boring or limited out of necessity, and that's fine... but if you have the option, get out there and do things!

Carbon Monoxide (CO) is the bi-product of partial combustion, i.e. Material not burning at 100% efficiency. It is colorless, odorless, tasteless and can silently kill you without you even knowing what is occurring. Fire places, oil burners, dryers, anything that produces an exhaust in your home, has the potential to leak into your home, exposing you and your family to this toxin.

Depending on the concentration (parts per million, or PPM) of CO in the air, effects can range from nothing at less then 35ppm over 8 hours, to headaches (100-400 ppm over 4 hours) nausea and dizziness (800ppm within an hour), confusion and convulsions  (1,600 ppm in 20 minutes - at that concentration death will occur in 2 hours) at 3,200ppm death will occur in 20 minutes, at 6,400ppm respiratory arrest and death in less then 20 minutes, and at 12,800 death will occur in 1-2 breaths. 

What is important to realize here, is that for every 1% of oxygen that is displaced in the air, 10,000ppm of CO is present in a leak. So if you have 35ppm of CO in the air, only .0035% of the air is actually CO, making this gas extremely hazardous to your health.

CO is also highly explosive at a concentration of 12.5-74.2%.

In certain states in the US, NY being one of them, it is now law to have a carbon monoxide detector in every private residence.

Edit: to add to the points before, yes CO displaces oxygen. Their molecules are extremely similar. 

CO is dangerous at low concentrations because of it's affinity to hemoglobin in the blood. Hemoglobin is 200x more attracted to CO then O2. The only way to quickly and safely remove CO poising from the body, is through a hyperbaric chamber. It is extremely difficult for CO to be removed from the hemoglobin once attached.

Apparently you can't save during the VN (story) scenes, nor can you save while you're in the middle of a dungeon.  Sometimes they make you do back-to-back dungeons without giving you a chance to save, which people seem to complain about.

What you don't see is that Jamal and his Mother were neglected and abandoned by his Father, Paul. Paul was physically abused, never shown affection by his father Chris, because Chris would work everyday of his life doing menial tasks in a company where only White people could see advancement despite the fact that he had been there much longer and had more experience and skill. He quickly reasoned that his Son would have to work like a machine to have any chance in such a cruel and unjust world. And in order to cope with the stress, he picked up a drinking habit that inevitably spilled over into the home. Chris's Father was a very hard worker too and never had a chance to go to school because his Father Wesley was lynched at the young age of 23 by a groups of drunk closet racist while simply trying to walk back home from a farm field. 

So until you realize that these types of situations have played out THOUSANDS of times, then you will NEVER understand why slavery is relevant, and why in your seemingly small mind Black people seem to always bring it up.  All those years of hatred, discrimination, injustice, social hinderances, rape, murder, neglect etc heaped on to Black people for all those years. 
Where do you think it goes?? You think a tiny fairy comes flying down to sweep up all those negatives into a little bottle and tuck it away behind a rainbow so that they can't do any more harm to anyone?! No. ALL of those horrible negatives penetrate the next generation and the next, and then are compounded by people who think that since slavery happened yesterday that Black people are just supposed to move forward as if the playing field had been leveled now.  I guess that's why it took this long to have a 'pseudo-Black' President? Because things have been so equal and fair immediately after slavery? Right? 
Perhaps if Jamal's ancestors were not harassed, belittled, abused, raped, cheated, robbed and killed by the ancestors of James Andrew Johnson's, then perhaps his lot in life might be a little different. Perhaps Jamal's 15 kids are a direct result of James' ancestor having 15 slaves.

While still tasty it lacks substance, made to satisfy the lowest common denominator with poor taste and a low budget. 

What started as a delicious cheese pizza got more and more complex, everyone had their own ideas on what a good pizza tasted like and kept adding ingredients pepperoni, olives, sausage, life was good. Variety was what made the pizza great and it worked for many years, then people stopped agreeing on ingredients. Vegetarians refused to let pepperoni even be on one half of the pizza and eventually pizzas stopped being made for awhile because of it. On top of that, a corporation bought the pizza parlor and converted it to a franchise. 

Now instead of the people having a real say in the choice of ingredients, the company has decided to put their interests first, using lower quality ingredients and hiring employees at minimum wage that give terrible service. To make up for the decrease in quality and service, the company started creating cheap, ridiculous, wild, unsustainable promotions; ""4 pizzas for four dollars!"" ""try our new lasagna pizza"" ""... with pizza rolls baked right into the crust"" and their best seller the deep dish bacon cheeseburger pizza, a pizza overloaded with cheese, made from a ready-made crust mass produced in a factory barely able to support the weight of its own ingredients. People became content and even started embracing the deals and stopped noticing the decline in quality and were only interested in the next deal or superfluous ingredient that the company would throw onto the pizza.

Eventually people forgot the taste of real pizza and became mostly content with the company's way; sure people still argue over the best way to slice the deep dish bacon cheeseburger pizza, whether adding crushed peppers or Parmesan cheese is good and there are some traditionalists who want the pizzas go back to how they were but they are all buying eating and purchasing the same pizza so in the end it makes no difference.

TRUE,lshiva,,,"I spent about 2 years planning the trip, and 5 years saving the money for it.  In the US I stayed at campgrounds or free campsites in city parks (Kansas and Missouri allow it along the Transamerica).  In Australia I camped, or stayed at hostels.  Mostly hostels once I found out they were charging equivalent prices and had them all over the place.  In the Outback I often just camped on the side of the road.  Far enough away from the road to avoid crazy drunk driver crashes, and often behind some natural barrier to avoid the curious.  In Asia hotels were from $5-$15 so I just stayed there, especially since camping isn't as big a thing.  Some people I talked to had luck asking for permission to camp in people's yards, but I really appreciated the running water, wifi, and privacy that a room afforded me at the end of a day.  Europe was back to camping again, but as in most larger cities I would get a hotel room so I could explore without worrying about my stuff I ended up staying in a lot of hotels in Europe.

My planning started with me brainstorming a giant list of all the cool things I'd heard about in the world that I wanted to see.  Then I made a basic plot of a route that would take me past most of them.  Then I started reading about the areas I would be going through in travel books, traveler journals, weather reports, and anything else I could find.  I started putting together a rough estimation of distances between places, figured out how long it would take me to get from place to place, looked at visa requirements, border crossings, elevation maps, and so on in order to get an even more detailed idea of where I needed to go.  Cross-referencing climate with travel dates let me shift my schedule around so I could avoid winter throughout the whole trip, flying to Australia in the northern hemisphere's fall, and crossing over the equator to the north as the seasons changed again, heading north with the spring.  All this turned into a giant spreadsheet with daily mileage estimates, rest days, tourism days and so forth.  I plugged in estimates on prices and used that as a budget to plan for how much I needed to save.  

While I was doing all this planning I also started doing more and more tours in the US.  Lots of overnight camping, and once or twice a year a week or two long tour.  Around Lake Michigan, Seattle to San Francisco, RAGBRAI, the KATY trail, the Natchez Trace Parkway.  Lots of rides to test out gear, find what worked for me, and most importantly of all, test my enjoyment of spending long days on a bike and nights in a tent.  I put on thousands of miles doing that, and in doing so was able to be confident in my gear, my own abilities, and my knowledge of what I was capable of.  Quite a long way from my very first tour.  On that one I actually carried a spare blanket because my sleeping bag wasn't warm enough at night, and I had to walk my bike up lots of hills.  Now I know what it feels like to spend hours riding to the top of a mountain pass, and minutes coasting back down the far side.

It's easy enough to just toss some gear together and hop on your bike.  If you're really interested in it, start doing some overnight camping trips with your bike.  In less than 24 hours you can get a good idea of how prepared you are for it.  Also, check out AdventureCycling.org if you're in the US.

Yes.  This is a good way to view your path.  It would be different if you were a nun/monk but that is not the case.  We all live in the world and our practice of meditation needs to be used in a way that helps us move through the world in a harmonious way...cultivating a state of mind that supports engaging with the world with grace and dignity.


&gt;confronting this fear in a harmonious way


Do you know anything about Judo, the martial art?  One of the principles of Judo is to be like water.  To yield in order to overcome.  To be fluid and flexible enough to move with your ""opponents"" energy/attack as opposed to fighting against the ""opponent"".  By this method the Judo master uses the ""energy/attack"" that their opponent throws at them to solve the problem by redirecting the ""energy/attack"" in a way that diffuses it.


What does this have to do with meditation?  :  )  It is directly related and here is why.   Meditation can allow us to view challenges, ""problems"" from a completely new perspective.  From a place that is not rigid, no, from a place that is accepting, flexible and fluid.  This is not an easy path, it requires courage.  NOT fearlessness but courage, study the difference if you are not sure you clearly understand.  Via meditation we learn to accept and acknowledge everything that arises.  We learn to face anything that comes up during meditation without grasping after it or running away from it.  This is fundamental in the development of the courage we need to face our fears in the ""real"" world.  To face all that arises in the real-world directly...honestly...with as much compassion as possible.


Part of what happens when you practice an effective form of meditation is that YOU change, your mind is transformed.  This can result in learning to relate to friends and family in new ways.  Sometimes this means that you will lose interest in certain things/activities that used to be a glue, a common activity that helped hold you and your friends together.   


There can be many ways to look at this but lets just narrow it down to two.

1.  This is where the Judo comes in.  The concern was that others may view you as boring in ""normal"" social situations.  Instead of worrying about this (and allowing that worry to prevent you from socializing or causing you to behave anti-socially) YOU use that worry to motivate you to socialize in a healthy/harmonious way.  You have through your practice of meditation developed your skill of concentration.  Put that skill to use when you are in social situations.  Challenge yourself to focus ALL of your attention on the person you are interacting with.  Use that focus to notice interesting things about that person and to pay incredibly close attention to what they are saying to you.  Use your skills to become a master of listening.  This endears you to people and will allow you to make insightful and interesting comments in response to what the person you are engaging with says.  

2. The second part is (this may seem paradoxical) recognizing that it is not healthy to force yourself to do things that you do not enjoy or spend time with people who do not share your interests and values.  You may need to seek out new people and friends that more closely share your values and interests.

TRUE,upgradewife,,,"  When your grandparents die, usually they're old (at least they seem so when viewed from two generations away), so even though it's terribly sad, it seems natural.
    
When my father died, I was on a plane coming up to see him.  We'd been estranged (his choice) for several years, but in what turned out to be his final year, I initiated a reconciliation, which he surprisingly welcomed.  So, at least there's that.  He'd always said he didn't want a deathbed vigil, anyway.
    
Mom &amp; I were extremely close my whole life.  When she could no longer live alone, she insisted upon moving in with me.  This hurt our relationship, but given circumstances I won't go into, it was the best choice.  I took care of her by myself for eight years while her health steadily declined.  Even through our mutual strain, we remained very close, and a different bond formed (role reversal). We shared a fondness for Christmas; it was always a special time for us, looking at all the pretty decorations everywhere and singing carols.  Three weeks before Christmas, doctors said there was nothing more to be done.  On Dec 11th, she died in hospice.  If my fiance had not been with me that week and the week after, I don't know how I would have gotten through it.

Mom was not at my wedding.  She has not been able to enjoy my four wonderful stepchildren.  She will not be here when my first grandchild is born this month.  I will never again hear her laugh.  It's been four years, and though my life now is wonderfully happy, a passing memory can bring back the initial grief as if it just happened yesterday.  You just have to deal with it, but isn't it wonderful to have had someone for so many years who meant so much?

I know she's free of pain now.  I know that she had outlived--by several years-- every life expectancy estimate given by each of her doctors.  And I know that the reason she hung on so long is because she wanted to make sure I wouldn't be alone...she said this to my than-bf when he told her he had the ring and planned to propose to me.  And didn't she just LOVE knowing that before I did!

Cling to humor.

I'd create a vast lake with a several tile long patch of land in the centre.  I'd build all facilities necessary for life - bathrooms, stalls, even entertainment and carousels.  I'd even put a maintenance man in to clean the spills and a mascot to keep children happy in their newfound home. 

And a new home it would be for all the guests I hand-selected to live on the Island.  They may have wanted to leave the Island, having a home and family to return to, but after a few weeks they would learn to like this land and their new ""family"" of guests.  They had everything they could possibly want, and I was in the financial situation where I could offer them all services for free.  Life was a heaven for them, whether they liked it or not.  

But I was not a fully constraining God.  If the guests truly wanted to leave the Island, there was always one way out.  A massive, custom designed Loop-de-Loop roller coaster was the only method of leaving the island, capable of launching the riders off its end.  It was expensive, terribly so, but some antsy guests were willing to do anything to return to their past lives, and I was kind enough to grant them their wish.  As they'd excitedly board their final ride on the Island, they'd feel excitement yet apprehension, as though something felt terribly, dangerously wrong.  

The ride would take off.  Acceleration would launch the riders at incalculable speeds through the loop.  As they reached the end of the track, reaching towards the sky, they'd realise they had made a terrible mistake.  They would launch, and from above see the park sprawling below them, in the distance the town in which they lived in.  Some could even see their homes, and for a moment forget their terror for their longing.  

The ride car would then fall.  They were far past the lake now, hurtling towards the ground at a hundred miles per hour.   Some would cry.  Some would pray.  Some would laugh.  Some would apologise profusely, begging me to let them back on the Island and forget they ever wanted to leave.  All landed in an explosive, fiery crash that caused bumper cars to jitter all the way through the park.  They denied my heaven, let's hope they found their way to a better one. 

Yeah, I seriously wish I could get RCT to work on Windows 7 though lol

TRUE,angryfirelord,,,"Fedora doesn't include subpixel rendering in the freetype package because it's patent encumbered. If you disabled it in Ubuntu, you'd probably encounter the same thing. Therefore, you can try two things.

-Install freetype-freeworld. This package is in the RPMFusion repository, which you'll have to enable. Once the new freetype package is installed, you can install the gnome-tweak-tool and fiddle with the hinting settings. In addition, you can place a configuration file in $HOME/.config/fontconfig/fonts.conf. I've found some examples from other distributions which you can try:

https://wiki.debian.org/Fonts#Subpixel-hinting_and_Font-smoothing

http://duganchen.ca/writings/slackware/fonts/ (scroll down the page to find it)

Don't put it directly in your $HOME path as it was [depreciated](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/Fontconfig2.10#Release_Notes) a little while ago.

-Install infinality. Some people like this, others don't. It's certainly worth a try. This requires setting up another repository, but it's quite easy to do so.

&gt; rpm -Uvh http://www.infinality.net/fedora/linux/infinality-repo-1.0-1.noarch.rpm

&gt; yum install freetype-infinality fontconfig-infinality

If you don't like it, just remove the two infinality packages. However, I would not mix freetype-infinality with freetype-freeworld so make sure only one or the other is installed.

Just remember that font rendering is subjective.

Edit: One thing I found that helped was getting a better monitor. My previous monitor was 7 years old and I had to keep it at a 1024x768 resolution or the fonts in its native resolution would be too hard to see. I got a new one and everything looks a lot better. But I see yours is set to 1366x768, so I'm assuming you installed it on a laptop.

TRUE,Mispey,,,"I just posted this in the other identical thread, but since a lot of people are confused I am just going to copy paste it here. 

Let's explain this, because I hate when people pretend everyone reads the articles on Reddit.

**Here is what happened and how it happened:**

When you have an app you need to create a way for the app to talk to your servers. You basically write your own little App&lt;-&gt;Server language. You do things like give the app a way to say *""I am looking for a new picture, can you give it to me. I am Mispey and this is my secret code""* and the server says *""Thanks for the secret code, Mispey...here is the picture data""*. This is called an API. The secret code is (basically) your password. 

If you study this language you can learn the language and then make scripts that do essentially the same thing and pretend they are the official application. It is not possible to grab the snapchats of others because of the secret code that is required. Nearly everything sensitive requires a secret code, except for one function....

There is also a way for the app to take the phone numbers from your address book and ask to return an account, if there is one, attached to a certain phone number. This does not require any sort of secret code (and the secret code wouldn't help anyway, since everyone can theoretically get their own secret code). This is part of the finding your friends feature on Snapchat. 

It turns out that this could be run in bulk. If you knew every phone number of every snapchat user it would only take about a day to generate a listing of every account-phone number combination. There is now a rate limit on this, so it cannot be run in bulk so easily but it is still possible to scrape phone numbers and be easily circumvented as of the time of this writing. 

Someone made a script that put in any particular phone number, real or not, and tried to see if a user account came back. They basically tried many popular area codes and went for it (XXX-000-0000, XXX-000-0001, XXX-000-0002 and so on). If they got a result they logged it into a database. This is how SnapchatDB was created.

The company, Gibson Security, informed Snapchat of this possible vulnerability a long time ago. Snapchat did not deal with it. They then published the information about how the exploit worked as part of a disclosure document. **SnapchatDB acted on this information and published it with the last two digits of any phone number deleted. Anyone else could have done the same thing but with the full phone number.** In fact, you should expect a new version of the DB to come out without deleted phone numbers. It might not happen, but someone else has a copy of this DB with full phone numbers. **This means that if your phone number is not on this list it might be on ANOTHER LIST.**

This is the Full Disclosure document that fully documents the API: http://gibsonsec.org/snapchat/fulldisclosure/

The part about grabbing phone numbers is near the bottom. 

**Why does this suck?**

* Because Snapchat had a lot of time to act on this (GibsonSec first contacted them 7/27/13, then released this without full disclosure publicly 8/27/13, then again full disclosure on 12/27/13, then Snapchat responded for the first time saying it is not an issue and difficult to create a database, then someone created a database before NYE) - That's 5 months total. 

* Because Snapchat told us that this was challenging to do, but it was actually very simple and took very little time (a matter of days) to collect all of this data

* Because the app worked in a way that made the user feel as if the phone number was not findable from a username, therefore giving out your snapchat username was relatively ""anonymous""

* Many people did act on this anonymity, for example girls on GoneWild might be finding out a lot of people have their personal phone number now. ",0,1388607613,,0,1388629425,1,ceexk3m,t3_1u5rmd,t1_ceexk3m,t3_1u5rmd,1427900945,182,FALSE,technology,t5_2qh16,182

TRUE,[deleted],,,"Part of my job is as a resume writer, but I try to keep up with networking and career consulting, too, as it helps with planning the resume side of things. I found a disc set once called ""The Hire Road"" - it's not very great production-wise (you can tell they were on a limited budget), but the content in it is awesome. They do a great job showing you how to go beyond online job boards, which are honestly the absolute worst way to get a job.

If you don't want to go buy something to help with job hunting, then I highly recommend the following:

First, get a polished resume. Seek out someone who can do it professionally. Even if you don't have a lot of money, trust me, it's worth it. Getting your resume done professionally will help you focus your goals and objectives, and it will help you figure out where you want to focus your job hunting endeavors. If you're feeling lost, seeking out a career adviser or vocational counselor is good, too.

There are plenty who offer online services (the small business I'm a part of does), but in your case, I'd actually recommend finding someone close to you, who you can talk to in person. A lot of resume writers like to hide themselves, never have contact with their clients, just write the resume and pass it on - that can work, but you sound like you're going to be in a more difficult position than most, and I think a good conversation would probably help you figure out where you need to go.

Second, learn about LinkedIn. Seriously. LinkedIn, if used properly, is where the job scene is at. You can't approach it passively like most people do, but if you start right now polishing your profile, being an active part of groups you find interesting, and posting updates that show you're smart, intelligent, and looking for a recruiter, it's not too hard to get feedback. At the very least, if you include a link to your profile on your resume, it should give any potential employer a chance to see who you are in more detail. It can only be a good (even great) thing if used properly.

Last, but not least, set a rigid schedule for yourself and stick to it. Recognize that right here, right now, your new job is to find a job. You are not unemployed - you are self employed. That means that you will work 40 hours a week, and your new job entails:

* Getting your resume in order
* Getting on LinkedIn and polishing your profile
* Networking with friends and family to see if they know of any open positions they can help you with
* Applying on job boards and proactively sending out your resume to companies you're interested in (even if you don't see an opening - the opening oftentimes means it's too late)
* Sticking to a rigid schedule (wake up early no matter what, have consistent ""working hours"" no matter what)
* Working out three days a week, the exercise will keep you motivated
* Learning new skills and reading new books - if you aren't working, then you should be making yourself more employable all the time

Anyway, sorry for the big speech. I deal with people every day who are in situations similar to yours, though, and I know from personal experience just how depressing and overwhelming things can be. Breaking things down into a list that you can follow will help. The worst thing you can do is just start spamming the job boards. That's a waste of your time, and it will only make you more depressed, as it's the most inefficient way to find a new job and you'll start to wonder if anybody really wants you as you apply for the 500th position without getting any feedback (been there, done that, never doing it again).

I really hope this helps. It's a sucky way to start off the New Year. But you *can* take control of the situation and come out better off for it. I've seen others do it over and over again. Best of luck to you!

I never met my biological father. He cut and run before I was even born. I have two sister's that I've known all my life. But a brother and sister that I didn't know existed until I graduated high school. I keep in contact with them regularly. One day Cassie (the sister I've never met) asked me if I wanted to talk to Ellis (my bio-father). I told her very politely no. She left it at that for a few weeks, and then she asked me again. Again, I said no. This time a few months went by before she asked again. And when she did, I told her that I have a dad. I've had a father in my life since I was around 2 or 3. He married my mother when I was 6, and he legally adopted me as his son when we moved to Nebraska from California in '95. He's the man that's been there for me. He's the man that punished me for sneaking out. He's the one that was there at my basketball games, my wrestling matches, my track meets. He was there when my son was born. He was there when my best friend and love of my life left me. And he was there this morning when I dropped by to say hello. That man is the reason I am the person I am today. I'm never going to see Ellis. I'm never going to talk to him. And I'm never going to ask him why he didn't want me. Because I found someone who did want me. And he's a hell of a dad. And I'm a hell of a dad because of everything that he taught me. I tell him that I love him, but nowhere near often enough. I know that this little speech doesn't have to do with James Avery passing. But its the first thing that came to mind after I watched that clip about Will's dad leaving. The question at the end ""Why doesn't he want me man?"" It really got me. But I found an answer. An answer that applies to that situation, mine, and I'm sure countless others from my reddit brothers and sisters. He didn't want me, but that doesn't matter, because the right one did want me. And that made every difference in my life.

Rest in peace Uncle Phil.

Buggy or not, the attention to detail in Battlefield 4 shows to me that they're passionate about their work. They're a friendly and dedicated bunch of people, and I don't believe for one second that they intended for things to end up this way.

Then you've got EA. They've got DICE on a choke chain, where constant greed and gross incompetence completely ruins the experience from the consumer's perspective. Whether we like it or not the two entities are attached. You can't punish one without punishing the other. Therein lies the problem.

It's a sensitive situation because if history has taught us anything about EA, it's that they'll sooner throw their development teams under a bus than to blame themselves on the failure of a franchise. So as much as I'd love to watch EA go under right now financially through some unprecedented recall on Battlefield 4, it would most likely end up being misconstrued as consumers no longer having any interest in the Battlefield series. Yes, EA is that dumb.

They most recently blamed the failure of the Medal of Honor (reboot) series on [""combat authenticity""](http://www.tomshardware.com/news/Medal-of-Honor-Warfighter-EA,20805.html). That franchise is now on hold indefinitely as a result. Okay so their decision to stop investing in Medal of Honor made business sense. *However* the reason they gave for its failure pretty much shows how out of touch they are with what was really wrong with the game.

I feel like if we all asked for a refund on Battlefield 4, it'll be Battlefield's turn to be next on the chopping block. And in reality this is not purely the fault of DICE, but rather EA itself who insisted that it be rushed out the door when they knew the game was incomplete. So yeah, it's a lose-lose situation.

Slavery and mistreatment of human beings is not some competition. It should not be a dick measuring contest to ascertain who had life worse throughout [documented, Western] history.

Furthermore, and i think ultimately, whenever slavery is brought up in an American context, no one is talking about a universal concept of slavery. If we are going to talk about that universal concept, then let's arrive at a universal answer: it's wrong. Period. 

We need to have a *What We Talk About When We Talk about Slavery* forum, or something. Whenever slavery is brought up in the aforementioned American context, it references the *specific* social construct of race implemented by the Virginia House of Burgesses and the resulting, *systematic* centuries-long dehumanization of black Americans that has had reverberating and lasting effects on both social perception and stratification.

Taking as balanced a perspective as a I can, I believe that the narrative of black Amerians must stop centering on seeing them/ourselves as [former] slaves. That bullshit narrative so quickly perpetuated by our so-called ""black leaders"" creates more problems than it attempts to solve. I understand that American history has been largely terrible for black Americans (and i say this meaning black Americans as a whole, because I know that someone will more than likely bring up the Irish argument), but if *all we do* is focus on history, then this cycle will continue. Lines have to be drawn somewhere, I believe, but no one seems to want to do that because ""black people were mistreated"" is such a comfortable fallback position to take. Black Americans love to invoke the Civil Rights era without invoking the spirit of the era, which was the create a positive *future* for Black Americans. In the spirit of Thomas Paine, the Civil Rights era was not about carving out a niche for the people marching, but for their posterity.

TRUE,[deleted],,,"This goes front page so much, but it's pretty much the only picture that I don't mind seeing again and again. Reminds me of a night a long time ago.

I used to go to a bar every thursday where they'd sell you a mug for $5, and you could get 50 cent refills forever and ever on it. After I had consumed god knows how much pisswater college bar beer I got a text from a friend who had been permabanned from the bar for pissing off the deck onto the street. He was at the bar across the way.

I get over there and he's fucking wasted, talking to these two extremely attractive, excessively drunk girls who probably weren't of legal age. Oh god they were hot.

See this bar had a special deal of their own. You could buy a fishbowl of liquor that probably would serve 5 people, 9 if they weren't alcoholics. So I bought one and we all shared it. Well an hour later the girls exchanged numbers with us and left, we both sat there, falling off our stools drunk. Two more hours to go before the bar closes.

I take the fishbowl with me to piss and return it to the bar and on my way to the bathroom I notice there are a fucking lot of fishbowls sitting places...some half empty. So I discreetly dump all those fishbowls into ours, piss and get back.

He asks if I bought more, and I tell him how I got it. He pauses and goes ""You're a disgusting but brilliant man."" It wasn't even purely that drink, people had dumped other stuff in there, we could smell beer for sure but we didn't care.

We get to the bottom of the bowl and there's a wadded up napkin mixed in with the ice, oh god it was so bad. After a lot of laughter and some minor gagging we leave and run into the girls who were waiting for a cab. Ten minutes later we're at their house and the one who I had been talking to all night about anthropology shows me to the bathroom. A few minutes later I've got her bent over the sink just fucking her senseless, apparently I was her post-breakup romp or something I don't remember I was drunk and enjoying breaking a year long dry spell.  

For whatever reason the thought of the napkin could have been a fapkin crossed my mind, such a random and inappropriate thought for some of the best drunk sex ever. I saw myself in the mirror just as my cheeks puffed out to blow. By the grace of Sagan's taint I turned and exploded into the open shower. 

Game over. Sex is done. I'm leaning over the tub producing these magically smooth streams of blue vomit. It was a miracle how smooth they were. That's all I could think about was it looked like a fountain coming out from under my nose, no stray drops or streams I don't know how I managed it. I have never thrown up that much volume before, it was absolutely astounding. 

Thankfully the wateriness meant I didn't clog the tub because I was ready to gtfo. We left and I only ever saw her once or twice on campus, we never spoke.

Assuming you're an optimist and you move to a reasonably decent place, it will generally go something like this:

* **Weeks 1 to 2** - feels like a vacation; you have an awesome time exploring this fun new place

* **Week 3 to Month 3** - you'll start to second-guess yourself more and more as you realize you have no friends and you start to discover the downsides of your new location; gets progressively worse until month three, give or take, when you'll have an ""oh no what have I done?"" moment

* **Months 4 to 6** - although you'll still be somewhat down on it, it will get progressively better as you learn to just accept the downsides and focus on the benefits of living there

* **Month 7 to Year 2** - you'll start to make real friends and become more attached to it; it will be 'home' 

* **Year 3+** - you'll either start to get tired of it and want to set out for a new adventure or you'll just keep on loving it and want to stay for the long haul

[Collapse of Complex Societies by Dr. Joseph Tainter](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0R09YzyuCI)

Venue: Grand Rapids, MI future.org meeting


The evolution of social complexity concerns the change from societies that were small with few distinctions other than those based in biology: age and sex, to those that are large, differentiated, and highly integrated.

Hunter-gatherer societies have only a few dozen distinct social personalities while modern censuses recognize 10,000 to 20,000 distinct occupations.

Concepts of complexity, e.g.: physics, biology.  Tainter means two
things:

* Differentiation and specialization in structure and function and behavior.  More parts and more kinds of parts.
* Increasing integration and control of behavior.  As number and types of parts increase, mechanisms to bind these together as a system.  Without integration and organization you don't have a system, you merely have an assemblage of parts.

Examples which superficially appear to be complex systems but aren't:

* 1942 N. Africa landings:  500,000 different types of military artifacts.  Julian Steward.  This _wasn't_ a complex system, ships were loaded poorly.  Consequence:  when unloading in N. Africa, guns arrived w/o gunsights or ammunition, no gunners.  Proper operation:  combat loading:  load in reverse order to need on landing.  Not a complex system because of lack of organization.  Great differentiation, poor organization.
* Opposite:  drummers at Bejing Olympics.  Low structural diversity, very high organization -- all the same.  High level of organization, but no differentiation and structure.  Hence:  not a complex system.

#### The Irony of Complexity

Complexity can be counterintuitive.  Complexity simplifies (hence: it's not complicated).  Complexity is an elaboration of structure and control, it simplifies and channels human behavior.  This is why complexity exists: it makes systems function.  

Financial crisis of 2008:  high diversification, little organization.  Hence, not a complex system.  A failure of complexity.

Again:  structure and organization are the elements of complex systems (differentiation?), and complexity simplifies and regularizes.  

What is a collapse?  When a society rapidly loses an established level of complexity.

Post-collapse societies are simpler, have fewer parts, are less well-organized, and often are smaller.

#### Examples of collapse:

* Western Roman Empire, 5th C AD (followed by Dark Ages of Europe)
* Classice Lowland Maya of Guatemala, 9th C AD
* Hittite Empire of Anatolia (Turkey), 13th C BC
* Minoan Civilization of Crete, 14th C BC
* Mycenaean Civilization of Greece, 12th/11th C BC
* Western Zhou Dynasty, China, 771 BC
* Harappan Civilization, Indus Valley, 18th C BC
* Egyptian Old Kingdom, 2181 BC
* Olmec Civilization, Mexico, 5th C BC (?)
* Teotihuacan (~700 AD) &amp; Tula (12th C AD)
* Huari &amp; Tiahuanaco, 11th C AD)

In the Americas:

* St. Louis Indian Mound culutres:  Cahokia (13th C AD)
* Casas Grandes (14th C AD), Chacoan (11th C AD), Hohokam (15th C AD)

#### Misperceptions about human complexity:

* It occurs simply because people invent things. (Contrast:  ""before his time"" -- Leonardo, early (Roman) inventor of Aluminum))

* Complex society ""civilization"" is an accomplishment -- an accumulation of many things invented over time. 

Problem with that:  complexity isn't free.  It has a cost.

#### Complexity in problem solving:

Complexity costs.  The costs may be metabolic or measured in some currency:  time, money, energy.  Ultimately:  energy.  For biological systems:  calories.  For humans ""the accounting is more subtle"":  money and annoyance.

But ultimately, metabolic, hence energy costs.

Before fossil fuels:  complexity meant _people_ worked harder.  People had to work harder to support complexity.  Which means that human societies don't have any intrinsic tendency to increase in complexity, contrary to popular assumption.  There are real reasons _not_ to increase in complexity as it costs more, simply because it costs and people have to work harder.

Why do societies become more complex?

* Complexity increases because it solves problems.  E.g., hybrid cars, new types of institutions, new activities.  Casablanca landings in WWII
* Problems are often solved by developing more complex technologies, adding new positions and social roles, or conducting new kinds of activities.

E.g.:  Complexity responses to the 9-11 terror attacks:

* Proliferated structure:  New gov't agencies (TSA, DHS), reorganized others, increased organizational control over people's behavior.  We've increased complexity.  And it costs us:  taxes, regulations, products we buy, annoyances.
* Complexity costs -- costs can be metabolic or measured in currencies.
* Complexity in problem solving is an economic function.  Complexity has costs and benefits.
* As simple and cost-effective solutions no longer suffice, institutions develop solutions that are more complex and costly.

Economics of complexity:

* What are economics of social or institutional complexity?
* Complexity has benefits
* Higher complexity costs
* Changing complexity changes benefit/cost ratio of complexity
* Changes in the benefit/cost ratio of complexity can mean
different futures for societies.
* Diminishing returns to complexity.  This can profoundly
influence society's future over long periods of time.
* Higher complexity requires societies to acquire more energy to support complexity (e.g.: fossil fuels).  At the same time,
having cheap energy permits and facilitates even higher
complexity.  So complexity _requires_ energy, but having _cheap_ energy permits us to develop more complexity.  This is the energy-complexity spiral.

Energy and complexity go up and down together.  You cannot have complexity without energy, and if you have energy, you're going to have complexity.

I don't know that I've met a lot of people with really stable home lives whose first reaction to seeing someone in a video game would be to say ""I'm gonna rape you bitch"" in their prepubescent, flute-like voice.

That seems like a good indication that homeboy probably takes it from a lot of different angles, and is looking for an outlet for being shit on all the time. If he wants to think that he actually has some power or control over something because he lucked out in a video game? Fuck it, go nuts kid.

He's still gonna have that same shitty life when he wakes up tomorrow.

Another route is [this way, the actual *best* way](http://www.hotrod.com/techarticles/body/hrdp_1108_1967_chevy_camaro_affordably_flat_painting/). Hands down. You're looking at 150 or so bucks but a bit of prep  work.  This paint is available at walmart and home depot as well as you're local autoparts store. Cheap.  

Like I said, i've done this, and you will NOT regret this decision either way. It's fast, cheap, looks great and is reversible.  

Finally, there's the plastidip option. Depending on the state you live, you can get a kit for around 300 bucks.

TRUE,Nickel62,,,"The retina contains two types of photoreceptors, rods and cones. The rods are more sensitive than the cones. In dim light, it is essentially your rod cells that give you vision.

So lets take a look at the rod cells - 

Rods use a light sensitive chemical called rhodopsin to detect the light.
The rhodopsin ""bleaches"" or breaks down when struck with light - it's this breakdown that is detected by the nerves and that makes you ""see"" the light. The more rhodopsin that builds up in the rods, the better you can see really dim lights.

A bright light in the detection frequency of rhodopsin instantly breaks down the rhodopsin that has built up - it's really sensitive stuff. Rhodopsin's detection frequency goes down as the wavelength increases. Red and Dark Red have highest wavelength in the visible light spectrum and rod cells (rhodopsin) is essentially non-reactive at these wavelengths. So your Rods can't ""see"" red light. They are blind to it.

TRUE,[deleted],,,"&gt; If you don't like who you are, where you are or where you're going, you won't be happy with yourself, you won't feel accomplished.

I don't mean for you to take this as an invitation to a flame war -- but man, lots of women are with guys who aren't happy with themselves and aren't particularly accomplished. Furthermore a lot of guys who make stupid choices, work meaningless jobs, don't have any real spectacular talents do fine with women. They are still flying high because sex is so validating. Let's not delude ourselves that this doesn't happen, it is an ego boost.

Hooking up with women is very easy in certain circumstances. You are on vacation somewhere nice, you are in a hostel and everyone there likes you, you are drinking somewhere where there are a lot of other singles hooking up and it's expected, you headline in a band in a pub on St. Pat's, etc. Women aren't particularly perceptive judges of men, most just go with the flow. And they get horny or lonely like everyone else.

If you want to get laid, environment and context are everything. You want to look social and popular. You want to be clean, fit, and smell nice. You want to be sexually confident, etc. You don't want to be a relentlessly self-improving introvert, and that's something of a recurrent theme here.

So all this ""crossover value"" bleeding into your dating life?  I don't know if I really buy it. I had some good friends who stayed at home and were great guitarists who loved their passion, they still struggled badly with women. Dating is its own specific skill like a muscle, you use it or you lose it. Whenever I focus on my career, spending time in the gym, or kicking around in the mountains, my dating life dies. Whenever I do my ""PUA impression"" (I can't stand the community though) I meet girls -- because I am approaching and actually taking chances. And surprise, surprise whenever I have sex, a little validation, and a kind ear, pillow talk and some TLC, I'm suddenly a lot happier. This will be uncool but I question how happy anyone really is during long bouts of celibacy. I'm certainly not.

Essentially I'm trying to say it's not just about you. Guys who do well with women not only have some good qualities, they are also in the right place at the right time, can recognize when a woman is interested, and know the right way to open and pursue an interaction. Focusing on only the 1st (good qualities) is going to hurt you in your dating life. For those good qualities, external things like good friends and a social life / education or career credentials / lots of leisure time / desirable lifestyle, etc. are probably more important than a passion. More women need balance than excellence.

Caveats apply for age, situation, and my own overgeneralizations. Exceptions are everywhere. Like I said Buddah, don't take it as a knock on you personally -- but I think this is a Princess Bride style fantasy we have (and I used to), where we vanish into thin air, come back 10x times the man we were, and our problems are solved.

From what I've seen : In the meantime a lot of girls will couple up with men they probably shouldn't and go off the market, you end up with a lot of money from your career and semi-proficient talent in things you mostly choose because they seemed nice to you in your living room. Or you get a girl and get a whole new set of problems to deal with -- just because you're now the perfect guy, doesn't mean you'll recognize the perfect woman -- and that time you spent self-improving won't give you relationship tools.

What I'd say to OP, is that you should keep trying, in moderation. You need to keep dating because the longer your break is, the harder it is to get back on the horse. Not dating is *nice*. No disrespect, no bullshit, no disappointment. I like it so much it's really hard to get started again. But buddah is right that you need to unfuck your mindset, because you need to change if you're not happy with who you are. Liking yourself will solve so many things in your life -- it just won't necessarily solve dating. And you need to be prepared to be happy with yourself and your life if it doesn't work out, because you still have decades to live.

TRUE,Cristal1337,,,"I am severely disabled (muscle illness) and one day, as a young lad, maybe 17 years old, a father came to me after school and asked, out of the blue: ""Would you have been happier if you never lived?""

People around suddenly turned their heads towards us, awaiting my answer and all I could think of was: ""Did he really just ask that?""

Luckily, I am not someone to blurt out the first thing that comes to my mind, but it did take a couple of seconds to formulate a good response: ""I have a happy life and I wouldn't have had one without the chance to live.""

The man elaborated: ""I'm sorry to ask this, Spain is currently debating the abortion laws and I just wanted a first hand opinion on it.""

Back then, I already had put a lot of thought into abortion laws, but I didn't have the time to tell him the story of my life. So I simply said: ""That's OK, I was quite surprised though. In my opinion, abortion is a personal choice. You have to keep the options open for all sorts of reasons. For example, pregnancy complications. It's a difficult subject. However, I am for abortions.""

It's difficult, indeed. There are health issues, economic issues, emotional issues, social environment issues, political issues...etc. So many reasons to have an abortions. A disability becomes irrelevant, because no human wants to raise a child in a fucked up world. However, even in a perfect world, I think having a choice is best. 

My disability only became apparent when I grew up. My parents didn't know till it was too late for an abortion. Luckily, I lived in a very social country and my father earned plenty. Of course, having a disabled child causes some friction. Pretty much everything had to be catered towards me and that caused frustration. They wanted the best for me and gave me what they could. My sister was also frustrated, she didn't get the same amount of attention as I did. Having a disabled child weighs hard on a family, even in the best circumstances. I was the black sheep by nature and I knew it. It made me depressed for years. 

I am 25, living alone and on social benefits because I can't make a living (although I am a freelance translator for extra cash). A social worker visits me once every two weeks to help me with my household and to cook some meals. My family is a bit sad because they think I can't become happy this way. However, I've never been more happy! The past three years of my life, the moment I moved out, were a blast! Whatever people think others need to be happy doesn't matter. I make my own happiness.

Still, if a mother thinks she is more happy with an abortion, it's her responsibility to make herself happy. If she feels her child will never be happy and that thought makes her sad enough, then I think it justifies an abortion. Who are we to tell people how to become happy?

So, the first step to impressive food is to season just about everything. People often forget to add salt and pepper during the cooking process, but just those simple things can make a world of difference. (Make sure you taste as you season as well. Adding too little is *always* better than adding too much!)

TRUE,wiseman207,,,"Here are my notes:

00:35 - With no enemies active, the worst that can happen is a group will wander in (very rare).  Hunker Down reduces visibility, so there's no reason to use it unless taking enemy fire is imminent.

00:41 - Dashing into unexplored territory gives you no time to react if you uncover something.  It's better to explore on your first move only, and take cover on secure ground.  Side note: cover isn't terribly important until you wake an enemy up.  It's better to explore and move to a more defensible area of the map, using Overwatch to cover in case something wanders in.

03:00 - Hunkering down here might not be the best idea.  Though it really reduces your odds of getting hit, you are conceding to let the enemy take a free shot at you.  Hunker Down works best when you don't have a good shot *and have a plan to improve your position later*.  If you're planning to bait with Overwatch or slug it out in a firefight, your better options for lead members are to either shoot or break line of sight to bait enemies closer.

04:00 - I think for this map in particular, defending this thoroughfare near the drop point is bad, since there's little good options for maneuvering (and that Sectoid spawn you hit is common on this map).  More generalized advice would be to look around for good ingress points before moving, and make a decision to move there, rather than turtling endlessly.  Look to gain tactical advantage instead of trading blows in a slugfest.  On this map in particular, taking the street behind the wall, or moving into the cars by the garage are good ideas.  Your rookie in the back is wasting his moves dashing between sub-optimal positions here.  Again, always take time to analyze a map and form a plan of ingress, and when enemies come, look for ways to maneuver into an advantage.

04:27 - Use pistols agains 1HP enemies to conserve ammo.  This move is a good offensive move, but you have to recognize that you're hanging your trooper for return fire from the other Sectoids here.

04:47 - Overwatching with enemies in sight is a bad move, since they don't have to trigger Overwatch to fire at you.  You're giving them free shots.  Either shoot, break Line of Sight, or Hunker Down if there's no other options.

I think a good way to approach an XCOM fight is to look at Shots-Fired-vs-Shots-Returned when dealing with enemies and cover.  I'll illustrate with an example.

Let's say a soldier moves up to Full Cover and meets 2 Sectoids.  The sectoids both maneuver into firing position.  There's no way to prevent the soldier from being shot without killing the Sectoids.  If you move up a second soldier without killing anyone, you could lose 2 men instead of one.  However, if you have a good chance of killing 1, then you'll only take 1 retaliation shot; so in this respect a soldier in heavy cover is as good as any other.  You can move up as many soldiers into full cover as you want to support the first, as long as you have a good chance of reducing the number of incoming shots (and potential casualties).  If the rest of your troops sit back, you're basically giving the Sectoid a free shot at best, worse it may move to a more defensible position, or reinforcements will show up.  This is only one example, but you can apply this sort of math to any fight.  You're as vulnerable as your weakest member, and you should aim to reduce return fire as much as possible, without jeopardizing additional men.  Attack aggressively when you have a chance to clear the threat, and protect weaker members with offense.  Spread your lines and get to better positions while the enemy is distracted by your toughest, best-covered members.  Turtling is admitting that ""this is the best I've got"", and you're going to take whatever losses the RNG chooses.  Better to do the math and try to make the most of it.  If it's you're all-star captain on the line, gamble those rookies and get the frags out.

Your men will take many more shots than any individual alien ever will.  Avoiding incoming shots is *always always always* the best defense.  Count potential shots from the enemy as sure hits, and anything less than 100% sure kill as a potential failure point.  Before taking a risk, calculate it out roughly in your head to make sure it's your best try.  Break line of sight, slink around when you can, leave yourself retreat points and hiding spots, and go for flanks for the aim bonus.  Never ever let an opponent shoot at you if you don't have to.

09:28 - We knew that Sectoid was there.  It may have made better sense to retreat to the truck, or make a break for the room to get wall cover, rather than hanging your men on the garage door like that.  It's hard to tell.  Remember, Overwatch only works when you have LoS on a moving target, so that Sectoid can play peekaboo on the cars all day.  Better here to fire, attack, or move away.

10:20 - Enemies who you do not witness moving should be assumed to be on Overwatch!  If you must move into Overwatch, dash for the defense bonus.

An 80% chance to hit here is a gamble.  If you missed, there was a good chance you'd get flanked and killed.  It would have been better to use a grenade (or at least have one ready via another soldier, in case you miss).

You used grenades well, but you might want to ""check"" them first.  For example, with that last grenade, you could know that that Sectoid was as good as dead, and then take other shots before swinging with it (and not worry about hanging your men on the garage door).

TRUE,ksclee,,,"rwallin, I believe you just found a very good piece of couplet that is at least 90 years old. 

A couple of small things first: 

(1) chasingxshadows nailed it on most of the characters and information, excepts the third word should be 詳 (detailed) instead of 祥 (luck). So it makes more sense to mean ""Moral character and integrity are detailed and clear"". 

(2) You are definitely right to put them on the front door because they are couplet (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Couplet_(Chinese_poetry)). However old Chinese passages and characters are written and read from left to right, so you should hang the first frame on the **right** hand side of the door and the second frame on the **left**, like [this](http://img25.artxun.com/sdb/oldimg/29ff/29ffff2f3700188eab4965ba4cf3b639.jpg) and [this](http://img15.artxun.com/sdd/oldimg/d7a3/d7a3bae2f789df37d7e08344793a5fcc.jpg) and [this](http://blog.jxcn.cn/UploadFiles/2013-6/5820722605.jpg). 

(3) On the small prints (and that's the interesting part): 

First frame: 饒合理夫子回國紀念

* 饒合理, Harry Fleming ROWE (1869 - 1946), is an American Methodist missionary. 
* 夫子 is a respectful form of addressing a teacher from his students. 
* 回國 means returning to the country from aboard. 
* 紀念 is commemorate or in this case, a memento. 

So the full sentence means (the couplet is a) memento for the teacher Dr. Rowe when he was returning to the country (presumably from China to US).

Second frame: 金陵神學美以美會學生仝贈

* 金陵 is the old name of Nanjing in China. 
* 金陵神學 as a whole is The Nanking School of Theology, before it merged with other theological seminaries and formed [Nanjing Union Theological Seminary](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanjing_Union_Theological_Seminary) later on. 
* 美以美會 is [Methodist Episcopal Church](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodist_Episcopal_Church). 
* 學生 is students. 
* 仝 is the old form of 同 which means ""together"". 
* 贈 means ""giving"" (some gift). 

So the whole sentence means the couplet is given (to Dr. Rowe) as a gift by the students from Methodist Episcopal Church of The Nanking School of Theology. 

From the very limited information online, ~~饒合理 (sorry I can't find a English translation of his name)~~ Dr. Rowe had a doctorate degree in theology in 1916 and had been preaching in China most of his life. He was the Headmaster/President of The Nanking School of Theology in 1921. He was also noted to have convinced a US billionaire to donate part of her heritage to the School, which worth USD$12m (not confirmed). Note that 金陵神學 was the official name of The Nanking School of Theology from 1912 to 1917, so this couplet may very well be from that period of time. Or when he was retiring and going back to US, then that would probably be a bit more recent, in 1930s or so.

It is often linked with foundational relationships, like those with her primary care givers, in her childhood and early adolescence. Frequently, individuals like this grew up under pressure from their (often well-meaning) parents to ""perform,"" in whatever manner they deemed appropriate, in order to ""earn"" their love. Therefore, she grew up believing that she did not inherently deserve to be loved, but that she was, in a sense, ""only as good as her last show."" Individuals with Ambivalent attachment frequently flip back and forth between clingy and deliberately hurtful because they ultimately don't have the internal, subconscious assurance that they are worth loving. Once they begin reaching a point of true intimacy with another person, they instinctively and reflexively sabotage that relationship out of fear and self-loathing (""I don't deserve him, I'm holding him back from finding and loving someone worth caring about""). It sounds like a pity party, but when these things sink into the core of how a person sees themselves, it is nothing short of tragic.

That's actually a really sad story. It sounds like you both endured a lot of pain and hardship that has roots back in her childhood. I don't know her or anything else about her life circumstances-- and to be fair, I could be completely off base. But I hope she eventually finds healing.

Influence: XVI Oppression  The Tower Um.. well.. its a forbidden joy. Something you aren't or weren't supposed to touch. Because I peeked ahead, its definitely a lover or love or feelings that has you conflicted.

Past: 9 of swords.  Sadness and Depression/Loneliness... Not a good history with this feeling. 

Recent Past: VI The Lovers.  Venus. You've recently developed feelings for someone but it has you completely foiled. This is a good card overall but for some reason I get this nagging that you're so very fearful. Smile :)

Future: XX Judgement Making a Choice and going with it. Listening to advice and heeding warnings/signs. Also you'll finally be able to stand up for yourself. [See final outcome]

Destiny/Goal: 2 of cups The relationship card. You want to make sure a relationship is the right relationship and is feasible.

Direct Revelation: 4 of Rods/Staves Finally laying down roots, setting up a foundation for family/marriage matters. I keep getting pulled toward it as an elopement because of that Tower as an influence. 

Environment: 8 of swords Pinned down. Your environment has you cornered and it seems like there is no way out. Have patience and you'll be able to escape. 

Emotions: Princess of Swords You desperately need to communicate in order to have your piece said and be able to express yourself. Remember that your tongue is used for defense and attacking.

Final Outcome: IV Power Freyja Miss, it looks like you're going to be accessing your inner power this new year. This love looks like it gives you strength even though it seems to be unpopular. It looks like you'll be able to say things you've been wanting to say for a long time. Even if this relationship isn't what you expect, it is the catalyst for unlocking your identity, yourself, and your inner/outer power. Heed it. 

January: XX Judgement This is when you make your decision. Listen to yourself, and be wise. 

February: Princess of Swords  Stick to your guns and be ready to debate others about your choices made in January. You'll feel ready to get out.

March: 8 of Swords You'll feel very repressed and like you can't get out. Hold on Until April.

April: 7 of Pentacles You'll have saved enough money by then to do what you want to do. Make sure to assess and to carefully calculate needs and wants and to also remember to plan for emergencies. 

May: 9 of Cups You get your WISH! Your plan has worked and you are out of your old mental/emotional/physical environment. You did it!

June: 6 of staves Victory! You'll have done it exceedingly well, and you'll finally be able to realize that you win, and when you win you win a lot. Revel in your optimism. Look Up :) 

July: 10 of cups Happiness. The successful culmination of a happiness/related venture. Life just keeps looking up.

August: Justice VIII It may be a legal matter that pops into your life, but I see it as more of a need for reflection. Can you be doing something better? More efficiently? Be more objective.

September: Queen of Swords  You'll have truly come into your own. You'll be a very powerful person indeed. Make sure to NEVER allow cruelty to tempt you. That's the dark side of air/queen of swords.

October: 6 of Swords A bit of traveling, either metaphorically or physically will happen. I think its more of an intellectual movement.

November: Strength XI  A test/feat of strength will be preformed this month and even you will be impressed with you. Stay strong and practice a mantra every day. If you see a mountain, climb it. It's the right way.

TRUE,Latama,,,"It is an Italian made picklock stiletto from 1958 or 1959. The handles are stag horn. The ""INOX"" is short for 'inoxidable' which means 'rust free' or 'stainless'. It looks to be a 9"" (23 cm) model. The blade style is known as a ""flat grind"" with a swedge or small false edge on the top.

The way you can date this knife is that it is a picklock. A picklock is the oldschool pre-1960 style of blade release where you lift the round tab off the blade pin with your fingers to close it. After 1960 they changed to the modern ""swivel bolster"" where you pivot the top front bolster and it lifts the round tab, which enabled you to close it with one hand.

This knife also falls into the ""transitional"" period of Italian stilettos. The transitional period was late 1958 right after the U.S. switchblade ban, through 1959. Production was moving from the old school picklock to the swivel bolster, and moving from high carbon steel bayonet style blades to stainless steel flat grind blades. The transitionals will have a combination of these old and new parts, like a new swivel bolster with an old carbon bayonet blade, or an old picklock with a new stainless flat grind, like yours has.

The knife was probably bought in Italy, France, or Spain. It looks to be in great shape and the red dot safety does make it a little more desirable to collectors. 

Take care of it and never sharpen it. Having the original edge on the blade is a huge plus to the value.

Before the Euros and their brand of greed under the guise of Christianity destroyed the Americas, Africa, India, and the Middle East, there were thriving cultures leading the way in science, medicine and technology.  People and cultures were forced to adapt to the European way, and not necessarily for the better.

The ""white"" populations have pillaged and now control a large portion of the world's resources.  This isn't because they are white, but because the Euros were lucky in their geographical origin.  If they had been closer to China or the Mongolians, they would have been destroyed.  For ""white"" America, it is shielded by two oceans that are difficult to cross easily.  

China has an ancient and grand culture that, if it had been situated in Europe, could have far exceeded the Romans.  The Egyptians were among the leaders in science and medicine.  The Arabs merchants built the beginning of our modern accounting and business practices.  Chinese, Indian and Persian scholars made great discoveries in mathematics.  

However we don't know about many of these because the conquer writes history.  Discoveries attributed to Europeans had been found out by other cultures many years, decades, and even centuries prior, but those were wiped out by the invaders.  European wars have destroyed countless centers of knowledge and culture that existed in these once great civilizations.

I lost much, as many people did when they realized they had to live on. Life has been incredibly hard at times, and no, you can never fix the past, or get back the wasted years of self loathing. 

But I can tell you this - despite all of the hardships, sorrow, and loss, the immeasurable comfort of finally being who you should have been is enough to wash it away. That first time when a stranger looks at you and smiles, not because you are different, but because *you are you*, it is something that can stir even the darkest times away. 

Let me ask you - what makes a 'real' woman? A uterus? A vagina? Maybe some breasts is all it takes? Or how about years of growing up as a girl? None of that, NONE OF IT, makes you a girl. It is a small part of a much larger picture. Would you say that a woman who has a mastectomy is no longer a woman? Or maybe cystic removal, like some of the girls I knew from high school? Does my having a vagina now, post SRS, make me a woman? Does my coworker, a FtM transman having a vagina make HIM a woman? It is all about perspective. 

I can't possibly tell you that it will be easy, and I don't know your situation to tell you that it will get better. But I can assure you of this - some day, someone will smile at you, and all the hardships you've gone through will vapourize in that instant.

Yet they consistently say women should never be judged for their appearance, as has been mentioned here before.

TRUE,barrelomo,,,"I can and can't relate to this. I've moved around to 5 major US cities in the past 6 years. The freedom to live a gypsy-like lifestyle is definitely liberating, and each time I land in a new city it is exhilarating and you truly understand and feel what possibility means.

My family respects my ambition and desire for life experience. This is a combination of getting lucky with having the parents I do, and me being articulate for my aspirations in life. They give me certain latitudes, like not guilting me this Thanksgiving when I was still getting on my feet after a recent move, (to Chicago as well, loving it!) and couldn't afford to travel home. Luckily a fellow redditor graciously had me over for their Thanksgiving (reddit is your family too goddamnit!) I visit when I can and make the most of our time together, otherwise technology is amazing and my 3 year old nephews can use skype as well as I can, that helps. 

However I had a significant other (S.O.) in my past city, and the relationship took and huge blow and ended mostly due to the sentiment that you're having. He wanted to move with me and even had a job opportunity lined up. But his family threw a tantrum and basically guilted him into staying around for their sake. I completely respect his decision and we both maintain a loving friendship, but where we used to plan our future together now a lot of what we talk about are his regrets of staying behind and the emotional burden his family has become. If things change—now I'm haunted by what I feel is a lack of respect his family has for him and the decisions he makes for his life, and how he chose acquiescence and regret over possibility and adventure. This may seem like an oversimplification and it is, but it's an educated one as I was a key sounding board for him in the decision process.

Of course being communicative and assertive (as necessary) with your family is what's going to make them see you as a mature, whole, and independent individual that wants to seek experiences to bring back and enlighten those you care about most. What I think is amazing and really greasing the wheels is technology. If you make smart choices in your finances and save judiciously, family is always only less than a three hour flight away (Continental US version). Skype is instant, and is real, meaningful connection and conversation as long as you're willing to see it that way.

I'd also like to quickly point out that closeness between family members is irrespective of distance. Hell, my best friend lives 700 miles away and she's no less my best friend. The result of our closeness and understanding of each other is respect for who we are, and encouragement for where we all want to go. My parents quit their high-paying city jobs several years ago and started a Sheep farm in the hills of Appalachia. They have absolutely no business sense, the farm is definitely in the red, and I hate the way my father keeps the books. But they love doing it, and this is their dream. And as long as that stays the way it is I'll keep helping my dad do his books, and my mom with the marketing. Once my savings gets to the point I'll even become an investor. That's family; **encouraging and supporting each other's dreams,**. I'll support the way they wish to see themselves, not how I want to see them based on my own desires and stereotypes. Everyone evolves, and I can't expect my parents to be exactly the same people they were with the same hopes and dreams as when they raised me. Thanks to google docs I can help my dad with his books, together, 200 miles away. We can shoot the shit, and get shit done. 

If you truly feel as though you're the one who makes the decisions in your brain, whether or not you feel as though you could pick up and move to Paris isn't your family's problem, it's yours. I suggest you start sharing your aspirations with them. If you're family is anything like my ex-SO's they will laugh, or tell you how unrealistic or difficult this will be, and it's not worth it. They aren't telling you about how you leaving and chasing life will challenge their world view, and how difficult that will be for them when the truth hits them. Expect this, and keep sharing. I would hope you are even asking about their hopes and aspirations as well.

Next, move. You don't need to move to Paris, move across town, or to the next town over. Say it's because you wanted a bigger yard or it was cheaper, but start to show them how even when it takes 30 minutes more to get to their house, you're still their son or daughter, cousin, etc. Call them more, get them used to other ways of communication than what they are most comfortable with. Part of your family duty as the newer generation is to not let the older generations stagnate themselves in the comforts and nostalgias of the past. Teach your grandma to use a fucking ipad, and to facetime you whenever she wants.

By this point you'll start to see a change. You'll probably start to be seen as a leader within your own family / generation. What a foreign concept! Family's have leaders! You'll start to receive more trust and respect than you're used to, and this coupled with their love will be such an encouragement, it might even encourage you to chase your dreams. And since you've been sharing them with your family this whole time, they'll support you—maybe not financially, but emotionally and with guidance—on this journey. 

One last thought, and this comes my personal experience with working with LGBTQ youth who have been kicked out of their homes. Your family, whether by blood, or those who you have a deep unbreakable emotional bond to,**is everything**. When a parent kicks a child out because they deny the future person that their child strives to become, they rob their children of any future. Sometimes this happens quickly, and kids end up on the street. Sometimes this happens over a long period of time, and it eat away at people well into adulthood and creates behaviors that erratically try to reach for where the heart aligned itself so long ago. A child or young adult (I worked with homeless individuals up to age 25) who has had these bonds severed has a snowball's chance in hell at becoming a responsible, fulfilled individual unless these bonds are reestablished or new ones are forged. We've put them up in their own houses, gave them work, gave them income, and they still fail back into homelessness because they have no one to fail back on. So working with homeless youth and their family led me to a tacit understanding which I'll try to make explicit: You need family (in the loose sense of the term), and your family needs to let you be you. In both of these you have agency and responsibility. *A brief programming note for any young'uns, especially any LGBTQ, reading:* If you are in a repressive home environment the law doesn't give you a lot of freedom to get away from this. Endure, have vision for your future, and when you reach a level of financial independence get out and create a family that loves you for who you are. So many redditors on here have stories of just this, and prove that your family doesn't have to be your blood. 

If you've made it this far, thanks for hearing what is partially my life's work and observation, and partially my continuously developing philosophy. I wish you every happiness for you and your family, and that none of you feel constrained and envious of those who have the ability and support to seek new life experiences. 

TLDR; The freedom and support my family gives me to seek new adventures gives us a level of loyalty and respect that strengthens our bond as a family and makes us closer. Assert your individuality, your agency, and pursue your dreams, no matter how reckless they may seem. Your family should, and eventually will, come to understand.

TRUE,slothyone,,,"I highly suggest you look up the book ""How to Stop Worrying and Start Living"", and read the chapter 1 about ""Living in Day-Tight Compartments"".  

The basic idea is that you need to 100% stop thinking about yesterday and tomorrow, and live 100% in the day.  People will create a storyline for themselves based on the past - for good or bad.  The thing is, you can't rest on the past to make you comfortable, or use it as an excuse - depending how ""favorable"" your past was.  You also can't look towards tomorrow to fix your problems, or to see what will happen.  By adopting this perspective, it forces you into action.  And, from my experience, makes you feel like a truly badass motherfucker.  Once you don't even think about the past and future except for practical terms (i.e. calculating how much you should save for the future lifestyle you want) - you will be pretty fucking icy cold because you've immediately removed sorrow/anxiety/regret, and a whole bunch of other weak emotions with surgical precision.  Enjoy that for yourself, because it's truly a reward.  Your emotions tell you how good a job you are doing with choosing what thoughts you focus on.  The better you feel, the better you know you're doing, and as a side bonus, you'll start getting more of what you want from others and from life.

One quote in the book that resonated with me is ""Every day is a new life to a wise man"".  If shit happened, forgive yourself.  Today is sacred, and most people only use a tiny portion of today's potential.  If you get in the habit of thinking that way, you will get the most out of today EVERY DAY, and you won't be held back by these arbitrary plot lines you've made up about yourself based on your past that you are projecting into the future.

I truly don't mean to put down other advice on this thread or sub, but I think this sort of high-level advice will result in greater overall happiness than more specific ""tactics"".  This is about living your life in a way that makes you feel like the shit, which is more rewarding and impactful from my experience.

Awesome, I flew into Kerala my first time too. 3 months, you'll be able to see a lot of India depending on how often you're on the move. But yeah, India is pretty dirt cheap or pretty expensive depending on how comfortable or uncomfortable you're willing to be ha.

The first time I was there was for about a month, stayed in guesthouses/hostels, traveled via the good to average train carriages (or sleeper buses when there wasn't any), went to about 15 different cities and ate most meals at restaurants and all up it cost me $800 for the whole month. You could definitely do it for a lot less, since I went to way too many places the first time. After you've dealt with the almost unavoidable Dehli belly, give the street food a go, they are amazing and is about 25cent for a full meal, restaurants maybe $1 to $5 (pending how fancy it is.)

Don't know if you've been to any other developing countries before but remember to haggle for everything besides food and trains/buses. Lot of people will try to scam you as well, honestly, just use the website below to book for every country train and buses, saves you from lining up (Indians have almost no concept of such a thing) at train stations and getting hassled by scammers.
http://www.cleartrip.com/ for trains and planes
http://makemytrip.com/ for buses.
Buy it online, print it out and you can jump straight on the trains with it without being bothered by anyone!

For location suggestions, the Kerala backwater is pretty nice, you guys have to go to Hampi, the landscape, the boulders, the ruins, amazing. While you're in Mumbai, make sure you take a day or two to go see the ajanta and ellora caves, like Ankor wat but carved into a series of caves. Taking one of the mountain trains up to the hill stations (Ooty, Darjeeling, Shimla) is worth a few hour train ride as well. 

Don't know when you guys are going but if the roads are open really recommend the extreme north via the highest road in the world into Ladakh and Kashmir, quite a different feeling from the rest of India, you're on the foot of the Himalayas, slightly more Asian faces up there, monasteries. More extreme landscapes there.

Can tell you a lot more if you want ha, but I'm sure you want to discover everything on your on! But if there's one main tip I have, is just go there with an open mind, Especially if you haven't been to a developing country before. India is gonna be super busy, chaotic, insane, you can't compare it with anything else, other developing country can't match how crazy busy it is, but everything somehow functions. Learn to embrace it for what it is and that's when you'll enjoy it. I always say there's a lot of crap you have to go through with to see the good bits of India, but the good bits are so damn worth it.

TRUE,ainrialai,southamerica,General Lovecraftian Bullshit,"When the Zapatistas began their rebellion twenty years ago, they were unleashing new currents of libertarian socialism and drawing from long traditions of indigenous resistance and communitarian values. Pre-Columbian indigenous America was as socially diverse as any other continent, and even in the colonial era, it's difficult to paint all indigenous peoples with a broad brush. Still, the indigenous Mayan communities in southern Mexico should be noted for their strong communal nature. The development of the hacienda system during the colonial era, then, introduced a strictly hierarchical system of private landownership that clashed with these indigenous farming communities.

The haciendas, large estates owned by members of a small economic elite and worked by dispossessed *campesinos* (peasants), outlived the colonial system that had birthed them. There's a lot of Mexican history to cover here, but I'm trying to get to the Zapatistas quickly. Before the Mexican Revolution, the country was under the rule of Porfirio Díaz, indirectly and directly, from 1876 until 1911, a period known as the Porfiriato. To quote a [post on the Mexican Revolution](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1h0bsq/what_started_the_mexican_revolution_and_who_were/capqckl) I made six months ago, ""The *Porfiriato* was characterized by a corrupt ruling elite, repression of civil liberties, heavy foreign ownership of Mexican land and industry, rapid economic growth, a modernization of the country, and the growth of the cities. The loss of communal lands (and corresponding growth of the *haciendas*) created a climate of alienation amongst the indigenous and rural peoples that would lead to the explosion of the Mexican Revolution in 1910.""

When the Mexican Revolution did come, it was less one revolution and more many revolutions. Liberal frustration with the Porfirian dictatorship, led by Francisco Madero, unwittingly opened the door for the radical movements to rise to greater prominence in Mexico. Ricardo Flores Magón, the anarchist labor organizer who had been a major figure in resistance to the Porfiriato and was exiled before the Revolution, led a short-lived anarchist communist revolution in Baja California in 1911 and was a figure of influence on the large anarcho-syndicalist labor movement centered in Mexico City. Among the other radicals his writings helped inspire was perhaps the most famous figure out of the Mexican Revolution, Emiliano Zapata. Leader of a great army of dispossessed peasants and indigenous peoples in the south of Mexico, Zapata fought for major land reform, ultimately assassinated in 1919 by the state that had emerged from the Revolution. A version of his plan for land reform had been included in the Constitution of 1917, however, and his imagine would be used for decades to come by the Mexican state. I'm greatly oversimplifying the Revolution here, for brevity, as there were a lot of ideologies and factions at play.

Eventually, the state produced by the Revolution was consolidated and institutionalized under the National Revolutionary Party (PNR), which would become the Party of the Mexican Revolution (PRM) and, eventually, the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). This party would become the longest ruling political party in the world, staying in constant power from 1929 to 2000. During this period, the ideological orientation of the party fluctuated. Under leftist President Lázaro Cárdenas (1934-40), the oil industry was nationalized, labor rights were expanded, and land reform accelerated. However, later presidents were more capitalist. Political repression also picked up, with the [Tlatelolco Massacre in 1968](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1jt6st/tuesday_trivia_askhistorians_wide_world_of_sports/cbid25t) and the mass voter fraud against presidential candidate Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas (son of the late president, who broke from the PRI) in 1988. By the 1990s, the PRI was ready to fully embrace neoliberalism and the Washington Consensus.

Land reform had effectively slowed to a crawl by this time, but the final straw that sparked the Zapatista uprising was the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). It required the stripping of Article 27 of the 1917 Constitution, removing the provision for land redistribution, allowing the foreign ownership of Mexican land, and removing protections for communal indigenous land. Zapata's key ideological contributions to the Mexican state, after a long period of infidelity, were effectively destroyed. Thousands of poor and dispossessed indigenous farmers lost their only hope when land reform was ended. A group of mostly indigenous leftists, radicalized by increasing repression and neoliberal capitalism from the Mexican state, had been organizing for a decade, but really gained traction with the communities following these new developments.

So, on 1 January 1994, the day the NAFTA came into effect, the Zapatista Army of National Liberation (*Ejército Zapatista de Liberación Nacional*, ""EZLN"") declared war on the Mexican state and 3,000 guerrilleros seized control of much of the state of Chiapas. Though they had no centralized leaders, their spokesman, [Subcomandante Marcos](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/71/SubMarcosHorseFromAfar.jpg/474px-SubMarcosHorseFromAfar.jpg), cut a dramatic figure that immediately seized the public imagination. The EZLN immediately released its revolutionary program, the [First] Declaration of the Lacandona Jungle ([early EZLN documents available here](http://lanic.utexas.edu/project/Zapatistas/chapter01.html)). They made clear the libertarian socialist nature of their revolution, with ""revolutionary laws"" surrounding labor, agrarian, and women's rights. For two weeks, they fought the Mexican state until a ceasefire was called. Pushed out of the major cities and much of the state, they retained (and still retain) control over a significant portion of indigenous territory.

Marcos began giving interviews and the EZLN made use of the internet to raise global awareness of their struggle and build pressure on the Mexican state. An uneasy standoff has persisted since, allowing the Zapatistas to focus on the governance of their territories and national and global advocacy for their ideology, rather than on constant violence. Though their governance style has been heavily influenced by anarchism and libertarian socialism/communism, the EZLN has rejected all political labeling other than ""Zapatismo,"" and has not actually demanded the disillusion of the Mexican state so much as its fundamental transformation and decentralization. The Zapatistas claimed to be engaging in the Fourth World War, against the forces of neoliberalism, which had emerged victorious from the Third World War (what we would call the Cold War). It's hard to keep within the 20-year rule here, because there have been so many developments in the indigenous liberation movement since 1994, from the growth of the participatory democracy of the Good Government Councils to the launching of the nationwide ""Other Campaign"" to the anarchist ""Oaxaca Commune"" in the neighboring state.

The Zapatista rebellion was not an immediate success in that they neither precipitated the overthrow of the Mexican state, nor retained control of the state of Chiapas at large. However, the EZLN did hold on to territory spanning many indigenous communities, in which the line between community member and Zapatista has been blurred, and has been very successful in propagating a new ideology of communitarian socialism and indigenous liberation in an era of neoliberalism. Though 1994 is now fair game for questions here, the Zapatistas are certainly not history in the sense of belonging strictly to the past, as they are as active now as ever. They continue their struggle and have become radical icons for solidarity and resistance in the global struggle against modern neoliberal capitalism in the developing world over the last twenty years.",0,1388647212,,0,FALSE,1,cefc1xb,t3_1u6wko,t1_cefc1xb,t3_1u6wko,1427894047,82,FALSE,AskHistorians,t5_2ssp3,82

TRUE,Embrace_The_Absurd,,,"&gt; You teach the belief set that deities doesn't exist

No atheist teaches anything. Atheist schools don't exist. In retrospect I should have stopped reading here.  

&gt; The agnostic view makes sense, and can be applied to other parts of science

As I just said, 99.9% of atheists are **agnostic** atheists. You are literally arguing with something that doesn't exist. You're arguing against a strawman. 

&gt; Dedicing that ailiens doesn't exist is also a belief

There is a difference between the **positive** statement ""I do not believe there is a God"" and the **negative** statement ""Due to a lack of evidence I am inclined not to believe"". Most atheists are the second example: they don't positively state there is no God, but rather are agnostic atheists because of a lack of evidence for the existence of God(s). They aren't saying anything, their beliefs are merely a product of evidence. No one says ""aliens do not exist"", they merely assume the default position that we don't know due to a lack of evidence. 

&gt; When you build a belief system like atheism on fallacies

Holy fucking shit was is wrong with you? My brain almost exploded trying to process that retarded sentence. ""Based on the evidence provided, do you believe in a supernatural Creator of the Cosmos?"" ""No."" The. End. That's it, that's all atheism is. How can a position that consists of 1 single statement be founded on a fallacy? ""A lack of evidence makes me think there isn't a God, but I dunno, man"". ""OMG YOU'RE RETARDED YOU'RE BUILDING A BELIEF SYSTEM ON FALLACIES!!!!111"". Like... what?

&gt; Christianity also has many denominations, so disagreements internally in your religion doesn't make it less of a religion.

My brain is going to implode. Christians still have a binding creed and those that differ greatly from Christian theology become their own religion. There is NO CONTRADICTION IN ATHEISM BECAUSE THERE ARE NO STATEMENTS MADE TO CONTRADICT ONE ANOTHER. It's like being silent and not saying a word. 

&gt; A cell based structure

... what? So the fact that people can discuss ideas across various mediums means that there is a doctrine, and therefore religion? By that 'logic' every piece of information able to be communicated is also a religion. This makes no sense whatsoever. Also, since there is no central, unified centre for atheism, if 2 people discuss ideas regarding the non-existence of God, this has 0 impact on atheism as a whole. You honestly believe some atheists in China care about what 2 15 year old atheists in Australia are saying? I can't wrap my head around this. Terrorists have a goal, and ideology, a purpose and unified reason for their actions, atheists have none of this. 

&gt; You teach the belief that deities doesn't exist

Yes. You said this already. We don't teach anything. We come to conclusions through various means, that's it. I was Christian for 21 years, now i'm not. Why? I explored the Bible's origins and found it to be nonsense and unbelievable. Others never heard of God, some may have lacked personal experience etc. This doesn't make sense. 

&gt; That your religion is simple, and unintelectual doesn't make it something unique

ok...?

&gt;  If you don't belive there is no religion, why aren't you just agnostic?

What is wrong with you? Why are you mindlessly ignoring everything i've said to you? 99.9% OF ATHEISTS **ARE AGNOSTIC**. Even Richard Dawkins said he was an agnostic atheist. Atheism does not have to be a positive statement; that is *gnostic atheism*, the belief that there is definitely no God. 

&gt; Asserting that something doesn't exist, while saying you don't know to hold a tiny grasp of scientificness sounds much like the fallacies religious people will use to appear more scientific

If I read this correctly, you're criticising agnosticism, but throughout your past messages, including this one, you're saying that you SHOULD be an agnostic. 

&gt; Do you make up doctrines about the answers of every scientific question?

TRUE,MajorPolstan,,,"I don't think I've seen any Indian on reddit arguing that the West is not better than India when it comes to women.

What the Indian redditors oppose is the projection of India as a land of rapists and where majority of the men are rapists and most of the population supports the rapists and blames the rape victims. That _is_ racist. These cases from India are in news only because a large number of people are out on streets protesting against them . You hear about the cases of police refusing to register a complaint or harassing the victims because the police officials responsible for these actions are condemned and punished. The only reason you hear more about rape cases from India (as opposed to say, Kenya or Mexico) is because a huge number of Indians are out on the streets protesting against them.

Also, there is an unfair amount of attention being focused on _India_ (which is a not a bad thing until people start associating the world ""rape"" with India). There is a  constant stream of India-related rape news on r/worldnews. Let's talk only about [British tourists](http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/uk/138-britons-raped-while-abroad-last-year-spain-had-highest-number-of-attacks-29430631.html): 138 raped and 300 suffered sexual assaults in 2013. Only 1 of these happened in India (no these cases are not under-reported because these figures are from reports to the British embassy not Indian police). The only case that happened in India was 1 of the 300 sexual assaults - the woman jumping from her hotel room in Agra. That story was on the r/worldnews front page. What about the other 299 sexual assaults and 138 rapes in other countries? Did you see them on the reddit front page? 39 of these 138 rapes happened in Spain. (Yes, there were gang-rapes too - eg [this](http://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/303643/British-tourist-in-Costa-del-Sol-gang-rape-agony) or [this](http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/gang-raped-front-hundreds-clubbers-magaluf-2096376)) Would you say ""I wouldn't visit Spain with any woman""? Compared to many other countries in the Western world, the attacks on tourists are far less common in India and the stories of police inaction happen only in the poor/illiterate parts of the society.

Lastly, there is too much focus on _rapes_ because this issue generates more moral outrage and stirs up emotions. India has a law and order problem like any other poor country (yes, India is a very poor country - there are more poor in India than in Africa). Life is shitty for everyone, not just women. If you read the Indian newspapers, you will find tens of shockingly bad things happening to men as well - but everyone is focusing on rapes. I know most people here would say ""Attention will encourage India to improve condition of women"". I agree, but thanks to too much focus, rape has become an emotional political issue in the country. People are no longer having sane discussions but indulging in rhetorics. When the recent [gang-rape](http://www.jpost.com/National-News/Six-14-year-old-boys-arrested-for-alleged-gang-rape-of-girl-12-335778) involving 12 boys happened in Israel, the Israeli media had discussions like ""How do we educate young boys against these things?"", ""Is access to pornography a problem?"" etc. In India, the discussions happening are ""Why do Indian men rape? - oped by Feminazi"", ""Minister should resign taking moral responsibility"" etc. This particular case for example became a headline because the communist opposition party tried to parade the victim's body to gain political mileage against the ruling party (that's why the police tried to 'hijack' the body - they did not actually cremate the body, btw - the ToIlet paper headline is misleading).",0,1388650847,,0,FALSE,1,cefcw6n,t3_1u6xi5,t1_cefcw6n,t1_cef7jo7,1427893583,229,FALSE,worldnews,t5_2qh13,229

TRUE,MajorPolstan,,,"No conspiracy here, just politics. The police didn't actually cremate the body (the headline is misleading - read the full article. That's why Times of India is called ToIlet paper - it's like Daily Fail of India).

The girl's father is a member of the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU), a trade union arm of the the Communist Party of India - Marxist (CPI-M), which is the main opposition party in the state where this happened. When the girl died, the CITU carried her body around the city for 3 hours in order to get political mileage against the ruling party TrinaMool Congress (TMC). In fact, one report claims that initially the father wanted no politics, but his CITU comrades 'snatched' away the body from the family for their rally.

The CITU wanted to organize a ""condolence rally"". The state government realized that this might turn into a political snowstorm like in Delhi, where the ruling government recently lost and the newly-formed political party which organized anti-rape protests (among other protests) is now in power. So, it ordered the police to stop the CITU procession.

The allegations that the police 'hijacked' the body have been made by CITU and CPI-M members (which include the girl's father). The police actually deny that they tried to cremate the body - or even forecefully take it. They say that they took possession of the body after consultation with the family members.

Irrespective of whether the police forcefully took the body or not, they did not cremate it (unlike what the headline says). Even according to the girl's father and CITU activists, the police could not cremate the body because they did not have the death certificate. The body was returned to the family and was cremated by them.

The entire thing has turned into political slugfest. In fact the victim's father has lodged a police complaint against the ruling chief minister (who is also the health minister) for causing his daughter's death due to medical negligence.

TRUE,VerdigolFludidi,,,"Hi!

I'm an electronic artist, you can listen to my stuff here: https://soundcloud.com/amiran

A lot of what you need to know depends on the genre you want to make the music in, but most of the decisions I have to make when creating a song are decisions every songwriter, composer/producer has to make. If you want straight up tutorials, I seriously recommend **Warbeats** if you decide to use FL Studio: http://warbeats.com/Tutorials This guy has really good video tutorials up on youtube, they're amazing, crystal clear and just straight up to the point.

I've been doing EDM for about 3 years now and I still re-check some of his videos if I've forgotten some old tricks.

I'll give you a basic overview of the most important aspects you'd likely need to consider. When you are still learning a lot, you'll likely also want to just focus on one of these aspects. It takes time and effort to be good at every aspect of the song composition.

**Rhythm**

A good rhythm is important - especially in EDM (electronic dance music). If you can bob your head to it, you are heading in the right direction. The simplest rhythm you can have is the techno house 4-on-the-floor beat. Dubstep rhythm is characterised by half-time beats. There are tons of other rhythms you can think of though, including moombahton, drum and bass, jungle and so on. Once you get an understanding of how to make these beats, you can move on and make your own - and maybe spawn a totally new genre in the process!

**Chords and Keys**

You have to know about basic chords, keys and scales. A chord is C major, for example. If your song is in the key of C major, too, then the chords you would most often use are: C major, D minor, E minor, F major, G major, A minor. Sometimes a song is just one chord, repeating over and over again - think of psychedelic trance. Sometimes you have an incredibly complex pattern of chords. A sequence of chords that you repeat is called chord progression. For example, the famous 4-chord progression in C major would be C, G, Am, F.

**Melody**

A good song is often just characterized by a damn good melody. I would argue that in pop music, melody is THE most important part of the song. If your song is in C major (also Cmaj or just C), your notes that you would use to create a melody are C, D, E, F, G, A, B. You might want to add a kind of blues or jazz touch to it - then you can use the D# note on the key of C major.

**Song structure**

Once you have a good beat, a nice chord progression and a catchy melody, you have to move on and see the song in the big picture. Your song might just start with some aggressive beat and end with it, like a god damn punk song. Different genres are characterized by different song structures, too. Progressive house starts with a melody, a chord progression or just a simple 4-on-the-floor beat and then adds elements to it as the song progresses, making minimal changes at once. The structure I use the most right now is just plain ol' intro, verse, riser, chorus, verse, riser, chorus. In pop music you find ""verse, chorus, verse, chorus, bridge, chorus, chorus"" to be most popular, with maybe an intro and an outro, too.

**Instrument sounds**

In electronic music, one thing you find yourself doing the most is just finding the right instrument. It is important to know how to make your own instruments through VST-s from scratch, but sometimes just shuffling through massive libraries of presets is an incredibly fun process. I cannot tell you how to pick your sounds - most often it's just this weird feeling that you have to get, a powerful subjective ""this is perfect!"" feeling. Genres are often described by describing their characteristic instruments only - this is especially true for dubstep, where the ""wobble bass"" is very pronouced.

**Sound quality: Mixing and mastering**

This is something I really like doing. You instrument that you've chosen have to be the right level. Making a clean mix is important. A clean mix that has things going on in all parts of the spectrum sounds good on every device - be it your headphones, powerful monitoring equipment or just a cheap car stereo.

Your instruments should usually have a frequency spectrum ""space"". You create that contained space by cutting out sounds. A bass sound you'd probably low-pass (cut out higher frequencies), guitar and vocal tracks you'll probably want to high-pass (cut lower frequencies below the lowest note that the vocalist sings). You contain your instruments in their spaces, but overall your song should cover the whole spectrum.

This way the bass won't mask the melody and the melody won't make the bass muddy.

**Variety**

Try to be creative in all aspects of the composition. Don't stick to one rhythm, try to experiment with chord progressions and don't be scared to use really weird sounds that you've never used before.

EDIT: Oh wow, thank you stranger for the gold! I'm going to expand on my post today with some additional information and insight into the actual process of music production, if anyone is interested.",0,1388661833,,0,1388733095,1,cefeq3g,t3_1u7mdd,t1_cefeq3g,t3_1u7mdd,1427892730,79,FALSE,IWantToLearn,t5_2rjo5,79
TRUE,NonViolentWar,,,"This is a generation that was told by their parents ""go to college, go to college, go to college.""  So they went to college, racked up enormous amounts of debt for what amounts to a worthless piece of paper.  Assuming they can find a job, they have to work twice the hours as the generation before them to make the same amount of money (if there were even that many hours in a day), and even then the same amount of money doesn't buy a shadow of what it once did.

...but even if it did, I'm not sure it would make us happy.  

For me, when it gets really bad is when you save up for that weekend holiday and you realize that the locations you are going, while they may even be the most beautiful sights in the world, still don't offer you any inspiration or solace.  It's just more stuff.  Even if you lived in such a beautiful place, you still get the feeling, ""It would get old after a while.""

The technology seems like it helps, but I'm not so sure anymore.  All of the knowledge in the world, at our fingertips...and we're still not happy.  We get on sites like Facebook and Reddit every day like there's something NEW there that we NEED to see.  It's just another addiction to useless shit that does nothing for us.

You can only stare into an empty smartphone screen and eat Easy Mac for so long before you think ""Surely, this isn't how people are supposed to live.""  

I also think the increasing trend of atheism is something this generation is going to wrestle with.  There was a time in many of our lives where 'God' was inspiration to live happy.  Someone to pray to that offered something to hope for.  Now, for those of us who aren't professional philosophers, we can't get back to that place we once felt with Religion.  I know that no one's coming to save me....I'm all alone.  Meanwhile, I've got all this shit that is supposed to make me feel 'full', and it doesn't

An improvement in state of mind and a good relationship with someone you love seems to help alleviate it a bit, but the longer I work and support my family through this life the more I start envying the lives of those Amazonian tribesman who live in the little grass huts and take Ayahuasca every day.  

I wish it could be simple.  I wish people could be honest with themselves and others.  I'm tired of all the lies.

Shit, that got out of hand fast.

**Edit:** I got so many positive comments, it's going to be difficult to respond to all of them. With this kind of response, I think it's safe to say that what I wrote here struck a bit of a chord with the core Reddit demographic.  I think the most important thing to those who feel the way that we do (I'm with you), is to acknowledge these feelings.  You can't appreciate the good and move forward, until you acknowledge the bad.  Maybe, now that we have all of this wonderful technology, we can set our children (the next generation) on a search for truth, meaning, and peace from the very start so they might avoid some of our pitfalls.

Congrats, you've made it.  Unlike the vast majority of the people who will read your words and mine, you've realized that you participate in a society in which you are essentially *required* to work, and your reward is some resources and time - what you do with them is up to you.  This is a realization that most people will spend their lives without.  No, it is not fair sometimes, but it is nonetheless the truth.

Some perspective: you have traveled further in your life in terms of miles/km than most people in all of history.  You have heard more languages, you have consumed more resources and you have killed more trees.  You have eaten more animals, worked more hours, been more productive, seen further into space, met more people and been exposed to more ideas than ever before.  There's a good chance that 250 years ago you would've been born, lived and died in the same country, probably the same county, and 500 years ago probably the same town.

You're right, it will get old after a while and there's *nothing wrong* with thinking that things are ""dull"" because quite frankly, the current life is the only one you've ever known.

Imagine that even back then, there was ""old"".  To clarify, when Caesar saw the pyramids, he was closer to the moon landing than their construction.  He could only ever read about what that was like, and likewise we can only read about him.  I'm sure peoples in that time had the same feelings you do, with a little bit less perspective perhaps.

Eventually, someone will look back on this time while reading a history book and go ""Damn I wonder what it was like when so few people could go to space.""  Ideally, they'll be reading it from some space station thing where beds are made from boobs and mountain dew isn't bad for you, but we can only hope.

But I digress.

What I mean to say is that you are lucky enough to have more time than ever and more resources than ever.  You won't be happy going to some exotic place because you know that it's not as hard as it once was - and nothing worth having comes easy.  So don't just go there, learn the history of the place (from ""the beginning"" - I would suggest Guns, Germs and Steel first, then everything about the location from then on), learn some of the language and the culture (widely exported for most places these days, but the more remote locations will require to you to hit a library).  Don't settle for the Cliff's Notes - read the whole book.  You have to *make* these things hard because it's too easy to book a flight and a vacation package these days and not actually press yourself mentally.  There's real value to ""expanding your horizons"" although in the modern time this means mentally more than physically.  I know people who've been to Vietnam whose sole exposure to their history begins when the US started supporting French Indochina - and many of them don't know where that name came from.  Đó là một sự xấu hổ.

Notice a pattern here?

Reading.  Always keep reading.

That's my advice to you, as long winded and unlettered as it may be.

You know what's more impressive than an old guy (or girl!) who has been around the world and exposed themselves to many ideas?  The same person with a giant library.  In fact, you'll rarely find an interesting, traveled, well-rounded (""Renaissance"") person who does not have a huge library.  Thomas Jefferson's library became the Library of Congress.

This was hastily assembled, sorry for any typographical errors.

TL;DR: ""It's never too early to start beefing up your obituary."" and you should work on making yours quite the novel - but novels are read, not watched on youtube.

Remember when you visited an amusement park while you were very young? When you arrived in the morning, you were almost shaking from the excitement and you (perhaps naively) thought that you NEVER wanted to go home.
As the day progressed you tried amusements one by one. Some bored you, some you retried numerous times, but the urgency you felt at first has faded leaving you to savour the individual experiences at a slower pace. Come evening you have become tired and the thought of going home seems more and more appealing, and when the park closes you tiredly follow your parents to the car remembering an awesome day, having only a slight regret that it has ended, and perhaps even being glad for the opportunity to rest.

We are all ""children"" arriving at the amusement park that is life. If you are not old, you aren't meant to be ready to accept your mortality. Instead savour the amusements/experiences you have, and come time the prospect of facing your mortality becomes less and less daunting. Some elderly describe death as an old friend, but you (and I, I'm not THAT old) cannot yet see it that way. And that is as it should be.

[Comparison of Quality of Care for Patients in the Veterans Health Administration and Patients in a National Sample](http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=718025) 

&gt; Overall, VHA patients were more likely than patients in the national sample to receive the care specified by the indicators (67% vs. 51%; difference, 16 percentage points [CI, 14 to 18 percentage points]). Performance in the VHA outpaced that of the national sample for both chronic care (72% vs. 59%; difference, 13 percentage points [CI, 10 to 17 percentage points]) and preventive care (64% vs. 44%; difference, 20 percentage points [CI, 12 to 28 percentage points]), but not for acute care (53% vs. 55%; difference, −2 percentage points [CI, −9 to −4 percentage points]). In particular, the VHA sample received significantly better care for depression, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension. The VHA also performed consistently better across the entire spectrum of care, including screening, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up. These differences in quality of care held true when we considered only those indicators (n = 72) supported by randomized, controlled trials (57% vs. 45%; difference, 12 percentage points [CI, 3 to 20 percentage points]).


[Vets Loving Socialized Medicine Show Government Offers Savings](http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aLIc5ABThjBk) 

&gt; Patients routinely rank the veterans system above the alternatives, according to the American Customer Satisfaction Index. Last year, the government program got a satisfaction rating of 85 for inpatient treatment, compared with 77 for private hospitals. The index, a University of Michigan project, found that veterans’ outpatient care scored 3 points higher.
&gt; 
&gt; Proponents say the agency also offers a model for restraining health-care costs. While an August report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found a “substantial degree of cost control,” it also said the comparison with private care is difficult because of the changing mix of enrollees in the veterans system and differing benefits.

FWIW, the general rule in the US the health care provided by the government almost always tends to be much better at controlling waste, fraud and abuse ([the rates in private health care](http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/news/news/2010-report-card.page) were double that of [public health care](http://cnsnews.com/news/article/medicare-and-medicaid-made-70-billion-improper-payments-last-year-more-all-spending) as of 2011); [more efficient and capable](http://www.ama-assn.org/resources/doc/psa/2012-nhirc-results.pdf) of delivering services (and doing so [pretty consistently](http://www.ama-assn.org/resources/doc/psa/2012-nhirc-comparison.pdf)); and [better at controlling spending](http://theincidentaleconomist.com/wordpress/medicaid-spending-growth-is-surprisingly-modest/). So again, the people saying that public health insurance is all scalpel jockeys operating in Civil War-era hygenic conditions on the government dime while the glorious free market works better and cheaper are either completely clueless or lying their faces off.

TRUE,drjgm74,,,"i was under the impression that there were postsynaptic receptors scattered throughout the cell membrane but there was a greater number of receptors at, or just distal to, the Axon Hillock.

Yes, the whole cell doesn't need to depolarise. I imagine that you have a whole lot of little zones of depolarisation occurring all around the cell membrane, like little sparks, and some of these sparks can cause little sparks nearby, but the channels are too few and far between so you can't trigger an explosion (mass depolarisation). In fact, the normal resting state of the cell probably has all these little sparks flashing as channels cycle and small currents/potentials occur but they are few and far apart.

But near the Axon Hillock there are large amount of receptors packed in there, so a few sparks landing in there, set off a few channels, and then the surrounding channels and BOOM!

I'm pretty sure that there isn't an intracellular protein that travels across the cell. It is due to the effect of these areas of electrical potential, and a function of the electric fields generated across the cell membrane. Remember one channel depolarising creates current flow across the membrane and an electrical field spreading out on the surface of the membrane (radially). This electrical field strength drops (inversely proportional to distance squared) but still it is able to cause effects some distance away (from the point of view of the channel). So when one channel sparks it can trigger another channel that seems far far away from the point of view of the channel.

&gt;Rich investors are able to target moments of opportunity and make things happen. The shallow mass of capital controlled by ""the 99%"" can not be targeted (although new innovations like Kickstarter have interesting implications in changing that).

You're talking about capital investment and I'm talking about supply and demand. They're two parts of the process, but they're not the same thing. And you're right about capital, though it's hilarious that you denigrate the amount of capital the 99% have while championing those who keep that amount as low as possible.

My point is that it's useless to invest capital where there is no demand. For 99% of products you need the 99% of the people to generate the demand that scales enough to keep our economy growing. You suppress the income of the 99% and demand stagnates. That's pretty easy, right? The money of the rich does scale and make things possible. But the U.S. economy doesn't run on a million families buying a Mercedes and a yacht and hiring a personal chef. It runs on tens of millions of people buying Chevys and pizzas and paying for day care. The spending of the rich is great for Ruth's Chris' waitresses and marina owners, but you'll notice how many of those there are compared to McDonald's and movie theaters.

&gt; Who do you think invests in new technologies and ideas?

A lot of the time it's the government. I actually work in this sector, so think twice before you pull out a prefabricated talking point. I hear them all the time and they're the product of a political agenda, not an understanding of how things work. It's a long chain of events with lots of places for people to spend money. But fundamental R&amp;D -- where truly new technologies and ideas come from -- is too expensive and risky for most companies to take on in a big way. You've got your IBMs and others, but a lot of what you see reported as R&amp;D is taking a government-funded breakthrough and engineering it into a product. Meanwhile, billions and billions of your tax dollars get funneled through government agencies to universities and others who do the fundamental research that leads to breakthroughs. And look at the medium you're using: first computer? Government. Internet? Government. GPS (if you're on your phone)? Government. And when you get something with a flexible display? Government (in a consortium with industry and universities). When you can run it all off sun light? Government (again, in cooperation with a lot of people).

&gt;Care you elaborate? Actually make an argument? How is it different? As you make your argument, remember that regulation is enforced by armed law enforcement officers and leads to confiscation or incarceration.

""incarceration"" Ha! That's a good one. A guy sells an ounce of pot and goes to jail for decades. Bank executives launder a billion for a cartel and the bank gets a fine equal to a few weeks' worth of profit. The rich don't see much jail time and the corporations who insist they are people are very scrupulous about not being people when it comes time for somebody to go to jail.

But the difference is easy to see if you get out. I served in Berlin when there was still a wall and along the DMZ in Korea. I've been to the Balkans and Saudi Arabia. A regulation that limits your ability to trade is coercion, but it's not the same as the coercion that puts people in slave labor camps and works them to death. There's a vast moral gulf between the two, just as there is between the physical blow of a slap on the cheek and the physical blow of a brick to the temple. The language will allow you to flatten them all under one vague heading, but reality won't let them be the same thing morally.

Look, you've bought into one side and I've bought into something else. I'm sure we've both read the articles about how difficult it is to get people to change their minds. I've been poor, I've been all over the world (albeit in the Army) and I work in the heart of the military-industrial complex. Your arguments won't overcome my experience, and I'm sure my arguments won't overcome whatever education or experience formed your opinions.

The year was 1987, and it was the World Junior Championships.  Canada was playing Russia in Piestany, and after a long, gritty game, things started to go south.  

A little skirmish led into a shoving match, which turned into a fight, which turned into a line brawl.  The thing to remember here is that fighting was unheard of in Russian hockey.  It was considered savage, brutal, and unsportsmanlike.  Unfortunately for the Russians, this sort of play style was right in the Canadians' wheelhouse.  Aggression was our speciality, and we knew it.

The Russians had little to no experience with fighting, and most lacked the intensity and willpower to even fight back... While the Canadians threw punches, the Russians just tried to grab sweaters and sleeves and hold on for dear life.

Russians didn't fight... they just didn't.  Except for one kid.  At 19 years old, 5'11"", and 170 pounds, Russian forward Vladimir Konstantinov stood little chance against his opponents, yet he stood and fought all the same.  

As events escalated, officials tried desperately to break up the fighting... but the Canadians still fought, and so did Konstantinov. Having lost control of the situation, the officials left the ice... but the Canadians still fought, and so did Konstantinov.  Desperate measures were taken, as the lights to the entire arena were shut off in an attempt to stop the anarchy... but the Canadians still fought, and so did Konstantinov.

Four years later in his rookie season, Konstantinov's first defensive partner in the NHL would be a Canadian kid by the name of Steve Chiasson... and when his English improved, they discovered why.  Steve Chiasson was Konstantinov's first dance partner on that infamous night in Piestany, 1987.

When asked why the Red Wings drafted this little Russian kid nobody ever heard of at 221st overall, Neil Smith, a scout who attended the 1987 World Juniors spoke up... **""He was the only one of the Russians who fought back.""**

Vladimir Konstantinov would go on to be arguably the most feared and aggressive Russian in NHL history.  Notorious for his devastating open-ice hits, his defensive skill and puck handling often took players by surprise.  In '95-'96, he led the entire NHL with a plus-60 rating, and he finished second only to Brian Leetch in '96-'97 Norris Trophy race.  That same year, he helped lead the Detroit Red Wings to their first Stanley Cup in 42 years... and was subsequently paralysed in a tragic limousine crash.

TRUE,xathor,,,"Today I am wearing my crummy little $4 watch and if you are interested I will tell you it's story.

A few years ago, back when I was in the Air Force, I was deployed to Balad, Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.  I was in a small 3 man team that managed all of the base security forces tactical radios.  This included every radio that the patrolling units, base defense units, tower snipers and multiple entry control points used to also include radios inside of tactical vehicles.  Basically, if it was on base or around base and was a PRC-117, PRC-152 or ASIP radio, it was my domain.  There were a few additional type of radios, but that's outside the scope of this story.  

All of these radios, that everyone used to ensure base defense communications, relied heavily on a frequency hopping technology called SINCGARS.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SINCGARS if you want to read about it.  These radios ideally needed to have time manually entered into them to within 4 seconds of the primary timing master.

For timing we used a device called a DAGR, which is basically a GPS unit.  Everyone had them, and they typically run on batteries if not hard mounted inside a vehicle.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_Advanced_GPS_Receiver if you want to read about it.  I don't know if any of you have been deployed before, but sometimes batteries are hard to come across.  Also, the DAGR takes about minute to five minutes to get a GPS lock after it's been turned off for a while.  

Everytime someone would mess with their radio, pull the battery or get a new crypto loaded, the time would have to be reset.  Waiting several minutes to re-time a radio 20-30 times a day is a pain in the butt.  

At the time I was wearing a Timex Weekender that I had strapped to my pack that I wore all the time.  I had the watch strapped to a loop that was on my left shoulder so I could look over and see the time.  Well, sure enough that watch got smashed to bits one day while I was getting into an MRAP.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRAP if you want to read about that.

Where does this little Chinese Darch watch come into play?  Well, my birthday was about 2 weeks before I deployed to Iraq... my dad had given me this cheap watch as a gift.  I hadn't thought much of it and tossed it in my bag as I was packing for my deployment.  After my Timex got demolished, I grabbed the Darsh and started wearing it.

So what makes the watch special?  Well, like I mentioned before, pulling a DAGR out multiple times a day to reset radios is annoying.  I used to have a daily ritual of setting my Timex to GPS time throughout the day.  The Timex seemed to be very fast, gaining several seconds through a day.  It didn't take but a few days to realize that the Darsh is very, very accurate... losing about a second a week if I remember correctly.  This was a huge time saver for me, not having to worry about having to ensure that my watch was set on GPS time.  As an additional bonus, the Darch has proven to be quite durable.  After a 9 month deployment, it has some nice wear on the sides and a few scratches on the face.  

TL;DR:  I used a $4 watch to time an entire military network that ensured safe and reliable communications for base defense in a war zone for nearly a year.

TRUE,Skeletorfw,,,"Ahhhh sleep paralysis, my old friend...

First time ever it was formed of a more realistic multicoloured version of this illustration: http://imgur.com/nV0EPfc. It was floating about half a foot away from my face, and in my doorway I could see an abnormally large silhouette illuminated by light coming through the cracks. This was right at the edge of my eye-movement range and I could not move my head to see it more clearly. There were sounds of scrabbling and faint chatter from the foot and sides of my bed, but the sources of this were out of my eyeline. I had a very strong feeling of unease, could barely breathe due to the chest putting weight on my lungs, and I felt very cold. After a while I managed to move a big toe, then some more toes, then a finger and finally my limbs. As soon as I regained most of my movement the hallucinations faded.

This happened when i was approximately 14.

And for now the most recent time, last year:

I was lying on the floor of my SO's old room with them because they only had a single bed. The bed itself was on my side of the room, and as I faced that way the wrought black iron curls of the frame were at eye level. I drifted off to sleep and dreamt that I was in a theater, watching a production. Everything was blurry and hard to make out, but I noticed as I blinked that they became perfectly in focus with my eyes shut. They were disturbingly malformed pastiches of clowns, and there were silhouetted spirals in the background. I opened my eyes again and it was blurry, then closed them again to see in perfect clarity. As I did this a few times I realised that the spirals I was seeing were made up of the spirals in the ironwork of the bed, but even armed with that knowledge I could still see the grotesque puppet show style performance in a blurred manner.

I tried to scream for help but couldn't and so carried on blinking, recognising that this was in fact sleep paralysis, but still being absolutely terrified of the things I was seeing. I could perceive the music of the show faintly, and the sense of unease rushed over me again. I naturally couldn't turn my body, and so felt that there was something watching me from the doorway who I couldn't turn to see.

I focussed desperately on trying to get even the slightest sound out of my lungs and controlling my fear. The curls of the bed started to look more like a bedframe and less like projected stage design, and whilst the show became clearer in my eyes, the stuff which actually was behind the framework of the bed started to become faintly visible. Finally I could hear my voice making a little bit of noise, no words yet but sound was at least some progress. Eventually I managed to get a slurred version of the words ""hug me"" out which got more and more understandable each time I said it as I regained conscious control of my speech. Finally I woke up my SO and they hugged me and made me feel safe until the fear and adrenaline subsided.

It was weird to hear my own voice shouting in a slurred and incomprehensible manner when my logical mind was entirely conscious.

**NOTES:**

- A few things about this second story are interesting. The main point is that sleep paralysis almost exclusively happens when in a supine or dorsal sleeping position (on your back or your front) and so for it to happen with me lying on my side is certainly uncommon, though it is documented as being possible. I have a theory or so regarding why it is common to experience this on your back or front, but no evidence to back it up presently. :( Also it is interesting that I get the pressure, without the typical demon which a lot of people see. I get analogues, but certainly it's uncommon.

- It's tricky to learn how to fight out of it, and unpredictable whether you can manage, but a good thing to do is focus on control of your blinking and your eyes and then see if you can make a face muscle work, or maybe a little muscle like those controlling your toes. Then move up from there.

- To those who do not have it, I'd like to point out that it's kind of like having your logic completely there and sound, but with your imagination still in dream mode and running free and wild.

**tl;dr:** Initial experience had scary green skull and feelings of unease. Latest was perturbing and had various auditory and visual hallucinations. It was bloody terrifying but also interesting.

TRUE,JJEagleHawk,,,"Lived in London for a year. Some things I found unusual (as a midwestern American):

(1) It's been said already, but ""You alright?"" as a greeting is something I never really acclimated to.

(2) You don't say hello to strangers. Rare to even even acknowledge them. I thought that was just a big-city (London) thing, because I've definitely seen that in NYC, but that was true everywhere we went in England.
EDIT: Maybe just the few places we went; apparently Northern England (Yorkshire, instance?) is friendlier.

(3) The orderliness of escalators is awesome -- stand on the right, walk on the left -- yet for some reason sidewalks are a disorderly mess.

(4) ""Mate"" has a range of applications, from genuine friends to a sarcastic address to irritating strangers. (Of course, when you refer to that irritating stranger later to one of your mates, you might call him a ""bloke"" or a ""geezer"" to indicate that he wasn't a true mate.)

(5) Tube cars with no tourists on them are deathly quiet -- it's almost like Brits think eye-contact and conversation spreads disease. If you're on the Tube and talking, 8/10 chance you're a tourist, and 9.8/10 if you don't have headphones in.

(6) Charitable giving. It's tough to find people that don't have an automatic debit for a charity -- RSPCA, Bernardos, Cancer Research UK -- and tough to find a high street without a charity shop. I know Americans also give to charities but it seems much less compulsory. People (in Britain) often support charities solely due to a personal connection to the charity, whereas in the U.S. it's more (though not only) for tax reasons. (*H/T to /u/Alexinsfo)

(7) Pub culture -- people take their kids to pubs! Here, bars are lonely places where alcoholics and 20-somethings go to get hammered. There, pubs are merely socializing hubs. I rather like that, actually, and miss it back stateside.

(8) Panto.

(9) Just-barely-below-room-temperature ""real ales"". WTF, guys? EDIT: WOAH, Backlash unanticipated. Note I am not promoting traditional american-style lagers as a superior product.

**(10) Can't believe I forgot this one . . . but pull-string lights in the bathroom. Everywhere else in the house will have light switches, but the bathrooms in a lot of houses still have a pull-string light. (Don't get me started on split taps, either.)

I wouldn't be so quick on the ""no one can tell you"" stuff. It is hard to be truly helpful in some areas, but people do make noble efforts at it that are worth sharing from time to time.

It is mostly sweat though, years of it. Then again you also have these young upstarts like Porter Robonson who are barely born yet and are sudden popstars, but BT took him under his wing so what do you expect, heh.

I have arrived at a few tips that aren't often heard (which isn't to say im good at this or anything):

* Pick a single synth plugin and master the ever loving shit out of it, don't jump into another one until you are absolutely sure that it can't make the sound that you want (mine is zynaddsubfx), don't let the marketers rope you in (a lot of those tutorial lords are paid to endorse one plugin or another).

* All the brilliant mixing and mastering in the world will do nothing if your sound design and composition is shit

* You can get lost in tutorials, howto videos and books all damn day and not create anything, at a certain point you have to stop learning and start experimenting, I limit myself to 2 hours of instructionals a day and honestly that is probably too much

* And finally, nobody is grading you, so dont be afriad to cheat. If you dont know what chords will fit into the key you are using, whip out http://www.mucoder.net/en/tonespace/, if you have a melody in your head that you can't seem to plot on the piano roll, then sing it into an audio to midi converter, if you suck at playing the keyboard then get one of those shits that remaps all the in-key notes to the white ones, like [the shwarzinator](https://www.ableton.com/en/packs/schwarzonator/)


There are a couple more inspiring things out there. 

* Posted a little while ago showing westbam in 1994, (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfhVbHj4mPs), you'll notice that neither of them really know how to play the keyboard and just plink around until something sounds good, and that guy is a legend.

* Also the aformentioned Shwarzinator, an amazing performer that can't play an instrument and uses a plugin to fake it.

* This brilliant classic by james holden (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRWUZh5nD8I), released in the year 2000 was made entirely using Buzz, notable because it is freeware. Prime evidence of not needing expensive software and an army of plugins to make something worth hearing. What if I told you that modern freeware is better than the stuff that was out there in the year 2000?

TRUE,boojit,,,"In this specific example, there's nothing wrong with the way you did it in the second case; many programmers might be partial to having it written that way.

There is also an important distinction here about ""storing stuff in memory"" that you should understand, although you may need to progress further in your studies before you fully appreciate the details. Basically, both cases are ""storing stuff in memory"", it's just that in your second case, you're not keeping a *reference* (remember that word, it's important) to the memory location where you stored the stuff. This line here stores stuff in memory:

    Console.ReadLine();

As you know, it stores the string value of whatever you type in on the keyboard, until ""enter"" is pressed. It doesn't matter if you assign the output of this command to a variable or not, in either case, within the guts of ReadLine, it is allocating memory and putting the contents of what you've typed in that memory location.

When you do this:

    uservalue = Console.ReadLine();

What you're doing is you're saying, ""after you store what i've typed into memory, give me a reference to that memory location so that I can find it later, and call that reference uservalue"". 

If you don't create a reference to the output from ReadLine, then that memory usage will eventually get cleaned up (by something called a ""garbage collector"" no less). But as long as you have at least one reference to that memory location, then the garbage collector will leave it alone.

Lot of big concepts in there, is it making any sense?

They will suck until they are full and then just keep going. That means, regardless of how badly they need to stop and cough or sneeze, if there is something in their mouth they will just keep going. Do you see how this can become dangerous? Also (and this is just a guess, but still) it kind of looks like that baby might be slightly premature and that bottle/nipple combo looks very similar to ones that we only use in the hospital - the yellow nipple is a slow-flow nipple we use on babies that, surprise surprise, choke easily and/or are mostly breastfed.

TRUE,In_The_News,,,"OOK since everyone is so wrapped up in the ""that's sexist"" argument, lets throw around things like historical context and gender politics of the time 

AT THE TIME women were only ""allowed"" to contribute columns based on domestic care and social notes.  They were not thought capable of the ""mental taxation"" required for journalism. 

People very much cared what she had to say because she frequently campaigned *in place of her husband* which was not only unheard of for the time, but gave her remarkable power in conveying presidential policy. 

She even had several pet-projects of her own that had national implications.  

Through all this she chose to continue to empower women.  Newspapers of the time would rather fold than be scooped by rivals. With two editions coming out daily, and the First Lady only allowing women in, it became an incredibly groundbreaking movement in journalism to put women in the position of political corespondents. 

It forced major corporations to hire women, publish their stories and stand behind their reporters as competent.  By having some of the biggest, most prominent media giants of the time stand behind women reporters, it gave females in general more credence.   

If she had allowed men in, no women's stories would have been published *at all.* The gender politics of the time dictated that *only men* were capable and worthy to be published on such ""weighty"" matters. 

In addition, having women write stories gave them a different perspective. Men of the time were very skeptical of Eleanor and looked for opportunities to undermine her and her missions. She seriously shook up the political, gender and racial norms of the time that rich white men running large media empires depended on.  Eleanor wisely did the modern-day equivalent of ""banished Fox news"" (except ratcheted up about 10 notches) from her addresses.   

Eleanor Roosevelt was a groundbreaking feminist at a time when feminism meant the difference between being able to go to the bank and make a withdraw without your husband's permission.  Or being able to take out any kind of loan. Or get a job that was not considered ""suitable"" for women. Or having to sign your paychecks over to your husband.  Being born in the late 1800s, she came of age during the Suffrage movement.  Think about that, *women didn't even have the right to vote.* 

This is coming from an Editor who probably owes her livelihood to Roosevelt bringing women into the journalistic fold. 

**Edit** Holy cow this comment blew up. Thanks for the gold, stranger. 

As cool as it is that this has spawned so much discussion, I was hoping to get away from simplistic rhetoric on sexism and highlight what a truly paradigm shifting woman Eleanor Roosevelt was. She took forceful measures to improve life for women, minorities and the poor.

You might as well say seatbelts cause autism because that's how fucking stupid that argument sounds.

Edit: since someone paid me in gold, I'll do the justice of answering the most asked questions:

*How does it endanger others in the car?*

Not wearing a seatbelt is dangerous for everyone in the car because you don't stop just because the car does. If you're strapped to the car, you still risk internal injury from the sudden deceleration but if you're not, you're going to continue in your path of motion (see Newton's first law of motion) and the only thing that's going to stop you is what you come in contact with; which could very well be anyone else in the car. 

*Statistically seatbelt deaths vs. non-seatbelt deaths are about 1:1*

There's a blurred area in those statistics. How many of those deaths were preventable with a seatbelt versus the amount of deaths that are prevented with one? There's no way to answer that so therefore the argument is invalid. ",0,1388685620,,0,1388709242,1,ceflcu5,t3_1u8pv1,t1_ceflcu5,t3_1u8pv1,1431768729,1925,FALSE,AdviceAnimals,t5_2s7tt,1925

I used to be 310.  When I started losing weight, I did it by controlling my diet, and then started doing dance dance revolution ( a game where you bounce up and down on a game pad )

I learned that you can, in fact, break a dance dance revolution pad, a little too easily actually.

When I started, I would be on easy mode for 30 minutes then collapse in a fat heap on the ground.  Sometimes just gasping for breath and wheezing.

Then I would get up, and generally do it again (I had a goal for 1 hour a day).

I did this for months before I got an exercise bike, which I promptly broke (too heavy for the seat), and then i got another one (I rode the seat all the way down for a couple weeks).

I still do exercise bike, and now I run, do adventure racing, swimming, climbing, hiking.

My ""Fat Problems""

I have asthma
I have/had bad knees (this problem barely affects me after I lost my weight)
I have no fullness reflex, I can literally eat until I throw up and never feel satiated, only time I ever felt what I think people call full is when I eat really rich foods like liver.  (I think it is full, I just don't want to eat more but I am not sure)

I have a nerve pinching problem, that when I was overweight made it so that some days I would writhe in pain when at work (programmer) unless I massive pain meds, and I would just sit at home on the floor crying when it was at its worse (around 2004 when I was around 280).

But, here I am.  

This kind of ""i can't fix myself"" or even ascribing that to others, really makes me angry sometimes.

I also don't like the fatlogic forums pre-disposition at times to think that fat people (general) are lazy.  Fat people just don't have the same goals.  I never really gave a shit about whether I was thin, until it became a serious health problem.  I never even thought in terms that the fat logic groups here assume.  I loved being overweight for the eating.

Even today, I eat a ton, and I exercise to compensate.  Sometimes, and I know it goes against this sub, that cake really does taste better than being thin.  It is just about priorities.

What I dislike is fat people who say they want to be thin, but then demonstrate fat logic to say they can't help it, and no one else should.

I see that abound here in the stories posted, and I think it is horrible and I think it should be fought against tooth and nail.

It is one thing to accept who you are, and not want to be bullied, quite another to argue that who you are is OK, and healthy, and fighting against a physical ideal which actually promotes health.

With Soldado not providing the expected goal output, many have called for Defoe to replace him in the starting XI.

Defoe would have shot that opportunity into a defender, where as Soldado took the time to pick up his head and find a better goal scoring chance.

Furthermore, he's far more tactically aware than Defoe, working the wide channels when the team shape get's lopsided. Before Adebayor was back in action, that left Spurs a little headless in attack. But now with a second striker in the mix, it's made his distribution from wide positions far more threatening as there's a target to play to. Soldado's assist to Adebayor last week is a prime example of this.

TRUE,GeneralMillss,,,"Here's the thing about NASCAR, and stock car racing in general. As compared to other forms of motorsport, like road racing that takes place on a circuit, NASCAR does seem boring on the surface. However, that loop-de-loop is not as easy to do as it looks.

The way that I like to think of it is that road/circuit racing is like an obstacle course; agility and versatility are extremely important, although specializing in certain aspects of the event may or may not help you. NASCAR is like walking a tightrope. The car needs to be balanced at all times, and a minuscule error in input will lose you valuable fractions of a second.

But that's just the skill side of things. People performing a difficult task won't make that task interesting to everyone, and that's fair. As we know, motor racing is a contest to see who can go faster than the next guy, and fastest out of everyone by driving a vehicle.

The things that make motor sport exiting to me are the risk/reward scenarios, the strategy, and, above nearly all else, overtaking. Overtaking is exciting because there is always a moment where a mistake by either driver means everything could go horribly wrong. It's one of those things that make you hold your breath and wince, and then all at once let it go. No matter if it's my guy or his rival, a good overtaking move is just creamy smooth goodness to a racing fan.

Now, I should make note here that I do not consider myself a NASCAR fan, per se. I'm an F1 guy. One of the biggest ""problems"" they have been trying to solve in F1 as of late (and the decisions to this end are cause for much debate, but that's a story for another day) is the small amount of overtaking present in the sport these days. This depends heavily on the track, but your average Grand Prix will have 40-50 overtakes/passes a race, and often times, after the last round of pit-stops have been made, you can pretty easily predict what the podium will look like.

Then there is NASCAR. An F1 car is a 600kg fine-tuned laboratory on wheels, while a NASCAR sock car is about as technologically advanced as an Ikea book case, relatively speaking. But the racing in NASCAR is fantastic. Stop thinking about the simple looking tracks, and start thinking about how every one of those cars has a guy behind the wheel trying to drive out of his skin. Hundreds of overtakes per race. Every lap keeps you on the edge of your seat.

You could say that NASCAR is about as plain as racing gets, and that's the beauty of it. Just a bunch of boys having a go at each other with horsepower. There’s no stewards enquiries, no expensive courtroom battles; drivers in NASCAR settle their own differences. In NASCAR, if a driver hits you unnecessarily, you hit them back. So long as things don’t get massively out of hand, drivers get away with retaliation too.

You know, now that I think about it, NASCAR is a bit stupid. At the end of the day, it really is just a bunch of dopes spinning around a race track for fun. But that's why racing, and other sports for that matter, exist in the first place. To see who's stronger, faster; better.

US JRPG gamers were all playing Final Fantasy X, released in July of 2001. For the PlayStation **2**.

And it seems like a mathematical artefact, that this state does not change, if you multiply it by an arbitrary number (in fact it can be even a complex number). This is what we call **Global Gauge Invariance**. 

Now what would happen, if we apply this locally? What if we multiply the wavefunction with different numbers depending on the position in space-time?
**Local Gauge Invariance** states, that such transformation should still be allowed and if we assume that to be true, than we are forced to introduce a new field, that compensates the effects of that transformation. This field has to be massless and if you look for it's properties you find, that it behaves exatcly like the electromagnetic field. 

So we say today, that electromagnetism follows from ""local U(1) gauge invariance"", which means exactly what I just said. (U(1) is another word for the set of complex numbers with an absolute value of 1; the language is the one of group theory, because more complex interactions as for example the strong interaction involve more complex gauge groups.) The particle's charge takes the place of some kind of coupling constant between the particlefield and the introduced electromagnetic field.

Now why did I tell that to you? 
The truth is, that this procedure does not automatically ensure that opposite charges attract and like charges repel. 
I never thought about it that way but i'm pretty sure that you can totally write down a theory in which it is exactly the other way around. 

So up to today's knowledge: 
We don't know why charges act the way they do. I know that this was a pretty long introduction for such a dissapointing conclusion, but I wanted to point out one thing: 
We know pretty well why there is electromagnetism in the first place and much of it's behaviour simply follows from this. 
It is just that to our knowledge it could work the other way around equally well and nature simply chose our way. 

EDIT: I have one little thing to add: as many other numbers in the standard model (for example the masses) the charges of the elementary particles are (until today) free parameters, that can be adjusted to fit the observed coupling strength. 
Of course, physicists hope, that a unified theory would explain those parameters. 

EDIT2: Zelrak is right. I thougth I could come up with a reversed-attraction-theory by altering the way the gauge transformation of the electromagnetic field works, but that doesn't make no difference at all as it is merely formal (you can always absorb the sign into the gauge function, for example). For the more technically interested ones: what can indeed be changed is the sign of the electric and the magnetic field, but if you choose to do so, then the force exhibited on charged particles also catches an extra sign (in classical terms **F**' = **-** (q**E**' + **v** x **B**')) and therefore stays unchanged. 
So indeed: *it is a fundamental property of our way to formulate this matter, that like charges repel and opposites attract.*",0,1388687964,,0,1388699582,1,cefmf7g,t3_1u8mdr,t1_cefmf7g,t3_1u8mdr,1431769231,60,FALSE,askscience,t5_2qm4e,60

Make sure your garage door opener has a reversing feature. If a reversing feature is not present, your overhead door opener should be replaced. Garage door openers manufactured after January 1, 1993 are required by federal law to have advanced safety features that comply with the latest UL 325 standards. Contact your manufacturer or installer for additional information. 

Test the reversing feature once a month.

First, test the balance of the door (see ""Testing and Maintaining The Garage Door""). If the door is properly balanced, then proceed.
With the door fully open, place a 1½-2"" thick piece of wood (a 2x4"" laid flat) on the floor in the center of the door.
Push the transmitter or wall button to close the door. The door must reverse when it strikes the wood. (Note that the bottom part of ""one piece doors"" must be rigid so that the door will not close without reversing.)
If the door does not have reverse, have it repaired or replaced. Have a qualified individual adjust, repair or replace the opener or door.

Force Setting Test
Test the force setting of your garage door opener by holding the bottom of the door as it closes. If the door does not reverse readily, the force may be excessive and need adjusting. See your owner’s manual for details on how to make the adjustment. Test the reversing feature after any adjustment.

TRUE,ENRN,,,"I am sorry to hear your girlfriend is going through this. Nursing is a funny profession where horizontal violence is rampant, especially for new nurses. It was likely some mean spirited, self aggrandizing long standing nurse wanting to show a new nurse how the standards have dropped since she went to nursing school with Phoebe in 55AD - observed this and either independently or with her brood wanted to make a point. The chances are a simple head bob, was passed onto management that she is regularly sleeping, missing call bells and one patient who has no legs and both arms in casts even fell, tended their wounds and got themselves back into bed all during one of her extended naps. They probably added that she wears no underwear, regularly texts inappropriate message, sings Rick Astley out loud and farts by the sleeping patients and blames them. Unfortunately there are some bad nurse managers, who like the drama as much as the lead nurse and happily play into it. 

My first job was horrendous - on my first day my preceptor told me that this unit was not for men as the patients required care only a women could give. It went down from there - a group of nurses regularly emailed the nurse manager that ENRN did this, or didn't do that. I would then be called into the nurse managers office where she would say I cannot disclose the incident to ensure the confidentiality of her staff, but I allegedly didn't change someones soiled sheets, refused someone pain medicine, or wouldn't hold a gentleman's testicles to help him sleep. With no specifics I couldn't defend the story, so I just assured her I was aware of the complaint and would work harder. This went on for a few months and then I resigned. When I left the nurse manager said that I was going to have a hard time in nursing, especially in acute care (this unit was med/surg at a regional hospital) and I should consider following my dream of becoming a truck driver.

Let your girlfriend know it gets better - many nurses get off to a rocky start. I didn't go truck driving school, but stuck with nursing. 2 years later work at academic medical centers in the ED - I have had no complaints and am confident in the care I give. Nothing like what I first experience has happened again. We recently got a new nurse manager, we all had an individual meeting with her - I told her, if there is a learning opportunity I am all ears, but I am allergic to catty bullshit - she laughed.

**[Biscuits](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2NP4WZJ-mI)** (later reprinted as ""Cookies"" in North America)   
*by Douglas Adams*

This actually did happen to a real person, and the real person is me. I had gone to catch a train. This was April 1976, in Cambridge, U.K. I was a bit early for the train. I’d gotten the time of the train wrong. I went to get myself a newspaper to do the crossword, and a cup of coffee and a packet of biscuits. I went and sat at a table. I want you to picture the scene. It’s very important that you get this very clear in your mind. Here’s the table, newspaper, cup of coffee, packet of biscuits. There’s a guy sitting opposite me, perfectly ordinary-looking guy wearing a business suit, carrying a briefcase. It didn’t look like he was going to do anything weird. What he did was this: he suddenly leaned across, picked up the packet of biscuits, tore it open, took one out, and ate it.

Now this, I have to say, is the sort of thing the British are very bad at dealing with. There’s nothing in our background, upbringing, or education that teaches you how to deal with someone who in broad daylight has just stolen your biscuits. You know what would happen if this had been South Central Los Angeles. There would have very quickly been gunfire, helicopters coming in, CNN, you know… But in the end, I did what any red-blooded Englishman would do: I ignored it. And I stared at the newspaper, took a sip of coffee, tried to do a clue in the newspaper, couldn’t do anything, and thought, *What am I going to do?*

In the end I thought *Nothing for it, I’ll just have to go for it*, and I tried very hard not to notice the fact that the packet was already mysteriously opened. I took out a biscuit for myself. I thought, *That settled him.* But it hadn’t because a moment or two later he did it again. He took another biscuit. Having not mentioned it the first time, it was somehow even harder to raise the subject the second time around. “Excuse me, I couldn’t help but notice…” I mean, it doesn’t really work.

We went through the whole packet like this. When I say the whole packet, I mean there were only about eight biscuits, but it felt like a lifetime. He took one, I took one, he took one, I took one. Finally, when we got to the end, he stood up and walked away. Well, we exchanged meaningful looks, then he walked away, and I breathed a sigh of relief and sat back.

A moment or two later the train was coming in, so I tossed back the rest of my coffee, stood up, picked up the newspaper, and underneath the newspaper were my biscuits. The thing I like particularly about this story is the sensation that somewhere in England there has been wandering around for the last quarter-century a perfectly ordinary guy who’s had the same exact story, only he doesn’t have the punch line.

**EDIT:** Oh my goodness. Reddit Gold! Thank you, kind benefactor. I have edited the post for typos in appreciation. **[I appear to have also developed some strange powers beyond those of mortal cupcakes.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2NP4WZJ-mI)**

**EDIT2:** I've changed it (back?) to ""biscuits"". I originally came across it as ""Cookies"", which puzzled me because I wondered why Adams would use the American word. I had assumed that he had just spent a lot of time in the US or something, or liked the word ""cookie"" better. Well, upon reading the comments below, it sounds like they actually had the gall to edit this story for the American printing of *The Salmon of Doubt*, and that the original version uses ""biscuits"".",0,1388693438,,0,1388784330,1,cefp1k9,t3_1u86l7,t1_cefp1k9,t3_1u86l7,1431770477,660,FALSE,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,660
TRUE,Lost_Thought,cow,,"An image like this, that clearly shows the breakdown should be what you have on the product page. As it stands, the current product page makes it just seem like a bolt-action AR-15.

That really does not paint a clear picture of what makes this rifle different from any AR platform.

If I were you, I would be pointing out the unique features:

* Easy change free-float barrels (I am presuming here)
* Easy change handguards
* Easy dissasembly for storage

that sort of thing.

Can you change calibers with just a barrel swap (assuming they are magazine compatible like .223 to .300 blk?)

Is this option a cost effective alternative to a regular AR-15 having multiple upper receivers?

Is a gas operated, or direct blowback model a possibility?

The tellers are told to just do exactly what (and only what) the robber tells them to, to get them out as quickly as possible, so nobody gets hurt. 

The trick is not to get caught. Want to know how not to get caught? Rob a bank as far away from home as possible, so several hundred miles. Rob it on a Friday afternoon before a holiday weekend like Christmas, and make sure the bank is close to somewhere a business hands out bonus checks. This will net you around $10k per teller you rob. Wear a nondescript hoody, hat and sunglasses. Be in and out fast, and don't park too close to the bank. Now for getaways some people like banks near highways, but you can just as easily get away by hopping on some random back roads. Do all of this, and never do it again. Most bank robbers are caught because they get away with it once, and keep going back for more; this pisses the FBI off and they will find you and catch you (sometimes because some kids stumble onto something they shouldn't have).

That's *kind of* what matter is like on a per-particle scale. Matter waves are probability waves where the peaks and troughs translate to the probability the particle will be detected there.

The analogy breaks down in that *if the particle is observed*, the whole wave ""resets"" to simply a sharp peak where the particle was observed. It'd be kind of like as soon as you see a water peak or trough, all the water instantly piles into a spike right where you're looking. Of course, to have the spike spill back down into a ripply surface within the bucket, you have to look away and let it do so.

It may in fact not always be applicable, and then it'll be up for debate.

&gt;I don't know what media you're watching, but rape is definitely not glorified in US media and is a topic of great debate in most media. Rapists aren't glorified at all.

They're not *glorified*, but they're sometimes treated deferentially…

&gt;During the course of the delinquent verdict on March 17, 2013, CNN's Poppy Harlow stated that it was ""Incredibly difficult, even for an outsider like me, to watch what happened as these two young men that had such promising futures, star football players, very good students, literally watched as they believed their lives fell apart..."" ([wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steubenville_High_School_rape_case))

We don't have to stop at rape. The Game as played by PUAs is basically a playbook for eroding consent. 

Police officers deciding that rape is ""too much work"" is in of itself a political statement. Have you heard of the slutwalk? It started after a police officer came to a university and told students that one great way to avoid getting raped is to not dress provocatively - putting the onus on victims, blah blah blah, I'm not that qualified to talk about this.


&gt;Again, you claim ""patriarchy"" as if it's definite fact that it exists. You need to prove it, show evidence of it. ""Patriarchy"" in your sense of the word is extremely broad.

All I have to do is demonstrate that men benefit at the cost of women. 

You've admitted that pay gaps are real - even if the methodology changes the exact value. The BI piece you linked to is just an opinion column… okay so, let's sidestep CEOs. What about representation on boards of directors? What about percentages of female government representatives? Do you honestly believe that the lack of female programmers has to do with an innate inability to understand science?

I am not interested in debating these specifics. I am convinced by my own experience - as a guy, talking to other guys when no women are around - and by the evidence that I've seen. I'm trying to explain to you the worldview. And honestly, the patriarchy is a pretty uncontroversial idea. 

Much in the same way that our social system shits on black people.

&gt;Feminism is not solely over the allocation of power, and that's an extremely underwhelming statement about the feminist mindset. You speak as if all feminists have the same ideas about allocation of power.

Well, allocation of power is a pretty broad statement. How is it underwhelming? The goal isn't to cut your dick. And yeah, the whole point of my parent post is *people have different ideas when it comes to this stuff*.

As a final gesture, I'm going replace a few words in your post and you should tell me if it's an outrageous claim:

&gt;""White people"" do not, as a whole, act in a way that discriminates against ""black people"". Just as most ""black people"" do not hate ""white people"" as a whole for one ""white person"" discriminating against them. They blame the individual. ""White people"" do not subconsciously gang up on ""black people"" to be racist, nor do they act as one entity.

You don't need people to be purposefully being a dickhead for them to be perpetuating a set of rules that collectively makes life shitty for a specific group.

I tend to do larger runs in a washing machine so I'll pre-chill 5gallons of water in the fridge then add that to the washer with ~2bags of ice and let it sit for 10-15.  Check my temps and start running material with water temp of 34 degrees F. Smaller runs are a lot easier to get to temperature quick because you don't need to have 25 gallons of pre-chilled water on hand.

To support Shaikoten's reasons of financial desperation, and as I wrote in a P.M. to Brosen87, Arnold came from a very wealthy family, that wealth unfortunately dwindled sometime in 1753-55, when Arnold's siblings, Absolom and Mary, died a few years apart - this drained the family's fortune, and Arnold's father unfortunately fell in to a serious alcoholism. This led to Arnold being unable to be privately schooled, and not becoming a merchant, but instead becoming a druggist. Anyway, what this all lead to was him volunteering in the British army during the French/Indian war, and he only served for a mere 2 weeks before returning home. After this, his mother passed away, and his father shortly thereafter - All in all, Arnold wasn't really well off, and I believe this partly contributed to his reasons for defecting later on.

In the Revolution, as Shaikoten said, Arnold had some great achievements - He was lauded as a great General, and everything Shaikoten said about him is more or less correct, a Patriot if you've ever seen one. After suffering a leg wound in combat, he had spent an alarming amount of money, even going so far as to drop over £1,000 ($78,000 in 2013) on a pipe of wine (Source: [Patriots](http://www.amazon.com/Patriots-The-Started-American-Revolution/dp/0671675621), p. 500). This lavish spending led to his fortune decreasing quite rapidly, but he was compensating for his debilitating leg wound that he suffered during the Invasion of Quebec, where General Montgomery was killed, which made him unfit for any active field command, rather putting him behind a desk. Just a couple of months before his treachery, he had been court-martialed, and narrowly avoided conviction, which led to him falling out of favor with Washington himself, who was at this point 'His Excellency, the Commander in Chief', but Washington respected him enough as a soldier to more or less just give him a slap on the wrist. Arnold had been given command of West Point in 1780 and had moved in just across the river with his wife, Peggy. She had also given him a child not long before this, and it seemed as if Arnold was finally happy and content. 

Only earlier in the conflict, Arnold felt he had been seriously wronged. He had been passed over for the promotion of Major General (6 Junior Officers had been promoted ahead of him, Benjamin Lincoln, Thomas Mifflin, Arthur St. Clair, William Alexander, Lord Stirling, and Adam Stephen). Washington took up Arnold's case and wrote, personally, to members of congress to try and sway Arnold's case, and pleaded with them not to make politically motivated promotions, as he felt it'd negatively impact other officers. He actually wrote a letter to Arnold on the 3rd of April, 1777, stating his surprise over not seeing Arnold's name in the list of new Major Generals, he urged him not to take any hasty action as he was sure it was simply a mistake. It wasn't. 

Arnold was again wounded in battle at the Battle of Ridgefield, again in the leg. This, he believed himself, led to the proper promotion of Major General, although he held no seniority over other Major Generals, something he bitterly despised. He submitted his official resignation in July of that same year, but this was soon withdrawn after Washington urged him to do so. Arnold's actions at Saratoga, especially having more than just a disagreement, more a full-fledged shouting match with General Gates, which ultimately led to Gates demanding Arnold leave the battlefield, were critical. However, in the second Battle of Saratoga (October 7th), Arnold returned to field duty despite his commanders wish, and was wounded for a third time in his left leg (Not a lucky streak), and Congress decided to restore his command seniority, but he felt as if it was sympathy, not his actions, that decided this 'restoration'. It left a bad taste in his mouth, and after being contacted in 1780 by John André for possible negotiations of defecting his command to Britain, he was probably given an offer he couldn't refuse. 

Given his prior 'insults' by the Continental Congress, he felt as if he was being mistreated and he felt as if he didn't receive the recognition he deserved. He had certainly been a valuable asset to the American cause thus far, why shouldn't he be treated as such? Taking Arnold's prior loans and funds put in to the Continental Militia and his general financial situation in to account, as well as his marriage to Peggy Shippen, the daughter of a very well-connected Loyalist family, £6,000 was a lot of money, on top of an annual £360 for his Brigadier General commission. I think this, as well as the fame he envisioned himself gaining with the British Army (Something he had desperately hoped would come out of his campaign in Canada), was enough to sway him. 

His own greed and rash decisions and ill temper had led to this decision, and his misinterpretation of situations certainly didn't help either. He had taken insults where none were given, and he had given insults where none were necessary, and he had tried to resign his command twice, and had probably suffered both mentally and physically from the 3 leg wounds and his young wife's apparent mental illness, it would've definitely taken it's toll on his mental health. This would also explain why he apparently left his wife alone with their child at Fort West Point, it could also be explained away by the fact that Washington was coming for a surprise visit, something Arnold most likely wasn't prepared for. 

Unfortunately for Arnold, the British army didn't really work out for him. He was promised a lavish £20,000 for the succession of his plot, but since it had failed, he was paid a 'measly' £6,400, and a pension of £360 yearly. Later, as a British Brigadier General, he had led some 1,500-1,600 men in to Virginia and captured Richmond amongst others, but unfortunately the Southern militia turned out and knocked them back, but the 'Southern Civil War' is an entirely different story for another day, and he left for England in 1781 to consult with Lord George Germain about the current war efforts, later dying in London in 1801. John André, the man who orchestrated Arnold's betrayal, was hanged as a common spy after three Patriots, one dressed in a Redcoat's uniform (Leading André to confide his purpose to him), stopped him on the outskirts of Tarrytown, and confiscated his incriminating documents.

TRUE,averagestalker2nd,ign,averagestalker,"Ok.  The official story is as follows.  In early July, I began to delve deep into the world of drugs.  I wanted to try heroin so I could write about it, I was curious, I was depressed, etc.  So I eventually found this chick through craigslist who had dope, and I went over to her house and tried it.  I quickly moved to the intravenous route. 

Within a couple months my life savings was gone, I was physically addicted to opiates, and my girlfriend at the time was kind of freaking out on me (girls generally don't like guys who slam dope).  In a complicated twist of events, this other girl I knew was very upset and called me while I was at work one night.  She was crying so I said I would come over and talk to her so she could calm the fuck down.  I had quit heroin cold turkey 36 hours previously for my girlfriend.  I had thrown away my syringes and sworn off the shit.

So I get to this girl's apartment and her roommate answers the door.  I can tell immedietly after seeing these girls that they are on some sort of substance, though I don't know what it is.  So I go inside and the girl who called me is just sprawled out on her bed and tries to get me to lay down with her, which i do.  She was pretty intoxicated because she was basically begging me to fuck.  I told her I had a girlfriend and that I couldn't.  Then I asked what the hell she was on.  Turns out she was on Ambien, a prescription for sleep that can provide hallucinations and blackouts if you stay awake on it.  I'm pretty good at sleight of hand, and I jacked 30mg (3x a regular dose) while she wasn't looking.  I quickly devoured it before driving home.  I was pretty desperate to escape the shitty sensation of acute opiate withdrawal.  My girlfriend was accusing me of fucking this girl, which I didn't do.  My dad had gotten me some liquor because he knew what I was trying to do.  I got home and took a shot.  I do not remember anything past this point.

I awoke (restrained) in a hospital bed, dry heaving and caked in blood and left with what little fragmented memories had managed to cling inside my mind.  My parents found me at 7am with an empty fifth of vodka, muttering incoherently.   They tried to get me to go to bed and apparently I refused. Bear in mind that I'm withdrawing from heroin, in an incredibly shitty girl situation, drunk as fuck, and blacked out from a shit ton of ambien.  They then procede to take the empty bottle and throw it away.

I snapped. 22 years of whatever the fuck has been going on in my head came out that night.  I went straight king kong on my house. I started smashing shit, punching holes, stabbing knives into the wall, just destroying as much shit as possible.  My parents locked themselves in their room and I apparently went into the garage and got an axe and used the  BLUNT end of it to smash the door down.  Right when I was about to get through the doorway, shadowy figures pointed flashlights at me and said ""freeze"".  I remember this as if it were a photograph.  Luckily I didn't charge the police, but instead ran into the guest bedroom and hurled myself out a 3rd story window... where I fell 22 feet onto concrete and shattered my left arm and wrist.  I picked up 8 charges (2 felonies have since been dropped) and permanently lost some function and sensation in my left arm.

I obviously relapsed onto dope because the pain was unimaginable and the percocet they were giving me wasn't doing shit because of my tolerance.  So the cycle started again and I basically said fuck it and went to rehab... I could write an entire god damn book on what happened next but basically i fucked this girl with big tits and a nice ass and did yoga and ate like shit and now I'm clean.  Chea.

Atheism is a lack of a belief in a deity. Full stop. There is nothing else to it. It's a *lack of belief* - it's not a belief in and of itself.

There are no a-leprechaunists. No one goes around saying, ""I don't belief in little Irish faeries with pots of gold. 

There are no a-golfers. No one walks around saying, ""You what what I'd like to do on this fine Sunday afternoon? I want to not walk around a big field with a bunch of small white balls and big sticks, and not hit said balls into scattered holes in the field. That's what I definitely don't want to do.""

Really? Let me recall something from a typical Mass for you:

&gt; ""Let us proclaim the mystery of faith!""

*Not* science.

Faith isn't compatible with science. It's just not. Faith tells you to believe in something because you are told to believe it. It doesn't matter if it's not really ""true"", you have to believe. So many times I did get in trouble in Catholic school, or in Confirmation prep classes what I asked questions... None of my teachers wanted to answer them, because they couldn't. ""You're too smart for your own good"" was something I hear many times - that doesn't smack of support for the basic tenant of science - QUESTION EVERYTHING! 

Religion is the reformulation of past mythologies: guesses, assumptions about universe, pronouncements made in search of personal power, all mingled with shreds of enlightenment. Always there is the unspoken commandment: Thou shalt not question! Millions have died because of it - questioning the Church in anything was at one time a death sentence, and can be that even now where the Church has a grip on political power.

&gt; My point is, it IS a belief that you cannot prove, because you don't have all the answers either.

I don't have to prove there are no gods. Every god humans have had has been put by the wayside as we've grown up as a species. None have been shown to exist.

TRUE,[deleted],,,"* Diet is everything. I achieved my weight loss not through paleo, but by mindful eating. Watching my calories and eating healthy: lean meats, veggies and legumes (boiled only). Fruit and whole grains in moderation (I have a cup of oatmeal everyday though). And absolutely no refined sugar and trash food or beverages other than water and tea. Also bread is out, although whole wheat bread is OK in moderation.

* Exercise: I started c25k and now I'm running 10k 3 times a week no problemo. I started lifting as well, I particularly do a mixed routine of bodyweight exercises and traditional lifting. Currently I can see the faintest signs of my 6 pack, the top two are visible now, my shoulders are wide, my traps are somewhat defined and my arms are not that big, but veins are visible.

* Progress measurements: I weighted myself daily and keep a log of it, I measured my body fat as well. Once a week I measured my waist, hips, chest, wrist and biceps and keep a record as well, every two weeks I took a picture of myself front and sides. Measuring often let you make adaptions and asses how effective your current habits are, I experimented with keto but found out that it didn't make me lose weight as fast as I was losing and that I was losing more lean mass than fat so I dropped it in time.

* Positive attitude: when you feel down or that you don't see any progress, remember this is a long journey, not a race, look at your log, see how you were a month ago or two. See your pictures, check /r/loseit for some inspiration, if your are working out, reflect on how you have progressed so far and think on how you will be in 2 months ahead, this will pump you up and keep up the spirits.

* to me this worked.. But you should avoid bragging or posting too much on social networks about your life style. Nobody gives a fuck about it and it makes you feel comfortable with your progress. The more people talk, the less they do. When you meet people IRL and see you the look on their faces is priceless, specially on those who brag a ton and do nothing, oh god I know it sounds bad but how I delighted with those fellows..

Basically, gay people don't come out for the benefit of other people or to make a statement. We do it for our own happiness and sanity, because having to watch what we say, where we go and who we go there with is fucking tedious.

TRUE,convoces,,82Δ,"Thank you for posting this; recognizing that there may be a problem is a crucial first step. I will directly address the points you brought up that you believe have merit.

1. What relevance does this actually have on anything? Who can tell what is going on in the brain? Not even advanced neuroscience or psychology can *definitively* delineate or separate complex processes like the ""emotion"" or ""logic"" going on in the human brain. *Fuck* anecdotal evidence, traditional, oppressive stereotypes, and some subreddit claiming to know ""the secrets of the brain and gender.""

2. Just because something is the status quo doesn't mean it's good. As an extreme example, slavery was the status quo and *some* slaves wanted to be ""good slaves"" because that was the best local maxima that they could perceive. Thousands of years of patriarchy can perpetuate a shitton of detrimental romantic stereotypes. I'm not saying there's anything wrong with this point inherently; the problem is when you *assume* this is the ideal and base your entire belief system about relationships on this idea.

3. What is wrong with casual sex? If you don't want to have casual sex because you are afraid you won't pair-bond, then don't have casual sex. If you don't want to pursue a long term relationship with someone who has casual sex because you're worried they won't pair-bond with you for the long term, then *don't do it.* If you want to have casual sex, then do it with people who also want to have casual sex. I fail to see how an inability to make this decision is the fault of ""third wave feminism.""

How does third wave feminism cause detriment to your life? For a long-term, pair bonding relationship, you only need *one* partner. Just because you haven't been successful at creating that relationship doesn't mean *it's the fault of feminism.* It's just *hard.* Stop letting people convince you into blaming others or women or pseudoscientific ""evolutionary biology"" bullshit for your problems. The red pill is indoctrinating you to *blame* other things for your individual problems and accountability and leading you down a really messed up path. 

Finding a viable or ideal partner is *not easy*. Dating and finding someone that complements you and supports you and loves you for who you are is *not easy.* Building a lasting, lifelong relationship with someone is *not easy*. It's hard work. **Stop looking for shortcuts and excuses.** Stop letting others convince you into blaming women and feminists for your individual problems; problems that a lot of people have.

It's **okay** to have these love life problems; almost everyone does, but going to theredpill is similar to, and arguably worse than taking dangerous, unapproved drugs for weight problems or joining a extreme religion. Theredpill can help improve your confidence in the way that these two other examples can improve confidence or have peripheral benefits. But they are still deeply, deeply wrong. You *can* build intrinsic, lasting self-confidence without these things.

When you have to say, ""well I don't buy into the 'rape is okay' part"", then you should probably take a step back and say, ""what the hell am I really buying into here, fuck this fucking insanity."" Which you are doing; which is good.

&gt;I am, however, a 23-year-old virgin

This is a key point. It's okay to be a virgin. You are probably feeling intense pressure on this point though; many people do. That's okay. However, realize that this fact has *skewed* your view. You are *vulnerable* because of it, so subs like theredpill are trying to sell you a attractive/easy-sounding solution to your **vulnerability**. Just like weight loss scams and Scientology and other extreme religion. **Don't buy into it.**

Thank you again for making the effort to hear why theredpill is frankly, a horrifying place. Let me know if you need any clarification, explanation, or discussion on any of these points and I will be happy to discuss them with you.

She then dines with him, where he and his family are feasting on her former sea friends, which she may have partaken in eating too, so she is now eating her former subjects.  Even if she doesn't eat them, she is fine with the fact that this guy she has an obsessive crush on is eating her former friends, but don't worry, that's ok, because when you think you are in love, it's perfectly fine for the guy to eat your murdered sea friends, because being kissed by him is SO much more important. Which brings me to the topic of being kissed, all the while all she can think about is getting Eric to kiss her, she doesn't even have the confidence to make the first move, she's obsessed with gender roles..  She doesn't seem to miss her father or sisters, her only concern is for Eric, a guy that she literally cannot even hold a conversation with.  

She is bat shit crazy, this is not normal for a 16 year old girl, this girl has issues spanning to the moon and back and she needs psychological help, not a boyfriend.

TRUE,PlushieChomby,,,"Wow. I typed 2,000 characters out and accidentally refreshed the page. I might cry a little. 

Round two, here goes: I'll bite, and try my best to explain things from my point of view, though please feel free to ask questions if I don't provide total clarity on what I believe on the subject. I also apologize in advance for the length. :) 

First of all, I'm a ""Christian"", though I fall pretty far from the average tree. I despise what the term has come to mean, and view it as a far cry from the ""little Christ"" meaning that Romans used to mock the early church. Organized religion has done and continues to do a great deal of harm (and a great deal of quieter, less publicized good, I'll admit) to the world around us, which is pretty much the opposite of what I believe Jesus intended. Rather I follow in my father's footsteps, believing religion to be deeply personal and devoting myself to attempting to walk the walk rather than spewing the talk at others, only talking about my faith when I'm asked, like in this instance. 

That said, I'm probably not your target audience, since churches tend to make me nauseous and sad, but since I fall into the religious category I thought I'd answer anyway. 

Honestly, it sounds like your Christian friend believes in a tiny little powerless god by that statement, and I completely disagree with the sentiment that God couldn't have accounted for *anything*, much less how much we multiplied. Then again, I believe God exists outside of the space-time continuum, and it would therefore be impossible for It to *not* know exactly what would take place, beginning, end and everything in between. 

Galatians 5:13-14 is one of many passages I've always liked, stating, ""You, my brothers and sisters, were called to be free. But do not use your freedom to indulge the flesh; rather, serve one another humbly in love. For the entire law is fulfilled in keeping this one command: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.'"" Mark 12:31 even says, ""The second is this: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' There is no commandment greater than these."" 

Needless to say, I spend a lot of time examining my actions in light of these verses, and others along the same lines. Am I behaving lovingly toward others, especially when they upset me? Am I patient when tried? Am I kind even in the face of ugliness? Do I feel envy or pride? Did I boast or dishonor anyone? Were my actions self-seeking? Have I been easily angered recently? Am I holding any grudges? Am I seeking out good and uplifting where I can, or am I commiserating and celebrating bad things happening to people who seem to deserve it? Am I embodying the values in both mind and action that I value so much? 

As someone who tries her hardest to do as little harm to and as much good for the world around me and the people inhabiting it that I can, it's simpler than you might think to boil down why I don't want to bear children. Yes, at points in history, human survival has been a concern. We are undeniably not at that point now. Thanks to modern science and technology, we no longer have to fear that one family will pump out twelve kids and only two will survive to adulthood. I'm sure it still happens, but it's nowhere near the scale it was before soaps and medicines and treatments that actually work came along. Hell, now we're at the point where your body doesn't even have to do the work to survive it once had to do. We have machines that will push blood through your veins for you, breathe for you, clean your kidneys, even flip you so your body doesn't suffer severe atrophy... the list goes on, while both expected lifespans and populations increase drastically. 

Meanwhile, mother earth has trouble supporting all her inhabitants. In just over 200 years, we went from 1 billion people to 7 billion people worldwide. That is fucking insanity. Earth has kept the majority of us alive so far, but the scars of our rapid multiplication are more visible with every generation. Reason One for my not wanting to have children would be that I'd like to not contribute to that scarring. Multitudes of other people will breed and I'm only a drop in the ocean, but it's one small, loving act to which I can readily commit myself: not hurting others by not contributing to the problem. Loving the people around me by denying my ability to produce other mouths to feed and feet to trample and little carbon dioxide producing machines. 

The second reason is this, my favourite verse in the entire compilation of books the councils of Laodicea and Carthage decided comprised the New Testament canon: James 1:27, ""Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress, and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world."" That's it: two things that both fall easily under the domain of practicing Real Love: taking care of those who have trouble taking care of themselves, and not losing yourself in a world ready to dilute you. 

I've done just about every kind of volunteer work possible. From suicide hotlines to pregnancy counseling to post-abortion counseling to multiple positions for battered women and children's shelters, from training dogs and cleaning their cages at the local shelters to AIDS walks and office work to visiting the elderly and doing their shopping/bills/taking walks with them, from doing music therapy and throwing parties and playing with children at the local mental hospital, to being a Big Sister and volunteering legal services and building houses with Habitat for Humanity. More than I've listed here, more than you'd care to read, and why? Because it's taking care of people. It's showing Love in a real way. The positions require exercises of patience, kindness, hope, joy... They exercise the things in me which I value and wish to continually grow, and keep me aligned with a very narrow, truly simple definition of the only ""pure and faultless"" religion. Helping the elderly and those in distress? Check. Taking care of orphans or those who might as well be? Check. Teaching adults to read, recording books for the blind... these all fall into the same category as the first two in my mind. I can make an impact, albeit small, on the world around me, by not having children - which allows me an incredible amount of time to make very real differences in the lives of those I can help. It feels more real, more honest, more loving, to take the time I'd otherwise spend training one or two spawn on how to be good people and instead devote it to enriching or positively altering the lives of people already *here*, rather than imaginary future children. 

I could be wrong, but I feel very strongly I'm on exactly the path which was meant to be most ideal for me, the path which spills the most Love into the world around me. Not having kids makes that possible in so many ways having them would limit for me. 

I guess I could have just summarized by saying, I personally think God's quite content, possibly sad about the sheer number of people that already exist on this planet, and is more than fine with my not contributing to the mass of people already here. 

Also, I'm 30, and while I've known for a long time that I don't want to bear children of my own, I can't say beyond a shadow of a doubt that in five or ten years I won't be in a place where adopting an older kid, not a baby or toddler, seems like exactly the right thing to do. I don't like small children, but I'm both a good disciplinarian and had an exemplary standard set by my parents on how to Love, which I've expanded upon greatly in my own studies and behavioral patterns. To be blunt, with over 100,000 children in America and an estimated ***153 million*** orphans worldwide needing adoption, it's incredibly difficult for me to understand how anyone who claims to follow Jesus Christ and wants children could even think of procreating themselves while the world is hurting so badly. I get it, lots of people want their own mini-me, they want to be pregnant or know they can breed, they want a kid from day one with the theory it'll somehow be special or different because they share DNA with it, but it kind of blows my mind how so many people can just skip right over something that seems so obvious to me. 

My aunt, one of only two who didn't pop out kids, was both a Christian and a social worker for decades. Although she was single, she adopted five children ranging from age 12-17 who desperately needed a stable home. I've seen the effects of how her being their rock, even in incredibly difficult circumstances, helped to shape them in amazing ways that I'm not sure would have happened had she not stepped up. She helped them with everything from PTSD to teenage pregnancy to getting them into college and helping them achieve their dreams. When she passed away a few years ago, I got to see all of them again (a few states over) and hear some incredible stories about how she'd permanently touched their lives and shaped their futures. I'd like to think someday I'll grow into being the kind of person my aunt was, but if I'm never in a place where adopting older orphans is viable, I'll still have plenty of time to help in non-parenting, positive influence, distress-relieving ways.... which, when you get right down to it, is what I believe God is asking of me. 

Wow, and I almost hit character limit. Sorry again for the length and I know I rambled a bit there, but it can be difficult knowing how to express things I generally keep to myself. I hope that provided a bit of insight into just this one religious person's view though. As Walt Whitman said, ""Do I contradict myself? Very well then, I contradict myself. (I am large, I contain multitudes.)"" But still, I'd be happy to answer questions if I was unclear or didn't make sense in any way. :)

There are different aspects that go into antenna design. I'm going to just talk about whip wire antennas. The antenna length is a large factor, as is the capacitance and inductance. Your speaker is a coil of wire and a magnet, so it has a high inductance. You are a capacitor in this circuit. The Aux cable is a length of cable so that goes with the length of wire in the coil of the speaker. These 3 values all contribute to how well the antenna works.

In this circuit the length of wire will pick up radio waves. The energy will then oscillate between the inductive part, and the capacitive part. Part of this energy will be used to drive the speaker. The more energy that is bouncing between the inductive and capacitive part, the easier it is for the speaker to take more energy.

It could even just be the Aux cable and you being a length of conductive material that are feeding into a transistor (think simple amplifier) that is powered on.

As is my tradition for all first time play sessions of a game: I had my tuna ready. I knew this was going to be a great experience so I didn't settle for princes, I went straight to John West and gave this shit the respect it deserved. 

Or so I thought.

After scavenging for a while, find wrenches and screw drivers as my character screamed of hunger pains, I came across some nourishing supplies. Hovering over a tin of tuna only to see the description of sardines pop up I felt a single tear roll down my cheek, as I wiped it away I realised I had just cried blood.

""Perhaps they haven't modelled the sardine tin yet and are just using the tuna one as a placeholder"" I innocently thought to myself, like a god damn fool. 

Within the hour I had witnessed the horror that was Dean Hall's interpretation of the one true fish of the tin. Along with the abomination known as the Sardine, the main market competitor within the maritime lunch sector of the almighty tinned tuna. 

Before long I found myself on the street outside my house, force feeding people disinfectant and shooting at every person that had come into my view. For a number of hours I continued in this manner before running out of steam, ammo and various lethal things that I could force down my neighbour's mouths.

Only then did I realise what had happened: True immersion. 

Though it was hard to accept this crime... this crime against fish packaging... I came to realise that it was necessary to trigger my deep psychosis that would allow for the DayZ experience to spill over into my real life away from the computer.

TRUE,JamesDK,,15Δ,"There's one giant reason why you should stay far, far away from TRP:

If it was going to work for you, it would have worked already. 

First, I don't think that you're really looking for what TRP is offering. At their heart, TRP and the 'seduction' community are about one thing: getting laid. You're a 23-year-old virgin, which means that you made it through high school and (probably) college, the horniest times in peoples' lives, without having sex. I don't think that casual, meaningless sex is what you're looking for. 

The thing is: TRP **will not** help you get a girlfriend, and I think that what you really want is a girlfriend. If all you wanted was a casual fuck, there was girl in your group of friends who you just *knew* was into you. Maybe she wasn't quite pretty enough, maybe she was kind of irritating or kind of dumb. Who cares? She was ''DTF'' and you knew it and you turned it down. 

The thing is: TRP doesn't teach you how to attract *women*: it teaches you how to attract a *very specific* type of woman. Believe it or not: women are people and, for the most part, people don't like being demeaned, insulted, intimidated, or disrespected. There is an extremely tiny subset of women who think as little of men as TRP thinks of women, and for those women: the only way to distinguish yourself from the 'herd' is to stand up to her bullshit instead of walking away. 

But ask yourself: do you really want anything to do with women like that: women who assume every male is a 'beta' milktoast loser until he proves otherwise by acting out? Are you ever going to have fun with a woman like that? Her default position is (and will always be) that you're not good enough. 

Imagine the exact opposite: that these girls believed all men to be violent rapists instead of losers. Instead of pursuing them aggressively, you needed to be ultra-careful and cautious in what you said and did. How long would you keep it up before you got sick of it? The *only* reason shit like TRP gets any traction is that it plays into gender essentialist notions that tell us that men are *always* aggressive and women are *always* passive. I think you know that's simply not true.  

This is the fundamental irony of TRP and all of the 'seduction' community': by putting up with girls that need to be 'neg'ed' and pursued aggressively to form attraction **you're still playing their game**. TRPers and PUAs deride 'beta' males who bend over backwards for women, but they're doing *exactly the same thing*. They're spending endless hours learning routines and tactics that have roughly the same success rate as **being a decent fucking person**. 

Women are wise to this shit. *The Game* came out, like, 10 years ago. My wife knows all about 'negging' and 'demonstrating value' and 'closing' from Jezebel and Feministing. When you act indifferent or 'subtly' put a girl down these days: she knows **exactly** what you're doing, and (unless she's the kind of girl that responds to that type of thing) she's just immediately ruled you out. Worse, she's going back to her table of girlfriends and they're **laughing their asses off** at your cheesy shit. ""Oh my God: he actually tried to 'neg' me!""

All of this is to say: TRP shit won't help you get a girlfriend, only works on a *very*, *very* small number of girls, is still (ultimately) doing everything you're doing because you think it's what women want, and (when it fails as it mostly does) makes you look sadder and more pathetic than you would have if you had just acted like a decent person. 

Run far, far away from this crap. Be a kind, empathetic, and genuine person and you'll meet a person in the course of regular life that will mean so much more than hundreds of random hook-ups ever could.

TRUE,Jamesev93,,,"She was so perfect. It had been atleast 6 months since they had met, but in those 6 months what a transformation she had undertaken. She shed 40 kilos; none from her breasts; the perfect hour glass figure.

 She claimed she wasn't doing anything different, since she came back from her holiday in central Africa. The number of attentive friends that surrounded her signaled that something must have changed. No one knew what it was though.

The coroner couldn't work it out either. 

She was the image of health; beauty even. Every inch of her supple skin, perfection personified. It was a shock to all when her boyfriend woke to find her without a heart beat, though she was more radiant than the day previous.

The death was treated as suspicious. After all, a beautiful girl who'd made an amazing transformation, from anonymity to near stardom, in a matter of months; someone had to be envious. Men would walk from their wives, enchanted in the streets. The pied piper would have turned green with envy at the sight. 

The coroner checked the skin. Supple and soft to the touch, it was unblemished - despite the families assertion of scars and stretch marks. The coroner checked the hair for toxins. Nothing but the sweet smell of strawberry shampoo. The coroner then checked the blood. The red blood cell count, the white blood cell count - not just within toleration - it was scientifically perfect. He double checked, and triple checked. Truth be told he was sure of his work, but he could not bare the thought of having to ruin this masterpiece with a scalpel. Alas, the decision was made. The organs were revealed; Perfect in size and colour. The body was unparallelled. It was as though there was nothing left to improve.

Back at the funeral, open coffin of course,  the crowd had turned out in droves. There were men swooning at the coffin side, women both enchanted and envious of a corpse's ability; perfect as it may be; to take their mans' attention from them.

She coughed.

 Silence fell upon the room. She coughed and spluttered and they came running. All crowded beside the coffin. The eager want for this snow white to wake from this slumber was palpable. Then she opened her eyes. Her eyes wide with fear and pain. Her mouth, agape, let out a great puff of orange mist. It covered the beautiful black gowns of the women, the solemn silk suites of the men, even the garb of the attending priest. With that last breath of life, she was gone. Her aura had faded.

The rest of the funeral went smoothly, relatively speaking of course. But when he went home, Jim felt the wanton need to sleep, and sleep deeply he did. The next day was uneventful, and the day after, and even the days preceding it. 

Until one day he felt the eyes upon him.

Surely enough, he would find himself catching the glaces of women at work. Huddled around the water cooler they whispered and murmured, stealing as much of a glance Jim's way as they could. Walking the street, women would stumble in his presence. Usually an unknown, at clubs he was approached endlessly by loose women ready to give their lives for him.

He looked himself in the mirror. He looked the same as he always had. He picked up a picture from the funeral. He, in his faded black suit, stood gaunt over the other attendees. His arms were too long and his hair was messy. But his face. His face was, different? He held it beside his face in the mirror. His nose wasn't crooked anymore. His eyes, not so sunken. His jaw, chiseled. He took of his shirt. His muscles, defined, made the perfect guiding lines down... He extended his waste band, well, there was definitely a big improvement to say the least.

The next day, he walked like a new man. Astute in his conviction and self esteem. His tongue, once quivering at the though of talking to Ashley, was made of silver this day, and from this day on. It was Ashley who found herself at a loss for words. Jim's interest in her was something she had dreamed of, if only recently. She had not noticed him before in the office, maybe, through the barrage of unwarranted sexual advances, he had avoided her gaze. Yet, here she was, quaking, giddy as a school girl. She was at a loss for words. She could scarcely remember how the conversation went. She knew she had to be ready at 6pm, dressed to the nines, but apart from that, Jim's eyes, his beautiful blue eyes, the conversation was a sweaty palmed blur. She was under his spell, and she knew it. 

The next 5 and a half months were the best of Jim's life. His career had jumped, due in part to his confidence, but in greater part due to his ability to stand out in the crowd. Ashely was wonderful, an eager lover with the fervor of youth, attentive and dependable. Although their time together had been brief, he knew it in his heart: this is how his life would continue. 

He had purchased the ring. Held it in his pocket for the last two days. The next day he would wake early, make breakfast and slip the ring on one of the roses he had bought, ready for Ashely to wake to. 

However, he did not wake. Ashely found him, without a pulse. She screamed bloody murder. The knife was further twisted when she found the ring. She was inconsolable in her grief.

At the funeral the crowds turned out in droves. Work colleagues, friends and acquaintances he'd met along this last 6 month journey all felt a deep sorrow for Jim's passing. The coroner could not explain it, nor could he explain the deaths of the 150 other random men and women in their sleep that same night. Their only apparent connection was their beauty. As though they were angels that were returning to heaven. Jim looked as such. A body of a god, the face of perfection and a heart of gold. But he had passed, and the ceremony had began. The coffin was open, of course, for all to marvel in his beauty. Then, Jim coughed, and spluttered, and all crowded around with bated breath, eager for Jim to rise.

 He did, with pain in his eyes, his mouth agape...

I took a dead leaf and a dandelion (as pictured) and told her to hide the leaf somewhere on her, and I would use the dandelion as a magic wand to find it. So I'm pretending to scan her body looking for it when I make my way up to her mouth. I stop at her mouth and I'm like, ""Open your mouth"". She cocked this smug-ass bitch smirk that was made 100 times better when I jammed the dandelion down her cunt gullet. She's crying, my cousin's crying, I'm getting yelled at by grown ups, and the whole time I was just soooo satisified.

TRUE,Shirrapikachu,,,"Smoking weed on a daily basis -- now see, that's not the problem. It's the ones that smoke it everyday and they make weed a part of their identity. Totally acceptable to base your lifestyle and identity on pot, but if you switch that out for any other drug, suddenly it isn't. Weed is widely acceptable as a can-do-no-wrong sort of panacea, and whenever somebody has an adverse reaction to it people make up excuses like ""oh maybe it's just the strain"" ""you just smoked too much"" """"it was probably laced"" weed isn't the perfect drug for everybody. And chronic use can certainly be detrimental to your health, significantly less compared to other things, but still there. 

Also, some of you stoners need to quit acting so enlightened and ""holier than thou."" You raise a fuss when I look down on you for daily smoking, but you turn around and preach about how drinking is ""soooo bad for you"" because we all drink on the weekends. You have your drug of choice, and so do I. 

Don't try and pretend you can't get addicted to weed, either. It might not manifest physically but if you're smoking everyday and altering the reward system in your brain, you bet you're gonna be irritable and have cravings if you all of a sudden stop. 


EDIT:: alright, this apparently has been taken as a personal insult to all smokers everywhere and that I'm an anti-weed piece a shit. 
this was meant to specifically target the group of stoners that base their sense of self and how they live their life on a drug, and take it to the extreme. I know plenty of daily smokers that treat it like a drug, and smoke it to relax. They don't rant about how it should be legal because it *does so much good* and yada yada. They can go without weed, they don't need it. And that's perfectly alright. 

Personally, I smoke pretty regularly myself. I have a friend I encourage to smoke daily because it helps her OCD. but I have personally seen the negative side of it, when the drug *use* turns into *abuse*. 

if you'd rather stay home and get stoned, that might be a problem. If it's taking a big chunk out of your paycheck, that might also be a problem. If you can't imagine being sober past the one week mark... you might *have a problem.* 

It's the stoners that are vehemently pro-weed that refuse to acknowledge their beloved pot *could* have negative concequences and addiction potentional, that I have an issue with. 
Again: *I am not anti pot so quit taking this as a personal attack on you or the drug itself.* 

Edit2: I'm going to make an analogy here -- You see, I'm a furry. When people think of furries they jump to the ""all furries are sick and into bestiality/yiff."" I dont take it as a personal insult just because somebody doesn't like the very specific type of furry. I dont like yiff or anything. I just happen to enjoy foxes (doubtful I'd want to actually be one, however) and enjoy anthropomorphic artwork (non-sexual.) When I hear or read somebody ranting about furries and how sick they are, rather then become offended, I try and clear up some misconceptions. Also with furries there are varying degrees of how much their identities and life are balanced with their personal interests. Some keep it private while others make furry things a part of everyday life.

So, I may have worded my original comment poorly and generalized pot smokers, but I'm specifically talking about one kind of smoker -- dont take it personally. That was probably a really shitty analogy but I tried to make it personal and relate to me.

EDIT3: I'm really happy that there's a large number of stoners here that are level headed and self-aware enough to see the negative!  Go ahead and smoke, but don't pretend there's no negatives. I'm also not denying that there can be positives to daily smoking, there definitely can! weed is also fantastic for medicinal things, I'd recommend pot over some pharmaceutical drugs any day.

TRUE,proffrobot,,,"So there are a couple of issues in cryptography, and a couple of ways that quantum computers can help. First though, we need to know a bit about encryption, and in particular, about one time pads. The idea is this. Say you could secretly talk to a friend of yours, and agree on a big random string of letters, say 100 letters long, this is going to be your key. Then you go your separate ways. 

Later you want to send your friend a message no one else can read. Your message is going to be another 100 letter sequence. So you encrypt your message in the following way. To each letter you associate the letter in the same position from your key. Then you add them together in some way, say a+a = b and a+b = c, and b+b = d, z+a = a, something like that, it doesn't really matter what it is so long as it uses all the letters. Then you can send off your string, and no one can decrypt it unless they have the key and they can do what you did. 

The reason no one can decrypt it is because for every message you want to send, there is some key that will turn it into every other possible string of letters. And since they don't know your key, they can't know what message you started with, in fact, as far as anyone else is concerned, there is an equal probability that you sent any message. That means that given the eavesdropper doesn't know your key, they can't tell if your message says 'GOFORWARDS' or 'GOBACKWARD' and both are equally likely. This kind of encryption is called a one time pad and it is perfectly secure, it can't be broken by anything. The problem is agreeing on the key in the first place. You can't reuse the keys, if you do that then things aren't perfectly secure anymore. For example, say your key was just two letters long. Then in the above GOFORWARDS and GOBACKWARD we'd be able to tell which was which, the first two encrypted letters, the GO, would be the same for both messages. But then, FORWARD has an O in it, which would be encrypted the same as the O in GO, so we would know that if the second and fourth letter are the same, we definitely don't have the message GOBACKWARD. Going on like that we see how we can deduce some information about the message if our key isn't the same length as it. 

So, this encryption, so long as you do it properly, cannot be beaten, because you don't know what the message was to begin with. Even with a quantum computer, because they're not magic, and they can't know what the original message was, or know what the key was any more than you can. 

There are two things you can do with Quantum Computers that you can't do with regular ones that help with cryptography. The first, is that there are algorithms that rely on being able to have superposition states that let you break some types of encryption much quicker than regular computers do. Most encryption used in the real world, because we can't all be sharing secret numbers all the time, uses encryption which is secure, but not absolutely perfect. This kind of encryption takes a long time to break, but breaking it is methodical. The reason it's secure is because it takes such a long time to break. These are things like RSA encryption, and these are what the article is saying the NSA is building a quantum computer to break.

The other thing you can do with a quantum system is something called quantum key distribution. That's a way of sharing a secret number over a distance, and guaranteeing that no one else can know the number. Again, this works more or less by quantum superposition. If some eavesdropper looks at the messages you're sending, then they destroy them, and you can just discard them. Quantum Key Distribution would be great, because it would theoretically be unbreakable. Since I could share a secret number with you, and as long as neither of us told anyone we could use the one time pads to share messages with each other, and no one could ever read it. 

So in a nutshell. Quantum Computers help in two ways. They can break lots of cryptosystems that are secure by virtue of taking a very long time to break. They do this using some quantum mechanical effects to speed up the algorithms needed to break those systems. This is what the NSA is trying to build. They can also help by quantum key distribution, which allows us to share secret keys that we can be certain (by the laws of physics) that no one was able to directly intercept. We can then use those keys to encrypt things. ",0,1388720275,,0,FALSE,1,ceg0ib5,t3_1u9xt6,t1_ceg0ib5,t3_1u9xt6,1431776022,7,FALSE,AskPhysics,t5_2sumo,7

As a morbidly obese person, I consider obesity to be a personal failing in the same way that alcoholism or gambling addiction are personal failings.  I hate myself for it.  I want to change.  It's not easy.

Unless they're really bad, a gambling addict or alcoholic can still be a productive member of society.  Same with an obese person (so long as it doesn't require physical labor), unless they're the kind you see on TV who can't get out of bed due to their weight.

However, alcoholism and gambling addiction (to a certain extent) don't have the obvious, outward-facing physical symptom (obesity) that food abuse does.  My father was an alcoholic for 25 years, but nobody at his work knew about it and it didn't affect his performance at his desk job.  Obesity is a very obvious, outward-facing symptom.

I don't expect to be catered to for my personal failing, but I also don't think it's appropriate to completely ostracize the obese, either.  If you're my doctor, fine, criticize me.  If you're family/friend and you're worried about me, fine, tell me.

If I barely know you and my obesity isn't personally affecting you, then yes, I expect you to kindly shut up.  If you found out I was struggling with gambling, you wouldn't make jokes about blackjack to my face or install a slot machine in the office.

There's a difference between catering to/accepting obesity, and common courtesy towards someone who is struggling to overcome their personal failings.

* believed that heterosexuality was not real, merely a social construct.

* two kinds of pedophiles; sadistic and affectionate. If mutual affection exists then he saw no problem with an 11 year old boy being in a sexual relationship with a man in his 20s or 30s.

* recommended gender reassignment for a botched circumcision, reported that the subject was a success and wrote books and papers on the subject, leading to people and the medical society understanding this like you do now

&gt;For the first thirty years after Dr. Money's initial report that the reassignment had been a success, Dr. Money's view of the malleability of gender became the dominant viewpoint among physicians and doctors, reassuring them that sexual reassignment was the correct decision in certain instances

* Cont. was a **total lie**, the subject identified as male at the age of 9-11

* leading to thousands of intersex children being assigned at birth as a matter of policy

* Is accused of the following, this is not proven but should be noted to understand what kind of man we are dealing with. 

&gt;In 2000, David(his famous ""astonishing success) and his twin brother (Brian) alleged that Dr. Money had taken numerous naked photos of the twins during their treatment and had forced them to engage in ""sexual play"" at age 7. In 2002, David's twin brother was found dead from an overdose of the drugs used to treat his schizophrenia. On 5 May 2004, shortly after being asked by his wife for a separation, Reimer committed suicide. Reimer's parents have stated that they believe Dr. Money's methodology was responsible for the deaths of both of their sons.

Seriously people need to get a deeper understanding of sex/gender. They think they are being progressive but what you are doing is literally spouting something that even the Intersex society of north America disagrees with. They take the logical, emotionally, and most humain stance on the issue. **Whatever** you think gender and sexuality are in the human race and culture.

&gt;We like to point out that what the story of David Reimer teaches us most clearly is how much people are harmed by being lied to and treated in inhumane ways. We don’t think we can ever predict, with absolute certainty, what gender identity a person will grow up to have. What we can predict with a good degree of certainty is that children who are treated with shame, secrecy, and lies will suffer at the hands of medical providers who may think they have the best of intentions and the best of theories.

The problem in the OP is NOT that his parents decided to raise him(or her, I haven't seen what they identifies as of yet) as a man. Its that they lied to them about it and shamed their feminine side.",0,1388723288,,0,1388723565,1,ceg1wui,t3_1u9x0g,t1_ceg1wui,t1_ceg17w6,1435539257,17,FALSE,AdviceAnimals,t5_2s7tt,17
TRUE,Cenodoxus,points ,11∆,"This isn't a subject that I typically write much about on Reddit, but I'll make an exception because what you wrote genuinely scared me.

**For reference, I'm a woman.** I can't speak for all women -- no one can -- but I will try to shed some light on this from the perspective of any random girl you might have run into at any New Year's Eve party on the planet.

**Context in human relationships is an inescapable element of what's actually going on:** Say you're at an office, and the 60-year old part-time cleaning woman is flirting with the 21-year old son of the boss who's just started an internship there. Probably harmless fun. Now let's change things up and say the 60-year old female boss who's recently divorced is flirting with the new 21-year old male intern who really needs this job and isn't related to anyone there. That's not harmless.

When people talk about trying to change the culture at a ""toxic"" workplace or about ""rape culture"" or anything else, this is usually what they mean. They're trying to make people aware of the social context of their actions and more respectful of what's going through the mind of a person who isn't approaching a relationship from the position of power. *Homo sapiens sapiens* is a primate with an instinctive sense of social dynamics. As with any other primate, you're acutely conscious of power when you're the one who doesn't have it. Civilization and, for that matter, democracy is about redressing this to some extent so that power is more evenly distributed in society (and Reddit is very loud on the subject of when it isn't). Feminism is about making sure that power is less sex-specific than it's historically been.

**So how does this relate to you and the girl at the party?** Let's come down from all this talk of primates and power and high-sounding ideas and examine what happened at this party. You were talking to a ""cute and intelligent"" girl. She ""strongly hinted she didn't want to do anything physical with a guy."" Not long afterwards, you pulled her onto your lap without asking her permission: ""She didn't resist and seemed okay with it, even after I let go."" So you were also holding onto her for a time.

This is where alarm bells went off for me. I don't blame you for not stopping to think that maybe she *wasn't* okay with it just because she didn't say something, or take the more direct route of belting you across the chops, and you're 23 years old and new to this whole game and getting dating advice from the one of the worst places on the planet to get it, but ...

Here it comes ...

*The dreaded context*.

**You are bigger, stronger, and faster than she is. You might forget this or not think about it most of the time, but women are ALWAYS aware of it.** This is the first truth and underlying principle of all male/female interaction. When you know each other, and more particularly when you're in a relationship, it's fun or helpful or even a source of amusement. When you don't know each other, it's a potential danger. Women usually learn this fear in their early teens or when they start developing. I learned it at 14 and that's pretty standard.

Now, there isn't a rapist lurking around every corner. Most streets are safe even in the dark. Most people are good and trustworthy. But not all of them are, and sooner or later the law of averages kicks in and then you find yourself in a situation where vigilance is the only thing standing between you and the dark, scary part of being smaller and slower and weaker than men. If you're lucky or simply observant, life tossed you little signs that say, ""This is dangerous, get out get out GET OUT,"" or ""This person is someone I should not be around."" 

One of the clearest you can get is when you say ""No"" and the guy doesn't care.

If a guy pulls me into his lap even after I've ""strongly hinted"" that I don't want to be touched (and really, is that so much to ask? Is the bar that low?), my immediate reaction is probably going to be surprise and a bit of panic over the incredibly awkward situation I'm now in. Then my brain is finally going to calm down enough to run through the following options:

 - **Option #1: I can try to remove myself:** What if he pulls me back? He's stronger than I am and can do this easily. What if he interprets it as playing hard to get and we get into what he sees a playful wrestling match?
 - **Option #2: I quietly say I don't appreciate being touched:** Well, the night's shot now. You'll trash me to your friends in order to salvage your ego and probably say that I was leading you on. How far is this gossip going to spread and who's going to believe it? I don't know. Great, I get to worry about that now.
 - **Option #3: I can cause a scene:** Now I look like a bitch to everyone who wasn't paying attention and get to feel bad about that. Your friends think all you wanted was to talk to a girl and the crazy bitch called you a creeper. And then I seethe inside; I didn't want to be fucking touched at all and said it!
 - **Option #4: Or I can just sit there and deal with it:** Many, if not most, young women will select this option, and I have to admit it might happen to me too. I would have been too surprised at first to react, and then I would have run through my list of extremely unappealing options, and very unhappily settled on #4. That's not because I actually like #4, but it won't pit me physically against someone who can overcome me easily, and it's the most drama-free option I can take, but I would have resolved inwardly NEVER to be around you again. 

Why?

*Because I said ""No"" to you and it meant nothing*.

Let me repeat that in a form more relevant to what happened at this party:

*She said no and you didn't feel obligated to respect that.*

**So how does this relate to /r/TheRedPill?** Because under the best of circumstances, you're going to wind up ""pulling"" women who are vulnerable to the manipulation that /r/TheRedPill espouses, or women who are too afraid to speak up when something bothers them. And, having experienced success with those ""techniques,"" that is how you will train yourself to approach women in the future. The more mentally and emotionally mature women who don't find unwanted physical contact or ""negging"" charming or roguish will have nothing to do with you. Under the worst of circumstances, you could wind up doing irreparable damage to your reputation and/or dating life by trying this stuff at the wrong place and the wrong time. Often there's a damn thin line between textbook Red Pill efforts and Standard Issue Creepy Guy behavior.

As /u/sevenbitbyte said in [an excellent comment above](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1u9994/starting_to_think_the_red_pill_philosophy_will/cefwlhw), what the /r/TheRedPill is fundamentally missing is a sense of empathy.

&gt;It would have been easy for her to ""go to the bathroom"" or something; I've personally seen a million ways that a girl can excuse herself from a bad situation. I'm fairly certain she was okay with me touching her in a very flirty way.

Please.

**EDIT(2):** Red Pill folks, as much as I appreciate [your obvious concern for my mental health](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1uhqgt/that_rbestof_post/), this isn't about hating men or trying to make their lives even harder. I don't hate men. The problems you describe for men on the dating circuit are very real. I'm trying to tell you why an action that you don't see as sinister might be perceived as such by someone who can't read your mind, and why so many women feel creeped-on and unsafe when someone attempts to use TRP ""strategy"" on them. If you really want to know how it feels to be a target, talk to women and not each other.

There are a lot of women in this thread and others around Reddit who've written about experiences like this. We're trying to tell you something, and honestly, it feels shitty to have people yell, ""Feminism!"" or ""Don't say hello to girls or they'll scream rape!"" and then walk away convinced that we're secretly plotting your downfall. Having a crappy time in the dating world is not a zero-sum situation in which one of the two sexes has amassed so many horrible experiences that the other never has any.

TRUE,ohhimark108,,,"Lot of great questions. Some of these are subject to personal interpretation.

We learn very subtly throughout the series that there are pockets of energy all over the world. Bernard takes Rose to Australia for one of those energy spots. There is a similar pocket of energy under the Lamp Post station in LA, probably another one in Tunisia. In ""316"", Eloise says that all of these energy spots all over the world are linked. The island is the *source* of that electromagnetic energy. On the other side of the equation, Jacob knows MIB is bound to that same electromagnetism, and that MIB will try to ""turn off the light"" to fulfill his goal of escaping the island. If MIB is successful, the light will go out all over the world, and it would probably be a very bad thing judging from what happened to the island after the light went out there.

When Juliet said ""it worked"" she wasn't talking about the nuke. Miles was actually reading her final thoughts as her consciousness transferred over to the ""afterlife."" She was talking about the vending machine Sawyer needed to unplug to get the candy, which is itself a metaphor for the mechanics of unplugging the island. The Incident is left ambiguous. It has never been confirmed whether or not the bomb actually detonated. The afterlife may be a result of it, but who is to say. Really up to personal belief.

This last question is pretty intense. The simplest answer is that the Others were just people. They all ended up on the island somehow, in a crash, or invited, or they made a deal with Jacob, etc. They certainly did feel it was their duty to protect the island, but Jacob never put them up to that. Most of them sided with MIB out of fear. Most of them had probably never seen Jacob, and now he's dead, and this person is offering them an ultimatum. It's a test of faith. The lists were how Jacob would communicate with the Others indirectly without telling them specifically what to do. Jacob and Richard would meet at the cabin, and Richard would bring the lists to the leader to do what they wanted with it. It's likely Ben inserted some of his own lists in there and said they were from Jacob. Jacob didn't not just appear to Ben, he was completely hands off. Jacob's goal was to prove the innate goodness in humanity, but he couldn't do that if he had to direct them. They had to have a choice for it to matter. Jacob couldn't tell Ben what to do because Ben was being tested.",0,1388723860,,0,1388728944,1,ceg25ub,t3_1ua6bk,t1_ceg25ub,t3_1ua6bk,1431776800,46,FALSE,lost,t5_2qhag,46

Do you know who couldn't use the swimming pools and brothels? The inmates? The SS guards could but the inmates could not. 

&gt;even allowed to print their own money. In fact you can always buy some of this money off eBay

Well no they didn't print their own money. They were given ""money"" for internal usage (which was extremely limited) after being forced to sell their property for very low prices. It was also only issued in very few camps and certain ghettos.

&gt;Keep in mind that the World Jewish Congress declared economic war on Germany in 1933.

Wait are you complaining that Jews were urged to boycott the goods of a country who viewed them as subhuman scum? Are you not at all surprised by this? Nope, you're a piece of shit so you will blame the holocaust on the Jews (not the rampant and obvious anti-semitisim of the Nazis).

&gt;Also, putting people in gas chambers was a myth however the ovens were legitimate. 

What? This is too ridiculous a claim to even debunk.

&gt; The water table at Auschwitz for example was too high for burial thus bodies had to be incinerated.

Never heard this claim before. I don't really get your point. 

&gt;This is still a common practice today yet no one is crying war crimes over it. 

Nobody is crying war crimes about it because burning bodies wasn't the problem, the problem is the murder of 11 million people in camps and millions more by SS death squads. 

&gt;My point is that there's two sides to every story and the US propaganda/education system only provides one when it comes to WWII.

Because there is only one side of the story when it comes to the holocaust. This isn't politics, there isn't a debate about this. There is a single widely accepted fact by historians. That the holocaust was the murder of over 10 million people in death camps by the Nazi regime. 

In summary you are at best an idiot who has not looked up anything. At worst you are racist anti-semitic scum and should really go die in a fire. I hate holocaust deniers more than anything else on the internet, you are a cancer and people like you will be responsible for the murder of millions because of racism if you are not shut down.

Then it's Pete, Pete is always happy, he has a huge grin on his face every night, his friendly smile, I like his positivism.

I don't know who is she but every time He talks about her, his eyes get brighter, I think He loves her. We play tea and read books. When I get sleepy, Mary tugs me in bed and tells me they'll come back tomorrow night, before I close my eyes He says goodnight.

""I know you're under the bed"" The man says as friendly as possible but he's far from being a friend. Mary appears next to me, she says I have to be quite. The man is about to find me, when He throws my lamp at him. The man curses. 

Mummy would be mad at him for saying those words. Bob jumps at him and the man screams, the man tries to fight with Bob but Pete joins him, smiling like I've never seen before. The man screams in terror trying to fight them. He grabs the sharp pieces of my broken lamp and before I get to see what he's about to do. Mary tells me to look at her, she tells me about how pretty my hair is and how she's going to teach me how to braid it. 

I can only hear her calm voice and the screams of the man. When mummy is in my room, my friends disappear,she yells asking where am I. I tell her I'm under the bed hiding from the man. When I see him, he's all red. I think it's blood. Mummy calls the police. I'm in the living room alone while my mom is talking to them in the kitchen. 

My friends appear in front of me. I tell them thank you for protecting me from the man. Mary tells me they need to protect other child. I get really sad, I don't want them to leave. I can see my friends are sad too. They leave and I'm alone. Why do they think they're evil? They're not.

TRUE,nozicky,,,"I wouldn't dodge from down low out of a square because it's too easy for the defender to just overplay your topside hand. You're too 1 dimensional as a dodger since you have a hard time getting to the other side of the net. So here is a dodge from X out of a diamond with a triangle rotation similar to what you would do in a 2-3-1. 

http://i.imgur.com/BoDlJ1o.png

This gets a bit tricky because if you dodge at the attack on the wing, the middie has to cover the endline. It can be really tough for 5/6 grade kids to have the lacrosse IQ to be able to handle a temporary invert situation like that. 

An alternative is to start from a ""Y"" set and dodge into a diamond that will always avoid the invert.

The issue with this can be setting it up. A 3 man perimeter isn't really ideal for moving the ball around and it can be really tough with 5/6 graders to get them to be able to think ahead enough to plan to move into this formation without making it very, very obvious that the kid with the ball at X is about to dodge.

You know your kids much better than I do, so you'll have an idea of what they can handle.

You can't initially go in, because he doesn't want some random guy in his mansion.. so you do the only logical thing and get a fancy dress for Aeris.. and for yourself. Plus a wig, a tiara, and perfume. Based on a few choices, you can get different levels of things (good perfume, bad perfume, gold/silver tiaras, things along those lines). Once you have all that, you can go inside.

You find Tifa inside and find out she wants to be picked so she can interrogate Don about something. Around that point, it's time for him to choose so the three of you go up to his room.

TRUE,JJatt,asia,Sikh History | Colonial India,"Sweet find. If you are indeed a fan of history I would look into preserving that letter asap. It has some very interesting history connected to it. Simply put, this letter was sent to dissuade Sikh soldiers from joining the Azad Hind Fauj, the Free India Army. And promised them safe return and their old post back if they did. 


Now for some context. World War 2 was a difficult situation for India and Indians. To begin with the population was starting to have enough of Indian Soldiers fighting in foreign wars. In WW1 alone India lost over 70,000 troops. The highest of not only all the British colonies, but any colony or non-European nation that fought in that war. There was also a general ""Awaking"" occurring in many parts of India. The Socialists in Punjab were outlining the atrocities committed by the British, and the humiliation that Indians were subjugated to by a foreign power. This struggle culminated when the crown hung Bhagat Singh. Gandhi's peaceful protests were garnering cross Indian attention. Folks who were not as far extreme to join the ranks of the socialists, but were for freedom, now had a new avenue of political power they can use. As you can see the Indian conscious is rising. 

Now here comes World War 2 and the British begin to recruit heavily. The Sikhs were always at the top of the recruitment list next to the Gurkhas and Muslim Jatts, due to an outdated oriental Martial Race system where the British Mandated the heaviest of recruitment fall from the so called ""Martial Races"" who were seen to be better fit for combat due to their race and culture. These soldiers would be given incentives to join such as higher pay, quicker promotions, and retirement gifts of land and livestock. Young Indian men were desperate for these jobs though, even with their disillusion of the Empire and Crown. Thy had no choice, India was starving.

Not many people know this but the British orchestrated a mass and systematic starvation of the Indian people during World War 2. The biggest one occurring in Bengal where even the most conservative estimates put he death toll at 1.5 million people. The British policy at the time was very clear, they wanted to feed their soldiers above all. When Winston Churchill was asked about this famine he remarked ""The famine was their own fault, for breeding like rabbits."" This is also one of the more conservative things he had said. It went as far as to block countries like the US and Australia from sending aid to India during this era of famine. The reason is unknown, but in Madhusree Mukerjee's  Churchill's Secret War, she outlines that this famine cause the number of recruits to jump up and caused the biggest ""volunteer"" army in world war 2. 


This is where the Azad Hind Fauj comes into play. The Axis powers, mainly Japan, had this policy it set out early on the course of the war. It wanted to promote and strengthen Asia and asians as a people. After Japan joined the Axis powers and started the Pacific Theater it's main goal was to start to occupy European Colonies in the Pacific and Asia. Here they would spread propaganda of wanting to strengthen the occupied countries and fight out European influence, they would make it appear as if Japan was to be this Big Asian Brother who would help the nation achieve freedom, under Japan of course. And it worked. The people were tierd of being subjugated by white men from far away, they rose up and helped the Japanese. All over the Pacific Japanese-Asian led resistance forces were popping up. Now India is a little different here. India had already a history of struggle and Independence movements. There were many freedom leaders already living in exile who had clout. The biggest player being Subash C. Bose. He happened to find his way to germany and actually meet with Hitler. There he had convinced the Nazis to let him and his fellow expat Indians ally with the Axis powers and help create an army. He was granted permission and traveled to Japan via U-Boat to represnt Azad(free) India in the Pacific theater. The Japanese gave him a few islands and parts of captured Brumese India, money, and weapons. Here he began to train his forces of folks who were exiled or left India to fight for freedom, interestingly enough it was one of the only players involved aside from Nazi Germany and the Soviets who allowed women to fill combat roles. But the numbers still weren't good and Bose's army needed more people. 

Here's where the POW's come into play. Japan and Indian forces were heavily involved in the Pacific theater fighting for control of South East Asia. This is where most of the British-Indian troops were sent and where the most Indian POW's were taken. These POW's were given an opportunity by the Axis. They could either die in the POW Camps, or fight for their countries liberation. I assume from this letter they were also told the British would kill/imprison them if they escaped and made it back, but I have no other sources to confirm this. So it's easy to see why the captured POW's would choose to enlist in the Azad Hind Army.

The reason Sikhs were one of the bigger forces to jump ship was due to Punjab being a hotbed of resistance. Many Sikhs had family member who were freedom fighters, or remember the Massacre of Amritsar(where British troops killed Innocent Punjabis at a gathering in cold blood, right next to a holy shrine) pretty well. But this letter has some castist, racial undertones as well. Like I stated earlier the Sikhs were a Martial RAce. So they were more valuable to the British. Sikhs were the ones who held most the officer positions. And it's interesting to see that put into practice in this letter. 


I hope I answered your question and I thank you for sharing this letter. I'd love it if you'd be able to scan it. I'll list some sources below if you'd like some additional reading.

TRUE,ProgramMax,,,"Hello. I'm the guy working on the Android app.
Sorry you're having frustrations with it.

The reason your stream is not in the watch now tab is sort of two-fold. But let me first explain why there are those two tabs:

The ""Watch Now"" tab lists streams that are live which your phone can play.

The ""All Results"" tab then is the list of all live streams, whether your phone can play them or not. That is why clicking it suggests you go to the list of playable streams.

Sorry if that wasn't clear.


Now then, the reason you are unable to watch your stream on your device is because it cannot be played on your device. So the real solution to this problem isn't changing the app...it is changing your stream so it can be played on mobile devices. :)

Remember earlier I said the problem is sort of two-fold? One solution is to make your stream viewable on mobile devices. The other solution is to have enough viewers that you gain our transcodes. We transcode the top X-many streams (that X number changes over time). At different times of the day it becomes easier or harder to pass that X limit. And there are other small details involved. I'm generalizing. But I've seen times of the day where 2 viewers gave people transcodes. If you're at prime time, you'll need many more than 2 viewers.

Anyway, the more immediate solution would be to fix your stream to make it viewable.

You know the Twitch Dashboard page that tells you if your stream is Excellent or Good or whatever the different configuration qualities are? First, make sure you have Excellent. But then, you may be broadcasting at the h264 profile High, which not all mobile devices support. You should instead be broadcasting on Main. If you do that, the latest version of the Android app will play your stream.

I'm not sure how to change it from High to Main on XSplit. I couldn't find the profile setting. I think someone once told me it defaults to Main.

For OBS, go to Settings -&gt; Settings -&gt; Advanced -&gt; x264 Encoding Profile.

Its bizarre because supposedly science should be much harder to understand yet even complex topics are easy to find. Yet simple two step social science topics are literally obscured on the internet by people seeing one statistic and going ""omg, the courts hate men!"" And yes, this tips in other directions too, women salary statistics are way, way oversimplified than they are looked at in the classroom. Without further adieu:

The big one that established the paradigm that if you ask for it, you are far more likely to get it than MRAs assert:

Though it is true that women are far more likely to be awarded custody, they are also far more likely to ask for it in the first place. To establish bias, one must show (at the very minimum) that equally qualified fathers who request custody are denied more than half of the time, and here the data prove inconvenient. Courts can't be expected to award what they're not asked to. *It turns out that fathers who ask for custody (and don't give up) are very likely to get either sole or joint custody:*

Bemiller, Michelle. (2008). When Battered Mothers Lose Custody: A Qualitative Study of Abuse at Home and in the Courts. Journal of Child Custody, 5(3/4), 228-255. 

The following study adds to research that examines child custody cases involving a history of interpersonal violence. This study contributes to past research by providing qualitative accounts of women's experiences with intimate partner violence prior to custody loss, institutional abuse at the hands of the family court, and abuse experienced after custody loss. Data come from a convenience sample of 16 noncustodial mothers from northeastern Ohio. Findings support past research, which finds corruption, denial of due process, and gender bias in the family court system.

Even if a woman is awarded custody by a court, a court will generally determine that it is in the ""best interests of the child"" for the ex-partner to be awarded access. According to the results of one study, in nearly every case, and eclipsing virtually all other factors, access of the non-custodial parent (usually the father) was considered paramount to the ""best interests of the child"". This was irrespective of the quality or regularity of his parenting. 

Chesler, P. (1991, 1986). Mothers on Trial: The Battle for Children and Custody. NY: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, Publishers.

Phyllis Chesler interviewed 60 mothers involved in a custody dispute and found that fathers who contest custody are more likely than their wives to win (p. 65). In 82% of the disputed custody cases fathers achieved sole custody despite the fact that only 13% had been involved in child care activities prior to divorce (p. 79 tbl. 5). Moreover, 59% of fathers who won custody litigation had abused their wives, and 50% of fathers who obtained custody through private negotiations had abused their wives (p. 80 tbl. 6).

TRUE,Scarbane,,,"Considering a multitude of factors (namely the huge productivity increases from automation and technology over the past 50 years), the minimum wage and/or social safety net in place for low and lower-middle income Americans needs to be a lot more robust.

One of the biggest complaints I hear from 1% apologists is that increasing minimum wage or expanding programs like Medicare, disability welfare, and general welfare is not feasible. On the contrary, *it is feasible* - but large corporations and wealthy families, like the Waltons, really like having huge sums of cash. It gives them enormous power to invest in *their* interests. They can buy out smaller companies with fresh ideas, they can buy politicians that will vote the way they want them to. With all of that money, even when it's just sitting in vaults or tied up in investments, they can keep up a facade that America *needs them*, that America's fiber and being is tied up in the never-ending race for profit.

Frankly, America's best interests are not at heart. There's no accountability with many large corporations, and even less accountability with rich families. Right now we don't have accountability when we need it most. Groups like the NSA and the TSA have made it their mission to label anyone who would dare try to expose corporate corruption or tax evasion as conspiracy theorists or terrorists. 

None of it matters because we'd rather just go back to playing the games we bought in the Steam sale. We'd rather just worry about work, because the rat race never stops. We'd rather just help our daughters plan her upcoming wedding. We'd rather just focus on school, because we have that big test to study for tomorrow. We'd rather just worry about our house selling, finally.

I would say ""let's organize a protest"", but what good will that do? Half of America thinks that things are peachy, and the other half thinks that things are ""fixin' to be peachy come next election.""

German Civil War breaks out, USSR intervenes.  The UK wants to intervene, but Communism had huge support among the French people and intellectuals at the time, and the UK refuses to go alone.

The result is an alternate history where all of continental Europe is under the Iron Curtain.   Without the EEC, the trade with the continent, the UK also suffers economically and undergoes a communist revolution.    Since the entire developed world has gone Communist, support for Communism builds in the US, and the result is a reactionary police-state.   The entire world becomes totalitarian. 

If Hitler dies at some point after becoming Fuhrer but before the war and the Holocaust, Nazism as an ideology is never discredited.   It's entirely possible without Hitler, Nazi Germany doesn't open hostilities with the USSR, and the continues on for decades.   Or, even after Nazi Germany's defeat, the Nazi party continues to exist as a strong political force in Germany because since Hitler dies before the fall of Nazism, Neo-Nazis can go around saying things about how the Nazis went astray, and how Hitler wouldn't have let the Holocaust happen, etc.  As an ideology, Nazism needs to die discredited with Hitler.

Usually if a person's native tongue is Spanish, I'd speak to them in Spanish to make them feel comfortable with me, but yet days I feel like speaking English so that they can practice it. F%ck me right?

So I decided I'd order in English. I get to the counter, a Latino man standing behind it with an accent difficult to understand, and I order the same thing I always order at Subway, but this time bacon was just calling my name, so I asked the guy how much it'd cost to add bacon:

Subway man: ""escuse me?""
Me: ""How much more does it cost to add bacon?""
Subway man: ""oh ok, one second plea?
Subway man: ""oye Carlos, este pendejo quiere bacon, cuanto cuesta?""  (Translation: ""Carlos, this stupid guy wants bacon, how much is it?)

Yet, he had the audacity to laugh about it too. Little satan on my left shoulder was telling me to tell him off in spanish and run off, but little god was telling me to keep my calm. Anyways, I kept my cool and decided to delay my attack just a couple of minutes. Waited 30 seconds for my sandwich to come out, and when he got to the part where he asks me what vegetables I wanted, bam, with an evil grin on my face I went with, ""Si, por favor me das lechuga, hitomates, pepinos, mayonesa..."" you get the point.

Also, what type of setup are you looking to create with 2 SSDs? Raid 0 provides insane performance at the cost of having no backup readily available (keep in mind your array will be limited to 256 GB ((128 x 2 = 256))). Raid 0 has minimal gaming performance improvement though, as Raid 0 really only provides insane performance for applications such as 3D Modeling software and Photoshop.

First generation SSD controllers were known to have some compatibility issues, but I'm fairly certain controller incompatibility is very rare with the new generation of SSDs you have. Also, keep in mind that the red SATA ports on your mobo are 6GB/s, whilst the gray are 3GB/s. 6GB/s controller is from Intel, so you shouldn't encounter any firmware issues.

When you install Win7 you can choose which drive to install the OS to (As /u/dracho mentioned), which will partition 100mb for the WRE (Windows Recovery Environment), as well as some other files before installing. I also recommend disconnecting ANY storage devices with a Windows OS, as Windows boot files may be accidentally written to the other storage device. Adding another SSD once you have installed your OS may not auto-format the added SSD. Sometimes you have to do it manually ; Start &gt; Right-click ""Computer"" &gt; ""Manage"" &gt; Click ""Disk Management"" &gt; Find your non-OS SSD and click on it &gt; Click ""Format"". (If that made no sense, here's a [link](http://pcsupport.about.com/od/windows7/ht/format-hard-drive-windows-7.htm).

If you encounter your Win7 freezing during installation, this could be because hot swapping is disabled in your BIOS, and should be set accordingly. Once your OS is installed, disable hot swapping in your BIOS. If you BSOD after allowing hot swapping, make sure your SSD has a dedicated power cable to prevent that from happening.

After you get your OS installed, be sure to check out the [OCZ Toolbox](http://ocz.com/consumer/download/firmware) to get the latest firmware installed for your 128GB HDD, TRIM is good for prolonging SSD stability over time, as well as the [Samsung 840 Evo Page](http://www.samsung.com/global/business/semiconductor/samsungssd/downloads.html).

The most unexpected things happen, and suddenly your life takes a huge turn and changes completely.   
Having never wanted children, and using birth control and condoms, I found myself pregnant. I didn't find out until I was over 18 weeks pregnant, which in hindsight, was a good thing for me because I would have had an abortion if I had found out earlier. I had been depressed for many years, and felt empty and useless. But suddenly, I had a reason to stick around. I know this sounds ridiculous and asinine. My life is now exhausting. As a single mother with a toddler, I never get to go out, never get a break, and rarely get more than a few hours of sleep. But I am happy at the end of the day, something which I'd never thought I could be. If someone had told me that I should have a kid, I would have declared them crazy and told them to fuck off. But that's where my life led me, and it turned out to be the best thing that ever happened to me. I'm not suggesting to have a child. I actually wouldn't recommend having kids to anyone! But I'm just saying, you don't know what is around the corner. Don't fold your hand before you see what the river card is.

TRUE,Das_Mime,,,"Tolkien is unquestionably the most influential figure in high fantasy, and I think it is not unreasonable to say that he and C.S. Lewis were the originators of the subgenre. The Chronicles of Narnia and The Lord of the Rings were both published during the mid-1950s. Earlier in their respective literary careers, Hobbit was published in 1937 and Perelandra in 1938, the former was not yet the fully-developed high fantasy of Lord of the Rings and the latter would be better described as science fiction. Tolkien and Lewis were good friends, of course, and often discussed their writings with each other.

The roots of Tolkien's works lie primarily in medieval writings, especially Anglo-Saxon poetry and Norse epics like Beowulf and the [Volsung Saga](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C3%B6lsunga_saga). Influences from farther afield, including the Finnish national epic the [*Kalevala*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalevala), show up from time to time in his writings as well. Tolkien was, of course, a professor of Anglo-Saxon (and later of English language &amp; literature) at Oxford, and was interested in poetry and languages since at least his late teenage years. In addition to being one of the all-time best selling authors in human history, he was an accomplished linguist, literary critic, and translator. The Book of Jonah in the Jerusalem Bible was translated by Tolkien, he made a complete translation of Beowulf as well as a highly influential lecture on it entitled [*Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics*](http://www.english.uga.edu/~jdmevans/Personal/JRRT1936.pdf), he did etymologies of Germanic W words for the Oxford English Dictionary, he wrote a vocabulary of Middle English, and he published translations of three Middle English poems: [*Sir Gawain and the Green Knight*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Gawain_and_the_Green_Knight), [*Pearl*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_(poem\)), and [*Sir Orfeo*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Orfeo). One particularly interesting aspect of Tolkien's writings, from a meta-literary perspective is that they are framed as a collection of writings which he discovered and translated from Elvish (Silmarillion and related works) and the Common Tongue of Middle Earth (the Red Book of Westmarch, written by Bilbo and Frodo-- the former of whom translated some Elvish source material for use in the book). Truly an irrepressible enthusiasm for philology. Also, if you read Lord of the Rings out loud to yourself, you will find many examples where Tolkien wrote sentences that pretty much could have been lines of [alliterative verse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliterative_verse), the style of Old and Middle English that many poems were written in, including Sir Gawain &amp; the Green Knight, Pearl, and Sir Orfeo.

Tolkien believed the world suffered from disenchantment: that along with the modernization of the Industrial and Victorian eras had come a reduced sense of wonder at the world, and a diminished willingness to believe in the fantastic and the terrible. In his essay, [*On Fairy-Stories*](http://public.callutheran.edu/~brint/Arts/Tolkien.pdf) (seriously, read it, it's great), he explained his views on faery-stories and the importance of fantasy and mythology. He felt that they had been tamed, that the connotation of ""fairy"" (he often used the spelling ""Faery"" or ""Faerie""--the spelling was important to him, as a discriminating philologist) had become domesticated and defanged, something you would meet in your garden rather than a dark forest, something adorable rather than something which should make you tremble. He felt that such stories described the world on a spiritual plane in a way that mundane stories about the real world could not.

While at secondary school in the early 1910s, Tolkien and his three closest friends (Rob Gilson, G.B. Smith, and Christopher Wiseman) formed a private club they called the Tea Club and Barrovian Society, or TCBS for short. They talked about many things, including philology and poetry, which they also wrote and read for each other. After graduating from the boarding school, they remained in contact and visited each other. All of them considered the TCBS to be the center of their intellectual lives. It was during this period and his subsequent university education at Oxford that the seeds of his world began to grow. In 1914, he wrote a poem called *The Voyage of Eärendel the Evening Star* (published in the Book of Lost Tales 2), which later evolved into the culminating episode of the *Quenta Silmarillion*. It was based on a line of Anglo-Saxon poetry by [Cynewulf](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynewulf). Tolkien later wrote that the name Earendil struck him as one that he could write stories about.

His influence on fantasy is profound-- anything which has Orcs in it owes him for that invention, and anything with Elves or Dwarves (although both spellings exist prior to Tolkien, he is largely responsible for the thorough dominance of Dwarves and Dwarven rather than dwarfs and dwarfish) very probably owes him as well, since neither of those mythical beings had yet taken the well-defined shape that is present in Tolkien. Elves and Dwarves were ideas present in Norse/Germanic mythology, but their physical descriptions were generally quite vague or indeterminate, and ""elfs"" in particular could denote a wide variety of concepts of mythological beings, from frolicsome gnomes (which one can see in The Hobbit as well as some of Tolkien's earlier writing) to wicked spirits which are responsible for causing illnesses (a view represented in late medieval Britain). To [Snorri Sturluson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snorri_Sturluson), the medieval Icelandic writer, dwarfs were dark-elves and light elves were what we might think of. In many cases both dwarfs and elves were thought of as simply beings which populated the unknown world on the periphery of human realms, hiding in mountain caves or deep forests, sometimes practically as animistic spirits, and rarely as the magnificent, ancient civilizations that Tolkien envisioned. Any time you see a representation of invariably bearded dwarves (which, let's be honest, is any time you see dwarves), you're seeing Tolkien's influence. Elves being the noble, cultured, ancient elder race is also attributable to Tolkien-- even in situations like the game Dragon Age, which another poster mentioned, where elves are a marginalized, formerly enslaved people, they were once much more powerful than humans. That game tries to buck a lot of standard high fantasy tropes (drawing on G.R.R. Martin's work in part), but the key point is that it still existed within a context where it doesn't even make sense to the player to use the word ""elves"" if they're not going to be a noble ancient race. Authors like Rothfuss and Martin have specifically said that they're trying to write something in high fantasy that *isn't* a rehash of Tolkien. I'm deeply sorry for the 20-year-rule violations, but the magnitude of Tolkien's influence is shown by the fact that until the last 20 years or so there were not many fantasy authors making a serious effort to do something wholly apart from Tolkien. Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series had the first installment published in 1990 and was still clearly laden with Tolkien.

After graduating from Oxford in 1915, Tolkien proposed to Edith Mary Bratt, married her in early 1916, and in the summer of 1916 shipped off to serve as a signals officer in the Great War that was then raging on the mainland-- a parting which caused both of them great distress, but it was just not very socially acceptable for a young, able-bodied man to refuse to serve in the war. He wrote the poem *Kortirion Among the Trees* while in a training camp in Britain in 1915-- Kortirion would later become the Elvish city on the isle of Tirion lying off the coast of Valinor. Besides disease and hostile shells, one of the chief dangers of the trenches was boredom. Tolkien's imagination had all the time it desired, and though it was nearly impossible to do any serious writing in the trenches, Tolkien nonetheless jotted down many an idea, which he would often expand upon during his time back from the trenches. ""You might scribble something on the back of an envelope and shove it in your back pocket, but that's all. You couldn't write.. you'd be crouching down among flies and filth."" It was during this period that he first began to dream up the two languages that would become the Elvish languages [Quenya](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quenya) (which he worked on first) and [Sindarin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sindarin) (which came later, in 1917, as a derivative of Quenya). Earlier in his life he had played with inventing languages, but never so thoroughly (nor with such a grasp of linguistic change) as during the period immediately after WWI. His history of Arda (the world which includes Middle-Earth) began in part as an explanation of the historical migrations of the Elves that led to the linguistic relationship between Quenya and Sindarin. The other three members of the TCBS were aleady serving in WWI by the time Tolkien joined, and they stayed in correspondence with each other regularly, writing poetry to fill their time. Rob Gilson died in the first days of the Somme offensive, which weighed heavily on the surviving three. Also at the Somme, Tolkien witnessed the advent of the tank, which made a great impression upon him, serving as inspiration for the description of Balrogs and dragons overrunning the walls of the Elvish city of Gondolin. He began writing *The Fall of Gondolin*, the first prose story about Middle-Earth in 1917 on the back of some military sheet music. The poems he had written prior to that point tended to become incorporated into the legendarium later on, but did not begin as poems about this other world.

TRUE,The_Year_of_Glad,,,"I think I've mentioned this in a similar thread in the past, but I'm going to go with the Bath School disaster. It happened in Michigan in 1927, and to this day it's still the deadliest mass killing in an American school.

The story starts with a 54-year-old farmer named Andrew Kehoe. Kehoe was by all accounts a frugal (some would say stingy) man, and even though he wasn't well-liked by his neighbors, his reputation for thrift allowed him to be elected as treasurer of the Bath County school board, and for a brief time as the township's clerk as well. He lost a 1926 election for the clerk position, however, after running on a campaign that emphasized low property taxes, and at that point he seems to have decided that he would perform an act of revenge against the citizens who had made it possible for the government to take away his hard-earned money.

Starting that August, he gradually purchased several hundred pounds of both dynamite and a military surplus explosive called pyrotol, buying small quantities at numerous stores in the surrounding area in order to avoid suspicion. Under the guise of performing electrical work for the school district, he concealed these explosives inside the brick schoolhouse that held all of the district's children. His preparations were so involved that he entirely stopped working on his farm, and paying his mortgage. That December, he also purchased a rifle.

In May of 1927, Kehoe put his plan into action. He killed his wife, who was terminally ill with tuberculosis and had just been discharged from the hospital, and concealed her body inside a wheelbarrow in his farm's chicken coop, then surrounded it with all of his money and other earthly valuables, in order that they could be destroyed together. He then set about systematically sabotaging everything on his farm: cutting the wire on all his fences to render it unusable, killing the trees that shaded it, slicing through all of his grape vines at the root and then wiring the stems back into place so that nothing would seem amiss to a casual observer, and placing massive firebombs inside every structure on the farm. He also used wire restraints to hobble the legs of his two horses inside his barn, to prevent them from escaping from it once the bombs went off, and filled his truck with large quantities of explosives and metal shrapnel. Finally, he started a fire inside his home, and when the volunteer fire brigade arrived, he rode off and told them that they should leave, as they were his friends and they would soon be needed at the school.

At 8:45 that morning, fifteen minutes after the start of classes, an alarm clock that Kehoe had rigged as a detonator triggered the explosives he had concealed inside the north wing of the schoolhouse. A similar device in the south wing failed to activate, but the result of the one successful explosion was more than bad enough. In an instant, the entire north wing of the schoolhouse lifted several feet into the air, and community members miles away were jostled by the shockwave. Burning children were thrown through the windows of their classrooms, and the roof collapsed on top of those still inside. A local resident named Monte Ellsworth who arrived at the scene shortly thereafter described it thus: ""There was a pile of children of about five or six under the roof and some of them had arms sticking out, some had legs, and some just their heads sticking out. They were unrecognizable because they were covered with dust, plaster, and blood. There were not enough of us to move the roof.""

The efforts of more than a hundred frantic men were not enough to lift the roof off of the children, so Ellsworth volunteered to go home to his farm and get a thick rope that could be used to drag it off of them. On his way there, he passed his neighbor Kehoe on road. Kehoe favored him with a big smile and a cheerful wave.

When Kehoe arrived at the scene, he beckoned the school superintendent (whom he hated) over to his carriage. Witnesses saw the two struggling over Kehoe's gun, and then Kehoe fired a shot that triggered the bomb inside his carriage, spraying shrapnel into the crowd of rescuers and instantly killing both himself and his rival.

Eventually, the townspeople were able to clear enough of the wreckage to remove and treat all of the children who were still alive. They also discovered the second timer, and *the more than 500 pounds of explosives* that it was meant to detonate. You can see a picture of them [here](http://i.imgur.com/9zFP8NE.jpg).

In total, Kehoe killed 43 people that day: his wife, the superintendent, four bystanders who were too close to the truck bomb (including an eight-year-old boy who had escaped from the first explosion), and 38 people who had been inside the school, all but two of whom were children between the ages of seven and fourteen. 58 others were seriously injured. Kehoe's body was claimed by his sister, and secretly buried in an unmarked grave. The only explanation he left behind was a sign wired to a fence post at his farm - it read, ""Criminals are made, not born.""

Whenever I think about the Bath School disaster, I'm always taken aback by Kehoe's behavior. It's one thing to just snap in anger - while that's terrible, it's at least something you can understand on one level or another. But for more than half a year, Kehoe lived among these people, made small talk with them, and tipped his hat in the street, knowing that soon he would do his best to take all their children from them in one terrible morning of blood and fire. And as if that weren't enough, the sheer spite on display in every detail of his actions is just breathtaking. He went well out of his way to ensure that nothing he left behind would be of any use to anyone from that point forward. The horses didn't tax his land, but because someone might ride them after he was gone, they had to die. The vines didn't hurt his pride, but because they might nourish someone after he was gone, they had to die. He methodically sowed everything in his life with salt, and even his own death ensured that the survivors would gain no understanding or closure from his passing.",0,1388751170,,0,FALSE,2,ceg908u,t3_1uac3m,t1_ceg908u,t3_1uac3m,1431780123,1733,FALSE,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,1733

TRUE,[deleted],,,"That bomber pilot went crazy, utterly insane. He managed to overpower his co-pilot and steer the plane North, where he intentionally crashed it into the British RAF base in Gibraltar... The Man himself later explained to me that that pilot had been suffering from a brain tumor which, at that moment, influenced that decision.

 The plane was carrying nuclear material, which was spread in the manner of a dirty bomb detonation when the plane's fuel tanks exploded and ignited a large gasoline storage tank in the base, producing a sizeable explosion. This was witnessed by the captain of a United States Forrest-Sherman-Class Destroyer which was headed out of the Mediterranian Sea at the time. Due to the distance, he could not properly ascertain the size of the explosion, but picked up the radiation of the resulting cloud of radioactive material on the ship's Geiger counter, thus making the fatal mistake of confusing the explosion for a nuclear detonation. He seems to have panicked at that point because in his message to Washington, he kept rambling about a Soviet nuclear pre-emptive strike on European military installations along the coast of the mediterranian sea. A lot of people reacted in a very rash manner in the next few hours... Long short story, after the United States started their entire strategic bomber fleet and Russian intelligence got conflicting news of a large-scale exchange between British and Russian forces in the mediterranian (which was entirely fictional and originated from an agent who was at the time suffering from delusions), World War III happened. Half of the human race did not survive the next decade. 

That was the time when The Man appeared. He didn't call himself The Man, but that's what I remember, him being the first Man I had seen in a long time - damn if I can remember what he called himself... He was, that we are quite sure of, not a human being, although he physically resembled one. He talked to me personally at the time (it was 1969), trying to find out what happened to the planet. I distinctly remember him saying that 1969 was a fixed point in time that was about to be altered: A human being had to set foot on the moon on July 20, which was, at the time, impossible because we had effectively bombed ourselves back into the stone ages. The Man implied that it was possible for him to take a human being there, if neccessary, but that that was not how it was supposed to happen. He said that a particular video tape of the moon landing was what was important, one that was longer than it was supposed to be... I can not claim to understand half of it. 

The Man also said that the crash of the B-47 was not a fixed point and could be altered. I would have taken him for just another nutjob then - the human race had not exactly retained its sanity after the war was over. Of course, it was never really over, but the last atomic bomb had been detonated almost eight years ago and there were about a thousand groups claiming to be the United States or the Soviet Union, fighting each other with old rifles, the occasional mortar or landmine, sticks, stones and their bruised fists. 

I would have thought The Man was a madman - which was a thing he called himself, by the way - if not for his clothing. In a charred wasteland of endless war, he strolled into my little safehouse in a perfectly new, clean three-piece suit. Now, you can't know what the world was like after the bombs had fallen, but let me tell you: When I saw him entering, I truly thought the suit was a miracle. There was nothing, could be nothing as clean and undamaged in the entire world. 

I don't know why I remember it all - because The Man went back. He told me he'd fix things and then he walked out again. There was a noise, then he was gone. Then there was confusion, I lost my consciousness, then I was back in my bed again and the year was 1956, the day after the war had started. Except it hadn't. I called friends and acquaintances everywhere, asked about the bombs, about the Russians and finally about the plane. It turned out that it had disappeared without a trace... They later locked me in a mental ward for a few weeks after I kept telling them about World War III, that was when I learned to shut my mouth. Hell, I stopped believing it myself at some point, started thinking they were right, that I was a right down regular nutcase. 

Except, of course, The Man came back. He looked differently, dressed differently, different face, different hair, different everything, looking younger than before - but it was him alright, and he knew me. Must have been about this time last year, I guess... We had some tea then. Now I know I've always been right, that the War was real and The Man was real, and I'm too old for them to lock me into a madhouse again. They'll just say I'm going a bit senile, so it's alright. I didn't imagine that second visit, either - he left me his number. I call him from time to time.

TRUE,Bernardito,,,"This is actually not true. It has been proven false since then.

The story never happened. It's complete fiction.

But Bernardito, wasn't it included in the Guinness Book of World Records? Doesn't Wikipedia confirm as true?

Here we get to the interesting part. 

First, the truth: February 1945. It's the final stages of William Slim's brilliant Burma campaign and the British have trapped a Japanese force counting around a thousand men in the islands of Ramree. Instead of surrendering, the Japanese commander chose to take his men across an unblocked route through ten miles of mangrove swamps. Many were already in a bad state entering the swamp. Malaria was rampant. As one can imagine, swamps are not pleasant places. They are filled not only with deadly insects and snakes but are truly a nightmare to get through. Out of 900 troops that went into the swamp, 500 made it out. 

The myth: The above story except that by the end 20 troops were captured by the British, the rest were all killed by saltwater crocodiles. This is a 'reported account' from this encounter: *""That night was the most horrible that any member of the ML crews ever experienced. The scattered rifle shots in the pitch black swamp punctured by the screams of wounded men crushed in the jaws of huge reptiles, and the blurred worrying sound of spinning crocodiles made a cacophony of hell that has rarely been duplicated on earth. At dawn the vultures arrived to clean up what the crocodiles had left... Of about 1,000 Japanese soldiers that entered the swamps of Ramree, only about twenty were left alive.""*

Why is this a sensationalist myth?

The observer of this is according to most accounts a certain [Bruce Wright](http://books.google.se/books/about/Wildlife_Sketches_Near_and_Far.html?id=Kb9XmQEACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y) who for some reason was in this swamp where this is said to have taken place, sitting in a motor launch and witnessing this. Yet only Wright's *Wildlife Sketches Near and Far* exists as the single account for this to have happened.

There is no other single source that can verify this event to have happened and the actual survivors themselves that came out of the swamp is enough to disprove this myth. There is no mention of it in official British records and W.O.G. Potts did his own research into this with an incredibly detail investigation in which he interviewed a broad range of people which included Ramree islanders, survivors and soldiers. No one acknowledged that an incident like this had taken place.

Lastly, historian Frank McLynn has this to say in his book *The Burma Campaign*: 

*Most of all, there is a single zoological problem. If 'thousands of crocodiles' were involved in the massacre, as in the urban (jungle) myth, how had these ravening monsters survived before and how were they to survive later? The ecosystem of a mangrove swamp, with a exiguous mammal life, simply would not have permitted the existence of so many saurians before the coming of the Japanese (animals are not exempt from the laws of overpopulation and starvation).*

The Wikipedia writer is overly critical about Frank McLynn in the article, for whatever reason that might be. While McLynn did indeed doubt the existence of Mr. Wright but as pointed out in the *Talk* section of the page in question, there is no evidence that the Wright who wrote the book which had the only account of the incident and the Wright which the Wikipedia page uses as a source (a dubious one at that) is the same person.

With things like Bigfoot, there are a great many stories, and interesting snippets of evidence, but nothing conclusive, imho. My main reasons for leaning towards not (yet) believing in Bigfoot, and other cryptids can be boiled down to these:

- No Body. Clearly a corpse of a cryptid would be irrefutable evidence that it exists. Were they to exist in numbers large enough to sustain a viable population, living in North America alongside humans for thousands of years, the fact that we don't yet have a body, or any bones etc is pretty damning. Absence of evidence isn't always evidence of absence, but when we know that there logically MUST be bodies if these creatures do exist, the fact that we currently have absolutely nothing in this regard is significant.

- Where is the fossil record? So there is another primate living in North America, or some other creature that's unknown living somewhere else. Well it must have evolved from something, and even if we don't have a live one or dead body, we would expect to find some kind of fossil trace that might hint at what a modern version could look like. For a primate the size of Bigfoot to exist, something that's quite possibly the largest primate to ever have lived (if it's real), then the fact there isn't any fossil evidence indicating this is likely is a major problem.

- Witness reliability. In general, humans actually aren't very good witnesses. People's memories are malleable, and in a culture where 'bigfoot' is a very popular, or at least well-known concept, the fact that many people claim to have seen it is unsurprising. I don't believe in a lot of things. Ghosts, Angels, God, etc. The fact that there are a lot of people alive today and historically who claim to be witnesses of them simply doesn't sway me. Even if people are telling the absolute truth as they remember it, that doesn't mean their account is accurate, or correct. I'm sure that everyone can think of something they don't believe happened/exists that has a great many convinced witnesses for.

I would dearly love for science to make such a massive discovery such as a live Bigfoot, or any one of the other cryptids that are often mentioned, but at the moment I just really don't think there is anywhere near enough evidence to be satisfied.

TRUE,thedevilyousay,,,"It's all about how you think. What helped me is to think of what dudes were doing just a few generations ago. See, around that time, the sweet ass Germans were just getting some *lebensraum* - space to live. After two decades of living in economic and geographic strangulation, they finally took a stand. The world has always been shitbaked of a strong german people. This is not a new struggle for them, because since Roman times, when they were just a smattering of tribes who cooked pigs feet over dung fires, fuckers have been trying to take their shit and tax their balls off. They don't take too kindly to that crap. They'd been fucking with shit since Arminius lured those Roman milk drinkers into the [Teutoburg Forest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Teutoburg_Forest). Just a bunch of barbarians, eh? Yeah, they laughed that day, as they dined on bowls of hot eagle stew. Still, the Romans kept pushing and pushing, slaughtering their kids and burning their nice ass farms. Eventually, after trying to conquer past the Rhine for like the millionth time, they finally hung up their plumes and gave up. The people had some space to live. That is, until the ""allies"" took that away in 1918. 

The germans, who were no strangers to not fucking around, were just looking for some sweet farmland to grow some cabbages, but Stalin and Churchill thought they liked them better under the yoke. So they recruited like 30 million guys in green to put the gerries back into slavery. They had giant fucking boats with guns the size of city buses, and they shot up all their shit. They had eleventy million tanks, machine guns, airplanes, and they had one goal: to blow their nuts off, choke the economy, and to dress the germans in nice frilly aprons so they could cook little fancy cakes like the spineless, neutered bitches they thought they should be. Fuck that noise. 

They got word that there were like a million bitches with machine guns landing on their new beach to fuck shit up. They just got this fucking beach for fuck's sake, ain't no way they're giving it up. They knew it could be the end, as everyone in the world was triple tag-teaming up to put them down like cattle in a PETA commercial. The boys on the beach showed their mates black and white pictures of their girlfriends, kissed their crosses, spit into the wind, and said, ""Do your worst."" 

And boy, did they ever. The yankee boats shot fucking flaming city buses over all their shit, while legion upon legion of bloodthirsty yanks stormed up the beach, shooting machine guns and lobbing grenades directly at their nuts. They held the line as planes dropped bombs on their brothers, who popped like water balloons filled with blood. Yet, they held that fucking line. Would it have been easier to just give up? Perhaps they should have just slept in and let them have the stupid beach. Maybe they could head back to Berlin for some sausage? Maybe go into marketing? Yeah, that would have been easy. Maybe they should sit quietly in the barren little playpen the world wanted them in, while everyone else got fat off of their land? Is that what Arminius would have done? I think you know the answer. 

Outnumbered and out-gunned, they held that line it until it finally broke, and tens of thousands of Marlborough-smoking fuckeaters enveloped them and started to split their skulls open with rifle butts and bayonets. They held that line while the so-called allies fired at them until they were biologically turned inside out. Their livers and brains littered the land like confetti. They held that line until their life's blood seeped out into the earth - the same earth they just wanted to live on 

That's what they did.

&gt;* After researching the original graph, I found that the source of the ""drug addiction rates"" (as seen [HERE](http://www.oas.samhsa.gov/NSDUH/2k10NSDUH/2k10Results.htm#Ch7). Was pretty much made up on the spot, as nowhere in that document does it discuss ""addiction rates"", nor could such a statistic be accurately measured. 

&gt;* I also noticed that the ""spending"" was not only in **nominal** dollars (not real dollars, which account for inflation) but it also did not account for the massive increase in US population over the past 40 years (from around 205million to 310 million).

&gt;* So I remade the graph, using the same style, to accurately show you guys a less bias, more sensible view of the U.S. drug enforcement spending. (and I cite my sources)

&gt;* The spending rates have been adjusted to be per capita (using data from the US census), and in 2010 dollars (using the bls.gov inflation calculator). That is, the number is the amount of money spent per citizen, in 2010 dollars. 

&gt;* The drug usage rates, are taken directly from the US department of health, and they show the percentage usage rate of ""illegal"" drugs in the country. As the main purpose of the ""war on drugs"" is to reduce the usage rates of illegal drugs, this gives a good picture on how it has been progressing. It is also important to note that the large increase during the late 80s was mainly to counteract the surge of crack usage in cities.

&gt;* Rates prior to 1979 were hard to find and not entirely accurate (the few sources I did find stated that usage rates were in the 20% area for the 1960s-70s, but I could not find conclusive data), hence the dotted line.

While living in Central Florida from 2001 through 2008 I saw Dawn, and other trainers who were interviewed in the movie, perform shows on a regular basis. I was there for the opening day of ""Believe"" and saw Dawn perform this show on several occasions. I witnessed Tilikum in action in several shows and I remember taking notice of the scars on his body. The simple fact is that SeaWorld executives knowingly bought a psychologically traumatized animal with a violent past and they continue to use him in shows to this day for two reasons:

A. Tilikum is their largest whale.

and 

B. He is a male who is a sexually mature breeder.



SeaWorld executives are responsible for lying to their employees about Tilikum's past for financial gain. I am not against keeping and training Orcas in captivity. I am not against the research and conservation efforts that are certainly a benefit of SeaWorld's existence. 

I am against crude capture of wild young orcas. I am against the purchase of Tilikum and his continued use for shows. I am against allowing Tilikum to be kept in an enclosure with other abusive females or kept in solitary confinement as a form of protection from said females. 

SeaWorld executives need to understand that Orca's are deeply social and psychological animals. There are consequences to improper psychological health when caring for an Orca. Tilikum has been through too much and has shown violent tendencies for too long. He cannot continue to live the theme park life.

TRUE,miczajkj,,,"There are a few differences in the use of *Qbits* (quantum bits) compared with classical bits:  

- the room you work in does not have to be 2 dimensional (you are not restricted to 0 and 1). This is not that big of an advantage and indeed you could also do a similar thing in classical computing. I just wanted to point that out. (For simplicity we still often look for 2 dimensional quantum systems.)  

- Quantum systems can be in superposition states. While classical bits are either 0 or 1 quantum mechanics works entirely different: every system exhibits vector structures. That means, that you have two basis vectors |0&gt; and |1&gt; (we may also call them (1, 0) and (0, 1) or up and down or however you like; don't be afraid by the notation: those brackets are just a neat way of talking about quantum states) but every combination of those vectors is also a possible state (because a constant doesn't change the physical state we choose to normalize them to an absolute value of one, so we can classify all possible states of one Qbit as (a, b) (or equivalent a|0&gt;+b|1&gt;) with the restraint |a|²+|b|² = 1.)   
We can interprete that as a state, that has the probability of |a|² to be measured as |0&gt; and the probability of |b|² to be measured as |1&gt;.

- two Qbits can be [entangled](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_entanglement). That means, that you can't demount the two-Qbit-system in two non-interacting one-Qbit-systems. 

A little more math to the last point: 
The two Qbit system can be described by four basis-vectors:  
|00&gt; (both Qbits in the state |0&gt;)  
|11&gt; (both Qbits in the state |1&gt;)  
|01&gt;, |10&gt;  (one of the Qbits in |1&gt;, the other in |0&gt;)
so every possible state can be expressed by  
|psi&gt; = a|00&gt; + b|01&gt; + c|10&gt; + d|11&gt;  
with |a|²+|b|²+|c|²+|d|² = 1. 
We stated before, that every one-Qbit-state can be written as a|0&gt;+b|1&gt; does that mean, that every two-Qbit-state can be demounted to the following product  
|psi&gt; = (a|0&gt;+b|1&gt;)(c|0&gt;+d|1&gt;)?  
(here the a,b,c,d are not the same as before, evidently.)

The answer is: no, this is not possible for every state. Take for example the (normalized) state  
|psi&gt; = 1/sqrt(2) (|01&gt;+|10&gt;)  
It can not be written as a product state - we therefore call it entangled. In fact, you can easily see, that the outcome of the two Qbits is anti-correlated: if you measure one to be 1, then the other one must be 0. 


Now the time-development of those states can be controlled by so called quantum gates and you can do that very properly. Therefore you can indeed calculate many things at once (by using the superposition principle) and you can kind of communicate over arbitrary distances (via entanglement, while you have to be very careful here: it is no real kind of communication, as an instant information-transfer would violate special relativity. But there is indeed the possibility of [*quantum teleportation*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_teleportation) where you can instantly transport a physical state over an arbitrary distance and [*dense coding*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superdense_coding) where you send two bits of information with transferring only one Qbit, thanks to entanglement.)

Controllers within the directive are specific for the directive. They don't depend on any outside factors, so the directive always has that functionality regardless of the page it's on. If you pass in a function to the directive, its behavior can change depending on the context you're using it.

If you have *phone* directive, you always want the call to go through once you've dialed, but how you dial depends on what time period you're in. 

So 100 years ago or whatever, you've got a controller 

    OldController($scope) {
        $scope.dial = function() {
            // old rotary phone or something.
            // so you've got to do a lot of spinning.

        $scope.dial = function() {
            // cellphone
            // we just hit speed dial
    };

So if your directive takes in the dial function from your controller, you can reuse it for any period of phones. 

Maybe you always want to print the phone number before you call, so you're saying like ""Now calling {{number}}!"" That can be a function ON the directive.

I've seen this before. What it is, when someone opens an attachment Outlook downloads it to a temporary folder. If you are in an enterprise environment, a lot of the attachments are going to be scan.pdf, photo.jpg, doc1.docx, etc. very generic names. Typically Outlook will clear out the temp folder if done correctly (typically when outlook closes). However, if for what ever reason Outlook isn't shut down properly it doesn't clean the folder. So this leaves these files in the temp folder. So the next time they open an attachment it now becomes scan(1).pdf, photo(1).jpg, doc1(1).docx, etc. Here is where the problem lies, Outlook can only create up to 99 copies of the same file. So most likley that is why you can't create a file. Clearing out that folder, should fix the problem.

TRUE,smh5003,,,"I have run a lot of large empires for hundreds of years without instability. It sounds like you are on the right track but here is what i do. Basically you want to actively take part in efforts that increase your strength relative to your vassals by either increasing your income, levies, or both by increasing your demesne size or by decreasing theirs. 

First, no kingdom titles should exist in your Empire aside from the ones that take only one Duchy to create like Castille and Brittany. All else being the same, Kings always seem more likely to join a faction than a Duke. This isn't the only reason, see below. You should not, I repeat NOT, ever need to bribe or scheme away faction members (or really give any one vassal any particular extra consideration), and with Kings that is sometimes your only option.

Ye shall always rock yon Elective succession with your primary title always being a single title in that tier, meaning no Emperor of This and That, or no being King of Italy and Burgundy. Ye shall however, hold all of these titles personally once they become titular for the added prestige.

Ye shall hand out all Duchy titles to members of your dynasty if you are not Muslim. Dynasty members automatically become allies, so even your minor vassals will have a large network of alliances with which to conquer outside of your territory and expand your realm. This happens without the added dangers of creating stronger vassals aka Kings. This doesn't work for Muslims because it will create a decadence spiral.

Because all Dukes in your realm are dynasty members, and only Dukes and children of the King or Emperor are eligible to be elected, and because you have one primary title with a single elective succession, no matter who wins the next election the player character will continue to be the highest title holder (King or Emperor) in the realm, and maintain his entire Demesne continuously.

Ye shall not worry anymore about who has claims to what. Pretenders to an imperial title are a joke when they only hold a single Duchy title vs your Imperial title with 10k+ retinues. Once your dynasty is big enough, distant relatives, denoted by the small blood drop on their portrait, should be your first choice when landing new conquests.

Ye shall only build Skirmish retinues and never the oft overestimated Cataphract, and certainly not the Heavy Cavalry retinue. These following two choices, although stronger in combat, neglect the primary benefit of retinues that all min/maxers use. This benefit is that your retinues, mercs, and levies all added up determines the current relative faction strength. Adding a Skirmish retinue adds 500 troops for 600 retinue cap usage, vs the same 500 troops for 1200 retinue cap usage with Heavy Cavalry. This will almost single handed prevent factions from becoming ""dangerous"". You can't lose wars you never have to fight. 

Building policy should focus on income improvement to the max possible through current tech first, and then militia training grounds then the other level 1 improvements first. This will increase your levy size as fast as possible and further reduce the possibility of a faction revolt.

Ye shall raise feudal taxes to low, and decrease feudal levies to minimum, creating several hundred gold in income per year for large empires. Your massive horde of Skirmish retinues and personal levies are more than enough to fight off foreign invaders at the Empire level.

Ye shall dump all military tech points into military organization to increase your retinue size, all cultural tech points into legalism to increase your desmesne and therefore levy size and to DECREASE the ever deadly short reign opinion penalty suffered from vassals, and all economy tech points into Castle Infrastructure once you have access to walls level 2 to increase your personal income and therefore indirectly your levy size through improvements.

Ye shall not land merchant republics outside of your de jure territory, unless you want a permanent independence faction member. You should make every effort to ensure your dynasty is the controlling patrician family.

Ye shall educate yon heir to be a high level diplo ruler for better relations, or stewardship ruler for greater demense and therefore levy size. Ye shall educate him by yourself even if you do not have the highest education traits because passing on traits like patient, charitable, and brave are far more important at +10 relations each than an additional +3-9 diplomacy or stewardship. All vassals shall be of the same religion and culture.

Ye shall educate the heirs of your strongest vassals, and send your children to be educated by your strongest vassals for opinion boosts all around.

Feasts and in particular hiring Mercs can be used as good last minute efforts to prevent a faction revolt from firing.

Finally, and most importantly, the Crown Authority of your highest title shall NEVER EVEN FOR A SINGLE DAY rise above Medium. After 1 day of High CA, most of the Dukes in your realm will switch away from Gavelkind succession to Primogeniture succession. Now instead of your Super Duke vassals naturally breaking apart on death when their 2 sons share their titles, all titles will pass to the oldest son, and the Super Dukedom continues.  This is another reason not to create Kingdoms, they also do not break up on death.

It may be worth abandoning an old empire title if you get the opportunity to usurp the Byzantine empire. It gives you access to Imperial Administration which gives tyranny free revocation of Duchies.  I believe you also get the opportunity to reform the empire and gain access to the imperial reconquest CB.

This all adds up to laws that constantly keep vassals weak and make you strong. Have fun, as I said, I go several hundred years without a faction using these techniques let alone having a faction revolt fire.


Edit: Religion Specific

Catholics should use free investiture for the + relations to vassals who own temple vassals.

Catholic Emperors (and Orthodox) should keep a vassalized pope in their pockets for guarantee excommunication of non dynasty member vassals for titles that slip out of your family's hold. Imprison/release constantly until a revolt happens to revoke titles infamy free.

Catholics and Orthodox may use Gavelkind at the large income producing stage of expanded empires. This will increase your demesne limit by +2 or +3 at that point. Extraneous heirs can be landed with newly built or holy warred temples to safeguard succession.

Zoroastrians should pursue the Saoshyant trait and ""divine"" marriages for more relations bonuses with vassals.

Unreformed pagans should marry old wives and then keep a barren wife for the stat bonus, but child rearing should be done with concubines, which can be discarded after a male heir is generated, also to protect the succession.  There are times when ""the ultimate solution"" for dealing with extra sons is justifed, meaning it is worth it to eat the penalty to imprison and execute sons sometimes.

Norse should spam raiding until the Viking trait is gained for more relations with vassals. I do not believe it is necessary to personally lead the troops.

Muslims should go on Hajj and observe Ramadan whenever possible to keep decadence down. You should also choose the Islam branch that helps reduce decadence. Male dynasty members should be assigned spots on the council to keep them from generating decadence, or imprisoned and executed if not.  Ruler design or chose a family that has the Sayyid trait for more relations.

Slavic, Romuva, Suomenskuo, and West African Pagans, and Jewish don't really have any bonuses useful for this purpose.

Which Argos already is and as they have way more than 150 stores in the Uk there is no point going after a share of their market.

When people buy jewellery,  they are investing in something or buying a present,  creating a memory. They want it to feel special and unique,  but also classic and timeless.  Your site should reflect this.

Even if people are looking for a good deal, they don't want to feel as though the goods are inferior or bad quality. The jewellery on this site looks good enough,  but there are some ways you could enhance it's appeal. I would suggest if you had the time, the resources and the budget,  a photoshoot displaying excellently lit, styled stills of the jewellery or even models wearing them would look good on a carousel across the top below the nav bar. Provide some context for the items, so people can visualise what it would be like to own them, themselves more clearly.

In terms of what you have so far the nav bar and logo are fine, but all of the boxes that form the main body are not working. They remind me of ads in the back of a newspaper. The red and white do not signal quality. They scream budget. I would stick to classic muted colours like white, grey / silver and an accent like teal or the paler maroon in the nav bar. Choose a classic serif font, to signal history and longevity.

She gave me a bowl of ice cream and told me that Bill was not my biological father and she was sorry that she left me with him and my younger brother(Bills biological son) in that house for so many years.

I learned this some years later in middle school and high school. I took it very rough. I was very angry blamed her for many years for the childhood I missed out on. The feelings have changed over the years. When I was in school I was angry and saddened. Seeing fathers everywhere, At football games, groceries stores, fairs ect. I wanted to be that kid on top of dads shoulders, I wanted to be that son who was being taught things and cheered for at events. But now, after I put myself through collage, I just am happy for the person I made myself become. Now I wonder biologically what the other half of me is, is there a disease that runs in my family that I dont know about? Its really hard to this day when things tell me to put down my biological father, for schools, for joining the Navy, for the government, I just have to put John Doe.

 I no longer have hate in my heart for my mother, I just believe that it was brought about the wrong way, especially with the abandonment.

I was born near Sarajevo, Bosnia, in 1994. My mother was not religious, but ethnically Bosniak (Muslim). She was imprisoned in a former school that had been converted into a sort of rape camp. She became pregnant quickly and was intentionally held there for almost 7 months so it would be too late to get an abortion. They teased her saying now she will have a Serb baby. When she was let out, she tried to find a doctor who would provide an abortion, but none would because it would likely have killed her. She tried to do that herself too, but her parents caught her.

Growing up, I was raised by my grandparents. They moved to the United States, and I was always told that my parents died in the war, that my father was a soldier and my mother was killed when a shell hit her house. I only learned about 4-5 years ago what really happened, and that my mother is still alive and lives in Austria now. But she wants nothing to do with me, and she has completely cut my grandparents out of her life because I'm with them.

I don't find it hard to deal with. It is far removed from my life. Perhaps if we were still living in Europe, it would be different.

With good leadership and support from the United States and our NATO allies, anything is possible.

TRUE,sqwirk,,,"I'm an only child and the product of rape. My mother had a roommate in the 80s who one day was involved in a pretty bad car accident. As a result, he suffered from brain damage. He stopped paying his rent and bills and my mother told him he'd have to move out if he couldn't get it together. He moved out, his mother helped him and some nasty words were said, and a week later he raped my mother. Now, the story gets a little hazy here: my mother claims she didn't have enough money for an abortion so she went through with the pregnancy. My birth father's mother claims that she offered to pay for the abortion but my mother refused. My birth father wanted the abortion to happen but he too didn't have any money. I have no clue which story is true but in hindsight all of them wanted to have the abortion. Really makes me feel great! (Despite all this, I am pro-choice. I just think it's a little bit mean to rub it in someone's face that you didn't want them to be born....the fetus is grown up and has feelings now, guys, and you're hurting them!).

17 years of dealing with an alcoholic mother (child abuse and neglect galore) I finally got out to live on my own. My mother would repeatedly beat me (hit me with her fists, throw me down stairs, close doors on me, etc) when I was a kid and I was in constant fear of her. She would also mentally abuse me. You know how some kids are raised ""brainwashed"" into religious cults? It was kind of like that for me but instead of religion, I was brainwashed into believing I'm a worthless piece of trash and will never amount to anything. Something my mother to this day tells me is ""You're not a product of love and therefore will never be loved."" Up until recently, that was true. I don't have many family members, never really had any super close friends, and didn't have a boyfriend or anything. To this day I'm still trying to learn what it feels like to be loved and it's very hard for me to accept the fact that it's possible for someone to love me or care about me.

I found out about how I was conceived at a very young age, I believe I was a toddler when my mother told me (I had asked questions about why I didn't have a daddy and she told me my good for nothing father was a rapist which made me a ""god damned bastard rape baby""). I didn't really understand the extent of the situation until I was older. My father wasn't in jail for more than a couple of years and my mother granted him visitation rights yet I didn't meet him until I was ~7 years old. It was really hard to be around him because he was a stranger and yet related to me and his brain injury made it hard to get through to him as well. He died in 2009 from a grand mal seizure. I've been in contact with his mother since I was about 11 years old, she has the point of view that pretty much my whole life is just a really big shame (""It's such a shame you were born"").

For anyone who's curious: I am now 23 and live alone with two cats, have a boyfriend, work at an esteemed institute of higher education, am almost finished getting my BA in communication and media, and consider myself to be pretty content with how things are. I suffer from anxiety, PTSD, and depression as a result of my childhood but am being treated and hopefully will be able to continue fighting off my demons.

This was a lot longer than I meant to have it be, oops.

TRUE,employeeno5,,,"If you're going to invoke Ellsberg and the Pentagon Papers to suggest a lack of integrity on Snowden's part, then it should be noted that Daniel Ellsberg has stated that he supports Snowden in both his decision to leak the information, and his decision to flee, saying that if he were leaking the Pentagon papers today he would also consider fleeing. 

It is because the political and social climates towards this kind of action, and how we deal with whistleblowers on a legal level, have changed dramatically for the worse. This is not at all the country Pentagon Papers were leaked in. In that sense it speaks volumes about how much more our civil liberties, insistence on due process of law, and general attitudes about civic virtue and speaking truth to power have eroded since the Pentagon Papers, not Snowden's nor Ellsberg's character or specific methods. 

There are arguments to make against Snowden, but so much of the focus (in both media and official government talking-points) has been on making assumptions about his character/motives. I think that is embarrassing and lazy. It serves only to provide a more simple narrative, and distract from the very difficult issues of the substance of his leaks, and how such a leak should be dealt with.

TRUE,Jig813,,,"I recently designed a jewelry website (www.feltnoir.com), so I feel like I may be able to be of some assistance.

First things first, let's think about what you're selling here. Jewelry is a fairly high ticket item, so the site doesn't need to just be easy to use, it has got to instill a certain trust in your brand and convey a more sophisticated (not the most descriptive word, I know) vibe.

Generally, design elements that will help you achieve these aims will be simple, toned down colors, subtle typography and plenty of negative space (alexandani.com is a good reference). The fhinds site is rather busy and uses bright colors and loud typography. This isn't bad in itself--but good design is appropriate design.

Any issue I may have taken to the actual graphic elements used is fixable though, because I think the framework of the site is pretty nice. It's nothing special, but I think it's pretty logical and wouldn't need to be changed all that much to be usable.

Take this with a grain of salt (I know how hard this is, I just did it, and I know my design is far from perfect) but my advice would be to completely reboot the aesthetic of the site. Focus on toning down your color and typography choices and letting the pieces of jewelry speak for themselves by giving them breathing room. Lot's of negative space, simple sans serif type, and a subdued color palette will probably go a long way here.

Let me reiterate, this is by no means a bad site; however, I think you could improve it dramatically by making these changes.

TRUE,scoder,,,"I'm assuming you have a brother in a similar situation. If not and you're just curious, hopefully this helps someone else.

I used to be a horrible person, brother, and son/nephew (grew up with an aunt and uncle since the time I was 5 because my parents were addicts). I started drinking and doing drugs at 13, which made me an even worse person. By the time I was 22, I was kicked out for my heroin addiction and awful temper.  

I wound up in a homeless shelter and still attempted to dupe my family into taking me back, telling them I was a changed man after just one week. I had talked my aunt into allowing me back if I went to AA meetings, but once I got off the phone with her, I began having a change of heart. 

For the first time in my life, I tried not to blame the world for the shitty hand I was dealt as a child and looked at the things I had done wrong. I imagined the new types of hell I'd eventually cause if I moved back to my family's house and kept getting high. To be honest, I was incredibly tired of being addicted to drugs and crime, and being an overall shitty person who lied about everything. People may see that as living a life of ""not giving a fuck"", but it's emotionally and mentally taxing as long as you're not a complete sociopath. I wore a different mask to everyone, which made it difficult to differentiate between my opposite personalities. I constantly had to remember which stories I told which person in my life, and near the end, I had started to lose control of the manipulation.

Long story short, I didn't know who I was or what I wanted, I just knew that I was hurting a lot. So I made two more phone calls, one being to my aunt to tell her not to pick me up from the shelter, and the other to a rehab. 

That's when I truly began to pick myself apart and look at my own flaws. I no longer wanted to blame the world for my addiction or shitty personality, I wanted to start over with my life and become someone people and myself could understand and like. I went to rehab and paid attention on how to fix my life, how not to feel pressured by triggers, and how to make amends with the hundred or so people I had hurt in my life. At the end of rehab, I again found myself at the crossroads to go back to my aunt and uncle's house. I realized that my journey of reconstruction wasn't over, and I'd need more assistance in staying drug and crime free. So I went to a halfway house for three months, then moved into a sober house for about 8 months where I got a job and learned to live with constant temptation (sober houses in NY are filled with drug addicts just taking advantage of DSS). 

After that initial year, though, I felt that I was ready to move on from sober living. I was the brother/son/nephew that my family needed, I was clean, and I had reentered society without a single problem. It was time to either move back to my family in NJ or go somewhere else. So I decided that NJ wasn't really what I wanted to go back to and decided on Denver, where I've built up an awesome life over the past year. My family and I, although 1800 miles apart, have the best relationship we've ever had. Besides not being dead, it is the thing I'm most grateful for today.

Sorry for the long story, but people can change. Your brother will continue to do the things he does until he hits a breaking point. Either he gets really tired of how he's living, he becomes dirt broke or homeless, or is forced into jail/rehab. None of those things guarantee that he will find a better path, but the rock bottom feeling is the only way I've seen people get better. Without it, they cling to the ideas that their lifestyle is somewhat manageable or fixable. 

As someone who has been through it all, my best advice is to cut him off. Your entire family should kick him out, cut him off financially, and try to accelerate the process to rock bottom. Although it can risk complete estrangement, it has the possibility of saving his life.

At one point, my grandparents sent her to live in a high-functioning group home. They thought it would be a good first step towards independence, because the staff were only there to help them with transportation, medical supervision etc. my grandparents had high hopes that my mom would be able to live on her own one day.

A few months into her stay, she was raped by a male staff member. She did the right thing, called my gram in secret an hour or so after it happened. Gram called the cops, and got her to the ER. She was too shaken up to comply with the rape kit administration. 

Luckily, the cops didn't tell that to my father. His dumb ass admitted to it almost instantly because he figured they had DNA on him. He was in prison for probably, seven years? Seems low, but that's not a bad term served given how few years most rapists serve. He had the gall to write me a year ago, and asked to meet me and asked if I wanted to meet my half siblings.

The authority to 'fast track' negotiate is specifically granted by Congress.

&gt;Fast-track negotiating authority is granted to the President by Congress.

Even after the deal has been negotiated it still must be approved by Congress.

&gt;Congress can approve or disapprove but cannot amend or filibuster.

And as you can see this is negotiating power that has been periodically granted to President's, by Congress, since the 1970's

&gt;was in effect pursuant to the Trade Act of 1974 from 1975 to 1994 and was restored in 2002 by the Trade Act of 2002. It expired for new agreements at midnight on July 1, 2007.

The point of fast track is to allow the President, any President, to negotiate deals in good faith without having to worry about politicized amendments or filibusters threatening the negotiations and impacting the United States ability to negotiate future deals.

Like any law Congress, the legislative branch, still must vote on the deal. The President still must work a deal that will gain a majority of votes in Congress, just like any law. There is no circumventing of the constitution.

And as far as the constitution and Presidential powers regarding Treaty Negotiation maybe you should give it a read.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_Clause

&gt;[The President] shall have Power, by and with Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators present concur...

In addition ...

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_Clause#Scope_of_presidential_powers

&gt;A sole-executive agreement can only be negotiated and entered into through the president's authority (1) in foreign policy, (2) as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, (3) from a prior act of Congress, or (4) from a prior treaty.[1] Agreements beyond these competencies must have the approval of Congress (for congressional-executive agreements) or the Senate (for treaties).

The President is simply acting as Congress's negotiating agent and is the 'sole author' of the legislation however, the deal cannot become law until approved by Congress. This executive power has been upheld by the SCOTUS going back to 1892

&gt;Although the nondelegation doctrine prevents Congress from delegating its legislative authority to the executive branch, Congress has allowed the executive to act as Congress's ""agent"" in trade negotiations, such as by setting tariffs, and, in the case of Trade Promotion Authority, by solely authoring the implementing legislation for trade agreements. The constitutionality of this delegation was upheld by the Supreme Court in Field v. Clark (1892).

'Sole Authorship' is no different than any bill written by someone outside of Congress, submitted, voted on, and if approved then sent to the President's desk for signature.

Yes fast track reduces the requirement from 2/3rds to a simple majority. As far as the rest of the points I will simple point you here ...

http://clinton2.nara.gov/Initiatives/FastTrack/work.html

&gt;In exchange for the expedited considerations of implementing legislation, Congress retains a central role before and during the negotiating processes and retains an equally important role in determining how to implement trade agreements. Requests for fast track have always included extensive notification and consultation requirements for the President with Congress and with private sector advisory committees. In every trade agreement negotiated under fast track, Congress has been an active participant in identifying negotiating objectives, monitoring the actual negotiations, and drafting implementation legislation.

.

&gt;Once the negotiations have been concluded and the President has signed it, the Congress and the Administration begin a period of extensive discussions on drafting legislation. This process, reflecting the growing complexity of trade agreements, has involved an increasing number of committees of jurisdiction and interested Congressional members. The President is required to spell out precisely how he intends to use his existing regulatory authority in implementing the agreement. Congress retains the right to vote down an agreement if, after consultation, it still finds the package unacceptable.

&gt;Additional Congressional prerogatives include special procedures for revoking fast track if the President fails to meet the consultation requirements. Where fast track authority has been granted with the possibility of an extension, either House retains the right to disapprove an extension provided either the House Ways or Means Committee or the Senate Finance Committee have reported out &amp;extension disapproval resolution.an Congress must be given advance notice of the President

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_track_%28trade%29#Procedure

&gt;If the President transmits a fast track trade agreement to Congress, then the majority leaders of the House and Senate or their designees must introduce the implementing bill submitted by the President on the first day on which their House is in session. (19 U.S.C. § 2191(c)(1).) Senators and Representatives may not amend the President’s bill, either in committee or in the Senate or House. (19 U.S.C. § 2191(d).) The committees to which the bill has been referred have 45 days after its introduction to report the bill, or be automatically discharged, and each House must vote within 15 days after the bill is reported or discharged. (19 U.S.C. § 2191(e)(1).)

&gt;In the likely case that the bill is a revenue bill (as tariffs are revenues), the bill must originate in the House (see U.S. Const., art I, sec. 7), and after the Senate received the House-passed bill, the Finance Committee would have another 15 days to report the bill or be discharged, and then the Senate would have another 15 days to pass the bill. (19 U.S.C. § 2191(e)(2).) On the House and Senate floors, each Body can debate the bill for no more than 20 hours, and thus Senators cannot filibuster the bill and it will pass with a simple majority vote. (19 U.S.C. § 2191(f)-(g).) Thus the entire Congressional consideration could take no longer than 90 days.

As you can see, Congress, and the relevant committees, still help craft, review, and approve the legislation.

With respect to criminal cases, no, there are none I regret winning and no one I worked with did either (admittedly, none of us handled anything as serious as a rape or murder - but the same logic would apply to those).

You don't regret winning a case, even when your client is completely, utterly guilty, because you represent them (i) for their own sake and (ii) to preserve the legal system.  Without defense attorneys to force prosecutors and police to prove their case, there would be no check on police/prosecutors arresting and convicting anyone they chose.  By representing guilty people you force the police to only arrest and the prosecutors to only prosecute at least nominally guilty people.  

The benefit of a vigorous defense, even of the guilty, is that it prevents arrests and prosecutions.

All of this is in addition to the moral imperative to defend the individual.  The byzantine workings of our court system prevent untrained people from defending themselves adequately, and the lawyers job is to 'sub' for that training by representing the person the way they would represent them self if they could.  

I believe it would be a far, far worse world where lawyers didn't represent the guilty.  Defendants would not be able to trust their lawyers then, and thus would not be able to defend themselves in court.

TRUE,jabonko,,,"I ask them for clarification.  ""What exactly about libraries is it you are saying is obsolete?""  This usually helps them think about the issue a bit more and sets up a more constructive discussion by ""unpacking"" the word ""library.""

Are they talking about public libraries? Academic? special libraries? Business information repositories? Archives?  Sometimes these get lumped in with ""libraries"" and may change the nature of the discussion.

I work in an academic library, so when someone says that **Google will make libraries or librarians obsolete** I usually give them an example from a student I just helped.

For example: Johnny Student asked for information on the impact of anti-bullying initiatives in high schools.  On Google we'll find plenty of news stories - but would your professor let you write a paper based just on CNN or FOX news reports? probably not.  On Google you may find *citations* for scholarly articles on the topic, but are they going to be available for free? very unlikely.  Are you going to tell Johnny Student, with his student loans, tuition bills, and student-sized budget that he'll need to pay upwards of $40 per article he wants to read?

On top of that, I will add in that librarians play a *crucial* role in helping people figuring HOW to search and WHERE to search.  We also help people figure out how to interpret the results they get (slow reading v fast reading).  Often, I view my job as expectation management, because I often have to tell people that the information they *want* may not exist but the information they *need* can be found by [insert instructions].

When someone argues that **public libraries are obsolete** I ask them about their internet connection and access to computers.  Most of my friends are from a similar socioeconomic background to myself, so they've got internet and computers in their pockets (smart phones).  So I talk about the Digital Divide a bit, about how libraries helped thousands of job-hunters during the Great Recession of a few years ago, how they *still* help job-hunters today.

Another point I make about public libraries is that these are a **public space, a community place.**  I will highlight some of the events the local public libraries have: story time for kids, guest speakers (authors, experts, etc.), classes to teach people how to use computers, etc.

If someone says that **libraries are only for old people**, I will counter with information about the effectiveness of video game rentals in libraries, of having video game events in libraries, of creating ""maker spaces"" (as OP mentioned 3D printers), of creating after-school hangout spaces, of creating Safe Havens for individuals experiencing persecution (a fellow library school classmate set up an LGBT-friendly hangout space as a project), of promoting literacy in youth, etc.

Occasionally I will even mention the lobbying and activist type actions of librarians, library communities and the ALA.  Promoting awareness of banned books and censorship is *huge* when we consider how easily the internet can be taken away (consider the Arab Spring in which Egypt tried to limit internet access).  Consider that after the events of September 11, 2001, that libraries across the country *changed their policies on patron information collection in order to protect the privacy and civil liberties of the patrons they served*.

**Libraries will change, and may even change names, but they will never be obsolete**

Disclosure is highly personal and no victim should ever be pressured to disclose.

TRUE,paper_liger,,,"What sprang to mind when I read your question was the movie Full Metal Jacket. I remember clearly watching it in college and being just horrified by the verbal and physical abuse. I couldn't understand what would compel someone to take that and keep going. I'd heard the director had the cooperation of the military to produce it and couldn't believe that they'd let him get away with such a burning diatribe against military service. A couple years later after the death of my parents and bunch of other personal upheavals I ended up quitting art school and joining the Army for no reason in particular other than that it was some species of forward motion. So it goes. 

At the end of basic training (just a few days before 9/11 in fact) we all watched the same movie in our barracks while we cleaned firearms. It was a treat from the drill sergeants. Of course no one puts their hands on you in the modern military like they do in the film and the mental issues Pvt Pyle suffered through are still disturbing but most of the other stuff rang true. The difference was that now it came across as mostly just hilarious. The movie hadn't changed. I had. My perspective had expanded and would never shrink back to it's former size. 

After lengthy training I went to Iraq for the first time in the earliest days of the war. You can't explain combat, only experience it. It's literally awesome and awful. You are in awe of how fragile and at the same time how indestructible a human body can be and how strong men sometimes become weak and weak men show that their will is all the strength that they need. War I found is huge stretches of intense boredom punctuated by moments of sheer insanity. 

The physical and mental challenges are on a completely different level from most experiences in modern life. Arabic language school for me was like a finals week in college except stretched out over 63 weeks, plus drill sergeants and waking up at 530 every morning to go run several miles. There's a reason there is about a 60-70 percent fail out rate. And deployments were harder than that.

It's not a secret club, it's a vast gulf of experience between me and you. It doesn't make me better, but it does make me broader. There are plenty of shitbags in the military yes, but the more tests and trials you have to get through to be were you are the less shitbags manage to hang on. When you finally reach a place like I did where everyone had to pass basic training, then language training, then all sorts of other crazy training, plus jumping out of airplanes and chasing bad guys through the filthy streets and deserts on the other side of the planet the only shitbags left are highly functional shitbags. 

I have more in common with those people than I ever will have with you. I know what it means to go to war with someone at your side and trust your life to their reflexes and their diligence. It's similar to the way that growing up in deep poverty put a gulf of experiential difference between me and the average kid in America who'd never once gone to bed hungry or cold. I can describe war and poverty, but I can't make you feel it. That doesn't mean that I don't have civilian friends or friends from middle class backgrounds, just that I tend not to try to tell them about things that they have no frame of reference to appreciate. 

Not every person in the military did the dangerous things I did either. I have about as much in common with the typical REMF as I do with you. But we few, we struggle to relate to people who haven't suffered and burned in that fire. The things we experienced turn down the volume on the rest of life in a way.

I got out after five deployments when I found out my wife was pregnant and ended up being a stay at home dad. I have close friends who stayed in and are raising wonderful well loved kids despite constant deployments. The generalizations that OP is flinging around seem to be painted on with an awfully broad brush to me but I understand why they would think that way. 

The kind of father I am (and I consider myself a good one) is both informed and deformed by every choice I've made in life. My daughter has a better father because of the rough edges I had knocked off by war, but I realize that not everyone makes it out unscathed. But welcome to life. There are just as many neglected kids out there in the civilian world, it's just that their parents aren't so easily packaged into one neat box with such a convenient handle.

TRUE,[deleted],,,"&gt; * ""God"" is Omnipotent &amp; Omniscient 

&gt; * God clearly puts great value in Free Will, 

Right off the bat, these two things negate each other. If an omniscient creator exists, Free Will is impossible, since nothing could ever happen differently from how he knew they would before even creating them, once they are created. If God chooses to create a universe where he knows I will become a sailor instead of creating a universe where he knows I will become a painter, it would be logically impossible for me to choose to become a painter after I am created. I could only do what he set the universe in motion knowing I'd do. Free Will is absolutely impossible when an omniscient being chooses what gets created, the life paths of which he has predetermined before even creating them.

But I'll continue anyway:

&gt;IF god were to let People who were just really good people but still had some evil in them, into heaven, He would either have to Negate the principle of free will and/or consequences, OR he would need to allow evil into heaven both of which he would refuse to do.

How would it violate free will? People could still freely choose to be generally good, then get into heaven. How would it negate consequences? Why can't God punish them for sins in Heaven? Why can't Heaven have a jail where people put in their deserved time like we do on Earth, then go free? And is there no free will in Heaven? Can people do evil when they're there, and if not, how are we not robots there?

&gt;In all honesty the whole Perfect human sacrifice for the atonement (removal of your sins) is kind of a cheap trick god made in order to let people into heaven without breaking either of those two rules. As long as you recognize that your not getting into heaven for free.

But I *am* getting into heaven for free. I did nothing during that ""sacrifice."" It is *given* to me, for free. I am not punished for my sins, because *somebody else was punished for me.* How is that justice? How does that follow any law of consequences?

&gt;God just kinda cheated and sacrificed something that no evil will ever be able to equate to.

Then why does evil keep us out of Heaven? Why isn't everyone saved regardless of their beliefs, regardless of their evil deeds, if no badness could ever overpower the ""sacrifice""?

If you've attended a few Catholic weddings or funerals, you might have heard readings from Tobit. For my money, it's the most novel-like book in the Old Testament. Great story. Has an angel in disguise in it, and a demon that's slaying all of a bride's new grooms on their wedding night. 

* *Enoch* - a book that's quoted in the New Testament, referenced in Genesis, but not part of the Catholic or Orthodox canon... *except* in Ethiopia's Coptic Orthodox Church.

Enoch is slightly troubling to Christian theology because it tells the story of a man who is translated to Heaven (which kinda seems like Christ's turf). It also goes into details about the reasons for the Flood - a group of angels (Watchers) who wedded human women and fathered a race of giants (Nephilim). YHWH didn't like that, so washed the Earth clean. 

Note: just like there are a couple of books of Kings, Chronicles, and Maccabees, there are also a [couple of books of Enoch](http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/divinity/rt/otp/guestlectures/vanderkam/). 1 Enoch is divided into sections (also called ""books"" - the Book of Watchers, the Book of Parables and so on). 

One of those books found along with 1 Enoch in the Dead Sea Scrolls, is known as the Book of Giants, and is considered [gnostic by some](http://www.gnosis.org/library/dss/dss_book_of_giants.htm).

Zen is about approaching anything and everything with a specific point-of-view.  If you are really serious about your inquiry, a good place to start will be to start with Three Marks of Existence - Impermanence, Depend Origination/Emptiness and Un-satisfactoriness and apply it to anything and everything (including your own post).  Another way of looking at it is this - If everthing is Impermanent and Dependent on Other Things, Grasping or Clinging to something - an idea, a thing, a teaching, a goal, a story, a metahpor - as though it is Permanent is plain stupidity.  Grasping and Clinging are not-Zen.  Letting-go and Holding lightly are Zen.


1. The responses you get will be Un-satisfactory (no matter how you or the responder is earnest)
2. Goals are not fixed.  They keep changing (Impermanent) and depends for their very existence on Causes and Condtions. 
3. Grasping is futile because of (2) and will lead to (1).

Goals change temporally and spatially. Bachelors in Arts after 3 years or Kicking the ball right in to the Net past so many yards.  They are goals and they are also non-goals.  (You get the idea) So it is foolish to look for ""The"" Goal.  There is no such thing.  You are searching for something that doesn't exist.  If something keeps on changing and you want to Grasp it, then that leads to Un-Satisfactoriness and Suffering.  If things keep changing and you are still in 1900s then that lead to Delusion.

Goals depend on ""Causes and Conditions"".  For example, fighting against Apartheid in China is an absurd goal.  The Causes and Conditions for apartheid simply don't exist in China.  i.e., the Goal is itself dependent upon Causes-and-Condtions.

-----

When you understand three marks of existence and put it in to practice you will have a Zen experience every moment of your life.  

1. You will jump right in the stream (Learn the hard way)
2. Go with the flow (This is liberating for you See-For-Yourself the circumstances and adapt to it)
3. Don't grasp but let go of things (You are flexible)
4. Start working with your mind  (Minds move mountains)
5. Stop asking questions and see for yourself (No fixed answers and it cannot be given to you but figured out by you)

Here are some stories I picked for you that illustrate the above bulleted list.

Upon meeting a Zen master at a social event, a psychiatrist decided to ask him a question that had been on his mind. ""Exactly how do you help people?"" he inquired.

""I get them where they can't ask any more questions,"" the Master answered.

A Taoist story tells of an old man who accidentally fell into the river rapids leading to a high and dangerous waterfall. Onlookers feared for his life. Miraculously, he came out alive and unharmed downstream at the bottom of the falls. People asked him how he managed to survive. ""I accommodated myself to the water, not the water to me. Without thinking, I allowed myself to be shaped by it. Plunging into the swirl, I came out with the swirl. This is how I survived.""

Some versions describe Confucius as witnessing this event. Also, in some versions, the old man explains how he has been jumping into the waterfall like this since he was a small boy.

After winning several archery contests, the young and rather boastful champion challenged a Zen master who was renowned for his skill as an archer. The young man demonstrated remarkable technical proficiency when he hit a distant bull's eye on his first try, and then split that arrow with his second shot. ""There,"" he said to the old man, ""see if you can match that!"" Undisturbed, the master did not draw his bow, but rather motioned for the young archer to follow him up the mountain. Curious about the old fellow's intentions, the champion followed him high into the mountain until they reached a deep chasm spanned by a rather flimsy and shaky log. Calmly stepping out onto the middle of the unsteady and certainly perilous bridge, the old master picked a far away tree as a target, drew his bow, and fired a clean, direct hit. ""Now it is your turn,"" he said as he gracefully stepped back onto the safe ground. Staring with terror into the seemingly bottomless and beckoning abyss, the young man could not force himself to step out onto the log, no less shoot at a target. ""You have much skill with your bow,"" the master said, sensing his challenger's predicament, ""but you have little skill with the mind that lets loose the shot.""

Two traveling monks reached a river where they met a young woman. Wary of the current, she asked if they could carry her across. One of the monks hesitated, but the other quickly picked her up onto his shoulders, transported her across the water, and put her down on the other bank. She thanked him and departed.

As the monks continued on their way, the one was brooding and preoccupied. Unable to hold his silence, he spoke out. ""Brother, our spiritual training teaches us to avoid any contact with women, but you picked that one up on your shoulders and carried her!""

""Brother,"" the second monk replied, ""I set her down on the other side, while you are still carrying her.""

Some versions of this story describe the monk as carrying the woman across a mud puddle.

The son of a master thief asked his father to teach him the secrets of the trade. The old thief agreed and that night took his son to burglarize a large house. While the family was asleep, he silently led his young apprentice into a room that contained a clothes closet. The father told his son to go into the closet to pick out some clothes. When he did, his father quickly shut the door and locked him in. Then he went back outside, knocked loudly on the front door, thereby waking the family, and quickly slipped away before anyone saw him. Hours later, his son returned home, bedraggled and exhausted. ""Father,"" he cried angrily, ""Why did you lock me in that closet? If I hadn't been made desperate by my fear of getting caught, I never would have escaped. It took all my ingenuity to get out!"" The old thief smiled. ""Son, you have had your first lesson in the art of burglary.""

I play a lot of Medusa, couple things:  
1. Assess your enemy lineup before considering Medusa. If there's a mana burning hero, chances are you don't want to pick Medusa, because her effectiveness is reduced. This is especially true against Nyx, because his entire skillset and window of opportunity antagonises Medusa.  
2. Do *not* rush a high-cost item without seeing what's going on or I will find you and punch you in the throat. This also applies to getting stats. Only get a Midas if you've missed, *maximum*, 8 last hits (two waves.) Remember the trifecta of early-game sustain: Wand, Boots, Drum. I love Drum on Medusa because she uses every stat and I swear to god it's so cost effective I might cry. If you're feeling unsafe and Timbersaw keeps gouging out your eyes with his sawblades (or another nuker is giving you gyp) I'd recommend brown boots &gt; band of giant strength &gt; bracer (interchangeable with BoGS) &gt; finishing treads &gt; finishing drum. If the game is going active **and you're on the recieving end** I will always recommend Treads over anything else, not only because of the tankiness from the +8 strength, but also because you switch treads to INT, throw snake at the ranged creep when enemies are close to it, switch treads back while snake is travelling - boom, free mana. Using this method you can also replenish your mana with lvl 2+ snake by finding either of the two Satyr camps. Phase if you're the aggressor, Arcanes if you're doing that weird bloodstone build that I really don't like but that I have 100% win-rate with over 10 games.  
3. **This point is the most important;** have vision. The enemy team will have what I call Meepo-Medusa Mania because these are the only two carries where the enemy team actively tries to shut you down. As such, if you're solo and a support isn't warding your jungle *AND* further up your lane, you buy the wards yourself. Do not complain about it, just do it. Don't overextend at all, tp to farm lanes, always have a TP. It's cliché, I know, but I say it for Medusa because most of your gold will be unreliable gold (unless you've been munching heroes with my patended build or have a Midas) and so you lose more when you die. It also helps to have a mid that creates space.

Whew, I hope that helped.

TRUE,JosefTheFritzl,boers,I habeeb in da Boers.,"Lady Theodora slowly walked down the beach, letting the wet sand squish through her toes. She took a deep breath of the refreshing salt air and smiled; the palace was nice enough, but there was little that could compare to that fresh scent of the ocean. It helped to take her mind off the stresses of state, if only for a little while. She allowed herself this brief mental respite, listening to the distant, plaintive call of the gulls.             
               
She glanced back at her retinue, following dutifully at a distance; her military adviser, her economic adviser, and the one responsible for her visit to the shores - her foreign adviser. Word had reached them of a shipwreck, discovered by one of her dromons and flying colors unknown to her lands. She had immediately set out to meet this person, against the advice of her military adviser - England's border was terribly close, and things had been strained since their last trade agreement had fallen through.            
              
Nevertheless, here she stood, watching as dutiful soldiers carried a ragged, gaunt figure to the shore. His skin and hair were fair, and his eyes blue, albeit a dull blue that perhaps once might have been handsome. Now, they only bespoke suffering.           
                 
""What is your name, good stranger?"" she asks, the man dropped to his knees on the shoreline, ""I am Theodora of Byzantium.""         
             
The man stares into the sand for a moment, and Theodora must strain to hear his words, ""Mit hjem er tabt. Hvor er jeg?""         
                 
Theodora's brow furrows; she was well versed in the languages of the continent from all her political dealings, but this was a language unlike any she'd heard before. Still, there was something about him...          
             
""Bring him,"" Theodora commanded the guards, ""We shall learn what he knows in time.""           
                  
*2 years later*              
              
Erik stood by the settee, his plate of fruit proffered to Theodora as she sat, reading through the economic reports of her empire. They were good, and only promised to be better with the upcoming banking system her money counters had developed. At the sound of footsteps, she looked up to see her foreign adviser walking quickly towards her seat.           
               
""My empress,"" she began, ""A caravel has just landed near Antioch. They appear to be an envoy from across the sea. The diplomat with them appears to have learned rudimentary Greek from trading with the city-states. He says they come on behalf of one named Pocatello...""          
             
Suddenly, a loud clatter interrupts causes the two to jump. Erik, white as a sheet, appears stricken. For a moment he remains transfixed before realizing his mistake, which caused color to rush back and turn his face bright red. Hurriedly he begins to clean up the mess he has made, muttering profuse apologies in his gutteral Greek that Theodora has come to enjoy...among other things.           
                
Returning to the issue at hand, Theodora turned to her adviser. ""Let them know I will receive them and begin introductions this evening.""        
              
With a bow, the adviser was gone. Theodora turned her eyes on Erik's svelt figure as he bent to collect the grapes that had scattered haphazardly about the throne room. She allowed herself a chuckle.            
                
""Erik, how can you be so clumsy with a plate when you are otherwise so dextrous? Did something the adviser said unnerve you?"" She looked closer and saw that he was shaking.            
                 
A long moment passed before Erik turned his blue eyes to meet the hazel of the Empress. ""Pocatello...my home..."" he muttered.            
                
Theodora wasn't laughing anymore. What happened to Harald's country was no concern of hers; she had never known them. But if this Pocatello was somehow involved in what happened...

TRUE,dko,,,"yes. the intestinal lubricant mineral oil is safe for human consumption and is perfect for finishing your cutting board. 

#protip: lightly flood the surface and allow all the oil to absorb. repeat until the oil no longer absorbs into the surface. pour a bit of oil onto the board and spread it with clean, new sandpaper. 220-400 grit is best. add oil if the paper bogs and is hard to move. keep sanding while wet with mineral oil until the board is silky smooth. wipe with a paper towel and allow to dry. 



EDIT: [Added from a below post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/1uc47l/how_can_you_tell_if_mineral_oil_is_food_grade_i/cegwzbe)





wooden cutting boards die one of three deaths:

physical damage from cutting and chopping. this basically doesn't happen unless you're using a fireaxe on a half inch board. maybe if you're double-cleavering chinese style for 12 hours a day for a few years. 

warping and splitting. this is the most common cause of death. untreated wood, regardless of how thick it is and whether it's end-grain or not, absorbs moisture very quickly. in fact, end-grain wood absorbs moisture much more quickly. it expands when it gets wet and contracts as it dries. it dries unevenly (outside first) and this causes stress-fractures, warping, bowing, and cracking. every crack is more surface area for bacteria to multiply. this is a serious concern when regularly used for preparing meats, poultry, and fish. 

contamination. this isn't very common as you probably won't put anything on a board that you wouldn't eat, but untreated boards very easily pick up tastes and smells. food oils go rancid eventually, so getting some bacon grease on a cutting board will cause a funky smell and taste eventually. it may even make you sick. 

regularly oiling and sanding your boards addresses all of these problems to varying degrees. an oiled board is denser and stands up to abuse better than an untreated board. it heals minor cuts and, with maintenance, even moderately large cuts seal or fill. 

a well oiled board is much more resistant to moisture. boards treated as i mentioned above can be washed with soap and water as well as scrubbed with scotchbrite pads. bleach and other harsh chemicals should not be used. soap and scrubbing removes oil, so the more often you wash your boards, the more often you will need to treat them. non-meat boards can be effectively washed by lightly rinsing them or just wiping with a damp paper towel. meat boards should be washed in warm soapy water, rinsed, dried, and left to fully dry on a rack or leaned against a counter in a way that allows for maximum airflow. if the whole board is oiled and maintained it will pick up almost no moisture. 

a well oiled board will also not pick up flavors and odors nearly as readily as an untreated board. if you prep something that is very strongly flavored, like habaneros or a ripe cheese, just wash the board with soap and water. 

flooding the surface and reapplying until the wood will not accept any more is a standard technique for applying drying oils such as boiled linseed oil or tung oil. mineral oil applied the same way, but it does not dry. at least not noticeably on the timescale of a cutting board. the board will need to be reoiled because of use and abuse way before the oil dries. 

when initially oiling a board it's advisable to keep flooding it until it no longer absorbs oil, even after sitting for 24 hours. this ensures that the oil has penetrated as deeply as possible. 

sanding is not crucial but advantageous. it's aesthetically pleasing. it looks better and it feels better when you pass your hand across it. more importantly there are functional advantages. a smoother board has less surface area and is therefore less susceptible to bacterial growth. it's also less abrasive with fewer asperities and therefore more easily cleaned with less scrubbing. regularly reseasoning the board by flooding it with oil and sanding will also remove and seal small cuts and nicks with a mixture of wood and oil. 

you can tell a board needs to be reoiled if parts of it are lighter than others or it no longer looks a ""dull wet."" that is to say the way wood looks when it has absorbed moisture but is not shiny. assuming that you fully saturated the board in the first place, applying a touchup coat is as simple as putting on a dollop of mineral oil in the center and spreading it around with sandpaper. if the sandpaper gets bogged or is hard to move, add more oil. once the board is as smooth as you want, stop sanding and let the oil absorb for a few hours. come back and gently wipe off with a paper towel.

&gt; At their heart, TRP and the 'seduction' community are about one thing: getting laid.

As a member of the TRP community, please allow me to correct your misunderstanding.

TRP is based on the idea that what we're told about human sexuality, and specifically what sorts of behaviors are attractive to most women, is a lie. That's why the community is called, ""The Red Pill."" It's a reference to The Matrix in which people are living a lie, and taking the pill allows them to see the truth.

[Here's a great example of one such lie](http://freenortherner.wordpress.com/2013/10/18/one-more-condom-in-the-landfill/) - it's a post about a letter to an advice column. The advice that the young man is given is typical of the ""matrix lie"" that we're told all our life. He's basically told to ""just be himself"" - to just keep on keeping on.

TRP is the idea that the advice given by the columnist quoted above is BS. TRP is about the *theory* of human sexuality - it says, ""these sorts of behaviors are attractive; here's why."" The pickup/seduction communities are more about *practical* advice - ""do this, then do this."" Pickup and seduction are about getting laid. But TRP is about sexuality, and therefore TRP can indeed be used to get **and to keep** a girlfriend.

Here are some threads on the topic: [1](http://reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1tem6b/any_other_marriedltr_rp_guys_wanting_open_up/) and [2](http://reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1j9zbh/applying_trp_to_find_ltr_with_quality_women/)

&gt; TRP doesn't teach you how to attract women: it teaches you how to attract a very specific type of woman.

This is correct. We call that very specific type of woman: The Majority of Them

That said, nobody in either TRP or the PUA community will ever claim that there is some magical incantation that works on every girl. However, understanding the true principals of human sexuality absolutely will increase your chances, and it will help you keep the girl that you eventually get.

OP claims that he has had 0% success. You're telling him not to bother trying something because it isn't 100%. You know, no drug has a 100% success rate. It's like you're talking to a sick man and you're telling him not to take that medicine because it's not 100% guaranteed - no, just stay sick and in pain; just keep on suffering. You are really typical of the bad advice that men get all the time which *drives them to TRP*.

&gt; Believe it or not: women are people

Oh sarcasm! Can I give it a try? Believe it or not: men and women *are different*.

The fundamental problem here, and the reason for TRP's existence, is that men are consistently given bad advice by people like you, who offer nothing more helpful than, ""women are people."" Again, you drive people to TRP.

&gt; people don't like being demeaned, insulted, intimidated, or disrespected

This is a straw man of TRP.

&gt; do you really want anything to do with women like that: women who assume every male is a 'beta' milktoast loser until he proves otherwise by acting out?

Another straw man. Women don't assume anything of the kind, nor are they consciously dividing the world into alpha and beta. The truth is, women *feel* attraction to certain types of behaviors because, among our ancestors, those who exhibited the behaviors left more and healthier offspring.

&gt; The only reason shit like TRP gets any traction is that it plays into gender essentialist notions

Ha! I knew it. You're one of those people who thinks gender is a social construct!

You're wrong. I have mountains of scientific studies that prove you're wrong. Hell, you can cut open people's brains and see the differences! You can also take biological women, raised since birth as women, majored in feminist studies so that totally understand the issues *and they even agree with you* and you can change just one thing - you can administer testosterone, and they'll start acting like stereotypical males. Check out [act 2 of this episode of This American Life](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/220/testosterone) - it's all the proof that anyone will ever need that you're wrong.

The reason you believe this treacle about gender being a social construct is that it plays into a particular political philosophy that just happens to be popular right now. But because you believe it, you give men like OP really bad advice and you condemn him to a life of frustration and loneliness - *and you don't even care* - he's just a pawn in your bigoted social experiment.

&gt; This is the fundamental irony of TRP and all of the 'seduction' community': by putting up with girls that need to be 'neg'ed' and pursued aggressively to form attraction you're still playing their game. TRPers and PUAs deride 'beta' males who bend over backwards for women, but they're doing exactly the same thing.

There's a couple of straw man here. First, nobody talks about negging anymore because it became a red herring. It was never about insulting women. I'll explain more if anybody cares.

Secondly, what TRP derides are men who allow themselves to be taken advantage of. They're stupid.

When you learn the truth about human sexuality, you aren't ""still playing their game"" because it's not ""women's game"" - it's the game of our species. It's our mating dance, and both sexes have their own steps.

Once again, you're talking to a guy who is frustrated because he's been lied to about the mating dance, and you're suggesting that he not try to learn its steps. You have no empathy for this guy at all.

&gt; They're spending endless hours learning routines and tactics

Again, PUA is about routines and tactics. TRP is about the underlying theory.

&gt; that have roughly the same success rate as being a decent fucking person. 

Which logical fallacy is this? I always forget. You assume here that the two choices are, (1) TRP or (2) being a decent fucking person. ""Pick one because you can't be both!""

I reject your artificial binary. I proclaim that I am a decent person. I am always kind, considerate, and friendly.

&gt; Women are wise to this shit. The Game came out, like, 10 years ago. My wife knows all about 'negging' and 'demonstrating value' and 'closing' from Jezebel and Feministing.

Uh huh. Well, allow me to let you in on a little secret: the day that Jezebel of Feministing start publishing articles advising women to head down to the library and gather up the meek, studious men that will respect them and value them, TRP will disappear from the face of the Earth. \*poof\* gone. You guys win.

Instead, women bloggers (sorry, I don't have an example handy from jezebel) publish [advice like this](http://www.xojane.com/sex/9-dudes-to-do-before-you-die-i-mean-get-married) and as I keep telling you, guys like OP see that and they recognize on their own what's up. They see this pattern long before they stumble on TRP.

You're wife knows all about game, huh? But she's still attracted to very specific things unless she's an outlier. Plenty of women are ""wise to this shit"" and yet still say things like, ""ugh, I can't believe that creep tried game on me last night - BTW, I went home with those two hot bartenders! #crazynight #walkofshame #raisehell""

Remember [this blog that I linked to above](http://freenortherner.wordpress.com/2013/10/18/one-more-condom-in-the-landfill/)? Please read it. That's *why* TRP exists. Your jezebel and feministing and similar sites are telling women to go for a tiny minority of guys. OP is left out in the cold and being given the advice in that blog.

That's the issue you have to solve if you don't want people going to TRP.

&gt; you'll meet a person in the course of regular life that will mean so much more than hundreds of random hook-ups ever could. 

That is true. I mean, it's bad advice, but it's totally true.

OP, if you keep doing what you're doing, then you will ""in the course of regular life"" get a girl. You'll be about 35 - she may be a year or two older, and she'll see you not as a great catch but as a fallback option. She will reminisce about the hot guys she dated before you and the amazing experiences that she had - and she will never love you the same way. And I say this not as a criticism of her. It'll be your fault, because you are and always will be boring. You will never inspire the kind of raw animal lust that you fantasize about. You will waste your life and you'll always feel that something is missing.

**Topic 2: Recognition** 
******************************

**#7: How do I calculate my gain or loss?** *
Gain or loss is calculated first on each bitcoin transaction, then on an aggregate basis by combining all your gains and losses to produce a net figure.  Your tax preparation software will automatically perform these calculations, so the actual mechanics aren't really necessary for you to understand.  However, you'll have to know the basics in order to enter the correct information into the software. 

Basically, gain or loss is computed by taking the sales price of each bitcoin and subtracting its cost.  The technical terms are “amount realized” and “basis.”  Although simple in concept, determining amount realized and basis can be quite complex, as we’ll see below.  
 

*Edit:  A good tool for calculating your gain or loss in bitcoin transactions is available for free at www.bitcointaxes.info.*   


**#8: What is my Basis?**  

Generally, basis is equal to cost.  So, if you purchase 1 BTC for $500, then your basis is $500.  You can also add to this amount any acquisition costs like broker commissions or wire transfer fees.   So, let's assume a 1% fee and a $5 wire transfer fee.  This would mean your basis is $500 + $5 + $5 = $510.00.  If you later sell that bitcoin for $900, your gain would be [$900] - [$510] = [$390]. 


**#9: How do I determine my basis in each bitcoin?** *

If you’ve acquired bitcoins at different times and at different prices, determining basis can be quite complex.  This is because bitcoins are fungible.  Once a bitcoin is purchased, it becomes indistinguishable from the other bitcoins stored in the same wallet or account.  In a subsequent sale or exchange, there is no way to trace the cost or acquisition date of the bitcoin being transferred out.  
 
Contrary to what you might have heard, it is not acceptable to arbitrarily choose the bitcoin with the highest cost or most preferable tax impact.  The IRS requires you to use a system with rules that will produce a reasonable and consistent result.   The default system (and the one generally preferred by the IRS) is to assume that your bitcoins are sold in the order they were acquired.  Thus, the first bitcoin you purchase is assumed to be first bitcoin you sell.  This is called the FIFO method (""First in, First Out"").   

There are some other methods available, such as LIFO (""Last In, First Out"") and Average Cost Basis, but it’s not clear if bitcoins are eligible for these alternatives.   So, I would caution against using any system other than FIFO without guidance from a tax advisor or instructions from the IRS.  ~~Note: If bitcoins are classified as a foreign currency, then it becomes possible to use any method you want, as long as the chosen method is reasonable, you use it year-to-year, and it does not always give you the bitcoin with the highest cost available.  As discussed below, it is still uncertain whether bitcoins can qualify as a foreign currency, so again I must urge caution in deciding to take this position.~~ *Edit:  IRS Notice 2014-21 clarified that bitcoins are not a foreign currency for income tax purposes.*
 
I'll note that it's theoretically possible to avoid this problem altogether if you keep each and every bitcoin purchase in separate wallets or accounts.  This would allow you to trace the actual cost of each bitcoin you later sell or exchange, alleviating the need for the FIFO (or alternative) method.        
 
Either way, determining cost will require some detailed record keeping.  I will discuss record keeping in more detail below, but remember that the burden to prove basis is on you.  The IRS will not give you the benefit of the doubt here.  If you cannot prove the cost of each bitcoin, they will assume it was $0.  Obviously you don't want that to happen, so keep good records of your bitcoin purchases. 


**#10: What if I mined my bitcoins, what is my basis then?**
 
IRS Notice 2014-21 clarifies the treatment for bitcoin miners.  Specifically, miners must recognize income for each bitcoin mined during the taxable year.  The amount of income is equal to the market price of bitcoin on the day it is awarded on the blockchain.  This also becomes the miner's basis in the bitcoin going forward and will be used to calculate gain/loss in the future when the bitcoin is sold.  

For example, assume you mine 1 bitcoin in 2013.  On the day it was mined, the market price of bitcoin was $1,000.  You have $1,000 of taxable income in 2013.  Going forward, your basis in the bitcoin is $1,000.  If you later sell the bitcoin for $1,200, you have a taxable gain of $1,200 - $1,000 = $200.  See below for the character of this gain. 

You mining expenses, such as electricity, would not be included into basis.  Instead, they would be deductible in the taxable year as an expense.  Miners will need to determine if their mining activity rises to the level of a trade or business, which is a highly factual determination. 

~~This is a very difficult question to answer with any degree of certainty.  The problem is that bitcoin mining is a completely unique activity that yields an even more unique  product.   To reach an answer, one must resolve some difficult tax issues.  Namely, what is bitcoin mining and how do we classify the bitcoins it produces?~~  

~~Unfortunately, addressing these two issues would be a lengthy and detailed post in itself, so I cannot fully address them here.   Suffice it to say that bitcoin miners will need a very competent tax advisor to make sure their gains are properly reported.~~

~~Not to leave you without any guidance whatsoever, the answer will most likely depend on the size and scope of your mining activity.  Large scale miners should probably treat themselves as a manufacturing business, and the bitcoins they produce as inventory held for sale to customers.  Such bitcoin miners would not determine their gains in the same manner as normal investors.  They would compute income at the end of the year by figuring their  total sales and then subtracting ""cost of goods sold.""  The latter would take into account the cost of producing bitcoins, such as electricity.  Other expenses, like depreciation on the mining rig, would presumably be deductible as an ordinary business expenses.  Obviously this implicates some complex accounting rules that are far beyond this post.  A tax advisor with some knowledge of these rules would be needed to accurately determine your tax liability.~~  
 
~~Smaller mining operations  can probably get away with treating their mining as an ""activity for the production of income,"" as opposed to a manufacturing business.  In such a case, they would follow the same rules for determining gain or loss as normal investors.  I suspect their basis in this case would be determined by allocating their mining costs on a pro rata basis, assuming they can reasonably track and allocate such expenses (like electricity).   The safest and most conservative approach, on the other hand, would be to use a basis of zero.   Depreciation and other indirect expenses would likely be deductible as an itemized expense, similar to a general investor (see below).~~  

~~I must emphasize that neither of these treatments is a perfect fit.  I expect different tax advisors to reach different conclusions on the correct treatment.  The goal in any case is to use the best method of matching income to expenses, whatever that is.  Presumably the IRS will respect your chosen method as long as you can convincingly argue that it is the best at accomplishing this goal.~~    
 

**#11: What if I received my bitcoins as payment, what is my basis then?** 

If you sell goods or services and accept bitcoin as payment, your basis in those bitcoins is equal their fair market value at the time they were received.  Generally, this is determined by reference to the average market price on that day.  Thus, if you wrote a software program for someone and received 1 BTC as payment on November 1st, your basis in those bitcoins is equal to the average price of 1 BTC on that day.  

The choice of which exchange to use for this purpose (e.g. Mt. Gox, Bitstamp, etc.) is up to you.  Whichever exchange you choose,  you should have a reasonable explanation for your choice.  You should also stick with that choice when computing your gains in the future.    Arbitrarily picking exchange prices that best suit your tax interests will not be acceptable to the IRS in a subsequent audit. 

**#12: What if I received my bitcoins as a gift, what is my basis then?** *
It depends.  Generally, you inherit the basis of anything given to you as a gift.  This means you would take the same basis as the friend who gave you the bitcoins.  However, an important exception applies if the friend’s basis was more than the market value of the bitcoins at the time of the gift (i.e. the bitcoins had a built in loss).

In that case, you would wait to determine your basis until you sell or exchange the gifted bitcoins in the future.   When the time comes, you would use the following rules: 

* First, calculate your gain/loss using your friend’s basis.  

* If this results in a gain, then the default rule applies and nothing changes.     

* If this results in a loss, however, then you do not inherit your friend’s basis.  Instead, you must use the market value of the bitcoins on the date of the gift and recalculate your gains/loss.   

* After recalculating, you must check if you still have a loss.  If yes, then proceed with using the market value as your basis.  However, if the recalculation results in a gain, then the tax law says to ignore the gain and report nothing.  To be clear, you have no gain or loss in this situation.  

Now that last point might confuse many readers, so here is an example to demonstrate.   Assume you received bitcoins worth $750 at the time of the gift.  Your friend’s basis was $1000.  This triggers the exception discussed above and you have to wait until you sell the bitcoins in the future to determine your basis.  Consider three alternative sale prices: 

* Sale Price = $1200.  Using your friend’s basis of $1000, this creates a gain of $200.  Therefore, you inherit your friend’s basis and have a realized gain of $200.  No problem.  

* Sales Price = $600.  Using your friend’s basis of $1000, this creates a loss of $400.  Therefore, you cannot inherit your friend’s basis.   Instead, you must use the value of the bitcoins on the date of the gift, which was $750.  Therefore, you have a loss of $150.  No Problem.  

* Sales Price of $900.  Using your friend’s basis of $1000, this creates a loss of $100.  Therefore, you cannot use your friend’s basis.  Instead, you must recalculate your gain/loss using the value of bitcoin on the date of the gift.  Now you have a gain of $150.  Therefore, you disregard the sale and have no gain or loss to report.  

This is a perplexing tax treatment.  It might help to think of this rule as preventing your friend from shifting bitcoin losses to your tax return.  This is why you get to inherit his basis only if it would create a gain on the subsequent sale.  If not, then the amount of his loss is extinguished and you get to recognize only the amount of loss that accrued after the gift occurred.  This also explains why you would have no gain or loss if the market price of bitcoin has increased since the time of the gift but is still less than your friend’s original basis.    

In any case, when receiving bitcoins as a gift, make sure to ask the person what his or her basis was in the bitcoin, as well as their acquisition date (which you always inherit).   Lastly, write down the date of the gift and the market price of bitcoins on that day.  

~~#12:~~ **#13: How do I determine  Amount Realized (i.e. Sales Price)?** 

This depends on the transaction and if you sold bitcoins for cash or exchanged them for goods/services.  

In the case of a sale, amount realized is equal to sales price, less any selling costs you incur in the transaction (like commissions or wire transfer fees).  So, if you sell a bitcoin for $900 and incur a 1% transaction fee, your amount realized is $900 - $9 = $891.00.  

If you exchanged bitcoins for goods or services (instead of selling them), then amount realized is more complicated.  This is essentially a barter transaction, where the default rule is to use the fair market value of the goods or services received in the exchange.  For example, if you purchased a laptop on November 29th with bitcoins, your amount realized would be equal to the Fair Market Value of the laptop on that date.  The easiest way to determine Fair Market Value is by reference to the sales price, although an alternative method can be used if yields a more accurate value.  

Presumably, the sales price of most goods or services will be denominated in dollars (even though payment is made in bitcoin).  Thus, if the laptop's price was $1,500, you can safely assume that it's FMV was also $1,500. If the sales price is denominated in bitcoin (instead of dollars), you'll have to convert it into dollars using the average exchange price on that day.  As mentioned above, the choice of which exchange to use for this purpose (e.g. Mt. Gox, Bitstamp, etc.) is up to you.  The most conservative option would be to use the price from the exchange that you purchased the bitcoin in the first place.  Whichever exchange you choose,  you should have a reasonable explanation for your choice.  You should also stick with that choice when computing your gains in the future.    Arbitrarily picking exchange prices that best suit your tax interests will not be acceptable to the IRS in a subsequent audit. 


**TL; DR:** Gain is determined by subtracting basis from amount realized.  Basis is generally equal to cost, but special rules must be followed (such as FIFO) if your bitcoins are mixed together.  Amount realized is generally equal to sales price.  If goods or property were received instead of cash, then amount realized is equal to the FMV of the property received.

Suprisingly, the most troubling aspect is the shock, the defeated expectations - the realization of another shitty thing to worry about, the need to rethink your outlook - which will be a less optimistic one the more you know. It's like getting ensurance/warranty for something and finding out it's useless - you just have to be more selective.

It's actually in society's best interest for men to be blissfully unaware of how women actually conduct themselves. This way men can work and be  productive members of society without all those extra sources of stress. Women embraced it since a good image is crucial to their social succes.

The thing is most RP theory is nothing new and revolutionary, these things were known hundreds of years ago, just read some philosophy. The only thing that changed in the last couple of decades is the social discourse, in the last 50 or so years postmodernist blowhards have been endlessly pushing down society's throats that women are special bastions of all that's good and fair in the world and men are dumb animals that need to be less *themselves*.

**That's why the answer is nothing new either. All the naive bullshit has done is to shift your mentality from individuality and self-validation, to woman-centric view and dependent on outside validation (women - through sex).**

**As long as the most important parts of your life aren't centered around women (and their loyalty), then the damage will be minimal - if it goes bad.**

**If possible, don't get married, don't cohabitate, build a vast social circle, with a couple of really close friends (the type that you can really depend on), have fulfilling hobbies/interest and a dream in life (not just professionally). Attain wealth and power if you can (but don't consume every second of your life trying)**

If you really want a LTR/marriage situation, learn to pick up on red flags...even pink flags, small things get more annoying after 10 years together. Read a lot of material on psychology and behavioural science, learn to be an excellent judge of character. 

**Test potential mates, it's not manipulative to find out who you're spending the rest of your days with - ignore the shaming caused by this - low quality women hate being vetted, it makes them doubt their (over-inflated ) worth. If a woman gets angry for something she does herself (testing you) she's not LTR material.**

**Tests:**

* **Sympathy tests** - great for avoiding alpha fucks beta bux - women generally lack (beyond superficial levels) the ability to  care for anything that does not affect themselves (or their children). So fake a personal issue that affects you (and not at all her) deeply, see if her instinct is to support you and care for you. If she shows indifference/repulsion/pretends to care - either means your value in her eyes is not high enough - in which case hypergamy will be ruthless to you, or she lacks the ability to pair bond (bad at LTRs)

* **Loyalty tests** - she mentioned/showed signs that she considers someone you know attractive ? Have him hit on her (or any equivalents), see how she reacts - does she shut him down? does she respond in a non-decisive way ? does she tell you about it?. A woman who clearly respects her man is a woman with a higher ability to control her hypergamy.

* **Compliance tests** - make a couple of irrational demands (not illegal) with conviction, making sure she understands how important those requests (you made of her) are to you. She asks why, you tell her **""because it's important to me""**. The more argumentative a woman is over big things, the higher chance of her being argumentative/combative over the small things once that ""harder to leave"" contract is signed (marriage). Any woman worth spending your life with will gladly submit/self-sacrifice a bit to show her commitment to you.

* **Hypergamy tests** - purposefully act like a beta for a couple of weeks, be indecisive, follow her around the house, ask for her approval/validation, be emotional and reactive, supplicate and pedestilize her - flowers and gifts and all that jazz. A quality woman will tell you (first in a covert way then in an over way) that your behaviour is a turn-off, and she'll give you time to bounce back before reacting accordingly to your new self. If the sex stops suddenly and she gets cold/distant, that woman's attraction (and respect) for your is fragile - most likely the type of woman who will never stop shit testing you - very hypergamous types.

**Also look for good habits, like having a healthy lifestyle (diet and exercise), a great relationship with her father (in general with her family), low prevalence of sex outside of relationships  -&gt; higher chance to pair bond.**

**Red Flags - character**

* any signs of a  disorder - eating/[personality disorders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality_disorder) - learn to recognize them.

* arrogant

* argumentative - it's gets old real fast.

* bitchyness - it's not cute, and it does not mean she's just opinionated.

* feminist

* ""sex positive"" - rebranding of the word slut

* victim (abuse)  - you don't need all that trauma hanging over your happyness - pick a happy and balanced partner.

**Red Flags - past**

* party girl 

* relationships with criminals  - she's heavily into bad boys, and you'll never be as bad without breaking some laws.

* single mom - just common sense - why sign up for extra baggage and beta bux.

* split-roasted/gangbanged - she's just not the ""brunch with hubby"" type.

* unfeminine/large tatoos - sign of a past that includes the above


**Red flags - behaviour**

* excessive attention seeking - especially male attention

* excessive social network use - sign of the above

* emotional eating - chances of getting fat come wall.

* keeps in touch with exes - hypergamous 

* keeps orbiters beyond 6 months into the relationship - hypergamous + lack of respect.

* uses sex as a reward/currency - deems you low value (or just beta bux)

* tries to guilt you into spending less time/cutting ties with your friends - classic cunt.

* nagging - it can only get worse once married

* overly eager to give you sex  - if you get a weird vibe, like she's trying fake a ultra high sex drive - standard beta bait for marriage - pretty much any time she seems to have sex with your for anything other than sex/intimacy it's a bad sign.

**Red Flags - social circle** 

* party girls / ex party girls - needs no explanation

* divorced women - there was a study posted around here - in short- divorced women praise other women who get divorced (self-validation ahoy)

* mostly male friends (withhout having male interests/profession) - hypergamy/need for male attention.

* lack of female friends - women can spot a bad seed - and shun it.

* radical feminists/social justice types - if she's attractive this won't be the case, but if it is, she's probably some sort of crazy/messed up.

TRUE,hurrrppp,,,"Got herpes 3.5 years ago from my ex-bf at the start of our relationship. Hadn't slept with anyone for a year prior and had gotten the blood test during that time and was negative for hsv-2 then. So I definitely know the source. 

We always had used condoms. One night, we had really passionate sex that involved a lot of grinding. Started feeling off down there and noticed a lot of clear, odorless discharge over the next week. Things became really painful and it hurt to pee. 

Went to the doctor who took one look and confirmed Yep, herpes. I'm lucky to have had a compassionate nurse practitioner who was kind about it, I've since met others whose doctor treated them coldly and slut-shamed them for being there.

Peeing, shitting, walking around, sitting down, and pretty much everything else were very painful for the next 3 weeks even though I immediately started talking antivirals (which control the symptoms but obviously don't cure the virus). Bumps didn't look nearly as bad as they felt. I continue to get fairly frequent, painful outbreaks to this day and stress is a big trigger. 

My boyfriend had always been asymptomatic and had no idea he had it. He got the blood test after my outbreak and it came back positive. Run-of-The-mill tests do not look for herpes by the way.

We were together until about 6 months ago. Dating with it has sucked. I've always been honest about having it because there is no other way. I did get rejected for it by someone I really liked. 

After a bit, I realized that I only wanted to date others with herpes anyway because I am very paranoid about giving it to someone. Have tried a herpes dating website with little success so far. Sort of giving up on dating for now. 

It's weird, I'm an attractive young woman and it's kind of a mindfuck when guys are into me and I know there's a good chance that they will do a complete 180 if I tell them. Casual stuff is off the table. 

I always remind myself that people have worse problems, though. And at least I can afford the medication, heard shitty stories about people who cannot. 

TL; DR got it from an ex-boyfriend, was pretty bad though the worst part is the stigma and not the physical pain. Haven't given it to anyone else.

TRUE,Plaptor,,,"I was a child of rape, but not by my father's fault.

My dad married my mom in the late 80s, and she already had two children, to which she was already abusive to. My dad also suffered from the abuse, mostly emotional, but it would get physical, as well, with all of us. She held me up against a wall by my throat in third grade because I forgot my math homework once. I remember growing up she had shoved my dad, and he pushed her away in self defense (my dad is/was a BIG guy, and former military; I believe he only let the abuse continue because she broke his spirit) and she fell against a wall, ""hurting her elbow"" and whined she would call the police on him. He ended up turning himself in, and nothing happened as a result. Both my half siblings had ran away from home before I was five, so I grew up mostly as an only-child. Once, when she was with her first husband (who was an alcoholic), she had called her sister/brother in law, broke a wine glass in the background and told them that he was beating her. When they went to help her, they discovered she had actually poorly put fireplace soot on her face to look like a bruise, and that her husband was passed out in the bathroom by himself for the last several hours. He had never touched her.

My mom would kick my dad out of the house for a few weeks only to beg him to come back. When he was gone, she would take the credit card (in his name) and purposefully buy everything she could to rack up his debt. He finally stopped moving back in when I was about 14, where he stayed at a family members', and I could still talk to him. Although, everytime I did, mom would hound me about what happened and what he said and if I would spy on him for her.

That day, at 14, I sat in his lap crying when he said he wouldn't be back in the house for a long time. He grabbed my hand and compared it to is. We both have very square palms, and he pointed it out. It was how he knew I resembled him. It was the first time, and the last, I ever saw him cry. I remember this very vividly. He kissed my forehead and said, ""The only reason I ever stuck around was because of you."" There were a lot of tears, and I still get a bit dewy eyed. Both my dad and I are very reserved and emotionally silent people, and we rarely, if at all, talk about how we feel/have felt. It's hard for us to do. So the day he said that was a very deep and profound moment in our relationship. If we ever have a ""moment,"" he will still grab my hand and look at it and compare it to his.

I didn't understand how far the abuse went with him until I was older. Mom had told me several times in my lifetime (almost became habitual) that I was worth nothing, I was a flake, I shouldn't have finished high school, et cetera. She told me my only purpose to having me was to keep dad around, multiple times. She used to lock me in my room so that I wouldn't hear/witness her berating him (she wanted HIM to be the bad guy, always), but I always could. She would say things like ""You don't have a sack"" or things like, ""your dick never did work, never will, because you're useless, you aren't a man,"" et cetera. Upon maturing, and talking to my dad's current girlfriend (who is also a former therapist, but they were NOT patient/doctor) that my mom forced my dad into sex to become pregnant with me, which she knew would keep him around (as he was trying to leave her) and it worked.

The divorce was finalized early in 2013, after I turned 21, and after years of my mom refusing to sign papers or changing her mind. He is stuck with the debt that she piled up. I live with him and his girlfriend. Because of the abuse he had, he doesn't sleep in the same room as her. After talking to her, I learned they've never even had sex, even though they've been living together for a year and a half and dating for two. She moved from Indiana to Oklahoma to be with him. It's mostly companionship that they share. But he loves her. I know he does. I see it in his eyes, and I've never seen him love someone before.

Growing up that way has also shaped how I make relationships with people - I fear marriage, conception, and the entire idea of settling down with anyone feels threatening and scary. I was always happiest when I was single, though that has recently begun to change.

I always had a really great relationship with my dad. He was there where mom wasn't - when I expressed interest in softball, he took time off work to take coaching classes and helped me to competative. Mom showed up to one game and before it started she asked if she could go home. He ALWAYS showed interest in what I loved. I remember that when I got super into pokemon, he poured money into the cards and would play with me. He even took me to the Top Deck nearby, where if you win games you got stamps towards a badge, and he would always put his stamps in my book (I wasn't very good, so I lost a lot :P). He did this with everything - magic, dnd, sports, books, video games. He was really the only reason I got to where I am today. I only figured it out within the last couple months what had really happened. 

At 17 I moved in with dad. I graduated HS with a high GPA, got a full scholarship (but didn't finish college - I found a full time job I am happy with), I had some writings published in a local magazine during highschool, I got offered a lot of money for some artwork, I got promoted at my job a few times stupidly fast, and I'm saving up for an appartment with my boyfriend, who is awesome. And yeah, we'll be having seperate rooms, but that's because I like to have my space, and he does to. I'm not closed off sexually, like my dad, so our sex life is awesome; half my blog is about sex. But I still have some of his habits. 

So fuck you mom. I grew up and got awesome and I like awesome things, and dad's happy and is still awesome, and has an awesome girlfriend that calls me Sweet Pea or Mouse, and she got me an eeyore feetie pajama suit that I wear ALL THE TIME 'CAUSE FUCKIN AWESOME, and she got me a leather bound Sherlock Holmes set for christmas, BECAUSE SHE KNOWS IT'S MY FAVORITE BOOK, and you're still a loser, and none of your kids or grand kids like to talk to you because you literally ruin everything you touch, and you don't give a shit about anything but yourself. GLHF

**TLDR: Mom raped my father, who stayed around for twenty years to ensure I had a happy life. Dad's awesome with an awesome girlfriend. I love him.**

TRUE,heybrochillout,,,"To be honest, the problem with TRP is the angry young men, who feel betrayed by the world. When you have lots of angry young men around one place shit tends to go down. To simplify it a bit, the whole philosophy is just being a man in the traditional sense. Having a character. Being confident and independent man. It's really nothing revolutionary.

Except it is for these guys. Most of the guys there are the bit socially awkward nice guys who wrote a poem to the pretty girl from your highschool class. They haven't been succesful. I'm not saying that writing poems never works, but it sure as fuck doesn't work for the guys at TRP. 

They are the guys who always asked the girl what does she want to do, what does she want to eat, always asking without ever catching on that they didn't care that much, as long as it was with them. Being bombarded with questions gets old really fucking quick, and then their relations ended in various ways. And then there comes the broken hearts and questioning oneself why did they get dumped? He was so good for her!

They are the guys who tried to attract the girl they had a crush on for years by being nice and good friend. They didn't see that they were forming a good friendship while her romantical interests were aimed at other guys basically the whole time. It's not like she or their friends hadn't probably catched on, but she simply didn't want to ruin a good friendship and drive away a nice guy she wasn't interested at. And as a bonus it's pretty nice to have a minion who does whatever you say. ""We should just be friends, I don't want to ruin our friendship!"" She would say after he finally gathered the courage to confess his obvious feelings.

And then the nice guys get angry at the world. They deserve to get the girls they borderline stalked for years. They should bath in pussy because they're so great guys. I mean they were told to be like that. In the stories they heard as a child the good guy got the princess. In the tv the good guy won. In the movies the good guy got the girl. And then they catch on that those were mere fantasies of the good guys writing the stories.

Somehow they end up finding the red pill. Finally something seems to be in line with their own experiences. ""Holy shit!"" they go, I want to know more! They bleed their hearts out and tell all their worst stories about women, and the likeminded reply with their own. People who don't agree with their opinions get banned and posts deleted, the ones that don't end up downvoted by the hivemind. An echo chamber forms where likeminded people are chanting their own beliefs louder and louder, and as a result it confirms their beliefs more and more. They get immersed in their own TRP world, read more and then contribute with their new views. It's a vicious circle.


The problem isn't about the base philosophy of being a man and having some fucking character to yourself. The problem is that some of those guys are fucking obnoxious. They go and replace ""nice"" with ""arrogant"" and have some minor success with that, and then they believe they have cracked the fucking code.

Edit: Unfortunately I don't have a copy of a safety plan from my work to share but [this site](http://www.domesticviolence.org/personalized-safety-plan/) could get you started if this is a problem in your life. Practice your plan when possible and have a code word with at least one person you trust that means ""It's time, I'm leaving."" Avoid confrontations in restricted spaces and especially the kitchen, where there are many possible weapons. 

Edit again: Someone below posted some good advice which was let go of your stuff if it's too dangerous to get it back. Your and maybe your children's safety is more important. Dealing with a pet in these times is particularly difficult. Try to find someone willing to take it in because some abusers will kill pets or use threats to a pet's safety to lure you back. There are some people/places that will temporarily take in pets, but it is rare.

The comment above is well written and internally coherent, which makes it persuasive in a debate. It is also almost pure bullshit. To keep this from becoming too long, I'll stick to one example. 

&gt;Hell, you can cut open people's brains and see the differences!

In reality, there are statistically detectable differences between male and female brains. Same holds for psychology. But ""statistically"" is the operative word. And correlation levels are... poor. I'll use a little bit of math. If you aren't fond of maths, don't worry - it's very little indeed, and easy to understand if you go along with it. 

Let's say that ""studies show"" that an ""average"" woman is different from an ""average"" man in characteristics X, Y, Z. More precisely, a woman is 12% more likely to be X, 15% more likely to be Y, and 28% more likely to be Z. 

TheRedPill approach is based on this kind of correlation - ""women are XYZ, men are not."" And they will pull up studies that show such, and they will then insist that their views are ""scientific."" 

However, what happens when you meet an actual woman? Multiply the probabilities: 0.12 x 0.15 x 0.28 = 0.005. This tells you that the woman you just met has about 0.5% chance (five in a thousand) of actually being ""more XYZ"" than the average man.  

Then ask yourself: how do you compare to that average man? ""Women are more emotional?"" Even if the average woman is more emotional than the average man (and that is debatable), have you ever objectively measured your ""emotionality"" (however you define that word)? Yes, you think you are super rational - but that is what we call ""self-reported evidence,"" one of the weakest kinds of evidence there is. 

Let's do a few objective tests and see how you hold up! And then, after an objective measurement, it may turn out that your actual level of emotionality is higher than than that of an average woman. It might be lower. But how good was the test? Did the woman take the same one? And all of this will tell you absolutely nothing about how you compare in emotionality (or anything else) with one *particular* woman you've just met. Unless you make her take the test.

And this holds even before you enter into the questions of how the studies were done, whether conclusions of a particular study are really valid, and whether the correlation estimate actually holds water. Which weakens the whole thing further. 

***

Hell. Let's end this with some actual advice. 

In reality, ""women"" as a category are so diverse that you can't derive any conclusions whatsoever. Which then brings us to the question of how TRP works, in the extent that it does?

By producing confidence. 

This helps in two ways. First, confidence is attractive (this is *not* a female characteristic; men are more likely to be your friends and to think highly of you if you have a healthy level of self-confidence). Second, you miss 100% of shots you don't try. If you are more confident, you try more often, and sooner or later you succeed. 

You *can* do this with a system such as TRP. If you really believe in it, then you believe you have figured ""them"" out, and that gives you confidence. And you go out and try. And if it works, you chalk that success up to TRP. This is how most of PUAs and TRPers get to where they are.

But, as you can see from bitterness that fairly drips from the comments in TRP, this has side-effects. Basing your philosophy on the ""fact"" that the majority of women are a certain way, you end up selecting a certain subset of women. Which tends to be... let's say, not the most desirable one, at least not to most people. If you base your approach on the idea that women are bitchy, insecure and neurotic, guess what kind of woman you'll end up with? It's a self-fulfilling prophecy. 

Instead, consider this: a woman is as attracted to you as you would be to a female version of yourself. If you are (for example) average looking, horribly awkward, and uncomfortable in large groups - look around. See that average looking, horribly awkward girl looking uncomfortable in a large group? There is no reason you should expect any girl to be more attracted to you then you are to that girl. 

Figure out what are your good traits and what are the bad ones; put the good ones to the forefront, and start working on the bad ones. And then bootstrap yourself some confidence without relying on bullshit like TRP. Start with small things, work up, one step at a time. Don't punish yourself for failures, just keep going forward and keep trying. 

It is the same approach that applies to a vast majority of things in life. There are no real shortcuts. You want that degree, you have to work your way through college. You want to be fit, you have to put in the time in the gym. You want to learn a language, you have to practice it. And if you want a worthwhile woman, you need to become a worthwhile man, and keep working on attracting what you desire.

They have the biggest selection and usually have some of the more limited stuff stashed in the back, so be sure to ask around. The third place I hit every week is Craft Wine and beer on Martin St. They have a large indoor cooler and will open bottles to drink in the store. They're the most expensive, but it's a very small company and I really appreciate what they do. If you're downtown Sparks the 7-11 on Victorian is ran by a beer geek and has an impressive stock for a gas station



For taps- Total Wine has a growler station with ten different beers and sell growlers for a decent price. I picked up a 32 oz of Black Butte XXV for $8.50 this afternoon! Craft Wine and Beer also has three taps and also do growler fills in addition to having a bar. The craft bar scene is pretty much concentrated to downtown- St. James Infirmary has decent selection, as does Public House, and I believe Waterfall has 20 taps. Ole Bridge Pub also has a few taps and a bottle list There's also Sierra taphouse which has all Sierra Nevada beers on tap and a decent bottle selection. The other bar I'd recommend is Chapel which is uptown a few miles, but they have good selection and Wookie Jack as of Wednesday. The last place here off the top of my head that's good for beer is the 775 Gastropub in the Meadowwood Mall. Good tap selection, but ridiculous mark up on the bottles. I don't think any of the bars will do growler fills


The local breweries here aren't too bad. There's Great Basin in Sparks with a Reno location, Brazier St. James which is near downtown, Silverpeak which is downtown, and BrewBrothers which is downtown in one of the casinos.

TRUE,Khayembii,,,"I'm not ever over at TRP.  I don't subscribe to it and I've seen some seriously misogynistic shit come out of there.  So I am in no way defending TRP.  However, I think it's unfair to characterize ""the seduction community"" in a single manner as if it's a monolithic entity.  That's just not the case.  For example, there is a (largely dead nowadays) section that focuses on - literally - what to say to a women, and finding great quotes to copypasta.  This started in the 90's before you could just look that shit up on the internet, and was probably the infancy of ""the seduction community"".

Then there's a section that focuses on just getting laid, and is misogynistic and puts forward a very aggressive and (to smart women) demeaning style of seduction that you're talking about.

And then there's a section that focuses a lot on inner game and identifying men's relationship with women as a facet of their overall experience, and connects this relationship with being a great man (person) generally.

So anyways, the idea of talking about ""negging"" and all the slang that is used is actually a way of deconstructing the way that people communicate with one another.  It's not demeaning inherently to analyze how flirting works.  And these different sections will have different ideas of what ""negging"" means just like different groups of guys will have different ideas on how to flirt.  None of them are absolutely right or wrong, it just depends on who's in the conversation.

I hate when people say that seduction is about ""manipulating"" women.  That's just so unbelievably wrong.  Women, for the most part, are from puberty bombarded with sexual advances in all forms.  They have guys coming at them, and because of it they learn very quickly how to deal with the opposite sex - for the most part - when it comes to flirting, how to tell a guy you're not interested, how to talk to guys when you're attracted to them, etc.  They have to learn this stuff in order to navigate daily social interactions.

Guys don't get that.  They don't have the experience of being bombarded with female advances.  Most guys consider it a memorable event when an attractive girl starts blatantly flirting with him.  The only way we learn to deal with women is by going out and actually pursuing them.  And every single guy on the street holds some level of fear, some level of insecurity, about doing this.  The fear/uncomfortability holds a lot of men back from interacting with women in a sexual way, and because of this they simply don't know how to flirt with women, or tell them they're attracted to them.  They're completely oblivious to social cues that women make in this regard, which is why so often men are painted as simplistic, straight-forward and unable to understand subtlety.

But that's not true at all.  They see the cues clearly for the most part, but they just don't know what they mean and even if they do, they don't know how to respond.  The only method of learning at their disposal is trial-and-error, and that requires trying in the first place!

I was one of these guys.  I was shy, nervous around attractive women, didn't think they were interested in me, missed obvious cues, etc.  Seduction helped me because it was basically like a blueprint on how to interact with women you're attracted to.  Not in the sense of ""if she does this you say that"" but in the sense of ""here's how flirting works"" and ""if she does this she might be interested in you, push her a little bit and see how she responds"" and ""ribbing a girl a little (negging) is a great way to start banter which is a good way of flirting, but make sure she knows you're doing it because you're interested in her and not just doing it to be funny"".  This isn't ""manipulating"" women or the interaction, it's *learning how to interact with women in the first place*.

(BTW, as I said before, I'm not defending seduction in general but just what I found useful about it)

As I read more into it, I got really attracted to the inner game stuff that Pook and RSD were putting out, particularly Pook's book and RSD's *Blueprint Decoded*.  I don't remember what was in it specifically, but I do remember that they were about how to gain confidence in your life, how to feel powerful and good about yourself, how to learn to be happy by yourself, how to not depend on getting girls for happiness (or let failure with girls make you unhappy), etc.  This is really powerful stuff that's been talked about for centuries, just packaged to guys that want to learn to interact with women without feeling extremely nervous/awkward or fearing that they'll be labeled a creep.

Now here's an interesting one.  

Gender Swapped Ranma 1/2

Now the easy answer is that nothing happens since Ranma embodies both genders.  But remember that girl type Ranma is still boy type on the inside.  So now we have to start over and take the exact same concept except Ranma is a girl from the outset and is a girl on the inside of her boy appearance.  Ranma would still likely have much of the same personality traits as before but is more sensitive to a lack of femininity.  In essence she would be teased as the new ""uncute"" girl and her circumstance as 1/2 boy doesn't help.  In many parts, the female ranma will take on many parts from the female Akane, now no longer.

The big change would from the supporting characters.  The 3 Tendo girls would do a reversal in their roles.  Akane who as a girl struggles with her lack of femininity would have to be completely different.  He would be a boy who is good at cooking but is terrible at sports and martial arts.  He would struggle with his masculinity.  Nabiki would stay the same conniving middle child.  Kasumi would be the most physically strong of the group.  Champion martial artist and takes no nonsense from anyone personality.  He is also the one that leaves the house the most.  

Ranma's suitors are almost entirely different as well.  The easy part would be to deal with the Kuno's.  Simply switch up the ages between Kuno and Kodachi.  The biggest change would be to focus less on love interest and focus more as them being martial arts rivals.  All of which have lost to Ranma as a boy type and demand rematches.  Ranma's rivals would be her best friends and her worst enemies.  Pretty much nothing changes on that regard.  Female Ryoga would pretty much be the same.  Female Mousse would likely be a lot more of a clutz as the glasses girl.  Kodachi would fill the role as the new main Kuno.

Now the hardest part would be to create the female Happousai.  The lecher role is traditionally reserved for a male role and Happoussai is king of anime lechers.  Female lecher doesn't work as well.  What could possibly work is that Happy does a role reversal with Cologne.  Making the patriarch of Chinese Martial Arts nothing more than the world's greatest perv.  The matriarch of the Anything-Goes Martial Arts is an old lady who knows of a technique or two to teach.  This would of course make the Anything Goes School a bit less of a source for comedy unless every technique is always ridiculous in concept but more than what they seem.

But basically the formula seems for a gender swapped Ranma is to role reverse or trade traits between existing character.

TRUE,phreakmonkey,,,"Disclaimer:  I'm an armchair aviation enthusiast (and pilot), but I'm not an aeronautical engineer.  Though I used to work for one!  So some of my information may be oversimplified or inaccurate.  
  
In my experience your crash was caused by two compounding factors:  
- It is very hard to gauge your rate of descent in vertical descents.  
- A multirotor is less stable in vertical descents because it is descending through its own prop-wash.  
  
""Prop wash"" is the term for the turbulent air created on the ""back"" side of a spinning rotor.  There are a few good ways to get an idea of how much turbulence is created by your props.  One of my favorites is to *carefully* fly the quad above yourself and feel the massive downdraft coming off of it.  (Disclaimer:  If you crash into your own head, you shouldn't have done that.)  Another is to fly over leaves, or smoke, or dust and see the disruption the air causes.  
  
Think of it this way- Newtonian physics says that in order to hover, your multirotor needs to be constantly pushing downward on the air with a force equal to its weight.  If your quad weights three pounds, that's a lot of air.  
  
In addition to the shear quantity of air being moved is the fact that it also creates turbulence in the process.  The propeller is a spinning airfoil.  As such, the tip of each blade is generating ""trailing vortices"" as it produces lift.(Google ""wingtip vorticies"" to read more about these.)  In addition to this, the rapidly moving air generates its own vortices where it meets the (relatively) still air around it.  
  
So, all this air movement creates a lot of ""rough"", turbulent conditions below your multirotor.  When you descend vertically, you're descending into this turbulent air, which your copter then has to try to compensate for to stay level.  
  
It's likely that flying level in this turbulent air requires more power, and as such more throttle, so it's likely that your vertical speed is actually going to increase initially as you descend into it from the relatively stable air above.  Add to this the fact that you have to fight both your descent rate and the turbulence in order to reduce your vertical speed, and you can see that it's possible to get into a situation where trying to reduce a fast descent can actually cause your flight controller to run out of ""control authority"" with which to make corrections against the turbulence.  
  
There are two basic ways to prevent this:  
  
1: Control your descent rate and don't let it get so high that it takes more than 75% throttle to stop it.   That leaves 25% of your power available for the flight controller to make level corrections.  Whether that is adequate depends on a lot of factors, including the size and weight of your copter and the size / effectiveness of the motor/prop combination you have.  
  
2: Don't descend vertically.  As others have suggested, descending while moving in any direction means you're effectively leaving your down-draft behind you and descending into smooth, stable air.  This prevents the exacerbation of loss of power and control authority caused by your own prop-wash.  
  
This is probably a good time to mention thrust-to-weight ratio.  If your copter has at least a 2:1 thrust-to-weight ratio then you can likely arrest any descent.   The higher the ratio, the easier it will be to stop a rapid descent in a short period.  Also, the more control authority your FC will have with which to fight turbulence.  
  
As your T:W ratio gets below 2:1, you start entering a situation where full power won't actually stop a descent above a certain speed within the amount of altitude you have.  At 1.2:1 it takes almost all of your power to hover, all of it to climb (leaving nothing for turbulence) and your ability to arrest a descent is nearly gone.  
  
It's fun to experiment with this phenomenon with micro-quads.  Add heavier and heavier weight to them and then see how carefully you have to descend before you lose control and it plummets back to the earth.  ;)  ",0,1388808403,,0,FALSE,1,cegv8pa,t3_1ud0be,t1_cegv8pa,t3_1ud0be,1431790858,15,FALSE,Multicopter,t5_2u9hy,15

TRUE,Blitzwire,,,"Logic games is really funny, because many of us just suck balls at them until one day we suddenly get it. Now, I'm not sure what resources you used to study, and a 155 in a month's worth of time is remarkably good in my opinion (depending on where your baseline falls anyways). Here are some tips I hope you'll find helpful:

* Isolate errors - are you consistently missing one type of question but acing the others? For instance, are you nailing the order questions but miserably failing the grouping questions? If so, you might want to orient your study strategy around getting specific question types down instead of doing broad studying.

* Using a guide - have you tried the Powerscore logic bible? It was a godsend for me when I was studying last May. Basically going through that got me from a -13 down to a -0 over the course of 3 weeks; and thats a -0 pretty consistently, with a -1 when I get sloppy and I always had at least 15min of free time after the practice sections

* Question review - try using LsatQA.com as a resource to troubleshoot your practice exams. They have very good analytics to break down where you need to focus your studying.

* Having a consistent strategy - this really comes down to diagramming. Whatever resource you use is going to have a certain way for you to diagram the sets, but you will find some ways counterintuitive and your mind really wanting to use a different form of diagrams. That's okay, embrace it! Work with your mind, not against it. That being said, be consistent. Don't flop between one diagram style and another, find what's good for you and stick with it. 

* Focus on conditional logic - this is really where Powerscore shines (albeit not for me personally since I took an intro to logic course at uni) but historically many of us stumble here. Mastering conditional logic not only helps you with 50% of the games (simple and complex grouping questions) but also translates well into other sections, especially logical reasoning.

TRUE,DashingLeech,,11Δ,"OK, I understand what you are trying to say but I think you've oversimplified to two extremes and missed the correct answer. You've extremized TRP, and PUAs in general, as merely a seduction community interested in getting casually laid and that is it. That is just flat out wrong. You also imply that following TRP or PUA approach is mutually exclusive from being ""kind, empathetic, and genuine"". This too is wrong. Many of your statements are very wrong, particularly about women as well.

I had always been the kind of guy to believe that *just* being a good person and treating women nicely was enough to attract them. I had a horrible time with women. When I got a girlfriend who stuck with me for awhile I clung to her, proposed, married her, and had a horrible 9 year marriage, the whole time trying harder and harder to please her. She ended up cheating on me with my best friend. I left her shortly after finding out.

I was determined to understand how to attract *quality* women better. I don't mean easy lays; I mean the cream of the crop: smart, attractive, funny, friendly, loving, competent, charming. I read a ton of books on the subject and it was all gimmicks. Nothing actually explained *why* women were different from men and what actually attracts them. Certainly they aren't attracted to men in the same way that men are attracted to women. That was very apparent to me for a long time, and is obvious throughout nature (sexual dimorphism).

Then I read a few *scientific* books on the matter: Sperm Wars (Robin Baker), The Mating Mind (Geoffrey Miller), and Red Queen (Matt Ridley). It all started falling into place. Having read The Selfish Gene and being knowledgeable in system dynamics and game theory, I understood the natural selection pressures that make our attractions different. But this still didn't give me insight into how to attract higher quality women.

When researching more books of the like I found these above books common on reading lists for something called PUAs. (This was 2005. I had no idea what it was.) In particular, these lists seemed related to somebody called David DeAngelo who had an ebook called ""Double Your Dating"". OK, sounded like more of the earlier self-help crap I ran into, but the link to these books I had already read had me intrigued. I got his ebook and loved it, then got his Advanced Dating Series (audio) (and later Mastery Series).

Wow. Everything clicked into place. While the goal was about improved dating, David kept re-focusing everybody back again and again to it being about improving yourself as a man and becoming the type of man who attracted women. Not by being fake, but by *becoming* a better person. Being better includes treating women in ways they actually like and respond to. ""Being yourself"" is an empty yet common statement since we aren't static. We all change and you can change for the better by better understanding how things work, whether philosophy, politics, social well-being, and relationships. And I did just that.

I began to experiment. I became more playful, more teasing, more mysterious. Some were great, some failed miserably, but all were educational. I remember one experiment where I was out with a bunch of friends in a pub as we did every week or two, and I just brought along a candy sucker. I had it in my mouth all evening. I'd take it out to sip beer and talk, then put it back in. I never said a word about it or acted like it was out of the ordinary. I had women coming up to me asking about it, including the cute bartender we saw every week who had never said much to me before. Now we had a great conversation.

I learned sexual banter and witty remarks, and why women actually like this. I also learned signals for when they don't like it. In fact, I learned about hidden signals in general (hair flipping, touching necks, smiles, looks, stances, and so on). I got really good at it.

See, courtship isn't not a job interview with a resume. It is a dance. That means knowing how to lead, follow, and read cues and respond accordingly. And none of these signals can be blatant or obvious or they lose all value as evaluation proxy signals for mating value. That's a key point of sexual selection.

And I read a lot of other PUA material like Mystery, Style (Neil Strauss, author of The Game), and a few others. They were fine but they only touched on the *why* basics and then focused on the gimmick techniques too much with too little about it being part of becoming a better man. I did like Mystery's 9-stage diagramming system as a means to keep it organized in my mind, as I am a visual person with an expertise in system behaviour, so these diagrams are helpful.

Did it get me laid? Sure. But quite the opposite of what the above comment suggests. Because I got better at being an attractive man, I was able to attract *higher quality* women, not lower quality women. When learning to dance you'll only get low quality partners. As you improve in your dance you can move up to the top quality ones.

And I did. Within a year and a half I was dating one of the nicest women I had ever met who also happened to be a model and one of the most gorgeous I had know. Never in my life did I believe that could happen. She took my breath away and we got serious for awhile. After a few months it didn't work out for unrelated reasons, but it was a great time.

Shortly thereafter I met my dream girl. She was gorgeous, friendly, intelligent, charming, funny, and perfect in every way I could imagine. What's better is how we met. We started discussing dating online months before I met her. I talked to her at great length about all of the things in the PUA material. After meeting, I even listened to David DeAngelos material with her and got her to read Mystery's ebook. She agreed with most of what they said. She absolutely loved discussing this material and how it can help men become better at dating.

That was in 2007. A week from today will be our 5th wedding anniversary and we have two young children. I am still deeply in love with her (and vice versa) and she is still my dream girl. And we still like to talk about dating and courtship and this material. (We still refer to things as DLV and DHV - Demonstration of Lower/Higher Value, as per Mystery's system.)

And I still use it with her. When things start seeming a little stale in our marriage, I re-learn some of that material. Things like how women like mystery and surprise, and having the man make the arrangements. (One early epiphany for me was when David D said that women tend to prefer to be in a restaurant they don't like eating food they don't like but the man made the arrangements and surprised her, than to be in her favorite restaurant eating her favorite food but she had to tell him what to do, or worse, to make the arrangements herself.)

So this is why I think the above comment is mostly wrong. I *am* a better person now. I *am* more attractive to women in general and my wife specifically. I increased the quality of woman I attracted, not lowered. I found high-quality girlfriends, not just one-night stands, and a wife. And women, knowing all of this, are not ""laughing their asses off"" at me. In fact, it is a bigger attractor. I feel more confident, I understand more, and perhaps most importantly I can better communicate with, understand, and keep my wife interested and happy. None of this would be possible hand I just kept thinking the same way I used to even though I was kind, empathetic, and a genuine person then. I am still a kind, empathetic, and genuine person.

Does TheRedPill have good info in this respect? I can't tell since I don't subscribe to it. I've looked briefly and it's stated goal of being better men seems appropriate, and there is some good material in there, but of course some cheap, sexist material mixed in and at least occasionally too much ""I'm a better alpha than you"" type competitions. That's why David D had to keep reminding everyone about the importance of the goal of being a better man. (The ""inner game"", as he'd call it, vs the ""outer game"" which is skills.) However, in general, PUA material has plenty of good stuff if you keep the goal in mind and interpret it in that context. I do highly recommend David D, at least the Advance Dating Series and Mastery Series.

This doesn't mean I think the above comment is a complete failure. If your goal is to become a better man with women in general, as I have, then I think the comment is wrong, particularly if you keep that goal in mind as you read and review PUA material.

If your goal is to just get cheap lays, then obviously the above comment fails since the criticisms is actually your goal.

Where the above comment may have value is if your goal is to become a better person and attract higher quality women, but you ignore those aspects of PUA material, focus on the techniques, and apply them in a disingenuous manner. Then they will laugh at you. But the solution is use the material to become a better man. You can be kind, empathetic, and genuine and sill very lousy at attracting women, as many friendzoned men are. You want to be those things *and* be good at the ""dance"" of courtship.

That will mean so much more than being a lonely, but good person, or settling for whatever woman you manage to get by fumbling through bad courtship. I did that for 9 years and it sucked. Learning how to attract quality women is one of the best things you could ever do to improve your life. At our wedding I said in my speech that I wasn't lucky to have found my wife because luck had nothing to do with it. I simply kept my standards as high as possible and it was inevitable that I'd marry the only woman who could meet them. That sounds like line, but I actually meant it seriously.

TRUE,drjgm74,,,"We don't know for sure. There are two main theories.

* Initially *Meyer-Overton* demonstrated that the effectiveness of an anaesthetic agent is proportional to the lipid solubility (measured as the oil:gas partition coefficient). This effect is very prominent and suggested a general effect of anaesthetic agents in a lipid soluble target. The theory is that anaesthetic agents dissolve into the cell lipid membrane and their presence somehow disrupts the cell function. The problem is that there are one or two anaesthetic agents that are not lipid soluble.

* The *receptor* theory. In more modern times it is noted that there are anaesthetic agents that act on specific sites on a ligand-gated ion channel (a cell surface receptor). I think this, that anaesthetic acts on a specific protein receptor ion channel, was first published by Franks and Lieb in Nature in 1994 http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v367/n6464/pdf/367607a0.pdf. The best example is the GABA-A receptor (a cell surface chloride channel) with inhibitory functions in the central nervous system. It has a specific binding site for barbituates (that augments the channel function and makes you sleep). Other anaesthetic agents can modulate the action of the channel. 

* Other anaesthetic agents act specifically at the NMDA receptor (another ligand gated ion channel on the cell surface). Best examples would be ketamine and nitrous oxide.

Currently the protein *receptor* theory is in the lead by a long way, mostly due to research on the GABA-A receptor in the CNS, but work is still ongoing in identifying the other protein receptors that are involved. There are anaesthetic agents that do not have an identified protein receptor binding site. This could be because the site is yet to be identified, or that the drug can act on the receptor, inducing conformational change in the receptor, by some other mechanism that doesn't require the classical *lock and key* drug-receptor interaction.",0,1388812911,,0,1388814447,1,cegwzfo,t3_1ud44g,t1_cegwzfo,t3_1ud44g,1431791680,4,FALSE,askscience,t5_2qm4e,4

TRUE,neon_overload,,,"Yes, basically, but when you get further into it it's complicated.

We have for various reasons a scale of 12 semitones per octave.  Mathematically, the easiest way to represent every musical note on a 12-semitone scale is to have every note be 2^(1/12) times higher frequency than the last.  This divides an octave into 12 equal intervals, exponentially speaking.  This is called equal temperament.

But the 12-semitone scale is chosen only for its ability to closely approximate the most important intervals, the perfect 5th and perfect 4th, as well as others such as the major 3rd, to within the margin of error where we don't hear too much discordance.

Naturally, our hearing hears the perfect 5th and its inverse the perfect 4th as sounding ""pure"" and these have ratios of 1:1.5 and 1:1.333 respectively, as these match up well with natural harmonics of each other.  These are referred to as ""just"" intervals because they are based on whole ratios.

Having an equal temperament of 12 semitones allows us to use a 7-semitone interval (such as between C and G) to approximate a perfect 5th.  That ratio comes to 2^(7/12) or 1.498:1.  So when we play a perfect 5th on something with equal temperament of 12 semitones we get ""close enough"" to the ""just"" intonation that it sounds okay.  For the major 3rd, which would sound best to us with a 1:1.25 ratio, equal temperament of 12 semitones gets closest at 4 semitones which is 2^(4/12) or 1:1.2599, which is only just within the margin of error of ""just"" intonation that our ears accept before it sounds ""dischordant"".

It turns out 12 equal semitones is the smallest number of equal segments you can split an octave into and get a reasonable approximation of all these important intervals, and in the case of a 12-semitone equal temperament it's the major 3rd that sees the most variance from the perfect tuning to sound best.  There are technical reasons why this is an important interval.

Because of the difference between the way a 12-semitone equal temperament represents intervals and the pure (""just"") intervals, people who tune instruments by listening to intervals (ie, how you would tune a guitar by ear) don't end up with equal temperament, but with the best sounding near-""just"" intervals in whatever key they tuned in.  So an instrument tuned by ear to a particular key may sound better in that key than some other keys.  To get closer to well-tempered requires more complex mathematics, talks of ""syntonic commas"", etc.

Another thing to consider, and this impacts on the original question, is that pianos don't necessarily use equal temperament based tuning.  Due to the stiffness of the strings, their harmonics sound slightly higher in pitch than you'd expect.  Pianos are often tuned using a ""stretched"" tuning where each octave is slightly *higher* than 2:1 as a result.  This is the sort of tuning you'd end up with if you tuned a piano by ear.  It makes octaves and large intervals sound slightly nicer given the unique stiff strings of a piano.

This post contains some simplifications.

Last time I wrote a post about this topic someone came and corrected me about the importance of the major third and told me about the syntonic comma, etc, the details of which I've glossed over here as I was aiming for a layman's explanation and also that I don't feel confident in explaining that ""why"" aspect.

TRUE,Journeyman12, points,1∆,"I just finished a fantastic book called *The Battle for God*, by a religious historian named Karen Armstrong, which somewhat addresses your question. (Disclaimer: both her book and my answer focus on Christianity, Judaism and Islam.)

According to Armstrong, premodern peoples had two basic ways of looking at the world: mythos and logos. Logos was the everyday rational way of doing things. We plant this crop at this time and it gives us food; we build a town here because it's a defensible spot; we have a dictatorship because it's the most efficient way to run things and it allows us to defend ourselves. Everyday actions. 

Mythos was how people found meaning in their lives. Religious texts guided your behavior, but people viewed them in a very different sense than they did the rational, practical information that logos gave them. It was a matter of addressing different human needs. Take the Jewish holy text, the Tanakh. It answers the questions of 'Why are we here?' 'What makes us different from other peoples?' and 'How can we behave best to make a good society happen?' It addresses the really, really big questions, like 'What happens after death?' and 'Are we alone in the universe'. It doesn't matter, in that sense, if the answers were empirically right or empirically wrong. They allowed the Jews to maintain a sense of community and a distinct religious tradition despite being splattered all over Africa, the Middle East and Europe as an often-persecuted minority. It also enabled them to find meaning in their lives. Such tiny actions as lighting candles on the Sabbath or spending a few hours in prayer were holy, *are* holy, because they allow/ed us to sanctify a little bit of our lives. They transport us beyond the mundane, to find something deeper than ourselves. Whether you feel this way or not, OP, people generally look for meaning in their lives beyond the chores of just existing. Religion gave premodern people that meaning. They could be devoutly religious and still be rational, intelligent people who made sound decisions, because they treated religion and daily life differently. 

But that doesn't really address your question, right? That was then. We have science now. We know, within a reasonable margin of error, how old the Earth is, how old the Universe is, and where we come from. So why would someone believe the old traditions now, assuming that they're not being indoctrinated, and that they are rational and intelligent?

Armstrong writes about 'the void', which first became a serious problem around the time of the Enlightenment and became reality by the time of the World Wars. Basically, once we killed God (as Nietzsche put it) there was a hole in many peoples' lives. What should I believe in? What does my life mean, if anything? If I don't believe in God, what happens when I die? What do I turn to when life is confusing or hard, or when the world seems to go crazy around me? How do I make my life more than just going through the motions? Again, human beings have a really strong need to have answers to these questions. Not all of us, but most of us need a deeper meaning than everyday life, particularly modern life, gives us. 

This diverges from Armstrong's arguments, but I believe that the popularity of a lot of modern forms of entertainment--novels, movies, TV shows, video games, consumerism, recreational drug and alcohol use, casual sex, sports, and why people get so incredibly into many or all of them--is rooted in the search for meaning. (Note: I enjoy many of those things, and I'm a religious person. I'm not saying that a lack of religion is sucking morality out of society, nor am I saying that people who consume them are going against God or any other kind of fundamentalist rhetoric... but I do think that a lot of people are looking for greater meaning in a lot of different places, and some of them ain't good.) Which brings us back to religion. As it has always been, religion is a way for people to fill the void. Yes, there is a deeper meaning, they say. God tells us to do good works, or to live a good and compassionate life. 

But how can people believe religious teachings when science tells us all the answers? Well, Armstrong's book is full of horrible things that happened when one side of the human approach to the world--logos or mythos--tried encroaching on the other. When mythos presumes upon logos, you generally get tragedies. She makes the point over and over that premodern religious-legal codes, built for agrarian societies, *don't work* in the modern day. Trying to adapt them for a modern lifestyle is one of the hardest jobs there is, and people screw it up and countries bleed for it. But the path of logos isn't clear and unmistakable either. When the rational side of us starts to take over the mystical side--when we adhere to strict rationality and believe only what we can prove, we get the void. Because whether there's something more to this world or not, whether there's a deeper meaning or there isn't, *we want there to be*. We, as humans, *need* there to be. Science can tell you how just about everything happened, but it's bad at telling you why. It's bad at providing that sense of deeper meaning. (Note II: I'm not criticizing science here. I have the deepest respect for the scientific method, the technological advances it has brought us, and the crazy amount of knowledge we've gained because people rely on empirical testing in the realm of logos and have gotten really, really good at it. But like anything human, it has its limits.) It's also bad at disproving things that aren't testable, like whether God exists. I could answer your first question, about why God would single out a certain group, with any number of hypotheticals, and you could marshal any number of counterarguments back at me. When we're talking about an ineffable entity, why even go there? That's why I've chosen to approach your post in this way. 

This is the modern relationship between mythos and logos, or at least, this is how I choose to define it. Logos can tell you everything about the world, but it cannot give you meaning. Mythos can answer the ultimate questions, help you feel like a part of a community and help you live a good life (science can too, kinda), but don't ask it to empirically prove anything. People believe in both at once--or, since I can only really speak for myself on this point, I believe in both at once--because, since they address different facets of the human experience it is possible to hold the two concepts in your head at once and not explode. Because many people still experience a sense of the mystical or the miraculous, whether it's empirically sound or not, and wish to celebrate it or make sense out of it. And because, like premodern people, we both need to make the world work correctly and need to find a deeper meaning. 


**Edit:** A good tl;dr for this might be that it depends entirely on what you mean by 'rational'. If you mean 'applies logos to every aspect of their lives', then I doubt any such person would subscribe to any religious hokum. If you mean 'applies logos to daily life and mythos to their spiritual, religious or otherwise mystical experiences', or 'applies logos to daily life but respects the limits of its power', then you might get something like my answer.

**ASTURIA**

**CAPITAL CITY OF NEW IBERIA**

*Introduction: History and Planetological Information:*

The city of Asturia is located on the planet of New Iberia, a planet in  the comic region known as Upper Centaurus, and orbits the star Kassia, a K7-class orange dwarf star. It has a rotational period of 73.3 hours, an axial tilt of 19.64 degrees, and an orbital period of 153 standard days. It has short, mild seasons, and due to its slow rotation experiences very long periods of both daylight and darkness.

Settled in the late 31st century by Neo-Germanic migrants from Eridani, New Iberia was originally called New Ganymede, in reference to the planet's small, shallow seas and mountainous landscape. The first colony was situated on a large island in the mouth of the León river (originally called der Löwenmaul) and was named Kronenburg, because the three prominent hills looked like the three points of a crown. The colony was mildly prosperous and was mainly an agricultural colony, supplemented by mining the rich iron ores found in the planet's mountains. 

The planet remained largely Neo-Germanic until 3415, when the height of the Françolais Revival led many Françolais planets (a cultural group formed from the fusion of the old-Earth cultures of France and Spain) to band together into the first Françolais Confederacy and expand further into Upper Centaurus. The Françolais-New Ganymede war lasted six weeks and resulted in New Ganymede becoming a possession of the Confederacy. Under Françolais rule, the planet was renamed New Iberia after the Old Earth birthplace of Françolais culture itself. Kronenburg was renamed Asturia, after a prominent Iberian kingdom. The planet remained a strong member of the Confederacy into the 35th Century, providing an enormous wealth of raw mineral resources in exports. When the Confederacy collapsed in 3567 after massive problems due to bureaucracy, New Iberia remained strong, largely due to its role as a banking power and prime location for transit to other stars. When the major powers of Upper Centaurus formed the Antares Federation in 3620 in the aftermath of the Second Crucian War, New Iberia joined the General Charter to retain its autonomy as a financial power, instead of the more centralised Special Charter. To this day, Asturia remains a bustling metropolis, and one of the most prominent centers of banking and commerce throughout the entirety of Centaurus.

**I: Architecture:**

The Greater Asturia Area exists as an expansion to the original settlement of Kronenburg. The city is built upon the several large islands in the León river delta and the surrounding shore areas. The heart of the city is Corona, the eastern section of the island upon which Kronenburg was originally founded. There, gleaming nanocarbon skyscrapers soar hundreds of meters into the air, most of them corporate and manufacturing headquarters. The current Palacia Central, the central government building, is located in the unchanged Zentralhaus, the original Neo-Germanic colonial office. The Palacia sits atop the highest hill in La Corona, the name for the three crown-shaped hills and the city distict of the same name. 

Asturia is divided into seven administrative districts, called cantons: Corona, Isabelle, Estabosca, Nord-Rio, Ribera, Oestmont, and Les Mareas.

 * Corona: The center of Asturia. Tall, modern plasticarbon buildings and spires. Many banks, guilds, and industries have their headquarters here. All the major metro lines run through central Corona, allowing for easy access to the entirety of the city. Takes up the southeastern portion of Isla Corona, the main island of the city. 

 * Ribera: the far-western portion of Isla Corona. Originally a working-class neighborhood, it eventually evolved into a middle-class neighborhood and cultural center of Asturia. Many mid-size flats, lofts and densely-packed with efficiency apartments. 

 * Nord-Rio: The northern portion of Isla Corona, as well as Dinamarca, a smaller island to the northeast. The Isla Corona portion of Nord-Rio is mostly manufacturing, along with high-rise agricultural buildings to supplement the city's food supply. Dinamarca is home to the city's spaceport, a majestic towering building that processes all of the inworld and offworld traffic and goods, and houses the central offices for the Otoridad del Porte.

 * Estabosca: A forested island to the east of Corona, noted as being a white-collar/upper-class neighborhood. Covered in beautiful parks and home to the city's Municipal Gardens and the Villa-Musé, a city-sponsored collection of museums. Most of the buildings on Estabosca are upscale apartments less than ten stories, though a significant portion of the buildings are individual residences. 

 * Isabelle: An island to the north of Estabosca. Currently home to many of the city's working-class neighborhoods. Also known for producing some of the city's most famous artists. Contains la Villa de Sol, a very liberal commune that is the city's LGBT center.

 * Oestmont: Located on the western bank of the Léon river, Oestmont is built on the high cliffs and hills overlooking the city. Many very large apartment buildings dot the landscape. Oestmont is known for being home to many different enclaves of immigrants, especially the city's Proksimi population, an Islamoslavic ethnic group descended from the original settlers of Proxima Centauri. Mostly working/middle class residents. 

 * Las Mareas: Built on the flats and wetlands on the eastern mainland, Las Maresas is Asturia's manufacturing and refining center, and is home to the city's central atomic plant. Also the hub for the city's high-speed rail lines out of the city and to the other settlements of New Iberia. 

In addition to the main islands in the Léon delta, there are many, many smaller island that have earned Asturia the title ""City of Isles"", and due to the city's well-developed network of bridges, Asturia is also called the ""City of Bridges"".

**II: Commerce:**

New Iberia's geographical position in the Antares Federation, and its proximity to many of the major interstellar shipping lanes makes it an ideal trading port. And Asturia, as the planet's capital, receives the lion's share of such trade. The spaceport at Dinamarca processes hundreds of thousands of ships, passengers, and goods shipments daily. The reasonable offworld tariff rates make it so that Asturians have access to a variety of foreign products and goods. 

**Imports:**

Although New Iberia does have a modest agricultural industry, the soil is too nutrient-poor to sustain the entirety of the planet's needs. Most of the planet's domestic agriculture is therefore produced in greenhouses and terraria, but even so almost 60% of New Iberia's agricultural products come from off-world.  Countless tonnes of Antarean wheat, Scorbettian maize, and cattle products from Zuben Prime go through Dinamarca Spaceport daily.

New Iberia, despite being rich in minerals such as titanium, cobalt, iron and copper, is severely lacking in metals such as platinum and gold, as well as heavier radioactive elements like uranium and thorium. As a result, large supplies of these elements are imported and then refined domestically. A large quantity of these materials are refined right in Las Maresas.

Among the planets and cities of the Centauri region, Asturia is one of the heaviest consumers of coffee. The favored blend is Muscovian Red, an incredibly fragrant and strong blend that pairs well with the seafood from the lakes and seas of New Iberia.

**Exports:**

Much of New Iberia's wealth comes from a combination of its power as a banking institution coupled with the large amount of finished-goods manufacturing it does. One of the major corporations on New Iberia, headquartered in Asturia, is Rochelle Dynamics, a manufacturer of groundcars and components for transportation systems. 

In addition, the weapons industry has a strong foothold on New Iberia. Marukh Industries, Bishop-Wycliffe Security Technologies, and the New Terra Armaments Corporation have manufacturing/distribution centers in Asturia. Products such as industrial and combat hardsuits, light/small arms, and weapons systems for combat vehicles are all exported at Dinamarca Spaceport.

I've seen pictures of snakes that were shot - some of them live for days, so
that's out too. So, I want you to bring back a sword.

Nate turned away to look back to the dune that Sammy had gone behind. ""I'd
say an axe, but that's somewhat undignified - putting my head on the ground
or a chopping block like that. No, I like a sword. A time-honored way of
going out. A dignified way to die. And, most importantly, it should work,
even on me.

""You willing to do that for me, Jack?"" Nate turned back to look at Jack.

""Yeah, Nate,"" replied Jack solemnly, ""I think I can handle that.""

Nate nodded. ""Good!"" He turned back toward the dune and shouted, ""Sammy!
Jack's about ready to leave!"" Then quietly, ""Thanks, Jack.""

Jack didn't have anything to say to that, so he waited for Sammy to make it
back to the lever, nodded to him, nodded a final time to Nate, and then
headed into the desert with Sammy following.
Over the next several years Sammy and Jack kept in touch with Nate through
e-mail as they went about their adventures. They made a goal of visiting
every country in the world, and did a respectable job of it. Sammy had a
natural gift for languages, as Jack expected he would, and even ended up
acting as a translator for Jack in a few of the countries. Jack managed to
keep the talking rattlesnake hidden, even so, and by the time they were
nearing the end of their tour of countries, Sammy had only been spotted a
few times. While there were several people that had seen enough to startle
them greatly, nobody had enough evidence to prove anything, and while a few
wild rumors and storied followed Jack and Sammy around, nothing ever hit the
newspapers or the public in general.

When they finished the tour of countries, Jack suggested that they try some
undersea diving. They did. And spelunking. They did that too. Sammy finally
drew the line at visiting Antarctica. He'd come to realize that Jack was
stalling. After talking to his Dad about it over e-mail, he figured out that
Jack probably didn't want to have to kill Nate. Nate told Sammy that humans
could be squeamish about killing friends and acquaintances.

So, Sammy eventually put his tail down (as he didn't have a foot) and told
Jack that it was time - he was ready to go back and take up his duties from
his dad. Jack, delayed it a little more by insisting that they go back to
Japan and buy an appropriate sword. He even stretched it a little more by
getting lessons in how to use the sword. But, eventually, he'd learned as
much as he was likely to without dedicating his life to it, and was
definitely competent enough to take the head off of a snake. It was time to
head back and see Nate.

When they got back to the US, Jack got the old RV out of storage where he
and Sammy had left it after their tour of the fifty states, he loaded up
Sammy and the sword, and they headed for the desert.

When they got to the small town that Jack had been trying to find those
years ago when he'd met Nate, Jack was in a funk. He didn't really feel like
walking all of the way out there. Not only that, but he'd forgotten to
figure the travel time correctly, and it was late afternoon. They'd either
have to spend the night in town and walk out tomorrow, or walk in the dark.

As Jack was afraid that if he waited one more night he might lose his
resolve, he decided that he'd go ahead and drive the RV out there. It was
only going to be this once, and Jack would go back and cover the tracks
afterward. They ought to be able to make it out there by nightfall if they
drove, and then they could get it over tonight.

Jack told Sammy to e-mail Nate that they were coming as he drove out of
sight of the town on the road. They then pulled off the road and headed out
into the desert.

Everything went well, until they got to the sand dunes. Jack had been
nursing the RV along the whole time, over the rocks, through the creek beds,
revving the engine the few times they almost got stuck. When they came to
the dunes, Jack didn't really think about it, he just downshifted and headed
up the first one. By the third dune, Jack started to regret that he'd
decided to try driving on the sand. The RV was fishtailling and losing
traction. Jack was having to work it up each dune slowly and was trying to
keep from losing control each time they came over the top and slid down the
other side. Sammy had come up to sit in the passenger seat, coiled up and
laughing at Jack's driving.

As they came over the top of the fourth dune, the biggest one yet, Jack saw
that this was the final dune - the stone, the lever, and somewhere Nate,
waited below. Jack put on the brakes, but he'd gone a little too far. The RV
started slipping down the other side.

Jack tried turning the wheel, but he didn't have enough traction. He pumped
the brakes - no response. They started sliding down the hill, faster and
faster.

Jack felt a shock go through him as he suddenly realized that they were
heading for the lever. He looked down - the RV was directly on course for
it. If Jack didn't do something, the RV would hit it. He was about to end
humanity.

Jack steered more frantically, trying to get traction. It still wasn't
working. The dune was too steep, and the sand too loose. In a split second,
Jack realized that his only chance would be once he hit the stone around the
lever - he should have traction on the stone for just a second before he hit
the lever - he wouldn't have time to stop, but he should be able to steer
away.

Jack took a better grip on the steering wheel and tried to turn the RV a
little bit - every little bit would help. He'd have to time his turn just
right.

The RV got to the bottom of the dune, sliding at an amazing speed in the
sand. Just before they reached the stone Jack looked across it to check that
they were still heading for the lever. They were. But Jack noticed something
else that he hadn't seen from the top of the dune. Nate wasn't wrapped
around the lever. He was off to the side of the lever, but still on the
stone, waiting for them. The problem was, he was waiting on the same side of
the lever that Jack had picked to steer towards to avoid the lever. The RV
was already starting to drift that way a little in its mad rush across the
sand and there was no way that Jack was going to be able to go around the
lever to the other side.

Jack had an instant of realization. He was either going to have to hit the
lever, or run over Nate. He glanced over at Sammy and saw that Sammy
realized the same thing.

Jack took a firmer grip on the steering wheel as the RV ran up on the stone.
Shouting to Sammy as he pulled the steering wheel, ""BETTER NATE THAN LEVER,""
he ran over the snake.

THE END

North Korea is an absolute anomaly in the world.  China may be another communist state, but it is a booming one.  North Korea is hermetic, secretive, and so strange that it borders on insane.  And it is crippled, a state failing behind a veil of Chinese/global support and a rigorous propaganda campaign.

And yet, the reason this dystopic little haven is so appealing as a story is because there are *people* living there.  Every wondered just how it is the German people were talked into going to war with the world?  Or how millions blindly loved Chairman Mao?  You can see it all played right in front of you here.  Hitler's dead and his malice exposed.  Mao died ages ago and the party has moved on.  But North Korea has undergone two dramatic changes in leadership (let's remind ourselves that KIS and KJI are revered as gods) and is still kicking.  Most of us (thank god) will never actually live in a society such as North Korea.

So it's not like we're forgetting about the gulags.  It's not like we're forgetting that most of North Korea is a stinking shitheap.

So, instead of focusing on the gulag aspect in this AMA (which clearly this dude doesn't have any new insights on), I'd rather hear about the North Korean people: what is it like to live under that regime?

It's often awkward and uncomfortable to say no to people, and equally awkward and uncomfortable to create a scene when they don't respect a ""No."" The discomfort factor rises when the person who ignores your ""No"" literally *picks you up and puts you in his lap* even though you've expressed that *you do not want to be touched.* The vast majority of women aren't going to find that cute, funny, or sexy. They're going to find it fucking creepy to be picked up and placed directly over the genitals of someone they've just met.

Ron Paul believes it should be legal to not pay taxes if you object to the legitimacy of the law (effectively making taxation completely unenforceable.)

He also believes that ""Separation of Church and State"" isn't outlined in the bill of rights. He has proposed numerous laws to prevent judiciary bodies from ensuring that local and state government do not affect display or language that supports the religious views of one particular group with public monies.

He votes against gay adoption and the equal rights of homosexuals regularly. However, peculiarly, he believes that gay marriage should be permitted, but also states openly that he would have voted for DOMA, and that the ultimate decision should be left to the states, and the venue that is providing the marriage. He says he ultimately believes that marriages should not be defined or registered with the federal government, but you'll notice he sneakily sidesteps this issue by kicking it down to the state level, where his constituents will ensure that the most anti-gay policy will be put in place. He has since 2010 started arguing that marriage is by definition between a man and a woman.

Ron Paul came out in support of ""Don't Ask, Don't tell."".

He is also known to defend sodomy laws for the sake that he believes that the federal government has no place striking down laws regarding sexual conduct, as the constitution doesn't define a statute that states that people have a right to commit sodomy.

Extremely anti-abortion. Violates his ""state rights"" bullshit to hamfist federal bans on abortions. However, government at the federal level, in his own words, ""should not be involved in medical matters, including contraception."". He wants to block planned parenthood and family planning funding, yet has the fucking gall to state ""the federal government has no place legistlating on abortion."" He then went on to vote on bills that banned certain types of abortion at a federal level, and increased punishments for clerical and procedural violations relating to operating abortion clinics.



**TL;DR**: *Again, I could go on, but extrapolate his policy of ""People shouldn't pay taxes"", to ""The federal government should be very, very tiny"", and then take a look at his massive, massive cuts to taxation and total elimination of taxes on the wealthiest sector of our population. His proposals aren't just a little crazy, they are tantamount to economic suicide for this nation, and given that a handful of the states whose policies most closely match his platform take more federal dollars than they actually bring in, his policies will bankrupt the country faster than you can say ""Ron Paul 2016"".*",1,1388826218,,0,FALSE,1,ceh0r31,t3_1ucv05,t1_ceh0r31,t1_ceh091n,1431793580,8,FALSE,news,t5_2qh3l,8

TRUE,Psycon,,,"I'm going to disagree. There's definitely a deeper ideology at work behind Interventionism. First, it is key to understand that US foreign policy is largely self-interested and primarily benefits the elite at the expense of all others. There are many reasons and lies that are told to justify it, and some of the elite even believe these lies themselves, part of this is due to a deliberate policy of distortion and compartmentalization. The conspirators want to keep people from trying to see the big picture and it facilitates what is known as ""plausible deniability"". At the core is always the self-interest of the elite, the rest is just misguided beliefs, political strategizing, and lies, and one of them is...

&gt;The idea is that the USA can eliminate problems before they become big problems.

This is a Neoconservative belief, based on the false and naive notion of American moral superiority and exceptionalism. 

Leo Strauss one of the founders of the US Neoconservative movement was influenced indirectly by the Nazis and the political climate of the post WWII era. Believing that American liberalism and individualism lead to Nihilism through moral erosion and the destruction of shared societal values which eventually would cause the downfall of the US, he decided to combat this by drawing inspirations from the Nazi ideals of a false romanticized cultural heritage, conformity, and blind nationalism, and thus created a modern myth of American superiority and exceptionalism using our own history and old testament Christian ideology as its basis. (The greatest irony of all is the speed with which some in the American Right these days will throw Leo Strauss under the bus and call him a Nazi supporter (he wasn't) despite his absolutely critical role of shaping their ideology.)

And it is this ideology which largely shapes our cultural identity and foreign policy of interventionism. We believe we are justified in nation building through our irrational belief that we are morally and culturally superior. Anytime someone comments or utters some nonsense of American exceptionalism and how this is the greatest country to live in I realize how effective the indoctrination of people like Strauss was. Couple that irrational spirit of superiority with the paranoia and suspicion created by CIA Cold War social engineers like Nash and you have a perfect recipe for controlling and shaping public opinion.

It is through the propagation of those ideals in the media (see: Operation Mockingbird) that the American right have socially conditioned liberals into supporting their agenda. 

Additionally, the US political elite has no interest in supporting any truly democratic governments that do not act as puppets working on behalf of western/US corporate interests. The past centuries worth of history clearly shows this. The CIA and US government has regularly aided radical Islamists and right wing terror groups across the world in order to justify perpetual war to support the MIC and spread US corporate hegemony.

The CIA essentially acts as the intelligence arm of the right wing US corporate elite, an organization which has constantly sought to undermine legitimate democracies and socially control people to turn them against democracy, liberalism, socialism, anarchism, and communism. You can see the results in the deaths and oppression resulting from US foreign policy, military interventions and intelligence operations in: 

Italy, Iran, Albania, Greece, Egypt, Kosovo, Hungary, Turkey, Honduras, El Salvador, Cuba, Haiti, Colombia, Chile, Argentina, Venezuela, Nicaragua, Guatemala, Rhodesia, Congo, Angola, Ghana, Vietnam, Laos, Bahrain, Libya, Syria, Iraq, and many more regions around the world. Keeping in mind that many of these countries were stable governments or democracies prior to US interventionism.

Were not just talking about hundreds or thousands... but roughly ten million people or more over the span of half a century who have been killed directly and indirectly through US covert, overt, economic, and military actions. And that isn't even counting the millions of other people in South America, Central America, Middle East, Africa, and Southeast Asia who have been injured, imprisoned, and are living under oppressive US backed regimes.

US foreign policy is entirely self-interested. It's all driven by the irrational and destructive need for money and power.

Hey guys, 

I also wanted to drop a note outside of the main post but still towards the top (if you upvote it :)).  

I want to tell you that words really can't express how awesome it has been to participate in this community over the past couple of years.

You all have have provided a constant source of valuable feedback that has led to new changes and great deals. To use a recent example, the addition of a ""DRM"" filter on our sale pages was something we implemented as a direct result of /r/gamedeals feedback. 

When I started working here there was a lot of concern around how I'd interact with the community. The biggest piece of feedback I received was that the community was concerned that I'd be more interested in pushing deals down your throats and not really be a contributing member.  

I hope my interactions with all of you has shown that I took that feedback to heart. I consider myself fortunate to be a member of this community and I thank all of you for making it so awesome.  

Lastly, by far the best experience I've had with all of you is having a great place to make my job really fun. Instead of looking at driving traffic towards our deals and announcements objectively I've had the amazing opportunity to make this part of my job personal and enjoyable.  

In 2014 the Amazon Digital Video Games team hopes to bring you new and exciting news ranging from awesome deals to new selection like the recently added Playstation Digital and Bethesda content.

Thanks again for an amazing 2013 and here's to a phenomenal 2014!

~~In the first scene with Trinity in room 303 (where Neo later returns), the exterior of the building is shown.  The sign on the front of the building indicates that it is a theater, but the inside looks more like an apartment building. I think this symbolizes the fact that the lives of those in the matrix are all a show~~

In the same scene with Trinity, as the police bust in they shine their flashlights at her, and she watches the shadows on the wall.  I think this may be a reference to Plato's ""[Cave of Shadows](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_Cave)""

Neo begins the movie in room 101, and ends it in room 303.  I think this may symbolize how he needed Trinity to become The One (3x101=303).

Neo sells the illegal files to a couple named Choi and Dejure.  These are French names, meaning ""choice of the day.""  Neo, of course, makes a really big choice in this scene.

When discussing the code they read to view the matrix, Cypher ironically says to Neo, ""I don't even see the code, all I see is blond, brunette, red head.""  This is just what is wrong with him.  He is regressing to his prior state, and letting the code fool his mind.  Neo, however, goes through the opposite transformation.  At the end of the movie he does not even see the matrix, all he sees is code.

There is a subtle reference to the Architect in the Matrix.  In the interrogation scene with the agents and Neo near the beginning of the movie, for a brief second you can see Neo being watched on a number of monitors which look exactly like those in the Architect's room.

Agent Smith (I think the most interesting character) goes through a really fascinating transformation in the film.  He goes from being an emotionless agent to someone who can hardly control his emotions (he says ""I am going to enjoy watching you die"" something an agent would never say.  he also has many angry outbursts.).  There is, of course, also the great scene with he and Morpheus, in which Smith removes his ear piece (unplugs) and tells Morpheus of all his hopes and dreams.  It is also ironic how he describes humans multiplying like a virus until every natural resource is consumed.  He himself becomes a virus and does exactly this in the next movie.

Morpheus's name comes from the god of dreams in Ovid's Metamorphosis, and Morpheus is responsible for waking Neo up.

When Neo goes to the Oracle for the first time, she tells him that he is not the One.  She says he looks like he is waiting for something.  When he asks what, she responds ""your next life, maybe.""  It is only after he dies that he becomes the One.

Also in this scene with the Oracle, she tells him: ""Being the One is like being in love... you just know it.""  At the climax when he becomes the One, Trinity confesses her love for him.  She KNOWS that she is in love.  And simultaneously, because the Oracle told her she would fall in love with the One, she KNOWS that Neo is the One.

The scene with Neo and his boss in the beginning has a lot of ironies.  His boss tells him ""you have a problem with authority,"" which surely he does, as he rebels against every form of authority in existence in the matrix.

Anyway thats all i can come up with off the top of my head right now. I hope these are as interesting!

Edit: several people asked about my opinions on the second and third films.  I'll copy and paste a comment I left yesterday:
I was really disappointed in the sequels the first time i watched them, but I was able to find a way of enjoying them. I simply watched them completely from Neo's perspective. If you pay attention to what Neo sees and does, it makes a lot of sense what happens at the end and what Neo is going through. It's about him realizing that Morpheus was wrong. He realizes that the real world isn't real. This allows him to stop sentinels with his mind and see without eyes. He realizes that there are many levels of reality coming from some ""source"" (The power of the One reaches all the way back to the source). Neo mistakenly thought the Oracle was talking about the machine mainframe when she mentioned the source. At the end of Revolutions, he loses his last connection to the ""real world"", Trinity, and resigns himself to leaving that world.
Incidentally, Smith also gains power as Neo does (The Oracle says ""[Smith] is [Neo's] opposite... the result of the equation trying to balance""). So, as Neo gains power in the real world (stopping the sentinels with his mind), Smith shortly does as well (corrupting Bane). Neo finally realizes that the only way to kill Smith is to ""kill"" himself, which is exactly what happens at the climax of Revolutions. This makes it ironic what Smith says as he dies: ""No, no no. Its not fair."" But that's the point, it's PERFECTLY fair. Of course, as I said above, Neo merely ascends another level rather than just dying. This begs the question though: If Neo is still alive, is Smith?
To be honest, though.... Reloaded was acceptable at best and Revolutions was complete SHIT. Revolutions was literally a continuous fight scene. Every time I watch it, it seems worse. Really depressing. Makes me wish they had left it without a sequel.

A number of people pointed out that I was WRONG about the building in the beginning being a theater.  It is, in fact, ""heart of the city hotel.""  Sorry, I don't know what made me think that.  Perhaps its just that the sign looks kind of like that of an old theater.

In this third installment of the 'Pusher' trilogy, we follow Milo (Zlatko Buric), the drug lord from the two first films. He is aging, he is planning his daughter's 25th birthday and his shipment of heroin turns out to be 10.000 pills of ecstasy. When Milo tries to sell the pills anyway, all Hell breaks loose and his only chance is to ask for help from his ex-henchman and old friend Radovan.

In the third and final chapter of Danish filmmaker Nicolas Winding Refn's acclaimed Pusher trilogy, the focus shifts from disgraced gangster's son Tonny to feared Serbian crime lord Milo. First seen in the original film as a vicious underworld heavy with a thirst for blood and a sadistic mean streak, Milo's violent professional life couldn't stand in starker contrast to his henpecked home life. From catering to the constant demands of his spoiled daughter, Milena, to watching over his shiftless henchmen and cooking his helpers some questionably prepared samosas, Milo's notorious street reputation can't hold a candle to his reputation for being quite a softie around the house. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi

There's really no such thing as ""white privilege."" What there *is* is discrimination against blacks and some other minorities--and disadvantages for them.  


Look, to say that x is privileged is to say that x is getting some illicit advantage. So consider, for example, getting hassled by the cops. Whites typically get hassled by the cops less. Is this an illicit advantage? No, it is not. Rather, it is a basic right that everyone deserves.   

Furthermore, if the problem is ""privilege,"" then the problem can be eliminated by eliminating the privilege. So, for the example above, the problem could be solved by the cops hassling more white people. Obviously, that is insane. The problem can only be solved by decreasing the amount of time that blacks are hassled by the cops. Again, the problem isn't ""privilege,"" it's *discrimination* (and illicit disadvantage).  


Also, as a kind of speculative post-script: there has never been any need for the concept ""privilege"" in any of these discussions. Everything we need to talk about can be talked about *more accurately* by the concept *discrimination*. SJWs like the term 'privilege' because it changes the focus of the discussion away from the struggles of the disadvantaged...and onto the groups SJWs love to shriek at and froth about--whites, males, etc. They are less interested in the real struggles of disadvantaged people, and more interested in promoting the suggestion that whites, males, etc. are getting things they don't deserve.   

But if you want to speak of the problem accurately, you need to use the concept *discrimination*, not the concept *privilege.* Furthermore, the former concept has been the concept on which all real, relevant, positive change has been effected (in the States, anyway). When I, for example, hear people talk about discrimination against some group, I'm all ears and eager to help. When I hear SJWs shriek about my alleged privilege--with, of course, the obvious suggestions that I'm getting and enjoying a cornucopia of unearned advantages, like some fat-cat minor aristocracy living off the sweat of the peasants--I just laugh and move away.

The first thing you need to do is configure the motors to accept step &amp; direction input so they can pretend to be stepper motors. In his first response to you, Jeff is saying (I think) that you don't need all of the cables and stuff mentioned in sd_cnc.pdf because you can use the snabhub as a USB-&gt;serial adapter. So, if you plug all the motors into the snaphub as usual and connect the snaphub to your computer via USB you should be able to start at section 4 of sd_cnc.pdf (note the part where it says you should mechanically disconnect the motors from the printer at this point). This consists of running NMCTest.exe to connect to the motors, find sensible values for the step gain and to tell the motors to accept step &amp; dir inputs. You will only have to do this once.

Once you have done ALL of section 4 you get to the part where you need to rewire stuff. Now you need to look at the table at the start of section 5 and find which wires within the cat5 cable correspond to the step, dir, enable and gnd pins on the pic-servo sc board. 

~~Begin by carefully cutting around the cat5 cable at the end furthest from the motors - just through the sleeve. You need to remove a section of the insulation. Once you've done that find the wires you previously identified as step, dir, enable and gnd within the bundle. Cut through them next to the connector and unwind them so they are free. The free wires will go into the RAMPS board and control the motor, all of the other wires left in the bundle will go into the snaphub through the connector and provide power. Keep a set of spare unaltered cables so that you can reconfigure the motors if needed. If cutting through the sleeve like this is too difficult you could buy a cheap crimp tool and some connectors - just be careful to get the wires in the right order in the connector.~~ **See below.**

You can see here (http://www.pololu.com/product/1182) where the pololu driver get its step, dir, enable and gnd connections. Find the header sockets on the RAMPS board which would provide these (based on where each pololu driver would sit on top of the board) and connect the wires in the right order. This part is important, as you could potentially break your motor if you get it wrong. The only obvious way this might happen is if you connected something up to Vmot by accident, so don't do that. I think most other mistakes would just result in nothing happening, but be careful anyway.

At this point you should be good to go... Your steps/mm will probably be a crazy value depending on what you chose as a step gain earlier, but apart from that everything should work. In theory.

Let me know if you're confused about anything!

TRUE,theultimatehero2,,,"I have never posted on r/books as I have no authority to critique books or slug it out with all of you well versed book worms. As an EXTREMELY casual reader, let me explain my perspective.

I read Looking for Alaska about 4 years ago. It was actually the start of my interest in reading novels again after I had graduated High School and celebrated that I no longer had to read books for English class. LFA resonated with me. Particularly it was astoundingly easy to relate to. It feeds an easy reading story of a character that is profoundly LIKE ME. Maybe not exactly like me, but similar to how I picture myself and my place in the world. 

As it was a kind of launching point for me it lead me to learn the importance of immersing myself into a book. By seeing myself in the role of the main character it really felt like my story. Sure it follows the same blueprint: Too smart for his own good, unobtainable love interest etc. His novels are heinously popular not only because he has 'Internet Fame', but because many of his readers come from a similar background to his. The characters and stories are what we want to think of our own story to be. 

This thread disappointed me a bit. Not that everyone should love John Green, but because everyone hopped on the hate wagon and lit their torches. This is the kind of book that gets young people like myself (4 years ago) interested in reading. It's not about complex, perfectly reasonable and realistic story lines. It is however about showing the reader there are reasons beyond passing classes to read a book, you might even find you learn something about yourself along the way. 

Edit: This post got a bit more response than I expected so let me respond here:

The comments in this thread have changed significantly since I first saw it. There were numerous people posting early on with very little reasoning just to 'hate' on John Green. That was disappointing to me. As it seems now those posts have been pushed downward and much more well reasoned posts have been brought up, which is of course, good :)

Another thing to point out, I realize this book is not for everyone. That's what I mean when I say ""his readers come from a similar background"". People that like his book are probably normal, everyday, geeky people.

It's part of Christ's sermon on the mount

Matthew 6:25: “Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothes?""

But this also addresses the other sins of the old covenant as being impossible to uphold.  The entire sermon on the mount was focused on telling people, ""It's impossible for you to live sin free.  That even thinking lustful thoughts is having sinned like adultery.  That even being angry is to sin, not just murder.""  The entire beginning of the sermon was dedicated to basically telling everyone, you're shit out of luck if you try and get into heaven by living sin free.

In the sermon he also emphasizes how to live a life seeking a relationship with Christ (living in the image of the father) and how through this you can seek to enter the kingdom of heaven.  This was the premise of the new covenant.  That Christ died for your sins because it was impossible to live a sin-free life/salvation under the old covenant.  To seek salvation through Christ you must pursue a life in his image where you:

* love your enemies,
* turn your cheeks rather than retaliate,
* give/help those less fortunate,
* the golden rule,
* don't practice your righteousness to be seen by others,
* don't flaunt your lavish prayers in the streets or in the temples,

And more importantly, are misrepresenting the stance of [enthusiastic consent](http://www.doctornerdlove.com/2013/03/enthusiastic-consent/) (you can find a lot about it at Google, [here](http://persephonemagazine.com/2012/05/why-do-people-hate-the-concept-of-enthusiastic-consent/) and [here](http://www.ourbodiesourselves.org/book/excerpt.asp?id=19) are another texts). This view was popularized by the book [Yes means Yes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes_Means_Yes). In my understanding, OP is against the idea of enthusiastic consent, or perhaps support it but think it doesn't apply in his case.

Can you clarify, OP?

Anyway, the point of enthusiastic consent is that your sexual partner should be interested into sex, and not just let you have sex (or merely ""agreed""). Quoting that first link:

&gt; The idea of enthusiastic consent is all about making sure that your partner is genuinely into having sex… that you are getting clear and unambiguous signals that he or she wants to fuck. It’s the difference between “Dear God I want to fuck you right now” and “Yeah… I guess, whatever” when they really mean “no”.

In your case, you were doing other activities but was generally attracted to her, and eventually was convinced into sex. Your experience wasn't damaging, I suppose. But consider that some people may be vulnerable due to various circumstances and have trouble to properly deny sex. For example, emotionally vulnerable people may have trouble denying the sexual advances of their SOs, for example. In those cases, the lack of resistance may not mean that the person didn't suffer an aggression.

Your exact experience wasn't rape, in your own words. But we could perhaps insert a few elements that would perhaps not change the overall picture, but could make the experience increasingly more coercive, to the point that some might consider it rape. For example:

1. If the you were much younger than her and had little sexual experience, specially if you trusted her.

2. If you were very nervous, and perhaps feared her.

3. If you had little means to turn her down, or if you feared to be ridiculed.

4. If you had been sexually assaulted and were triggered by repeated sexual demands, even after you said no.

Some of this would mean a change on her behavior, but we could turn this into a more coercive scenario by just changing *you*. *You* were okay with her behavior, but other people might respond to it poorly. Everyone has a right to not be sexually harassed, and some people may respond poorly to this kind of insistence. Not everyone handles sex as good as you.",0,1388854939,,0,1388855237,1,ceh6roh,t3_1ue4lm,t1_ceh6roh,t3_1ue4lm,1431796482,107,FALSE,changemyview,t5_2w2s8,107

The train was late, as many were, due to the constant fear of air raids. As I stood there, staring into the cold void of the thick, foggy air, a man slowly walked into the station. He wore a long overcoat, a fine bowler hat, and his musky cologne carried in the breeze. It smelled of leather and elderberries. As he walked closer, he raised the brim of his hat. His deep blue eyes seems to be lost in the cold void that night, but just as the light of the nearby lantern met his face, our eyes locked with the power of a thousand suns. Who was I to reach into the nothingness and find such beauty. He walked right up to me as my body seemed to crumble within his eyes. He embraced me by the small of my back, dipped my slightly and kissed me. My world was shattered. It felt liked the frigid lifelessness of a stray dog's tongue--hanging lifless out of its mouth. It was as if the pup's tongue just sat there on my face as my eyes broke away and looked around--looked around for some sort of meaning of all this. By this point, the train arrived, and only then, did he pull away and board the train. I stood there in disbelief, unable to move. The doors eventually closed and the train slowly steamed into the foggy abyss. That was the last I saw of Mr. Leroux. Is it you, Mr. Leroux?

On the one hand you have a perfectly formed F#m9, with a 3rd, and 7th, simple as can be chord name that accounts for all the notes present.

Bear in mind, even though you ignore the 5th in the chord name if it's omitted, you can't do that for the 3rd, so if you want to call it Amaj7/F# you have to account for the missing 3rd, so Amaj7(no3rd)/F# is the correct chord name if you choose to go that way.

So, on the other hand you have an F#m9, a simple root position m9 vs a 3rd-less maj7 with a 6th/13th in the bass.

Working on the ""simpler is better"" basis it would be better to call this F#m9, simple, everyone can pull one out from the top of their head.

A situation where you might want to use the Amaj7(no3rd)/F# over F#m9 is if, say, the song starts with an Amaj7(no3rd) and the bass moves down to F#, so you would use this to show that only the bass is moving and the Amaj7 continues over it.

It depends on context but, like  said before, simpler is usually better.

No. They are gestalt entities, unified figments of the imaginations of tens of thousands of loyal cereal company employees, shaped and moulded by shamans on retainer, reinforced by the idle adoration of myriad children. The mind of a child holds prodigious power that is rarely tapped.

Where you have it backwards is that these mascots' service is not in promoting cereal. In fact, it is cereal that promotes the mascot.

At the same time it's disappointing for them to put out the misinformation that female bisexuality is, ""Not as much of a problem,"" because, ""Men find it sexy."" 

Firstly since ~75% of bisexual women have experienced violence and *bisexual women are at the greatest risk of violence of all people of all sexual orientations* ([""This makes bisexual women the number one target of sexual and domestic violence in the world, followed by bisexual men \(47.4%\), then lesbian women, heterosexual women, gay men and heterosexual men.""](http://www.gender-focus.com/2013/12/21/violence-against-bisexual-people/)), that is a wrong piece of information to put out there. 

In a world where women are at an increased risk of intimate partner violence to begin with and where bisexuals are at an even greater risk of violence, especially with the complications of trying to balance the emotional needs of male and female lovers and queer and non queer lovers and communities and the potential for strong hurt feelings in lovers when the bisexual doesn't manage to be socially skilled and salve everyone's hurt feelings, that is damaging information to put out there. It is not accurate to say that bisexuality, true bisexuality is all good with straight male lovers because in reality it puts bisexual women at vastly increased risk for intimate partner violence. 

I would be willing to hazard a guess that a large proportion of the intimate partner violence that bisexual women experience comes from straight men who got into the relationship thinking that bisexual women's feelings for women were something that was merely there for their titillation, and something that was there to cater to their sexual needs. When the bisexual woman then has feelings for women which conflict with meeting the straight man's sexual needs or she loves her more than him and expresses her bisexuality in a way that doesn't revolve around him, this is a very painful situation that he is completely unprepared for. It's like the pain of a breakup + the pain of a woman who is expressing her sexuality in a way that doesn't revolve around men's needs. 

For the NYT to put across this view that straight men are all good with bisexual women's sexual orientation when bisexual women are the group MOST LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE VIOLENCE FROM STRAIGHT MEN is unfair to bisexual women. The more that men read articles essentially erasing female bisexuality, the farther away they will be from accepting it and the more violence bisexual women will face because their straight lovers cannot accept who they are. 

This perspective is also invalidating of the sincerity and depth of bisexual women's feelings for women, it suggests that female bisexuals don't actually care deeply about women or have ownership of our feelings, it's just something cute for our male sexual interests. 

No no no, these are *my feelings*, they not for men's titillation, they are my feelings.

So spending billions on the [""politics of punishment""](http://youtu.be/c2tOp7OxyQ8?t=21m48s) is not the way forward in addressing immoral behaviour in society; which is what Bryan Stevenson implies [- an extremely reputable human rights lawyer who spends his life trying to address the issue of punishment, and who knows more about it than most of us.](http://www.ted.com/talks/bryan_stevenson_we_need_to_talk_about_an_injustice.html))*

It wasn't defined as a ""crime"" despite it being based on the thinking that black people are inferior &amp; can be used as slaves, making it ok for [Americans, the British &amp; Europeans to raid Africa of ~10million people.](http://abolition.e2bn.org/slavery_45.html) Where's the *basic* human empathy worldwide!?

It was addressed by educating people on how it really hurt others, instilling empathy. [I.e. William Wilberforce publicised evidence to the public that Slave Trade really hurt people, which lead to British parliament taking action to abolish it due to public pressure.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_slave_trade#End_of_the_Atlantic_slave_trade)

Because one of the most immoral ""crimes"" in history was addressed by instilling empathy, I think to change people's behaviour, we shouldn't be so focussed on ridiculing, name-calling &amp; expressing our disapproval; it likely segregates and makes people set up/reside further in their mini community like /r/TheRedPill , or stormfront, making it ok for them to continue having those unempathetic opinions. We should focus primarily on educating people on understanding how things hurt people - to instil empathy.

Every individual has the neural ability to change what they think about something. What you think/feel about something isn't ingrained for life, we all have brains that display neuroplasticity, allowing us to change &amp; learn. Some evidence on why empathy is very real to all humans &amp; how it changes the brain are: [here](http://youtu.be/BG46IwVfSu8), [here](http://youtu.be/l7AWnfFRc7g), and [here (this guy won a Marie Curie Award for such studies)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Keysers)

TRUE,[deleted],,,"I'm a feminist, but I believe that there are problems with the language that you're using.  Speaking of privilege seeks only to promote guilt in a wide spectrum of human beings who share only in anatomical traits.  To say that all white heterosexual men enjoy privilege casts as negative the very things that should be promoted to be enjoyed by all people.

That language neglects that some of us are poor, suffer neurological and physical conditions, come from a wide array of family backgrounds, have different social statuses based on resources, criminal, and educational records, and exhibit personalities as diverse as all of humanity.  The color of one's skin, what lies between one's legs, and whether one prefers different, matching, or no genitalia in a partner or lack thereof have nothing to do with whether we are deserving of respect and moral equality.

That language singles out white, male heterosexuals for different treatment from others based on nothing more than biology and anatomy.  That IS sexist, racist, and heterophobic.  You don't realize it, but you're perpetuating exactly the perception that you claim does not exist.

Rather than attack a basic level of decency and respect by singling out one group to hate based on their apparent receipt of such, it should be promoted that this imaginary notion of privilege be extended to all people as a benchmark of the exact goal that we seek to reach.  Anything else only uses biological markers to single out one group of people to blame for all the world's problems.  That is exactly the opposite of what feminism should be about.

I'm a disabled person, and what little bit I do own is always falling apart and was earned through hard work.  Nobody gives me anything for being white, male, nor heterosexual.

TRUE,DesertWizard1,,,"The power supply shouldn't hurt the logic board. I'd be more concerned about the logic board coupling noise into the power supply. Digital circuits generate a good deal of EMI and this can get coupled into your power, which effects the rest of the circuit. 

Though, there are many factors that you need to consider, such as frequency and how sensitive the rest of your circuit is to noise. Also, you may be able to mitigate some of these problem through your design. For example, add in some additional EMI filters. 

Another trick for reducing EMI is to use paralell ground and power planes. This creates a capacitance that is good for shunting high frequency noise, it's called the ""image-plane effect"". When the ground and power are not close they can act as antennas, and this is when you have problems.

TRUE,tomrhod,points,6∆,"Just a note OP, I can't access your medscape article, it appears to be behind a paywall, so that makes it difficult to respond to it.

But having looked into the schizophrenia thing with a lot of sincerity myself, and being a long-term daily user for various reasons (some medical, some not), I can give my perspective.

Firstly, if schizophrenia was correlated to marijuana usage, you would see higher rates of schizophrenia in areas of the world with greater usage of weed, but that hasn't happened. Schizophrenia is a genetic condition, not one brought on by marijuana. For some people, marijuana usage can be a triggering incident to activate latent schizophrenia, and in fact there are many triggering events in life, usually brought on simply by stress (see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causes_of_schizophrenia)). [For instance](http://healthland.time.com/2011/02/07/marijuana-linked-with-earlier-onset-of-schizophrenia-in-research-review/):

&gt; ...none of the data linking marijuana use and psychosis can prove causality or sufficiently explain why rates of schizophrenia have remained stable or even declined since the 1950s, while marijuana use has increased exponentially. Unlike rates of cigarette smoking and lung cancer, which rise in tandem, marijuana smoking rates in the population do not correlate with higher rates of schizophrenia.

So you can't ""catch"" schizophrenia from marijuana usage (although again, [everything is debatable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causes_of_schizophrenia#Cannabis), and use should be avoided before brain development is closer to completed around 18/19), but it can trigger an earlier onset in susceptible individuals. Being aware of family members with it and how that might affect you is an important part of being a responsible adult that can make choices for themselves about risk vs reward. Since schizophrenia affects, at most, 1% of the population, 99% of people won't have to deal with anything like that.

As for ""schizophrenic symptoms,"" that sounds a little vague to me. As I said, I couldn't access the article, but if they define it as I imagine they did, then technically they're correct. Marijuana usage can cause certain symptoms that correlate with schizophrenia -- vivid internal hallucinations, minor visual distortions (wavy fields, etc), auditory hallucinations (brief, inexact, but still), confusion, negative thought loops that seem to spiral out of control and leave you anxious, etc. Yes, those are all things that people with schizophrenia experience as well, but that's not necessarily meaningful as we could apply the same thing to many types of legal drugs, too. Every drug has side effects, but with the recreational ones, every side effect seems to be magnified because of its prominence as a DRUG and not merely a ""pharmaceutical"" drug.

As for physical health, people can ingest or vape marijuana instead of smoking it. In fact, I found that smoking it was the worst part of the experience, and often left me hacking up things after a long time of usage (plus it was a much harsher experience overall). Vaporizing removes the need to burn it, and thus you get more out of it, there's no potential harm from smoke (as there is none), and the high is much smoother. This assumes a good vaporizer (like the Volcano) and not a crap one as is so often seen.

But I have never seen a study linking long term marijuana usage with increased rates of cancer either, whether smoking or not. There has even been research on THC -- the main active compound in marijuana -- and it's anticarcinogenic properties, but research is ongoing and inconclusive at the moment.

Mental is something else that's difficult to define. It obviously caused issues for you, but I can tell you I went through a similar period. It wasn't so much the weed doing it as it was something happening in my life that it exacerbated. Without being able to deal with that stress, the marijuana turned against me and shined a light on my anxieties and fears in a much more pointed way. This is often the case, in my anecdotal experience, with people having similar issues.

Nonetheless, two anecdotes don't make data. But I think you can see that, much like any drug, it affects people differently, and potentially harmful effects can be mitigated or eliminated entirely with proper research into it, into one's own family medical history, and with a keen eye towards listening to one's own body. If you don't like what's happening when using it long term, then you stop. And you did! That's how it's supposed to work.

I mean marijuana wasn't entirely negative for you either, was it? Yeah, towards the end it was negative, but you wouldn't have smoked it for a year if you weren't enjoying yourself.

And once again, just because something was one way for you and your body and personal biochemistry, doesn't mean it will be for most other people.

**EDIT:** One thing to add is that there is evidence that heavy marijuana use can lead to lower cognition and IQ levels in adulthood if used a lot when you're young (under 18/19) (although there have been [criticisms](http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/23/us-australia-cannabis-idUSBRE90M14C20130123) of such studies).  So if you do use marijuana before then, try to not use it that often (maybe every few months).

But to be safer, wait until you're 18 to dive into it, or even 20.  You have your whole life to be a stoner, but only a few years where your brain is becoming formed.

You'd think that with him being the son of god, STDs wouldn't be a problem, but Jesus hung out with a bunch of whores and lepers back in the day, so his cock is absolutely covered in open sores, puss, scabs and general nasty bodily fluids. He grabs his cock at the base and starts furiously jacking off. Scabs are flying through the air, and Buddha is getting covered in pus. So Buddha grabs Jesus by the torso and rips open his stab wound and starts eating it out like it's a pussy. Buddha is covered in puss scabs and blood and starts to foam at the mouth. He stops eating out Jesus and starts fucking the gaping hole in Jesus' side. Vishnu steps in and grabs Jesus, Buddha and himself all around the neck and strangles the shit out of everyone while simultaneously jerking himself off. Now Jesus's face turns black and he dies from lack of oxygen. Vishnu and Buddha start to devour his corpse  piece by piece, really tearing into the flesh, ripping out eyeballs, real passion of Christ type stuff. It's especially brutal because Vishnu uses three hands to tear at the flesh, and one to jerk off, where Buddha only has the one hand to tear at Jesus with. Of course, using the other one to jack off. At the point, the timer on top of the Marmoset cage has gone off, and a herd of wild, rabid, hungry marmosets all descend upon the scene like some kind of blood orgy. You see, they've been locked in that cage for days. The stench of all the dried crusty monkey shit and diarrhea, plus the blood and organs from the ones they killed is so powerful that it literally causes Buddha to pass out. Now there is a proverbial tide of marmosets, all competing with Vishnu for the chance to eat and fuck Buddha. Fortunately, he has enough fat rolls that every mouth and dick is satisfied. Now Jesus comes back to life, but most of his body has either been eaten or fucked to bloody pulp, so he's really just an oozing mass of puss and blood and sweat. There is so much sweat, I almost forgot about it all. It's not the kind of sweat that you get from going to the gym for a few hours, but it's the kind that collects right where your ass crack stops and your taint begins. It's like, 99% humidity, 110 degree weather kind of gooch asscrack butt sweat. So Jesus comes back covered in what is essentially Santorum, and starts eating Vishnu's asshole. Not like how gays do it in pornos, but more like a hyena eating the asshole of a dead, decomposing elephant. Tearing into it with his teeth, really getting the job done. While that is going on, Vishnu starts to fist Jesus, and the Marmosets all descend into another shit throwing, puss eating, cock smockling blood orgy.

At its core the NSA is charged with protecting American interests technologically by any means, but its role is outdated.  More and more Americans want America to meld in with a more equal global climate.  It's exactly what happened before the Civil War.  Most people saw them selves as a Tennesseeian or a Georgian than an American, but America had to go through a painful change to catch up with how industrialization made our world smaller.  Now its happened again and we are struggling to adapt, with a block of power set firmly in an old world where America as a nation matters more than the global economy or culture.

I imagine many at the NSA are honestly confused about why Americans care they are spying on the Swedes or Russians.  They wouldn't understand that we don't view them as any different from ourselves anymore since we can hop on Xbox Live and have a chat with any of them as casually as we do with our family and friends at home.

TRUE,lol_donkaments,,,"Trap as a genre suffers from rigidity right now.

Hip hop beats themselves are very straightforward, there's relatively little room to mess with the fundamental 808 kick timings, with snare hits on three, claps on each beat, 16th note high hats with 32nd fills, etc.  Hip hop has gotten away with recycling many similar sounding ""beats"" (I hate that word) because what's on top of them - the vocals - are what people really care about, and are different every song.

Trap doesn't have this to the extent hip hop does. Things start to sound the same. Not only is there rigidity in the ""beats"" of trap, the synth lines themselves are severely limited in a creative sense by a lack of tonality.  (Almost) every trap song is in a minor key.  Beyond that, it's rare to find chord progressions in drops, and sometimes even in songs.  What's most limiting here though is that the synth melodies tend to hinge on the tonic (the note of the key the song is in), and move one semi-tone up, or one or two semi-tones down, and not much more.  8 measures into almost every 16 measure drop (90% of all trap drops) the melody is just moved up or down an octave... 

This is all to say, trap, like hip hop, is a mostly percussive genre, not a harmonic one.  The reason house, trance, hardstyle, dubstep, etc. have longer musical half lives than trap is because they have a much larger tonal toolkit at their disposal. Major keys, minor keys and other modes are all fair game.  Obviously this is the case, because they are held to an even more boring standard rhythmically - 4 to the floor kicks - but they're still around, and there is still wide diversity between tracks.

Trap is undergoing divergent evolution currently - on one side the genre will continue polarizing itself more towards hip hop, with lyrics at the focus, and the trappiness of the accompaniment being an afterthought (think Ace Hood's Bugatti). Movement will continue in the other way towards influences of melodic EDM genres.  So basically, from how I see things unfolding, if trap is to continue as more than the cute hiphop/EDM gimmick of 2012-13 we're going to have to see a broadening of what is standard.  The melodic toolkit needs to be expanded.  The 808 kick + snare + claps + hi hat, etc. framework needs to be elaborated on and experimented with by some musically inspired people.  Basically, we need trap's equivalent of Mozart or Beethoven to come around and have the musical vision to say ""this sounds sick but THIS would sound even more dope.""  We have a few of these people now (RL, Baauer, and Bro Safari come to mind immediately, imo) but we need more.  If more and more talented people with great ideas get into trap production, the genre will live and continue to be interesting, if not, it'll fade away as quickly as it exploded over the last year and a half or so.",0,1388869967,,0,FALSE,1,cehd23c,t3_1uet32,t1_cehd23c,t3_1uet32,1431799476,71,FALSE,trap,t5_2qx81,71

http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/the_data_question_should_the_third-party_records_doctrine_be_revisited/

Those opinions questioning and advocating against the third-party doctrine are the fruit of a ten second Google search.

That is point blank idiotic, and indeed begs the question. Even the people who defend the third-party doctrine have *never* said that metadata is *de jure* or *de facto* unprotected. If you're just going to make unsupportable assertions without any reasoning whatsoever, I think I'm gonna vacate this conversation as unproductive.

TRUE,informationmissing,,,"I see a lot of shitty, non-explanations here. Let me walk you through an example. Forget about your apple though, it's a bad way of talking about division. 

Imagine a 6 foot (meter if you wish) long piece of wood. You want to cut it into 3 equally-sized pieces. How long will each piece be? Of course the answer is 2 feet long because 6/3=2. Now cut a 6 foot piece of wood into 2 pieces, the result of this division is 3. Cut a 6 foot piece of wood into **one piece**...

This always makes people stop and think... ""cut it into one piece.?? but if I cut it then won't I automatically have more than one piece?"" The answer is yes, so the solution is not to cut the wood. leaving you with one piece of wood that is 6 feet long. 6/1=6. dividing by 1 is essentially the same as doing nothing. 

Finally, cut a 6 foot piece of wood into **zero pieces**... You should see why that won't work. You're basically asking someone to take something that exists, a piece of wood, and make it no longer exist.

People always say ""BURN IT!"" and think that they are very clever, but if you burn a piece of wood, you have not 'cut it into zero pieces', but you have transformed it into many millions of pieces; ash, gasses, smoke, etc.

To cut something into zero pieces is to make it disappear. That is magic, and magic is not real, however much we all hope that it might be. You have asked a person to do something impossible if you ask them to give you a result for 6/0.

Why do you expect Jews to reimburse him? Do we give charity to those who are poor or sick or having horrific atrocities occurring to them and expect to get all our money returned to us from them? 


And if we as Jews decided to give him all the money he spent during that time, who specifically would have repaid him and when should it have occurred? Right after the war by those people who he saved? By their descendants? By Israel? By Jewish Americans? Or  should every single Jew in the world pay for the damages for the atrocities committed against our own people? Do you not think that the people he saved were trying their best to help him survive, while they were doing the same thing for their own families?


And how would it have been paid? In one full allotment? Monthly allowances, with 5% interest?


Oskar said it was around $1,056,000, but I personally think he was worth a lot more.  But what is the price now a days for saving someones life and risking your own? 


And why do you not expect Germany to repay him? Or by those people and their descendants who took his money from him?



I wish he could have had a better life because he deserved some kind of restitution. But the question is, who owed him that? Jews? Germany? Humanity? And who are you to decide who owes what.


Do good people always expect to have their lives be perfect because they do good things? I wish it were true, but sadly it is not.


Oskar Schindler would be horrified if this is his legacy. He is considered righteous among men, where hundreds of thousands of people visit his grave -located in a holy spot in Israel- yearly. Memorialized by millions, and never ever forgotten.

**TL;DR** You all trivialize his life, and I am horrified by it. None of you would ever expect a charity to repay you for a donation, so why do you expect it in this case?

That's all they wanted so they could get in to their fancy college with a big name.  They didn't care about history or chemistry; they took classes to look good.  At the end of my senior year, my English teacher said to my class: ""You are all, by far, the worse generation I've ever had to teach in my entire life.  You all get the best grades yet you're the worst students.""  We were all grade grubbers.  Analyze Shakespeare? Easy.  Care about Shakespeare? God, no.  After having graduated high school, I still find it true.  In college, most people I know are in majors that are predicted to do well within 4 years time.  If I asked a person why they were in that major, they wouldn't say that they liked it; they would say: ""because it makes money."" 

My generation has been scared shitless by all the stories of jobless degree carriers that they seriously lose any value in their education.  They don't find the things they learn *meaningful*, they find the things they learn a means to an end.  They don't care how cool calculus is, they just need to know how to take a derivative so they can pass a class and add a degree to their resume.

I find people my age have zero meaning to their lives unless it's ""get a job, make money, retire.""  How absolutely *dull*.  This generation is plagued by this obsession of practicality.  ""If I don't major in yadda yadda, I won't get this job! Therefore, I'll be in this major.""  

You end up with a generation of people who can *do* things, but *don't care* about what they're doing.  I find the current generation is struggling to find meaning in their lives, which makes them obsess over money, material objects, and superficial things.

TRUE,2bABee,,the dentist of love,"I think sexual compatibility is a red herring for the bigger problem of seeking instant gratification. Obviously you want someone who meets your needs, but there is a difference between a person who won't meet them and is willing to with time. You can easily determine that from conversation. Anyone who is emotionally invested in you should be willing to meet your sexual needs within reason and work towards pleasing you. That's just part of being giving and generous in a relationship. 

Most of my relationships were pretty lame sexually. So I have sought out via OKC more sexually driven and kinky people. Largely however, our personalities and values do not mesh at all, and my relationships have been with people who have narrow sexual horizons because I find myself far more compatible with them. It's a bit of a bind, but I am who I am. I'd rather try and work with someone who I can get along with day to day than seek out sexual gratification from someone I cannot respect as a person. 

I'm in no rush. To me time is not 'wasted' with people, even if things don't work out. I spend almost four years with a partner who was a dead fish sexually, but it was fulfilling in lots of other ways. We were together over six months before we slept together, and that was fine by me.

I don't mind putting effort into connecting with people at all, precisely because I'm not in it to 'get something out of it.' That entire mentality morally irks me, and is probably why I can't engage in casual sex. I might be able to do FWB, but that just seems boring and too limited to retain my interest. I'm greedy, I want the whole deal or nothing.

The more I think about the more I realize I just don't think about sex/relationships with any of this terminology. It just seems bizarre and transactional to me in a way that seems dehumanizing. I don't interact with people for them to fulfill some subset of my perceived needs, I do it because I want to interact with people who will force me to grow and make me a better human being.

TRUE,[deleted],,,"wow. Not sure where to start here. I've been doing CG for years, many years. I work on my art every day, whether I am getting paid for it or not. I enjoy sharing it. I produce a massive quantity of art that never gets seen, a massive quantity that rarely gets seen outside of its intended context, and then these anatomy studies, which is my hobby and which I enjoy showing off. 

Yes, this is ...like my 5th. But these aren't simple pieces of art you do in a day. These take days, weeks, or months depending on the artist, how much time they have, how fast they work, and how much of a perfectionist they are. So if you want to go back to the first time I tried one of these realistic portraits, I've been learning this kind of specific portrait art for about 2 years.

Beyond that, art was never destroyed by being 'shared', and artists never prosper or grow in a complete vacuum. You are either incredibly immature, or you know nothing of art - either way your opinion of me, art in the age of the internet, and art in general, is flawed, and you need to put some time and energy into both that, and the way you present yourself as some asshole who is overly offended by his own poor suppositions.

And thus continues the Chiefs postseason losing streak now with 8 consecutive losses over 21 years. Words cannot express my sadness. I'm not angry. All I wanted was the drought to end. No Superbowl, just a win in the post season. Kansas City is the Sisyphus of football, destined to roll a boulder up a hill in the postseason, only watch is roll back down, and repeat forever. 

""Indianapolis, where I learned the truth about despair, as will you. There's a reason why this prison is the worst hell on earth... Hope. Every Chief who has ventured here over the centuries has looked up to the light and imagined climbing to freedom. So easy... So simple... And like shipwrecked men turning to sea water from uncontrollable thirst, many have died trying. I learned here that there can be no true despair without hope. So, as I terrorize Kansas City, I will feed its fans hope to poison their souls. I will let them believe they can survive so that you can watch them clamoring over each other to ""stay in the sun."" You can watch me torture an entire fan base and when you have truly understood the depth of your failure, we will fulfill Irsay's destiny... We will destroy Kansas City and then, when it is done and Kansas City is ashes, then you have my permission to die.""

TRUE,DanReggins,,,"At first I moved to Costa Rica.  Lived in Latin America almost 4 years.  If you are an American man, I do NOT recommend moving to Latin America without a professional sponsor.  They overwhelmingly do NOT like Americans and this will affect every aspect of your life (outside of tourism that is; we're the best tippers.)

I also had some savings that I used until I got a job leading expeditions for G Adventures.  

Right now, I have my company and savings I earned from 2.5 years in Iraq and Afghanistan.

You asked -- you know what I left behind in So Cal?  Oh man, I can feel the hamstering coming on, but hey, we support each other here, right? 

Nothing.

Because I had fucking nothing.

I'm a CISSP, about to finish my Masters in Information Assurance.  I've been an MCSE since 2003, but also an MCITP:EA and MSCA for 2012.  CCNA since 2001.  After 7 years of working in So. Cal, you know what the best fucking job I could get was?

Desktop support.  (Help desk.)

I simply could not get even interviews for anything better.  Recruiters outright refused to look for anything for me other than help desk.  I had my own successful internet company running too -- but was told to take it off my fucking resume!  I had proven myself more capable, but it was like the world was telling me that they'd never let me be more than a low level piece of shit.

I have no family.  Well, technically I do, but in reality I don't.  I'll leave it at that.  

Finally, let's talk about women.  It's a big reason why we're here.

Well, I didn't have any.  Say what you want, but now I'm spinning plates.  Much is different now, but nothing that I would think that should justify me going from 0 to plates.  

I know that I didn't have everything going for me.  I'm only 5'10, blond, and didn't have a good job.  I'm also not materialistic.  I accept the negatives that come with that.  I just don't think that I deserved nothing.

That said, I still had spending cash, dressed well, and was in shape.  Not good enough.

I had nothing.  But who got the stupid, vapid california cunts?  A meth addict ""friend"" was popular.  So were the pasty high-school dropouts who offered, literally, nothing.  And you know where I saw the largest number of HOT women?  

When I visited a friend in FUCKING JAIL.

I couldn't believe the number of REALLY, drop-dead gorgeous women there with fucking LOSER criminals.  Listen man, I could understand an attraction to a successful criminal like Pablo Escobar, but a fucking loser who got caught stealing a $50 stereo? Really?

And you know, I had recently done a successful score myself.  Won't say more than that but it was a helluva lot more than $50, and I sure as hell didn't have it on my record.  But I guess the type that aims low and gets caught is what is ""sexy"".  

As you can imagine, shit like this leads to violence.  ""Oh, really, you're going to be another plate for this drop-out pasty little bitch?  How about I fucking show everybody who the better man is right now?""  I remember, even on Christmas eve, dudes punching others in the back of the head followed by a boot there when they're on the ground.  

So, what?  Accept having and being nothing?  Kill myself?  Or do something radical?

Move to another state?  I had absolutely no evidence to suggest that this would work out for me... but I did have evidence that life in other countries would at least fix the woman situation in my life.

So, I got rid of all my shit and I left.  It's been long and hard, but I've found places that are good for me.

And as far as my career goes -- going to Iraq and Afghanistan finally forced the world to judge me on my merits. I got promoted 3 times my first year, and nobody can ever doubt me or take that away from me.  So I'm not so pissed about that anymore.

&gt;what you found? 

There really isn't anything profound out there.  People around the world are fucking shallow and petty.  If I was in a place that liked americans, my life was good.  If not, only slightly better than the US.  That said, there's little to be gained in a place that dislikes Americans unless you're getting paid. 

&gt;And How do you live on that relatively small income?

Things can be lower quality, but a lot cheaper in other places.  Subtract 50% of your rent, then 100% of your heating, your car, gas, insurance, overpriced materialistic bullshit, and you'll see you have quite a bit left.  It takes adjustment but it's definitely possible.

To get to 2601 Zuni from the Hilton:

* Just go NE on Welton 2 blocks to 16th
* Take the shuttle (Mall Ride) NorthWest to Wynkoop street (All cross-streets are announced on the PA; it is a couple stops after the Market Street Station). 
* Go SW on Wynkoop and cross the creek.
* Take a moment to enjoy the view; we have some nice pedestrian bridges crossing over Cherry Creek.
* Head across, then up, Speer, over the light rail, over I-25, and you're at 2601 Zuni.

To get to the Pepsi Center from 2601 Zuni:

* Walk back SE on Speer to Chopper Circle / Wewatta Street (It changes names at Speer; don't get lost).
* Walk SW down Chopper Circle, underneath the awesome Pepsi Center Sign / Art Installation
* Continue down Chopper to where it starts to curve (You will cross one little road labeled VIP parking or Permit Only parking - for the curious, it leads to the chiller plant / loading dock area, and the Office Tower on the back of the building). You will see a little round patio with a big Pepsi Logo made of rocks/gravel. This is the main entrance!
* Enjoy The Game!

To get back to the Hilton, if it is before 1 AM:

* Walk NE on Chopper, Cross Speer, Continue NE on Wewatta across another awesome wood-decked steel pedestrian bridge.
* Continue on Wewatta across 15th Street. At this point Wewatta curves to the left. On your left is a mostly-empty grass lot, and on your right is a set of buildings, with a sidewalk that cuts across the lot, hugging the buildings. Take this sidewalk.
* Turn right on 16th, stop at the lit sign that says Wynkoop. It has a bus map on it. The Mall Ride will pick you up here (if it is not after 1:15 AM).
* Diversion: If you want to have a pint post-game, the Wynkoop Brewery is two blocks NE on Wynkoop, at 18th. They have awesome microbrews and great atmosphere).
* Take the mall ride out SouthEast to Welton
* Walk 2 blocks SW to the Hilton
* Rest Easy!

I live downtown, and it's perfectly safe if you keep your head on your shoulders, but sadly I am working Friday night from 7 PM - 7 AM, so I can't be your guide. Let me know if you need a hand or somehow get turned around (16th street has bus maps at every block that show where you are).

Edit: There's a SmashBurger on 16th in between Lawrence and Larimer (They're a Denver-founded burger joint that rolls the beef into round balls, then smashes them onto the grill to sear them).

TRUE,texasflag1836,,,"You cannot become fluent in a language with DuoLingo.

It's one tool--a great one--but should be one of several you use.

I think DuoLingo teaches *vocabulary* and *grammar* well. It's NOT teaching you how to read and write with any fluency. Being able to translate a sentence from one language to another is not writing. If you think about it, all you're really doing is checking your vocabulary and grammar. Writing is being able to express your own thoughts with a degree of fluency. Do you know how to write a letter, a blog post, or even a funny text message in your target language? DuoLingo isn't teaching you that.

Vocabulary and grammar are foundational skills, but they are not real language learning. There are four basic competencies in language learning: Listening, Speaking, Reading, and Writing. To reach a level of fluency, you have to actively practice each of these.

Fortunately, there are online resources that can help with all of them.

**Listening**: This is probably the easiest one to get online. You can find countless youtube videos, podcasts, newscasts, etc. in your target language at Beginning, Intermediate, or Advanced levels. Spend 30 minutes a day actively listening to something that's challenging but comprehensible.

**Speaking**: To practice this one, you're going to have to speak! You can find cheap online tutoring through iTalki, or find a language exchange partner or tutor in your city. You should be trying to get through a set amount of time without using *any* English. Start with 5 minutes, then build up from there until you can be in conversation for an hour at a time using only your target language.

You'll probably find that you know very little about how to actually speak! What's the most natural way to greet a friend? What kind of slang or bad grammar do people constantly use when speaking, that's never mentioned in the textbooks? You'll also find that listening to a native speaker in casual conversation is much different than listening to the radio or watching TV! You need to learn this stuff, and the only way to learn it is from a native speaker who's willing to be patient with you.

**Reading**: finding these resources is just as easy as listening. You should be able to find books, stories (I found a lot of free ""leveled"" Kindle reading textbooks), news, current events, blogs, etc. in your target language. Anything that you would normally do in English (like browse Reddit!), teach yourself to do it in your target language. Change your Facebook, Reddit, Gmail settings to your target language. Change your computer and smartphone language settings: now you're going to have to learn the menus in your target language! Get creative with it. Anything that's not for your actual job, you can switch to doing in another language.

**Writing**: this is something you need to practice often, hopefully daily. Start with writing short (5 sentences) monologues. Basic stuff. I love coffee, for example, so I'd start with a short paragraph about why I like it, where I buy it, how I make it. Use simplistic grammar and vocabulary at first--the point is that these are *your* thoughts, coming from your own mind, expressed in your second language. You can post it to Lang-8, and native speakers will correct your writing and give you tips. If you have a tutor or language exchange partner, they can help as well.

Again, look at your behavior. What do you do every day? Could you switch from English to your target language? Could you express yourself just as well in another language? Every Facebook comment, reddit response, email, Google search, ask yourself, ""How would I do this in my second language?"" Write that stuff down, post it to Lang-8 or show it to your tutor.",0,1388893100,,0,1388894613,1,cehl8w9,t3_1ud6lp,t1_cehl8w9,t3_1ud6lp,1431803431,9,FALSE,duolingo,t5_2t6ze,9

Anyway at one point in the conversation I mentioned that I had always thought she was cute and she said that she had actually had a crush on me for a while.

She was cheating on me.  I didn't realize at the time.  But she was very distant and I was trying anything to repair things with her.  Telling her how important she was, buying things, cooking meals, etc.

Anyway, I took her upstairs for some sex in the hope that I could connect with her, but it didn't happen.  I mean, we had sex, but there was no connection.  She wouldn't look me in the eye.  She wouldn't touch me.  I couldn't get off, and when we finally gave up, I spooned her and told her how much she meant to me.  Then she got out of bed without saying anything to me.

No fingering, no stretching nothing. The worst part? He used lotion as lube. The only thing I could bear was his tip, and even that made me limp around for 3 days (I should've mentioned that I told him to stop after this and pull out).

TRUE,conservativecowboy,,,"I was a female medic in both DS/DS and Operation Iraqi Freedom in 03/04. I was in Iraq and Qatar in DS/DS and Iraq only in Iraqi Freedom.

In DS/DS I treated a fair amount of Iraqi soldiers that were burned. I had very little real world experience at that time and was only an EMT-B in the civilian world. 

For Iraqi Freedom, I was called up from a National Guard unit and attached to a mounted ADA unit, but also did unmounted patrols with both the US and Polish infantry. By that time I was a paramedic in the the real world and had extensive experience in trauma.

Technically I was a POG (people other than grunts), but I earned the respect of the other soldiers in the unit and being a female was never an issue. I carried my own crap, leaned to pee standing up (thanks P-Mate), went days without showers, was the only female with 57 guys and it worked. It also helped that I was older than most of the guys in the unit. Also, there is something about being a medic that we are given more responsibility/treated differently than other soldiers in the unit. 

I became the defacto marriage counselor, financial counselor, just mental health counselor though I had no training in these things. This wasn't just for the enlisted either. I was asked my opinion on things I had no knowledge of militarily. I was placed in situations with Iraqi women that I certainly had no training in. 

Combat is more intense than anything I could ever describe. It is loud beyond belief. It is confusion, fear, anger, shock, center-shocking and by that I mean physically, your insides are shaking from the noise and concussions of explosions. It's also invigorating, sometimes incredibly funny, terrifying and earth-shatteringly sad all within a very few minutes. 

I was in several convoys when I was with the mounted ADA and experienced an IED explosion. This was before our vehicles were up-armored and we were driving around sitting on steel plates. Except it was 110 degrees and those things are freaking hot. So we'd convoy bare and hope like hell there were no IED's. 

First the explosion would cause your ears to pop and your chest to lose air. Like some giant was just crushing your chest preventing you from inhaling. In reality it was the concussive pressure from the shock wave. I was in the vehicle behind an IED explosion and watched the vehicle fly up in the air and come down burning. The gunner manning the .50 cal flew from the vehicle and ended up with a couple of broken bones, but nothing major, the driver was thrown clear but had a TBI, and the Iraqi Lieutenant (he was born in Iraq, but raised in the US and graduated from USC or somewhere out there with an engineering degree) was still in the vehicle. Now the vehicle is burning, but he is still in there grabbing/collecting his gear. 

I'm treating the gunner, the guys are setting up a perimeter defense, I'm calling in a 9-line and I'm screaming at the LT to get away from the vehicle. Finally he scoots away. After the medevac comes in and the two injured guys are gone, I asked the LT what the hell he was doing.

He said he was getting his gear because otherwise the supply sergeant was going to charge him for the lost gear. So weren't not taking fire, but we could have at anytime, the vehicle is burning, there are live .50 rounds cooking off, I have a medevac en route and he's worried about being charged for missing equipment. That is the kind of craziness that makes you break out in giggles.

But the giggles stop when a 23 year old that was hit by a sniper's likely Tabuk round asks me to look if his junk is still there. He lived, but I don't know that he would ever have sex again. 

I helped deliver a teenage wife's baby. She was about 16 and her husband was gone. We just happened to be passing through and the house to house found her crying in a back room. I had never delivered a baby, but a call to my PA and he walked me through it. 

I treated an Iraqi family's goat. The goat was their supply of milk and cheese that they sold, but it was sick. The CO had a relative that was a vet back in Wyoming and between the three of us, we got the goat healthy again.

I am a combat vet, but the military insists on telling the world that women aren't in combat. We've absolutely been in combat for over a decade, but the American public wasn't ready to hear that. So instead we were attached to infantry, engineer, ADA, and cav units so the military can say there are no women assigned to combat units. But you better fucking believe we were and still are there. 

That is why is it so frustrating to hear the Marines say women aren't ready for combat because half the the women can't do three pull-ups. Never did someone screaming Doc ever see me coming and turn me away because I was a woman. 

Can all women do what I did? No, but all men can't either.

It was our (mostly he played as I watched, but I got him to name Magikarp to Magikrap) escape from everything.  This game meant so much to me (and I assume him as well) as it was a happy memory.  The clerk began to know us by name and knew what we were there for (to extend our pokemon red rental) until we finally beat the game.  

This was before we had internet, so the game took us forever to beat (and we were only able to play while our Dad was at work).  He played it on the Super Gameboy we had borrowed for an unintentionally indefinite period of time from our neighbors.

I had started scrounging around every single coin I could find for months.  Any time I was with somebody who paid cash, I'd ask for their change letting them know my intentions.  Most people happily gave me, a child, their 15 or whatever leftover cents.  After a couple of months of saving and scrimping, I had what I figured enough for a gameboy color and pokemon blue.

I went to the game shop up the street from my house, pulled out the 3 gallon sized bags, one with pure pennies, one with pure nickels, and the last a mix of dimes and quarters.  I said to the shopkeep, ""I'd like to get the purple gameboy color, it's my brother's favorite color!""  He looked down at my intended method of payment, looked at me (a clueless child) and look back at the bags, specifically the one of pennies.

He had an obvious internal conflict going on, until finally he said ""How much do you have here?""  And I dutifully said ""about 100$""  Without even counting, he handed me the gameboy color and Pokemon Blue.  He told me to wish my brother a happy birthday.  My brother played the hell out of that game.  He caught all 150, trading with our neighbor up the street.  He eventually got a case for his gameboy to keep it protected.

You know when you fall for someone, how they completely consume your life? That's what it was like for me. I thought about her all the time. Literally the first thing I would do in the morning was grab my phone and send her a happy ""Good morning, I dreamed about you last night."" My grades dropped, not drastically, but enough that I fell from being salutatorian to barely in the top 3% of my class (which was a big deal in my high school). My relationship with my family, which was always a little strained but loving and caring, deteriorated because I would rather spend time with her than with my parents or my sisters.

The thing is, our families didn't like each other. Like, not even a little bit. I'm really not sure why, even to this day. I know it has something to do with my grandfather, who was a high ranking officer in the Taiwanese army. He fought on the side of the Nationalists during the Chinese civil war, and when Communists took over, he was forced out under threat of torture/death. My girlfriend's family, on the complete other hand, were utterly Communist. 

It's difficult to explain, and the way I'm describing it makes it sound very petty and lame, but the rift between our families was really severe, and was a huge issue. Nevertheless, my girlfriend and I didn't care about the ROC/PROC conflict, and only cared about each other. Against our respective family's wishes, we began dating. Eventually, as we were young and foolish, we took our relationship to the next level and had sex.

We didn't use a condom. I came inside of her.

She became pregnant.

We were so in love, nothing was going to stop us from having a family. We weren't blind; we knew that it was going to be very tough on us, and that we were going to be looked down upon or disowned from our very traditional families, but we didn't care. We were *in love*.

For some reason, we kept the pregnancy secret. My parents didn't know, her parents didn't know. My grandfather probably would have had a heart attack if he knew. The only person in our families that knew was my little sister, who supported our relationship at the outrage of my parents. What we were thinking, I don't know. It's not like we were going to be able to deny it once her belly became so big. We were still living in our parents' houses.

Then, the worst day of my life occurred when she was 3 months pregnant. I can remember everything in vivid detail. We were in school, walking to class, holding hands and being happy, when she stumbled. I looked at her, her hand squeezed mine as tight as I can ever remember, her eyes rolled upwards, she gasped. 

She fell.

I remember collapsing by her, throwing my binder to the same and clutching her face while teachers ran towards us while others kept the students from stepping on her. I remember waiting by her side when the ambulance came. I remember sitting by her when she woke up. I remember when her parents came to see us, with crazed eyes of equal parts concern and rage. I remember when the doctor came in and told us all that my girlfriend had had a miscarriage.

The next thing I remember was my girlfriend's father's face in front of mine, screaming at me in a jumbled barrage of broken english and chinese, while my girlfriend and her mother cried. He ended up literally shoving me out of the room, and that was the last time I saw her.

It's not like she died or anything. Her parents just refused to let her see me. After getting out of the hospital and dealing with a nosocomial infection, she transferred schools, and their family moved away after graduation. The only information I ever found out about her after was from a mutual friend, who coincidentally went to college in the same town that they moved to. Last I heard, she's healthy again, but has a haunted look on her face. She started doing drugs, and was kicked out by her parents. I've tried looking out for her, but I was never able to contact her.

It's funny, looking back at things with full hindsight vision, when I'm able to see what a complete and utter idiot I was, but this experience is something that I look back upon both fondly and in horror. So, the most regrettable sex I've ever had was my first time, when I got a girl pregnant, permanently fucked up her family, and probably ruined her life.

Edit: Thank you everyone for your sympathies. I've only been able to share this story with a few people in person, so typing this all out in an anonymous forum was very cathartic. Your words of concern have really made me feel better about this whole thing.

I'm glad that many of you have taken an interest in that part of my life, and I've gotten several comments and private messages about contacting her online (my favorite was the PM ""contact her you stupid fuck""). I've tried to contact her online in all the ways that we used to talk to each other, and I haven't been able to actually find her.

As for sharing public information, I'm pretty hesitant to talk about her name, where we're from, and where her family moved to. Being incautious was what got us into this situation in the first place, and I'd like to think I've learned from the ordeal.

TRUE,DeeMI5I0,cookie,"15; The best, I love you","Firstly, OP, I will deal with the first clause of your question: What is the reason behind the popularity of selfie threads


One of the most basic, shared traits among humans is a primal need for attention. But perhaps we should back up a little bit. 

Every single *basic* action humans take is driven by a fundamental desire to survive long enough to pass our genes onto our offspring. From eating and drinking, to attending college. Though we have developed greatly as a species over time, I argue that, in an underlying, essential sense, we have not developed at all.

Let me give you an example. School. From our childhood, we are taught that one must always strive to do well in academia. Those that are most successful will move on to the greatest colleges, and, as a result have an advantage in the job market. This advantage may allow that lucky subsection to find a job and settle in financial security earlier than the other subsections of the population, paving the way for (you guessed it) children. Those who have better paying, more stable jobs will be in a much better position to produce and care for offspring.

Now, you may be wondering how this applies to seeking attention. Well, dear reader, basic human instincts cause us to be attracted to beauty. This beauty is a fabrication of our prudency in ensuring the survival of the human race. For example, big breasts are better to produce milk for an infant. Strong muscles are a sign of ability to provide for children through work. Though muscles are no longer as a reliable sign of a stable income as they once were, our instincts war on! Nonetheless, when one is largely considered “beautiful”, “handsome”, or “pretty” they are offered a huge advantage is the playing field of possible partners. When one perceives themselves as beautiful, or at the least more suitable than average, they will therefore want to ensure that as many people as possible are aware of the fact that they posses favorable traits for offspring. Finally, (as many people on this sub attest) confidence is considered very attractive. So, if trying to get as many people as possible to see your face is caused by you believing that you are attractive, then that simply *exudes* confidence! 

In conclusion, teenagers submit their photos to /r/teenagers in an attempt to spread the knowledge of their desirable genes and in order to appear more confident—thus making the possibility of the production of offspring more likely in our extremely outdated instinct’s mind.

Our instinct is fickle, naïve, and nearing obsolete in this age of technology. It causes us to do and think seemingly unexplainable things.

TRUE,Mrs_Frisby,,,"Actually I think NH is a great example ... just not of success.

About 7 years ago the [Free State Project](http://freestateproject.org/) started a libertarian take over of new Hampshire.  They figured out that due to its low population and governmental structure in addition to its relatively large population of native libertarians the local state government could be taken over if enough libertarians re-located to NH.  They set a goal of 20,000 immigrants that would agree to move to the requested counties to flip seats in the state government.  Essentially they became an invading army taking government away from native NH residents.  

And what have they done with it?  [A lot](http://www.unionleader.com/article/20131011/OPINION02/131019875/-1/news).  Libertarian reps are the most active lawmakers in NH by far.  Over half of reps last year proposed no laws at all.  Leading libertarians sponsored dozens each.  For Example:

**Food Safety Showboating**

You know how ~~Ron~~ Rand Paul made up his own board to certify himself instead of being certified by the existing medical board?  NH libertarians are trying to make their own FDA instead of the federal FDA.  To do this they repeatedly pass laws exempting local producers from following FDA rules.  **[but they didn't ask local producers if they wanted this first](http://www.nhbr.com/January-13-2012/House-bill-seeks-to-exempt-N.H.-food-from-federal-safety-rules/)**. Turns out ""FDA approved"" is something farmers want stamped on their products.

&gt;I think the intentions are good -- I think the sponsors are trying to promote New Hampshire agriculture and farm products and make a favorable business climate for them, and we appreciate that,"" said Merrill. ""But we have some concerns about how it could actually play out.""Those concerns, she said, ""relate to food safety and the reputation of New Hampshire food and products."" 

So they have passed 5 laws in the name of libertarian ideology that are illegal on their face, won't stand up in court, waste taxpayer money to defend, and local farmer's don't even want (you don't know what you want, we libertarians know what you want).  Mission Accomplished?

**Libertarian War On Women**

NH Libertarian leaders Dave Itse and George Lambert are *very concerned* about a man's FREEDOM to beat his wife.  Did you know that before the libertarians came to NH if a policeman was called into a domestic violence dispute and found a wife beaten black and blue he could just arrest the husband without a warrant!?!?!  Mere probable cause was enough.  They attempted to correct this with [House Bill 1581](http://legiscan.com/NH/text/HB1581/id/507520) which would explicitly strike existing language permitting arrests in volatile domestic abuse situations.  These libertarian bros also filed bills to make it harder to enforce restraining orders.  Locals were outraged, papers across the state ran articles, the Republicans turned on them (the GOP wants us pregnant, not beaten to death), and after the tidal wave of anger rolled in even the sponsors didn't dare vote for their own legislation.  But its revealing that they thought they could get away with it.  

They could get away with passing additional [restrictions on abortion](http://www.boston.com/news/local/new_hampshire/articles/2012/03/29/nh_house_votes_to_ban_abortion_after_20_weeks/) and legislatively harass abortion providers because the GOP stood with them on that.  So they've added waiting periods, ""conscience clauses"", banned government money going to any organization that provides abortions even if they are the most cost effective organization to provide a service ( and effectively preventing NH hospitals from providing abortions because hospitals need government money to operate ER rooms ) and other bullshit.  Because nothing says Libertarian like government monitoring of women's bodily functions.  There is a reason so few women are libertarians.  We know you'll sell us into slavery to get yourself a tax break.  

**NH Libertarian Love Affair With Sin Taxes**

This is a case of paying attention not to what people *say* they believe but at what *they actually do* when given power.  In theory, libertarians hate sin taxes.  Using taxes as punishment?  Bad!  Anti-Freedom!  Its just a cheap asshole trick to make someone else pay your fair share of the taxes by saying something they like is bad and then punishing them for it.  So what has happened to sin taxes in NH as the libertarians took over?

In 2005 the sin tax on a pack of smokes in NH was 52 cents.  As libertarians keep refusing other sources of tax revenue and creating more and more budget holes they've looked to sin taxes to fill in those holes and sin taxes on tobacco have risen again and again to $1.28 a pack today ... more than doubled!  Thanks to libertarians [NH is ranked 9th in the nation for the percent of its revenue gained from sin taxes](http://xfinity.comcast.net/slideshow/finance-10statesprofitsin/new-hampshire/).  And it does this *without casinos*.  Most of the other heavy hitting states on sin taxes have legal/taxed gambling.  


**On the subject of Smoking**

You'd think a libertarian dominated state would be leading the way on legalizing cannabis.  But they didn't even get around to medical use until this last June and even then they created [the strictest Medical MJ laws on the books](http://www.nashuatelegraph.com/news/1011460-469/cannabis-care-new-hampshires-law-is-one.html) requiring you to actually have a medical problem and to complete normal treatment regimes first using medial marijuana only as the last resort.  Meanwhile folks in non-libertarian Washington and Colorado have had medical use for years and now have full legalization.

I pretty much spent the whole party talking to him. We laughed, and drank, and smoked, and laughed more. It was great. So, a few weeks later, we actually go out on a ""date"", drinks at a local bar. I show up and he's already there, which is nice, but the magic we seemed to have at the party was nowhere to be found. The conversation was stilted and awkward. He talked a lot about the girl he had just gotten out of a seven-year relationship with back in Georgia. But, I'd had a few, and he was hot, so when he suggested we go back his place I thought why the hell not. We get back to his place and are making out, which is nice, but that's when things pretty much started to fall apart. The guy is pawing at my boobs, like he's never seen a pair of tits before. He takes his shirt off, and he's thin but pretty hairy (which normally is fine with me, but his body hair was coarse and thick and very odd looking). I started to think to myself ""this is kind of like having sex with a bear,"" due to the hairiness and the pawning. Then he went down on me, and CLEARLY had no idea what the hell he was doing. He basically just slobbered all over my junk, nowhere near the clitoris. I tried to guide him, both verbally and by shifting my body, but he was resistant to any suggestion. Then, he tried to put it in without a condom-- an absolute no-no for me, especially with random dudes I meet at parties. I pretty much had to DEMAND that he use one, and he got all butt-hurt about it. I don't know why I didn't leave right then, but I wouldn't have had to wait long, since he lasted literally 3 thrusts and done. I tired to give him the benefit of the doubt by trying again in the morning, and nope, again, three thrusts and done. I left and never spoke to him again. I now refer to him as The Bear Slug, as having sex with him was simultaneously like being mauled by a bear and attacked by a slug. Definitely most regrettable sex. 

Edit: As I'm off to bed and a few people have asked: I stayed due to having too many drinks to drive home safely, and I was trying to give the poor guy the benefit of the doubt. I should have just left and called a cab, but we all make bad decisions when we're a bit hammered and haven't had sex in six months.

TRUE,[deleted],,,"
It was the end of high school, I had recently come off of a break up that was because of circumstances rather than a lack of love. My ex had started dating a friend of mine which sucked, cause ya know.. Love, right? 

Ok so I had been flirting with a girl who I knew wanted to hook up in hopes of gettin my mind off my ex. We did, it was shitty sex since she just kinda did nothing. 

Here is where it gets regrettable. She and her friends (she told them all) thought it'd be funny to prank me. I was set to move out of the country for study and they didn't like that I wasn't going to be staying in the US. So she told me she was pregnant. I lost it, I felt sick, depressed, ashamed and like my life was over. I almost canceled my study abroad but she insisted I went. For the next 8 months I was constantly checking up on her, making sure she was ok and that the pregnancy was going well and to do whatever I possibly could.

Around 7 months in she stopped talking to me and finally outed that it was a prank. She thought it was funny and didn't have the guts to fucking come clean about it when she got too far into the lie. 

Months of worrying and planning, sleepless nights and depression and pure terror and she was just ""joking"". I've got problems trusting now. I have a really hard time letting people in and I find it incredibly difficult to date now without having anxiety attacks. I hope they all had a good laugh.

TL;DR Chick lies to me about being pregnant for 8 months. Got the ball rolling for some serious trust issues and emotional damage for me in the following years.

Her eyes were pretty, her sense of humor was sharp, her teeth were terrible, her tits were huge and my carnitas burrito was a tad overcooked; but all in all it was a nice little ""date."" Anyway, she ended up coming over to my apartment that night and we just sat on my couch and got drunk and talked. One thing led to another and we started making out on my bed and slowly groping and disrobing each other. Now I'm what you call a fucking gentleman so I gave her about 20 min of foreplay followed by about 5 min of ""bean flicking"" (is that the PC term?). Anyway it was getting pretty hot and heavy so I went to go put a condom on but she stopped me and said ""no sex"". So I went back to bean flicking a tit sucking for another 10 min and then again tried to go for my condoms, but once again she stopped me and said ""I don't want to have sex"". And before I could say a word she hunched over my loins and started sucking my dick like a freezee pop. So i wasnt exactly in a position to complain. But I guess her jaw got tired cause she stopped with the oral and switched to just a hand job. I've always been quite the fan of the hand job so I didn't mind... At first. But she had the worst handjob form of all time. She gripped my member WAY too tight and focused 100% on the tip, it kinda felt like she was trying to milk a goat. This handjob wasn't doing anything for me and since sex was apparently off the table I kept trying to force her to do oral by constantly shoving my penis towards her face. When I did this she would suck it for a bit but would just stop and go back to the fucking goat milking, at which point I would shove my dick back in her face and we would start the rotation all over again. We stayed in that weird blowjob/handjob limbo for like 15 minutes before I just gave up and accepted her shitty hand job. The problem was it didn't feel great so i just couldn't fucking finish. But you got to admire her spirit because she just kept going with that hand job for what felt like 45 min. Towards the end of it my dick started to kinda hurt from her rubbing in the same spot so tightly, and looking back I probably should have just showed her how to work a fucking penis, but I was drunk and she was kinda a stranger so I didn't. Anyway, after 45 min of that I realized that there was no way I was going to orgasm to this, so I just threw her off me, crawled on top of her, dry humped the shit out of her thigh and ejaculated all over her stomach. I guess I was kind of annoyed cause I just rolled off of her, put my boxers back on and went to sleep. I'm not really sure when she left but she was gone when I woke up. Relieved, I got up to take a piss and that's when it hit me, a searing pain on the tip of my penis. I look down and there were red blood stains on the inseam of my boxer shorts. In a moment of absolute horror I ripped my boxer shorts off and examined my dick. And lo and behold this chick had ripped the skin off my penis. My dick had been peeled like it was a fucking banana. There was actually loose skin that was hanging off the end holding on by a thin thread, the entire tip of my penis had been rubbed raw and bloody by this chicks shitty hand job. I'm not really sure how I didn't feel it when it was happening. Adrenaline I guess. Anyway, i ignored the girls phone calls after that and had to wrap my dick in gauze for about a week and a half just so I could comfortably wear pants. Worst fucking hookup ever.

TRUE,Tylerdynamo,,,"A few years ago I lived in Philadelphia, was in school and working part time at this swanky restaurant cutting meat all day. I had just got out of a really long, unhealthy relationship. Immediately following the breakup, I was pretty much willing to sex anything that would allow me to do so.

So I went out to a club and ended up hitting it off with an adorable blonde girl, well call her Erica. We went back to my place and the usual drunk adult activities ensued. All-in-all it wasn't bad, yet.

The next morning I woke up at like 5 or 6 a.m. and it was still pretty dark outside. So we went at it again then too. That's when things began to go awry.

She passed right back out post-coitus. Normally I would have probably done the same, but for some reason I just couldn't. Something wasn't right. My spidey senses were tingling. I sensed impending doom.

The sun began to peek out over the balcony and into my windows, illuminating the bedroom with that orangey-golden light that lingers only momentarily. I looked down at Erica. The way the light made her hair glow, and bounced off of her fair skin was poetic.

The thing that was NOT poetic was the giant pool of period blood that was now staining a sizeable portion of my ex's baby-blue sheets.

I immediately inspected my junk. Complete disaster zone. We may have to amputate. NO. We can still save this, I thought to my self.

In a panic I rushed to the shower. This is going to be very awkward when she wakes up. Hopefully, she'll hear me in the shower, get up, realize what's going on and she'll take off to save both of us.

But she did not take off. She did the opposite of take off. When I returned into the bedroom I saw that she had got dressed and was rooting through my things. And she was holding one of my paystubs. I was making good money and had a pretty big place for center city Philly. But, the paystub she was holding was a bonus check for some like measly $185 or something.

""How do you afford this place?"" she asked.

Note: It was at this point I noticed that the tote bag she had been carrying all of her things in was made of a fine burlap, very eco-friendly. The letters PETA were embossed on the side. However I didn't immediately register what those letters stood for.

""How do I afford this place? Oh I'm a butcher.""

The color immediately drained from her face and her hand darted upward, kind of cupping her mouth.

Me: Are you ok?

Erica: Oh god I think I may be sick.

Me: What's wrong with you? You hungover? Need some water or something?

Erica: No I'm a vegan.

And with that she darted into the bathroom and proceed to release the contents of her innards in the most violent fashion all up in my bathroom. Not out of sickness, but out of hatred and disgust for my very existence. I am not even shitting you.

So now I have my ex's sheets covered in nosy vegan period blood (the most potent of period bloods) and my bathroom covered her puke.

It was at this point I said to myself ""Maybe I should not have done the sex with this strange woman. I am regret.""

""Fuck it, I'll just go make breakfast I'm strangely hungry.""

But every cloud has a silver lining. And every butcher has raw pork sausage marinating in something in their fridge. And not like store bought precooked, bratwurst. Like raw animal meat, stuffed in intestines, marinating in hot sauce and porter. It looked like a failed lobotomy in a ziploc bag. It was terrifying, even to me.

She emerged from the bathroom

Me: You ok?

Erica: Yeah.

Me: Hungry?

Erica: Yeaaaah.

Me: YOU WAANT SUM SAUSAAAAAAAAGE ARRRRRRRRRRR!!!!

And she darted out my apartment, and I never saw her again, and it. Was. Awesome.

**TLDR; Morning sexed vegan. Period blood on my junk and bed. She looted my bedroom and found pay stub. Puked all over my bathroom when she found out I was a butcher. Rebuked her with raw sausage.**

So I need to accept.  Foreplay is nonexistant other than a footrub for her.  She asks that I start, and I'm so afraid of what's to come that I try desperately to force myself to stay soft so I can can have a way out of this.  I don't want to see her suffer from her depression any further.  Doesn't work, my physical body does its thing, so sex is a go.  

She wants just missionary position and to hold still.  I try kissing her neck, she tried to like it, but she reacts and pulls her jaw down to hide her neck.  She apologizes because she's trying to like kisses.  So I try some moves instead, and she winces in pain.  I try other things, she yawns and then apologizes for yawning.  It's obvious she's not enjoying this, it's hurting her, but she's trying.  I can't enjoy anything because she isn't enjoying this.  A few months back I was in this situation, and I pulled out.  She was an emotional wreck for a week.  So I'm stuck there, in a boring position, with my face buried in a pillow because I can't do anything else with it, she's holding still, and I can't do much but move my hips.  I hated that I had to be in this situation.  But I have to climb, because she would feel like a failure if I didn't.  First time in my life having sex where I didn't want to climb but I had to.  I wasn't enjoying it, and she wasn't enjoying it, but I had to convince her I was enjoying it.  Eventually the physical body did its thing.  I do everything I can to sell it.  

Afterward she wanted to talk.  She could tell something was wrong.  I slip up.  I said it was really hard to enjoy it seeing her in pain, that I miss sex, and I'd rather sex happen when she's more awake or the timing is better.  BAM.  She's shattered.  Tears and depression follow.  Ugh.  This is my wife.  It's not supposed to be like this.  

Edit: Whoa, thanks for the responses.  Yes, she's been seeing professional help for this.  We've been working at both intimacy and depression issues for years.  We've tried dozens of different approaches at it.  We communicate about it almost daily.  We have a pretty good relationship in all other aspects of our marriage.  She's not on birth control, and she's not using and SSRI based antidepressants.  We both think that if her depression were gone, so many other issues would be easier to manage, and her drive might come back.  But depression can be a very complicated and difficult thing to fix.

TRUE,Unbroken_one,,,"Sadly, this happened to me.  I met a guy for a drink when I got off work at 8:30pm. He was the athletic director of the local catholic high school. When I arrived, he was sitting at the bar &amp; had ordered a glass of white wine for me.  (I know, I know....) long story short is that he dropped me off at my sisters house at 2:30 am (he used to live in her neighborhood), I couldn't speak coherently &amp; my sister thought I was having a stroke. Took me to the ER where my BAC was .30. She told them she thought I had been drugged. Had never seen me like this. (I am a well respected business owner in the community...if that matters.) 
Go to the doc a day later to find out the result of the drug test. They can only test for what I specifically ask to be tested for. Say what?!? From the doctors office, I call the local sex assault prevention center to ask the name(s) of what to tell them to test for. They tell me to go to a different hospital for a rape kit. Do that. That hospital notifies police. Police detective calls me at midnight the next day. Shows up at my house at 1:00 am &amp; is there til 4:00 am. He assures me this is normal routine for police who work the night shift. Get a call at 8:00 am that day from a captain who apologizes &amp; assigns someone else to the case. Turns out that detective #1 was a good friend of the perp. Rape kit results rushed through the crime lab (why??), &amp; 2 weeks later, case closed. The ""investigation"" was a total joke. 

I remember having two glasses of wine &amp; that is it. The total blackout for me was about 7 hours. Video showed us leaving the restaurant at 11:00 pm. Detective #2 did say that I would have had to consume A LOT of alcohol after leaving the place. Have no idea where I was from 11:00pm to 2:30 am. Could not tell you what kind of vehicle he drove that night or anything at all. 

How did I deal? Life is not always fair and I did learn a valuable lesson about being more aware. I truly believe that he will eventually be caught doing this to another woman. Karma is a B.

TRUE,textualintercourse,,,"My Ex while we were married. She hated sex. So I wasn't getting any regardless the 'foreplay starts in the morning with acts of service' BS. One morning (among many) I woke up early and cleaned the house. Our son started crying so I took him downstairs to take care of him while I cleaned. I cleaned the kitchen, bathrooms, living room, dusted, vacuumed, etc. Then I made breakfast.

I am guilty in that I always instigated / initiated sex since she literally never would. She comes down, ""Oh, you are just doing this since you want sex later.""

Instant deflation.

I power on anyway and get the entire place in order. After I finished cleaning I got ready and I left for work. After work I was taking some night classes at the university and I had about 40 minutes between work and first class. So I took some money I had saved from donating plasma (trying to pay down the credit card debt that was sprung on me 1st month after we were married) and I buy her flowers. She was visiting her Mom. I get home from School and put the flowers on the table hoping to surprise her. She gets home, sees the flowers and says, I quote, ""Oh..you bought me flowers, why haven't you done the dishes?"" Literally in the same breath / sentence...her voice went from somewhat sweet to annoyed.

I go to school. I come back later and she is watching American Idol and our son is asleep. I start homework. She then said she was going to bed and to come up for the nightly prayer (Yay for Mormonism...). We pray, she goes and lays down and i finish my homework. I come up, brush my teeth, and get in pj's and lay next to her. We hadn't sex for 2 months up to that point. So yeah, I'm a guy with a sex drive, sue me. I roll over and kiss her neck. She rolls over and away. Alright I got the hint so I roll back over and am about to close my eyes and I hear:

* Her ""Hey.""
* Me: Hey
* Her: You want to have sex?
* Me: Uh..usually yes.

* Her: How's the Porn problem?  (One particular Sunday the leaders of the church we attended were flipping out about the evils of porn and the destruction it's wreaking on the family. I had broke...(We had sex about 20 times the first year of marriage...which is far from adequate..but Mormonism is a sexual dysfunctional wreck of a system.)...I looked at Porn online literally 2 days before that Sunday the first time ever in the marriage. She questioned me on it, and I wasn't going to lie to my 'eternal companion' so I told her...God..what was infrequent became close to nothing after that.
* Me: Gosh, I'm good. I haven't looked at it. Whatever, have a good night. (I roll back over to my side of the bed)
* Her: Fine, get it over with.

Nothing. Zero. Zilch. Nada is worse than obligation sex. Nothing. It's terrible, pathetic, pointless, stupid, and it's not even that easy to have the attitude, ""Doesn't matter, had sex"" excuse. So, not sure if it was spite, frustration, hate, or what, but I was like, ""Ya know what? Fuck it."" And I did. Worse. Sex. Ever. 

Life is too short. We are divorced now and I'm out of that religion.

TRUE,vogueadishu,,,"Several years ago, I was at a bar with a couple of new female coworkers (strippers, all three of us). A couple of their guy friends showed up, we were all having fun, decided to go drink some more after the bar closed. Went to a hotel room but I was so drunk that no alarm bells were going off. Anyway, I went into the bathroom and when I came out the girls were gone. The two guys said they ran to buy cigarettes, then offered me a drink. I took it, not thinking anything of it. I was drunk but not at my limit (I get drunk quick but can actually tolerate a lot before getting sick) so I thought it odd when I had to throw up. I blacked out while puking... I came to a few times, and while I will spare the details I can say that I was violated in all 3 holes and I do know that I said no several times. I remember hearing one say ""she's moving too much. Hold her still, I'm about to fuck this ***** in the ass."" I came to around 9am with no clothes on, the door propped wide open, and my money, my cigarettes and my phone were gone, as were the guys (the girls had never come back). I called down to the front desk and asked them to call the police. Filed my report, went and got a rape kit done (if I didn't watch so much SVU I probably would have taken a long hot shower). They blood testef me but it had been long enough that there wasn't enough in my system to prove anything (supposedly). Got a horrible detective who hates strippers... I positively id'd them out of a photo lineup and the girls who set me up. There was plenty of dna evidence. The detective in the end said she wasn't going to pursue the case because they told her that I was a hooker and she accused me of being upset that I didn't get paid. I didn't leave my house for almost a year except to go to work. Those guys and the girls had been in the club we worked at so the doormen had their images printed out. Once the detective decided to accuse me of being a whore, the manager of the club have all doormen permission to beat them senseless should they ever show back up (which is the main reason I kept working. I felt safe there)... Sadly they never did, lol. 

I spent a year leaving my house only to work and go to therapy. I then spent another year sleeping around trying to get back the control and power that they had taken from me. It took a while but I finally grew from it. I'm still devastated that those two got away with rape and I really think those women should have been charged as well, but nothing I can do about it now. It's been about 8 years. 

TL;DR: two guys drugged and raped me with the help of two females who set it up. They all four got away with it because the detective was a jerk.

TRUE,theglasspainting,,,"It happened on July 28th, 2001 sometime in the late afternoon. I was eight. My mother and I were on a walk with our dog in a very quiet neighborhood. I was eating an orange popsicle and was wearing a brand new outfit my parents had bought for me. 

Suddenly, there was a loud squealing noise- the sound of tires grinding against pavement. My mom and I looked around for the source of the ghastly screech; across the street was a faded blue Cadillac. The driver (an 80 year old man with a revoked license) kept hitting the gas and the brake, the gas and the brake, the gas and the brake over and over again. The Cadillac almost looked like it was jumping. And then, suddenly, the car was speeding in reverse...right toward us. We tried to run into a yard to escape, but we were like magnets. My mom pushed me out of the path of the blue beast just before she was struck. 

The car literally ran her over. She was like a rag doll beneath the wheels. 

The driver hit a tree in the yard we had sought refuge in. I thought it was over. It wasn't. 

The man then put the car in drive and ran her over AGAIN. This time, he the struck the fence in his yard across the street and came to a halt- there was smoke coming from the hood of his Cadillac. I was throwing blood curdling screams at him. YOU IDIOT! YOU IDIOT!

I ran to my mother the check and see if she was okay. She wasn't. She didn't look like the mommy I knew. Her lip was split wide open, the rip spreading down to her chin. Her nose was broken and bleeding, the skin beneath her eyes already blackening. She was struggling for air. I could tell that she was slipping. She looked up at me and asked me to hold her hand because she thought she was dying. Her eyes were far away. I touched her hand and told her I loved her. 

But I didn't linger. I ran for help. I knocked on doors, I stopped cars, I screamed for people to call an ambulance. 

Finally, after what seemed like hours later, the ambulance came. The paramedics and EMT's did their work and took her away.

I cried in the arms of a stranger for a while. She rocked me back and fourth. Calming me. I wish I could thank her for that. I still think about her every now and then. After that, they took me to the hospital in a police car.

My dad was a fire fighter (he is now retired) at the time and was on shift. The department put his truck out of service and he and his crew were at the hospital a few minutes after I arrived. My dad scooped me into his arms and we said a prayer. 

The doctors told my dad that with the injuries my mom had sustained, she had a 5% chance of survival. They said if she did survive she would likely suffer from brain damage and would be paralyzed. 

But she didn't die. And she doesn't have brain damage. And she can walk. After three months in the hospital she was released. She has tons of metal inside of her body, has quite a bit of nerve damage, and still struggles with pain daily. She never complains. If you saw her today, you would never know that she had been in such a terrible accident. 

I lost my childhood on that day. I was too afraid to play outside for a long time because I was in fear of vehicles. I couldn't cross the street without breaking into hysterics. The sound of cars driving by our house at night terrified me. While my mom was still recovering, 9-11 occurred and then I was afraid of planes, too. I was in therapy for a long time. 

I was far too young when I learned the realities of life and how easily it is taken from us. But, really, I'm not bitter about that at all. I had the privilege of witnessing a miracle in her recovery. I learned the true value of life and that I need to LIVE every second of it. I learned to love my family deeper. My relationship with God is stronger. I never leave the house angry with my loved ones and I always make sure and let the people I love know just how much I adore them. I learned these things long before most of my peers. And really, I am thankful for that.

One thing I want to warn you about is that you seem, from the picture, rather young to have already lost a parent. From my experiences, people don't think about this, so when I'll switch between saying parents in the past tense, but dad in current situations, people question me on where my mom is. Not maliciously (although sometimes nosily),  but in the process of conversation. Be prepared to factually mention that she has passed away and be ready to bulldoze through to continue the conversation. If I linger on my mom, I'll either get upset or the person will say something hurtful while trying to be nice. Being able to function in society without having to constantly censor any mention of my mom has saved my sanity.

Less than two years ago I had an old friend show up at my work and tell me how she had just been raped the day before and really needed someone to talk to. Being the nice guy I am go out and get a soda with her at a bar. 

Night goes as one expects except for the last thing I remember is the girl running her hand over my glass and saying we have such a good chemistry in the way out bodies mirror each other, taking drinks at the same time and such. Wound up having sex with this girl and having no idea why. Immediately flash to the next day, nothing comes back to me, but I wake up naked with a girl on my bed. I kick the girl out and call my girlfriend and tell her what happened. Told her I had no idea why I did it, or even remembered doing it, but there was evidence. She breaks up with me. 

Six months pass of me doing absolutely terribly. I had a really bad experience with cheaters which put them really low on my list. I = cheater, which meant absolutely no self worth. Barely skimming by on the skin of my teeth. 

My ex shows up at my doorstep and says she needs to talk. She sets me down and tells me that I was drugged and raped. The girl's sister found her diary and found that she was wanting a kid and had parts mentioning wanting to drug someone. She did get knocked up, but luckily it wasn't my child.

can you use focus recovery as a response to sacrifice recall, if you are putting more than 4 cost worth of thoughts into play? The sac ability seems to state that the focus is lost at the same time the thoughts are brought into play, but it isn't clear to me if the thoughts are actually in play, and thus contributing to your cost limit, when the focus is lost.

With thought aggro and any similar cards. If you play this in response to an engagement being declared, does it redirect that engagement, or would you have to have played it before then for it to have effect?

TRUE,o0DrWurm0o,,,"NIF's lasers are primarily neodymium amplified. They actually start out with a tiny (you could hold it in your hand) fiber laser that emits a precisely shaped pulse into the rest of the system. That shaped pulse is then amplified by bouncing between a bunch of [neodymium glass slabs.](http://www.wired.com/images/slideshow/2009/05/gallery_nif/nif_4b.jpg) Then the light is cavity-dumped (they take the reflector off the front), split up, and shot at the fusion fuel. 

Actually, right before it hits the fuel, the IR light is doubled twice in frequency, bringing it from IR to UV. If you've ever picked up a green laser pointer, they use Nd:YAG crystals which emit at 1024nm and then halve the wavelength to 532nm with a frequency doubling crystal, which yields a nice, bright green. So, if you stuck another frequency doubler on a green laser pointer, you'd be making the wavelength NIF makes. 

The funny thing about NIF is, really, the technology is quite dated. Flash-lamp pumping? That's like how they did the very first laser. NIF is just a giant version of very well understood laser concepts; in many ways, the optics aren't all that interesting aside from scale. When I toured NIF, they told me they were going to replace their giant, building-sized solid state lasers with couch-sized fiber lasers (which are much more technologically up-to-date), but I'm not sure if that went anywhere.

TRUE,BLSmith2112,,,"Alright I need to get this off my chest. The ignorance here is over the brim. The reason for the lack of zombies is because of how the game controls item/loot spawning as well as zombie spawning. The reason for this alpha test was to exactly test server stability. This is how development works. Start small, make core product work, then go bigger. You are getting a large chunk of the DayZ experience even with these bugs.

So the very fact that people are complaining about lack of zombies needs to be complaining about their own lack of knowledge on this subject. Dean Hall said eventually you'll see over [2000 spawned zombies](http://www.pcgamer.com/2013/11/12/dayz-standalone-needs-more-optimization-before-release-says-dean-hall/), 25,000 loot items, roaming hoards between towns, and so much more. You can't complain about zombies clipping through buildings on one hand, and then on the other say that you want more zombies. They have to fix whats broken first, optimize where they can, then you can have your zombies. 

The fact that zombies walk though buildings is obviously something they are working on. The mod did not suffer from this nearly as badly, and the fact that DH's development team now has full access to the engine files instead of a limited API means that they have much more at their disposal to address these types of issues.

You have over a year until beta people. Sure, duct tape has no use in the game, but I think the community might want to use some on themselves for the time being and read some damn development blogs, AMAs, [patchnotes](http://forums.dayzgame.com/index.php?/forum/76-announcements-information/), etc. This is what you signed up for when buying the game.

When they raided the Tantive IV above Tatooine they suffered fairly minimal losses considering they were being funneled through a single, heavily guarded, choke point. The local constabulary on the surface was admittedly fairly useless, but their primary purpose was patrolling the spaceport and collecting taxes in the arse end of the galaxy. That's the kind of boring dead end assignment they give to soldiers who made an enemy somewhere up the chain of command. It's understandable they'd be slow to react to Han blasting his way out. 

The troopers on the Death Star had nothing but emergency drills for weeks to the point where they doubted the intruder alerts right up until they were under fire. Before they could even get fully organized they were ordered to allow the intruders to escape so that the ship could be tracked. They showed remarkable self control allowing themselves to be shot at while purposefully missing to put on a good show. 

Nothing to see on Hoth. They overran the Rebel defenses and captured Echo Base in what looked like less than an hour. Two hours tops. 

On Cloud City the troopers arrive mere minutes before the Falcon touched down. In that time they managed to take control of the entire facility without disrupting operations and without alerting the majority of the civilians. That is more impressive than mere marksmanship if you really think about it. Later when Luke arrived the troopers were told to herd him to Vader; again showing an iron will as they purposefully fail to shoot someone who holds no qualms about killing them. 

On Endor the troopers didn't use camouflage or take proper precautions to secure their perimeter. Both Vader and the Emperor were interested in capturing Luke alive so they very likely ordered the ground forces to remain conspicuous for fear they might lose their prize down the sights of a sniper's scope. In the subsequent battle the Imperial reinforcements to the garrison were overkill for a single squad of Rebels, but not the Ewoks as well. Sure they don't seem that threatening, but the fact they effortlessly heave boulders the size of their torsos onto the unsuspecting troopers below shows they're a lot stronger than they look. They're clearly adept at hunting prey much larger than themselves and when the kinetic force of a blow leaves a man on his back surrounded by dozens of little ravenous teddy bears, well... there's no training in the world that will prepare you for that one.

Also, I'm known for telling people not to can things without a recipe and not to follow advice without knowing the authority of the source, especially things on the Internet. So, there's that. My opinions. Large grains of salt.

You're correct in that oil is not safe for canning, but the bigger danger in pressure canning is that it will prevent jars from sealing properly. Jars have to exhaust when they're processed - the air has to purge out, which is why we're instructed not to tighten lids completely before processing. Sometimes a bit of liquid or vapor from the boiling contents of the jar burps out as well. Even a tiny little droplet of oil can prevent the lid from sticking down properly resulting in a bad seal and dangerous, spoiled food.

As for making new recipes safe for canning, the only way to be absolutely certain is to have it lab tested and certified as safe. The reason is that it has to be guaranteed that every bit of contents all the way to the center of the jar reach a temperature of at least 240 and hold there for more than 3 minutes. At home, you have no way to know for sure that this has happened. Too, the reason recipes have to be followed to a T is that any changes in the density of the contents of the jar changes how the heat penetrates.

It's good that you have a pH meter. It will help you with a lot of things, just not this. Right off the bat, this recipe has chicken broth in,  so it's going to be pressure canned no matter what and how long it's processed isn't going to be determined by the pH.  

And now, the moment you've been waiting for..... [The NCHFP suggests that soups are a special category and can be canned without following an exact recipe](http://nchfp.uga.edu/how/can_04/soups.html) as long as you follow the basic rules of:

No milk, cream or dairy products.
No rice, noodles or pasta of any kind.
No flour or thickeners.
Process pints for 60 minutes, quarts for 75 at the pressure advised for your altitude.

The instructions also mention using a 50/50 mix of solids and liquids. There is no instruction on canning a pureed soup. However, the Ball Blue Book does offer instructions for canning a pureed split pea soup which is processed 75 minutes for pints and 90 minutes for quarts, so obviously it can be done, though the recipe also states that it shouldn't be ""too thick.""

Basically the American producers of Power Rangers look through the current Japanese sentai shows to figure out what they can make fit with their own stories. Since all the action scene have dudes in masks and cheesy giant robots, it's easy enough to replace the live action scenes and dub over the action scenes (and crazy cheap to do).

It's actually an ongoing series of loosely connected shows, but there's so many damn shows that Super Sentai could almost be thought of as a genre.

A fun fact, there was a Spider-man Super Sentai show: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPX-FX0KStE

TRUE,revoltbydesign86,,,"the fact is after a few years of service in the military, most become unfit to serve. In the Army or marines anyway. source: I'm active duty military and will assuredly be label 60-75% disabled upon leaving.A lot of people do not understand the cost of service or war. If you think the war was expensive, the care for soldiers who fought them is outrageous. Why do you think that the federal government has relied so heavily on contractors for both wars? many people believe that those guys are more expensive at 250,000 a year paychecks, but they aren't. They're cheaper! mind = blown. The legacy costs of war are astronomical. I would vote for this 100% if it were tried today.  Right now the system as it stands has the government preying on certain ""at risk"" sectors of the population. males between the ages of 17-25 who dropped out of high school or didn't, but didn't go to college that cannot find work = enlisted, 19/20ish- 27 who went college got most of a degree or graduated with a degree in something hard to find a job in (history majors, lit, political SIC,etc) = officers. The volunteerism doesn't stop people from starting wars, what it does is allow the military to become polarized to one side of the political debate 95% republican with a very small disenfranchised liberal group e.g. (bradley manning). This allows the military industrial complex to have huge sway over when wars are started. all they do is buy out the politicians on the right to pander to the military on issues important to them and most of those military personnel will never believe that they could become brainwashed or ""used"" in a system were not supporting your troops is akin to ""pedophila"". This amendment would be a far better solution, but as it stands now we will continue to have more illegal wars of aggression until the system is  changed, until the incentives are changed. Simple fix to your question is that if they're unfit to serve then a ""war tax"" for anyone who wanted the war but couldn't fight would do. Like 50% of your income or something, something large so people wouldn't be stupid about war. In a sense that is probably the amount we will all pay towards these wars in future taxes anyway. 

EDIT: Thank you for Reddit gold, I was just speaking from the heart about my experience in the military I guess it resonants. First timer thank you for validating my thoughts.

EDIT: On careful consideration I retract the statement about the draft. I may have been over zealous, people not wanting to be there was my concern, not because the military would lose effectiveness, but because I would not want that to happen to me. I think this amendment would still serve the nation much better than constantly being at war with everyone. The ""poor tax"" comment I do not retract, because searching through several academic sources I found numerous complaints that information on the amount and severity of ""waivers"" was not represented in their studies. I also found that the military admitted to loosening the standards drastically to meet demand. They did this because they failed to meet recruiting standards as early as late 2003. which would make since considering the US started another war in Iraq at that time. My opinion is my own and while it resonants with some who most likely served around the same time others who didn't find it offensive. I don't care if I hurt your feelings. The truth hurts.

TRUE,maktouch,,,"By doing ""WHERE tag_id = 5"", it will only return those where the tag_id = 5. If there's no keywords attached, it will be NULL, so it will not return, same as if the tag_id is 4. 

If you want to return only the images with keywords, without querying an exact tag_id, you could do ""WHERE tag_id IS NOT null"", or use a normal join. 

If you want to query by tag name, just add a join and query the tag. For long query, I like to split my lines btw. It's clearer this way. 

    SELECT * FROM image 
    LEFT JOIN image_tags ON image.id = image_tags.image_id 
    LEFT JOIN tags ON tags.id = image_tags.tag_id
    WHERE tags.tag = 'cats'

Joins are pretty useful ;) There's some more stuff that might be useful, like GROUP BY. 

For example, you want to know how many keywords is attached to each image

    SELECT image.*, count(image_tags.image_id) as keyword_count     
    FROM image 
    LEFT JOIN image_tags ON image.id = image_tags.image_id 
    GROUP BY image.id

Another example, you want all images with a comma separated list of the keywords. 

    SELECT image.*, GROUP_CONCAT(tags.tag SEPARATOR ', ') as tags, count(tags.tag) as tags_count FROM image 
    LEFT JOIN image_tags ON image.id = image_tags.image_id 
    LEFT JOIN tags ON tags.id = image_tags.tag_id
    GROUP BY image.id

*I'm writing this without testing, might be typos or something. Always test your queries first!*


-- edit

Also, just a few corrections in the first post. You should model your database and think about the col names. In the first post, I said ""table: tags, col: tag"". It should be ""table: tags, col: name (or title)"". That way, you prevent queries like ""WHERE tags.tag"" and instead you have clearer queries, like ""WHERE tags.name"" 


It will also translate well if you're using an ORM or if you're modeling your data in code.

 ~~$tags-&gt;tag~~ = $tags-&gt;name

Regarding your questions of small queries vs big joined queries, it really depends on your dataset. Joining 4 tables of 10m rows will take time. Sometimes multiple small queries are better than 1 big one, but this is more of a scaling problem and you shouldn't premature optimize. Also, if your code is made to do multiple small query, it would easier to use caching methods and stuff. For example, if tags are commonly queried, I'll prefer to have them in memcached so that I don't bother MySQL that much. 

But since we're talking about it.. I prefer to do small queries. I've worked with big data and sometimes, joins are just not manageable (I hate queries that goes over 3 secs). 

Let's add a new dimensions to the queries called ""users_likes"". 

Table: users

id|name|
--|--|
10|Mike|

Table: users_images

users_id|image_id|
--|--|
10|1

You then have to find all cats images that Mike liked.. Let's do it the big query way 

     SELECT * FROM image 
    -- Tags (btw, when a line starts with --, it means comments. Comment your big queries so you dont get lost)
    LEFT JOIN image_tags ON image.id = image_tags.image_id 
    LEFT JOIN tags ON tags.id = image_tags.tag_id
    -- Users
    LEFT JOIN users_images ON image.id = users_image.image_id
    LEFT JOIN users ON users.id = users_image.user_id
    WHERE tags.tag = 'cats' AND users.name = 'Mike'


Or separate small and quick queries with a max of 2 join each. I'm getting lazy so ill let you figure that one out. 

-- edit 3

Also... by default, the id column is an index. The key to fast querying is the index. For example, the indexes for image_tags should be image_id and tag_id. 

Another note, ""WHERE name LIKE '%LOL%'"" seems like a good idea at first but it is very slow, since it's not using indexes. If possible, use ""WHERE name LIKE 'LOL%'"". It will search for everything starting with LOL like LOLA or LOLOL but it will now uses indexes, so it'll be faster. 

But I suggest you look into ElasticSearch for searching. MySQL is not really good for fulltext searching :).

TRUE,splattypus,,,"Yep, that's the problems with reddit.  

There's no easy solution, because part of the problems are also part of reddit's very identity.  And the more people who come to the site every day, who heard about it by half-assed explanation via who-the-fuck-knows-where aren't interested in assimilating into the *actual* communities that exist within the subs, they want to participate and promote the community they *thought* they were coming too.  

And reddit does a poor job of explaining the differences in communities, and helping users *find* those communities that appeal most to them.

Moderators lack the tools to make any sort of cooperative effort between subs, they lack the tools to thoroughly oversee their own subs. /u/deimorz's AutoModerator is a godsend, and hopefully only the beginning of vastly-overhauled mod tools.  As good as it is now, it's still very complex and takes someone witch pretty significant knowledge to operate, and it's still pretty limited. 

The admins promote the site like crazy, saying 'we are a great community where voting is all that matters, change the world, etc etc' (you all know the ridiculous stuff on the sign-in page if you aren't running add block).  But when it comes to helping the mods, even (especially) the defaults, we all basically on our own.  It's reached that point where they want to run a *profitable* site, not a *good* site.  Time and time again the message is 'Good luck, you handle it' until they find something they want to step in and override or change. There's no communication or consultation.  'You're on your own until we wanna do something different.'

I can't say I blame them for that, but as a mod who's had to put up with stupid shit time and time again because they don't want to get involved, or do the bare minimum to handle a situation, it's hard not to be a little insulted by it.  So then where is *our* motivation? We get minimal appreciation or support from the admins, and get abuse from the users who we somehow insulted by trying to operate an appealing and effective subreddit. But let me say this, if you enjoy a sub, and enjoy the moderators, let them know. Because that's something you can't hear enough. Especially since most hear it so little as it is.

You can't please everybody.  No matter how good of a sub you have, there's always someone with a different impression, or bad intentions who just want to fuck stuff up, abuse users a mods alike, and burn the fucking place down just because they can. Nobody should still mod if they don't care about the sub, about making it good, about always trying to make it better.  But eventually it becomes less of a personal project. It starts to feel like a job. Clock in, do your work, go home and forget about it.  Mod burnout is very high in a lot of subs. It's not about the workload, clearing the mod queue is an easy job if that's *all* you do.  But its every other aspect that wears on you.  Not to mention that reddit becomes repetitive as hell everyone.  

And it does, it gets very stale.  It's to the point that you see reposts of reposts every other day. Sometimes in the same day.  The veteran users drastically change habits, visit less, whatever.  So you have the new users, the trolls, and the just-don't-give-a-damns dictating the content of the communities.  Eternal September.  

But there's no one solution to it. The subreddit system creates hiveminds, and the karma system creates circlejerks.  Karmawhores game the system, and casual users are more than happy to feed them for a cheep laugh. Overwhelmed or under-enthusiastic moderators can or will only do so much. It seems like there's more marketing admins than there are anything else, so the system is lacking and there's no collaboration between upper management and middle management. There's no saving reddit.  Every social site does the same. Eventually it collapses under its own load, and the users flock to the next new site that overs some novel feature that the last.  It won't disappear, and maybe the even the dedicated will be able to revive it under its original purpose as a web-content aggregate when its all said and done, but it's become a social site now. And not the mods, nor the admins, nor the users, nor the very website itself, is capable of handling that.

TRUE,Bardlar,,transliquid transsolid gas identifying aquakin,"This whole tumblr fat acceptance movement is ruining the idea of fat acceptance and body acceptance. Although, I don't believe being fat is acceptable, I do believe dumping on people for being fat is immature and unproductive; that's not what overweight people need to get better. 

That all said, at this point, based on Tumblrs ideas, whether we accept them or not is completely irrelevant, because how accepted or unaccepted they are is based on a lack of self-respect, so that no matter what people say to them, they'll find a way to make it a bad thing. Obviously these people either don't want to take responsibility, or just want attention.

The term ""shaming"" has lost all meaning. Acknowledging that you are outside what is considered good health is not putting your down in any way. Calling you a horrid sack of feces because you're obese; *that* is fat shaming.

The problem with this sort of behaviour is that it makes arguments impossible to resolve because it is more about you just being hurt and wanting attention than anything else.

Total shot in the dark here but your girlfriend is sick of it. She recorded you because she is out of options. Maybe she truly thinks that you dont know the extent of your poisonous behaviour.

This breach of privacy thing is hogwash. How is it a breach of your privacy? It was a conversation between the two of you, she didnt record you masturbating in private. I think you are just so ashamed of how you behaved and that you will be grinding your teeth in embarrassment listening to the ridiculousness.

TRUE,ihatewil,,,"&gt; did he really think that people forgot about him when he was making that song?

Yes. Dr Dres reputation took a nose dive shortly before leaving Death Row records in the mid 90s. He became a highly dissed and ""uncool"" in the world of hip hop, and then people even started to question his skill as a producer (to be fair, people still do). For years people talked about how he's passed it, irrelevant, etc. Hasn't worked in years, takes credit for other peoples productions, slaps his name on it, and then it sells. Remember, before 2001 was released in 1999, Dr Dre had not had an album in nearly 8 years.

In between the Chronic and 2001, he had two major hits. California Love with 2pac, and No Diggity with the Blackstreet, but even by the time No Diggity came out,he was being openly mocked. In 1995 Tupac joined Dr Dres record label after having some legal troubles and interscope no longer wanted anything to do with him, coming under pressure from Time Warner to get rid of Tupac. Dr Dre was one of Tupacs heroes, but as they saying goes, never meet your heroes. Dr Dre produced three records for Tupacs album All Eyez on Me, a song called Can't C Me, and California love and the remix. Deathrow Records wanted Dr Dres name to be on the album as head producer, but Tupac kicked up a fuss stating the obvious, Dre only produced three tracks out of 27, why should he get the credit for 27 tracks and the other producers such as [Johnny J](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_%22J%22) and [Daz Dillinger](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daz_Dillinger) do not. That's just business, Dr Dre as a producer was more marketable, but Tupac was having none of it. Before the album even came out he started airing his grievences in interviews making it publicly known Dre only worked on three tracks, and in the end Deathrow changed the head producer credit to Daz Dillinger, who actually was the head producer of the album. 

People close to Dr Dre state that he never wanted the credit in the first place, other people at deathrow (suge knight) actually tried to put his name down as the producer as a business decision, but then blamed Dre when it didn't sit well with Pac. Tupac was very charismatic so people started to treat Dre differently at work, and in the end he decided to leave the company he founded because he found the work environment unbearable. He felt like he lost complete creative control of his own company because people (not everyone) did not respect him. Deathrow started signing artists without his permission as if his opinion didn't matter etc, he was getting cut out of the businesses side and the creative side too - which was supposed to be his end of the business.  


Then he made no diggity with blackstreet and although it did well in terms of charts, he got a lot of heat for it. Tupac recorded a song with a very similar beat and dedicated an entire verse to [openly mocking Dre](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=Owdl9BnxHV4#t=201). After that, he became a bit of a recluse. He stayed away from hiphop and started working on various different projects, even doing mixing work for [Nine Inch Nails](http://ilarge.listal.com/image/1165478/968full-nine-inch-nails.jpg) etc. People really did forget about Dre.

Meanwhile he was trying to start his own label, and signed a rapper called Eminem. That seems like a no brainer now, but you have to remember at the time a lot of people didn't take eminem seriously, even when his first album was out. It wasn't until his second album, the marshel mathers LP did critics really start to think ""This guy is the shit"". So Dre releases the slim shady LP, and if you didn't actually buy the album at the time, you'd just know him as the comedy rapper that made ""My Name is"". So people looked at Dr Dre doing a cameo in that video and thinking ""How far has this guy fallen? Doing video appearances with some white jokey rapper"". Around that time Dr Dre himself was working on his comeback album to shut up the critics, ""The Chronic 2"", but even people from within the industry had been trying to cock block that also. His old label bought the rights to the trademark ""The Chronic"" so he couldn't use that, so he stated he was calling it ""The Chronic 2000"" and getting around the trademark issue by making the album cover a weed leaf with just the words ""2000"" on it, so the album would actually be ""2000"" but it would look like it was called ""The Chronic 2000"". Deathrow records then created an album called ""The Chronic 2000"" which was basically 12 tracks dissing Dre, their plan was to release it around the same time as his album ""2000"", and confuse consumers into buying an anti-dre album. After that, he just ditched ""The Chronic 2000"" idea and just called the album ""2001"" to give them all the middle finger.

It was a massive success and at the time a production masterpiece. He proved everyone wrong and became one of the most powerful people in music in the last 15 years because of it.

Now its been even longer, 15 years since 2001 dropped. People are starting to say the same thing, Dr Dre takes too long to make songs, he's fallen off, he's irrelevant, doesn't have it anymore. I hope he drops one more album and punishes everyone one last more time. The dude deserves it.

TRUE,LordSpasms,,,"There's definitely something about surviving in the post apocalypse that is different than surviving in a fantasy setting.

The post apocalypse survival setting plays on a lot of human fears. The first and most obvious is the loss of humanity, both literally and psychologically. Shooting people in the face in a post-apocalyptic setting has an immediate thematic connection to the setting because it is the most obvious result of losing humanity.

Another big fear that post-apocalyptic settings instill is the fear of scarcity. Post apocalyptic worlds thrive on the feeling of dread that there are not enough resources to go around. This dread fuels the loss of humanity.

These two fears combined paint the perfect picture for a survival game. The feeling of animalistic hunting and gathering works well in a system of scarcity filled with desperate people losing their humanity.

If a fantasy survival game were to work (for me at least), there would have to be a prevailing sense of dread associated with it. I think a good example would be the Game of Thrones universe from the point of view of a lesser house or peasant. You are in a world of powerful, bickering lords who care more about their own apotheosis than the affairs of the common people. A lot of power is being thrown around, and all you can do is cling to life through the chaos.

In cold weather you don't want to let your gas tank get too low.  Over time, water from condensation forms a layer on top of the gas in the tank and if that gets into your fuel lines, pump, filter, or injectors and freezes, you're going to have a bad time as your car won't run.  A bottle of Iso-Heet helps clear out that water safely.

Depending on your level of comfort driving In snow and slippery conditions, it may be a good idea to go to an empty parking lot at night and practice drifting your vehicle around.  Being comfortable and aware of how it feels and got your vehicle handles while sliding can save you if it begins to happen outside of a controlled environment, e.g. While driving and hitting a slick spot.  If driving a rear wheel drive vehicle, be careful of icy spots.  If you accelerate while your rear wheels are on ice or snow, it could cause your rear end to swing out and throw you into a ditch or other lanes.  Front wheel drive cars will pull you the direction the wheels are facing while accelerating, regardless of sliding.  If you do begin to slide sideways, remain calm.  Panicking is what will cause damage.  If sliding into a ditch and you can't stop it, point your wheels into the ditch.  If they hit sideways, there is a high chance of damage to your steering parts (idler arms, pinion arms, control arms).  

Check fluid levels before you leave, it's never fun to see your vehicle overheat on the highway because you are low on anti-freeze (coolant).  Pay attention to cold/hot levels when checking fluids, as the cold will cause levels to appear lower than they will when the engine is at running temp.  When checking oil, the engine needs to be off to get an accurate reading.  The opposite is true for transmission fluid, which needs to be checked while the vehicle is running.

Maybe for the team spirit, [but his estimated value is €40m](http://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/en/robert-lewandowski/mwverlaufgraph/spieler_38253.html) and Dortmund aren't getting a cent of that. He could have done what Eriksen did, which was basically say ""if I'm not *bought* this season, I'll renew a contract so that Ajax can make money off of me. They saw my talent, developed me into the player I am, and I at least owe them that."" Lewandowski did not do this. He almost certainly would not be the player he is were it not for Klopp, and it disgusts me the act that BVB get sweet fuck-all but a middle finger for helping him become a powerhouse of football, and to make it worse he is moving to a rival fucking club. I'd rather Kloppo spent the last 4 years playing a meth-addicted hooker upfront, at least she'd know her place.

TRUE,a1will,,,"                                                     ***WARNING***   

***Do not proceed unless you are unable to accept that you have been lied to your entire life.  In actuality most people have never eaten real bacon.  The insipid product sold in most stores is injected with smoke flavoring.  Besides high end butchers or artisan food producers (read as $$$$$), you will not be able to find bacon that is actually slow cured and smoked.***
 
  
 Now that I've made myself sound like a food snob (I'm really not) lets proceed.  Here's the process I've pieced together from sources on the internet.  I'm no expert, I'm merely following the advice of others, and have a pretty good hang of it.
  
  




-Start with ***fresh*** pork belly, not frozen.  This will come with the skin(rind) on.  

-Most countries outside of America eat bacon with the rind on, it will result in a crispy sort of pork rind/cracklins type of strip on each slice.  

-A lot of people remove it, I haven't found a good way to remove it (I have dull knives), so I've been removing it after smoking (it just pulls off by hand, and makes good cracklins) or leaving it on. 

-Next I cut into manageable sizes so it will fit on my smoker.  I use a Weber 18.5'' and [Smokenator](http://www.smokenator.com/) insert (very basic setup, most over in /r/smoking put it to shame.  But it works and was cheap, Weber was free, so I can't complain), so I need them in 3-5 lb chunks (I can fit 3 per batch).

-As for rubs/cures we've been experimenting, and on this part of the process I defer to my much more talented gf.  Having said that, there are a few rules to follow.  

-For proper curing use ~1 1/2 teaspoons Morton's kosher salt
and 1/2 teaspoon pink curing salt ***per lb of meat***

-I use that like a base coast and rub it in really good.  Once I have that on them I put whatever other rub/brine on I want.  I've done dry and wet and both work (wet seems to impart more flavor).

-This batch we did a few different batches

[Photo](http://imgur.com/l3cacFr)
[Photo](http://imgur.com/479SQ6I)

Traditional (salt/sugar/herbs)

Bourbon Maple Syrup

Peppered Brown Sugar (I still haven't figured out how to get the pepper to stick to the top like the commercial kinds do)

Asian ( We are on Version 2 of this.  Basically soy, garlic,ginger,5 spice and other ancient chinese secrets)

Asian Fermenter's Delight -various Asian fermented pastes in addition to the ""normal"" Asian we make.

So far the two Asian varieties are hands down the more complex and delicious with the Fermented one being insane.

-Next batch I will attempt to take the skin off before I cure, to allow for the cure to penetrate on both sides, for better flavor.

-As for curing there are days/lb sort of metrics out there. In the past I've used 7-10 days, but this time with the holidays and inclement weather it took me 14 days before I could smoke batch 2 (Asian varieties) and the flavor was so intense I think I will do this from now on.  Make sure to flip ever 1-3 days. 

-After curing I wash off very good (if not it will be very salty), towel dry and throw on the smoker.  Many will talk about drying overnight to form a ""pellicle"", but I don't really put to much weight behind there, after reading Amazing Rib's [debunking](http://www.amazingribs.com/tips_and_technique/zen_of_wood.html).  Speaking of Amazing Ribs, [here](http://www.amazingribs.com/recipes/porknography/making_bacon_from_scratch.html) is a good walk through of their's.

-Now for the smoking.

-I use a remote thermometer to keep on eye on temp.  Not [this](http://www.amazon.com/Maverick-Remote-Smoker-Thermometer-ET-73/dp/B00EQFFOLA/ref=sr_1_2?s=home-garden&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1388958902&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=remote+wireless+thermometer) exact model but something similar.  This really helps on long smokes.

-I put my meat on, get temp dialed in, and relax.  For smoking on cold midwest days, a welders blanket really helps to shield from wind/insulate.

-Smoke over hardwood of choice at ~220F for around 2-3 hours until an internal temp of ~150F.

-Take of grill, cut a couple slices and bask in your awesomeness.

-I throw in the fridge overnight and slice into manageable portions and put in freezer.  Since this is cured and smoked, it will last in the fridge for weeks.  We normally just always have a chunk in the fridge, when it is gone, grab one out of the freezer.

-One last thing. I've noticed that since the bacon is cured and smoked (basically fully cooked already, you can eat safely right off the grill) that it is firmer than store bought.  I used to be picky about having my bacon crisp because I hated the consistency of the fat.  With the stuff I make the fat is firmer and I cook it a lot less than storebought.  I basically cook it enough so that all sides get nice and browned (yummy Maillard reactions) and then pull.  This allows for the flavor to really shine and not be overpowered by that carboney flavor you get when trying to get it crisp. It's hard to explain, because I lack the food vocabulary to describe it.

TRUE,apathy2007,,,"I think explaining how Austin is/was could be compared to how SXSW has changed.

Back in the day, you paid $25-$50 for a wristband, and you had the privilege of going around to all the venues in town and hearing new, up-and-coming, unsigned bands while those same bands had the chance to be heard by record labels and embark on a career. Hanson and Beck both got discovered as a result of SXSW back in the day.

Now SXSW is, essentially, a watered-down, marketing shit hole. Every band is already signed and well-known, and they pack and cram every band in town into every place that has a door and windows and can host a band. Hell, they have stages set up in the streets now. Everything, every wall, window, tree, and door has someone's brand on it. Every stage, venue, and show is sponsored by some corporation - our town is shit all over no matter which direction you look. You cannot park anywhere within reason, nor rent a hotel anywhere within reason. Every restaurant, bar, and business within a 3-mile radius is filled to the brim with tourists. NO ONE in the world likes tourists, no one - it's like having an unsavory guest in your home who doesn't respect any of your sensibilities. Your life has to revolve around that tourist, you can't just relax around them because they change the atmosphere you live in.

Businesses, though, businesses love tourists. Businesses love that they can jack up the prices of their services and see their doors packed to the brim. Businesses love to line the pockets of politicians so the business keeps flowing. And the city is constantly coming up with new ways to bring more and more tourists to our city, and hopefully keep them here so we can continue to take their money. Businesses like Parkside can come in and tell well-established street vendors to take a hike because they're ""dirtying up the sidewalk and weirding out our customers."" Keep Austin weird? The city sided with Parkside on that one, folks. Additionally, they kind of forgot that, in the 80s, they decided to *suppress* our growth by not building the infrastructure and roads to support growth. OOPS. Where do we put the million new neighbours?? TEAR EVERYTHING DOWN AND BUILD A HIGH RISE. Do you know how many art studios, long-time bars, coffee shops, restaurants, and local business have been shut down and bulldozed to build condos? Do you know how many neighbourhoods have been converted into shitty douchebag frat bar strips (here's looking at you, Rainey Bro Street)? East 6th had a few bars dropped in, and now they are building more high-income condos, kicking out laidback local businesses (Cheer Up Charlie's) and seeking not just to gentrify, but corporatize yet another area of town.

Anyway, here is the rub: people LOVE SXSW as it currently stands. They love seeing Macklemore play in the bathroom at a Buddhist elderly woman's retirement home playing only a kazoo. They love sitting around a packed bar with dark wood tones while sipping a *cocktail* they paid $15 for because some bearded dude in suspenders wiped lemon around the rim and called it something like ""Dylan McDermott Cow Rustler Old Timey Vintage"" while, between incessant texting, telling their friend about the Macklemore show so they can make them say ""oh my GAWD are you SERIOUS - hold on I have to check Facebook while you sit there right in front of me, awkwardly.""

People eat it up, and they pay out the ass for these experiences, for this lifestyle. Go to some shithole taco restaurant with cockroaches clearly within sight. Now look at the people - holy shit they all look so rich, dressed up in the latest hipster fashion oohing and aahing over the authenticity of ""real Mexican cockroaches"" while eating a barbacoa taco that, truthfully, tastes exactly the same as the other shithole taco place down the road. However, someone marketed the place really well and had everyone buying into the belief that *this place* is really special, much more special than the other kids. 

We are a town that name drops restaurants we eat at, neighbourhoods/zip codes we live in, bars we drink, or places we shop as a representation of status. Back in the day, the fanciest restaurant in town was Jeffrey's, or Green Pastures, and you saw dudes in jeans, a t-shirt, and flip flops because status didn't mean shit. Rich or poor, we were all just living the same laid back, carefree existence. We weren't about the things we did, the places we went, the things we saw - we didn't have to prove to anyone that we were making it, everyone just *knew* that we were all living in a really special city and having a good time with our lives.

I moved to Dallas for two years to go to college, and when I left, Austin still wasn't about status and glitz and ritz and glamour. Dallas was all these things, and I hated every minute of it. I came back here, though, and found that the Dallas vibe had made it's way south. 

But by god, there are people who love the shit out of Dallas, they love the shit out of status and SXSW and corporate marketing. They love the shit out of their overpriced high rise condo in the middle of downtown Austin. They love the shit out of eating rabbit paste on a bed of tartar and foie gras paired with a mean glass of Riesling. And they love the shit out of telling everyone they love the shit out of all this. These people are exactly whom are flocking to the city. These people are filling our bars, restaurants, and businesses to the brim. If you want to be condescending and tell long-time residents to ""suck it up - Uncle Jimmy is moving in and you're just going to have to like it, or you can move out and let Jimmy have the run of the place,"" then you can fuck right off and kiss my ass on your way out.

I can't move. I make a shitload of money doing a specialized job at a lucrative company - packing up and moving isn't realistic at this point. I used to love this city to the point that it annoyed my non-Austin friends who claimed I worshipped Austin. Now, I yearn to live anywhere else. Hopefully one day I will.

* Pretty much everyone you'll interact with speaks English. Most people also immediately switch to English if they see you're not fluent in Swedish, which is actually annoying when you're trying to learn/practice your Swedish.
* People are generally very introverted and distant when you don't know them or don't work with them. It's to the point where you can easily consider them rude, especially in public/busy areas. You will rarely find anyone go out of their way to help you just because. On the plus side, they also usually keep to themselves and respect your privacy/silence.
* Apartments are expensive. Very expensive. Did I mention everything is expensive? Because it is.
* Apartments are also high in demand. You probably won't find anything by yourself. I was assigned a rental agency who helped me find a place, pretty much everything was in the 15-22k SEK/mo range for 60-70m^2. I ended up finding a place for 12k SEK/mo for 65m^2. However, I'm finding out that it's still too expensive.
* pretty much everything like internet/phone/tv/rent/etc. requires a 3 month notice for cancellation.
* The public transit system is really good. Don't bother getting your own vehicle unless you really want/need to. You can go pretty much anywhere with public transit without worries though.
* I would not buy clothes (or much of anything really) in Sweden. Prices are **significantly** more expensive. I've found it to be massively cheaper to go to Poland or another EU country, do all my shopping there, and come back compared to buying in Sweden. Don't even bother with designer stores, it's just flat out wallet rape.
* The country ""shuts down"" a lot around holidays, and also for 1-2 months during the summer when everyone takes their vacation.
* Your gf will likely get completely screwed. When I moved here with my gf, I was told there'd be no problem because she was a Polish citizen. We applied immediately for residency and a PIN (think of it like Swedish Social Security) for her. 1 1/2 years later, still nothing. Without a PIN you can't work, can't get health coverage, can't open a bank account, can't be added to an existing bank account, can't get any government benefits, can't get a cellphone subscription plan, can't get paid, can't get tv/internet, etc etc. Luckily she can still go to school thanks to her Polish citizenship, but that's it. Also, aside from tech-related fields, you'll need to speak Swedish to get a job (and a PIN). You're pretty much dead in the water without a PIN, and it can be **really** depressing.
* The immigration process for myself was all handled by the company that brought me to Sweden, so my process was extremely easy and quick, I had my PIN and everything set and ready to go within 3 months of arriving. I definitely would recommend finding a job prior to moving here and asking if they can help you through the process.
* You get 5 weeks paid vacation minimum if you're full time (not including holidays/sick days), which is awesome.
* There's a lot of tech/programming jobs in Stockholm
* Most online retailers don't ship to Sweden.
* You'll need to understand Swedish to use almost every online portal/mobile app/phone helpline from your bank/ISP/cable provider/etc. as they rarely have updated English versions.
* Expect your monthly living expenses for 2 people to easily push past 10k SEK/mo, not including rent.
* Taxes will take about 52% out of your paycheck.
* Coming from Florida, I've found a lot of the Swedish clothing styles look a bit metrosexual, which is kind of amusing. Swedes are also very accepting of pretty much everyone, which is nice. If you care about religious stuff, most here are Atheists/non-religious.


Honestly, I would say that it's fairly hard to move to Sweden, you'll need to adjust to a lot of things, the biggest of which is how tight on money you'll be. Budgeting is **extremely** important, and you'll find that you'll quickly need to pretty much only buy things that are on sale.

I definitely was not prepared when I came here, and it's been a pretty huge struggle to adjust to the living/financial situation here. My gf's situation also definitely does not help, which causes a lot of stress and frustration. I would definitely say that you should expect to be in roughly the same situation. Luckily my employer is now trying to help with the situation.

Compared to the US, even though my actual gross salary is about the same, I make a net profit that's almost 80% less than before (after all living expenses, taxes, and whatnot).",0,1388961974,,0,1388964610,1,cei6gae,t3_1ugj84,t1_cei6gae,t3_1ugj84,1431813674,7,FALSE,stockholm,t5_2r7aq,7

*ABS has a density of 1.04 grams per cubic centimeter, so a 1kg spool should be
about 962cc. The nominal cross-sectional areas of 3mm round filaments is .07069 square centimeters.  Divide the volume by the area and you get a length of 13603 centimeters for 1kg of 3mm filament.  One of my latest edits has the amount of filament required using my config files for my printer setup and for the smaller parts.  The total is 2257.5 cm centimeters for both inner and outer kits.  With one spool I could print 6.025 kits.  At $30 per 1kg of filament it would cost approx $5.00 per kit.

TRUE,yodatsracist,,,"The more I read about that album, the more depressed I get.  It's just so good.  I'm not a musician, but in my lifetime I don't think I'll ever be able to make anything in my field that good.  And I remember sitting in my living room at age 21, looking forward to graduating college and I realized Nas made that at 19.  *19 years old*. He made a straight up masterpiece at 19.

And then it gets sad, because he spends about the next decade trying to be something that he's not, trying to make hits for other people.  *It Was Written* and *I am...*  have some great songs  (""the Message"", ""Street Dreams"", ""I Gave You Power"", ""If I Rule the World"", ""Nas is Like"", ""N.Y. State of Mind, Part II"", maybe a few more, some of which even broke new ground for Nas stylistically), but the rest of those album show Nas going further and further from being Nas.  I mean, they're *okay* for the most part, but he's just trying to be something he's not.  Rakim brought internal rhymes and rhyme density to hip-hop, but Nas took his lead and mastered the whole thing, at age 19.  To choose an example not from *Illmatic*:

&gt; I *peep*ed you **frontin**

&gt;I was in the *Jeep*

&gt;tinted with *heat*

&gt;sunk in the *seat*

&gt;*beats* **bumpin**.

&gt;Across the *street* you was WILDIN

&gt;talking bout how you ran the ISLAND..

And so on.   Nas's rhymes can just get dense, but it's always in the service of something, in service of the story he's telling or the picture he's painting for you.  Eminem is a great example of artist who sometimes just gets lost in his own verbal density (take a look at his early work, like the first verse of ""[Infinite](http://youtu.be/CtRbEgoTqQs?t=22s)"", where he raps a lot but doesn't say anything--arguably a few of Nas's most technical moments are like this, like his verse on Raekwon's ""Verbal Intercourse""). As this [blog post argues](http://rapmetrics.wordpress.com/2011/09/16/why-nas-lost/), Nas is at his best when he's weaving first person narratives.  Unlike a lot of rappers, it's hard to pay attention to Nas's lyrics and argue that he's glorifying violence or drugs--it just feels more like he's describing it.  Nas makes you feel like you're there, the little details just do it (""on the corner betting Grants with the cee-lo champs/
Laughing at baseheads trying to sell some broken amps"").  

But really, what gets me about Nas is how *effortlessly* he weaves his stories when he's at his best.  Famously, at the very beginning of *Illmatic*, Nas does a little boasting and then goes ""...I don't know how to start this shit"" and he was serious.  Here's DJ Premier describing it:

&gt;""Nas — he's one of our saviors now. When we did ‘N.Y. State of Mind,’ at the beginning when he says, ‘Straight out the dungeons of rap / Where fake niggas don’t make it back,’ then you hear him say, ‘I don’t know how to start this shit,’ ’cause he had just written it. He's got the beat running in the studio, but he doesn’t know how he's going to format how he's going to convey it. So he's going, ‘I don’t know how to start this shit,’ and I’m counting him in [to begin his verse]. One, two, three. And then you can hear him go, ‘Yo,’ and then he goes right into it."" DJ Premier later discussed the unexpectedness of Nas's delivery during the recording, stating ""He didn’t know how he was gonna come in, but he just started going because we were recording. I’m actually yelling, ‘We’re recording!’ and banging on the [vocal booth] window. ‘Come on, get ready!’ You hear him start the shit: Rappers…. And then everyone in the studio was like, ‘Oh, my God’, ’cause it was so unexpected. He was not ready. So we used that first verse. And that was when he was up and coming, his first album. So we was like, 'Yo, this guy is gonna be big.'

Two comparisons come to mind: one, how much effort he clearly put into making club hits in nadir of his career (listen to ""Hate Me Now"", etc,) and how the rapping just sounds strained.  Nas can only describe how awesome cars on when it's in service of story, not for idle boasting. Check his verse on Mobb Deep's ""An Eye for An Eye"" for an example of him talking about ""500 SL, green, ’95 nickel gleam"". It's not a boast, but a detail in picture, just like ""Tailor made ostrich, Chanel for my women friend"".  Plus, that verse includes the vivid simile, ""My sanity is going like an hourglass"".  They're not just words, rhymes, and syllables, they're descriptors, reeled off by a master.  But when he's trying to write for the club, to front something, it just feel strained.  Nas will never have a club banger and most of his best songs just will never be radio hits.  He's managed to be better at being Nas and yet still making radio songs recently, like ""Hip Hop is Dead"" or ""The Don"", but generally, he's at his best not in the club or the radio, but on headphones, or maybe on a system, drunk or stoned, with one or two friends.  A song like, ""Queens Get the Money"", to choose a recent exmaple, is a perfect Nas song that will never be on the radio.  As Nas puts it, he raps ""for listeners, blunt heads, fly ladies and prisoners"".  When tries to rap for someone else, it just falls flat.

For the other half of his effortlessness, look at ""Life's a Bitch"" on *Illmatic*.  AZ delivers a great verse, quite possibly the best verse of his entire career, like he is given a shot and he nails it out of the park. And you almost think, is Nas going to get shown up in terms of verbal dexterity on his own album? And then, after AZ sings the hook, Nas comes on and it's just so clear Nas is playing a different game entirely.  Effortless.  He makes it sound like AZ is reading from a piece of paper and Nas is just sitting on your couch and telling you how it is.  And that's why someone like J. Cole will write a song called ""I Let Nas Down"", because Nas is a rapper's rapper.  When Nas is being Nas, and not trying to be someone else, he just does it.  Honestly, though, what other rapper could you write a song called ""I Let [Them] Down"", and it be about not being the best artist you could be?  Saying ""I Let Jay Down"" probably means you weren't making enough money or something.  Most other ones would be like ""Oh I didn't rep my hometown thoroughly enough"".  But Nas?  Nas is fucking artist.   He paints pictures, he just happens to use words to do it.  And *Illmatic* is nine or ten pure classic tracks of just Nas being Nas, over beats from the best New York producers of the era.   Even when people criticize Nas, they have to acknowledge its greatness (""that's a one hot album every ten year average""). And if you know the album, I can just say ""Jerome's niece"" or ""'Yo, my shit is stuck'"" or ""watching Gandhi til I'm charged"" and it will pull up a mental image as clearly as if I said ""the Mona Lisa"" or Picasso's ""The Old Guitarist"".  And still, because of its sonic and lyrical complexity, every time I listen to *Illmatic* I discover something new.

If the beliefs and practice of Pastafarianism are too vague or ""silly"" to be considered protectable as a religion, what about other religions?

I've seen men in top-hat-ish headwear with curly sideburns blow a goat(?) horn at people by way of blessing. I've eaten a thin, tasteless cracker that I was supposed to believe was actually 100% the real body of Jesus. I've moved my stuff out of the way so a Muslim man could get his prayer rug pointed just the right direction in a cramped room. I've been late to events because I got stuck behind an Amish buggy. 

I think all of those practices are rather silly, but I'm not going to pass judgement on the validity of the religion they belong to; at least certainly not in a legal capacity. I won't even condemn Scientology (the religion) despite the seemingly epic corruption of Scientology (the church/organization).

The whole point of Pastafarianism is to demonstrate the ideal of separation of church and state. Religion shouldn't have an effect on or be affected by the workings of the government. What religious object someone chooses to swear an oath on should not matter, as long as it is significant to them.

Thanks! Great question! 

Currently, Streamus collects absolutely no identifying information about a given user. I do have a server which stores videos, playlists and errors encountered. Storing videos and playlists allows me to enable sharing of playlists between users.

When you first install Streamus a unique 16-digit ID is generated for you and written to local storage on your PC (think  cookie). This ID is then sync'ed between all PC's you're signed into Google Chrome with (think how Bookmarks sync between PCs).

This allows me to simulate a 'logged in user' which can have your playlists shared between PCs without having to actually collect anything.


**BUT**

This implementation is fragile for two reasons:

* A malicious user could send the correct 16-digit ID to my server and delete your information.

* If you uninstall Streamus, your 16 digit ID will be wiped (I can't do anything about this) and you'll lose your information. 

**SO**

**I will be collecting your unique user ID from Google+ in the future. This will allow me to protect your data from malicious users and, if you uninstall and then re-install Streamus, I will be able to recover your data.** I have no plans to collect anything else. I don't really care about your information. I'm here to make a music player that *I* want to use -- I'm simply sharing it with others. :)

The permissions currently requested by Streamus when you install are:

* *.beatport.com: I inject HTML markup and JavaScript into beatport.com to allow you to listen to Top 10 and Top 100 playlists through Streamus instead of using Beatport's player.

* *.share.streamus.com: I inject HTML markup into my own website.

* *.streamus.com: I inject HTML markup into my own website.

* *.youtube.com: I inject HTML markup and JavaScript into YouTube pages to allow you to easily add videos to playlists. 

* streamus.apphb.com: I need to be able to send data to my server.

TRUE,Ryan_Jarv,,,"The following is a critique on your security. Everything I mention is definitely optional, security is usually a trade off with usability so you'll have to decide how secure you need your server to be. If you want to learn then I would say go out, personally I think security is interesting :)

&gt; no remote root login.

So far so good

&gt; only login with keys.

Cool. Just make sure you don't leave your keys laying around, using a password on them is a good idea.

&gt; non standard ssh-port (!=22).

The amount of security this gives is very minimal, I would recommend against this. Your security in your SSH setup is based on your keys. If a attacker doesn't have your keys they won't get in (in however many million years), if they do then all they have to do is find the server it belongs to and the port you used... nmap is good at that. Keep your keys secure and you'll be fine.

&gt; Fail2ban setup to listen to the ssh-port, and ban for 0,5 hour for 3 tries in 10 minutes.

Doesn't give you much a chance if you use the wrong username or accidentally specify the wrong key file. Security is a balance, not saying that it's a bad idea to block brute forcer's but almost all your security is still in your keys.

&gt; 1. I still need to get a log going, but besides that does it sound safe enough?

Edit: sorry didn't see the besides that part, but will keep my response just cause logging is important...

Logging is the most important part, no matter what you do to lock down your server it's still possible for someone to get in... if they do you want to know about it. 

So on the logging subject I would turn on sudo-io logging. So that would look like this in sudoers (use visudo):

    Cmnd_Alias      NO_LOG_IO=/sbin/reboot, /sbin/shutdown, /sbin/halt, sudoreplay
    
    Defaults log_output
    Defaults!NO_LOG_IO !log_output

Sudo logging basically records every command you run as root, if you need to ever find out what exactly happened in a sudo session you can use sudoreplay. halt, shutdown, and reboot are excluded from sudo logging because the system will hang when it tries to write the log to a disk that is unmounted. Last thing regarding logging is in a ideal situation you send log's off to another machine so that if a machine is compromised the attacker can't mess with your logs. 

You will want to look into how to properly configure sudo if you have any other users that need a slice of root permissions other then you (it's very easy to do it wrong, sudo mastery is a good book if need to learn more).

You may also want to look into a logging and intrusion detection stuff like autitd or tripwire.

&gt; http - Input and output. (source-port on input and destination-port on output)

So they can reach any port as long as they send it from port 80?
If your just trying to access web sites from your machine only add the rule on output and on input allow all established from port 80. Also don't forget to add port 443 for https. Also it's worth it to note that browser's are the second weakest link in the chain, most people don't run them on servers, but since it's a home server (and doesn't have any thing too sensitive?) it's probably ok.

&gt; 2. I had to put spt on input, and dpt on output for http, and setup udp dns to able to apt-get update. Is this the regular setup for http and dns?

This is how I usually do it:

* Allow all out
     * The reason I see for blocking outbound traffic is so you notice when a malicious program is trying to call home. If a program has root though it can disable your firewall, so generally you will block outbound traffic on a separate firewall.
* Allow established in.
     * This will take care of letting all your dns and http(s) traffic come back through without explicitly opening any ports.
* Allow in the services that I'm serving to the public, lock them down to certain IP's if I can.

&gt; 3. How can I secure myself so a static address will compromise my network as little as possible?

I assume your referring to your private IP that will be accessed through port forwarding. If I understand networking correctly (it's not my strong area) putting your server on a seperate vlan will prevent [arp spoofing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARP_spoofing) and putting it on another subnet will prevent [DHCP Hijacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_DHCP). Of course it may be necessary to run it on the same vlan or subnet depending on what your trying to accomplish.
There are a lot of attacks a cracker has available once he/she gains access to your internal network, and sometimes it's not possible/desirable to prevent the these things from happening (all kinds of different [mitm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack) attacks. I believe a IDS like snort will detect a lot of these things and at least alert you if it does happen. You would have to set up snort on another computer (rasperry pi?) and give it access to all the traffic on your network ([port mirroring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_mirroring)).

As far as security goes this is just a small part of what you can do to lock down your server. It's always a trade off between security and usability, if you secure something so well that no one uses it then it's useless. Last thing, the weakest link in the chain is always the user... yes that's you! ...or me if you give me access :)

He was first associated with sex abuse in 1993, when Evan Chandler, a dentist/aspiring script writer accused him of molesting his son Jordan. He accused MJ of molesting Jordan only after MJ denied to fund a 20million dollar script deal and build an extension to his house.

Here is a taped phone conversation in which Evan Chandler lays out a plan to extort money from Jackson:

http://youtube.com/watch?v=tx8Z9fxxw-U

This was taped July 2nd, but the Chandlers claim that they found out their kid was abused on July 16th. 

Michael jackson was investigated, he cooperated with authorities, he was strip searched and photos were taken of his genitalia to see if they would match a description given by the boy (they did not), and his homes were raided yielding no evidence to support the claim. Hundreds of children who knew Jackson were interviewed and all claimed Michael did nothing inappropriate with them. The investigation was closed from lack of evidence and criminal charges were not brought. 

The Chandlers were continuously delaying the criminal trial, demanding that the civil one go first (gee I wonder why?.) The law in California at the time stated that a civil trial could precede a criminal one. This was unfair for MJ's legal team as the prosecution could changed their strategy and story after hearing the defense at the Civil trial, which would greatly jeopardize MJ's right to a fair trial in the criminal one. 

Michael Jackson's insurance settled the civil case, (as that was really his only choice), and the Chandlers refused to testify in criminal court over and over again (the statute of limitations was extended for the Chandlers twice.), even though the contract stipulated that they had every right to testify against MJ (after all, you cannot settle criminal charges). Instead, the family immediately  sold stories to the National Enquirer, tried to shop a book deal ([Here is a book publisher talking about being approached by the Chandlers to sell a book, she called them brazen opportunists](http://youtube.com/watch?v=yQYeNfHVBtM)) and then had the gall to sue MJ AGAIN and numerous other company's for 60 million and the rights to produce an album called EVANstory, where they will write and sing songs about their son being abused. Yes, they actually tried this, you can't make this shit up. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_child_sexual_abuse_accusations_against_Michael_Jackson

That was the one time MJ was accused of such things, until the 2005 trial, which anyone who is familiar with it knows it was an obvious shakedown with zero evidence to support the claim, a history of the family approaching celebrities for money, evidence of lying and extortion, inconsistencies, contradictions, an impossible timeline and a complete waste of tax payer dollars.

TRUE,backgrinder,,,"""What I dont understand is how a larger force would be unable to stretch their lines more effectively than a smaller opponent, or how the persuing persian were unable to keep up with the wheeling and charging maneuvers executed by the Macedonian forces. ""

 Your first fundamental mistake here is not realizing that larger groups are harder to move while maintaining cohesion than smaller groups (a mistake the Persians also made). Imagine taking a kindergarten class on a field trip. Now imagine taking an elementary school on the same field trip, with the same number of chaperones. 

 The second error you are making is not knowing what Alexander knew about the Persians. He knew their order of battle (the types and numbers of units). He knew how they liked to fight. And he knew that the Persians by this point were equally familiar with him. This meant Alexander knew how to show the Persians something they would expect, and he also had a very good idea how they would respond to it. Alexander, in other words, knows everything about the Persians at Gaugamela a bullfighter knows about a bull before walking into the ring. He knows where their horns are, how they will respond to seeing a red cape, and where the weak spot he can attack and stab them in the heart is.

 Alexander's standard battle tactic, developed by his father, is to use his infantry units, the Phalanx troops, to make contact with the enemy in the center or left side, and pin the enemies best infantry down there while using his cavalry to sweep wide around the flank and then sweep in and trap the enemy between the two forces. Alexander had used this very tactic against the Persians successfully before, and he knew showing this tactic would be very familiar to the Persians. He also knew they had amassed a large elite cavalry formation to counter him. Like a bullfighter showing a red cape he aligned his infantry to the center left, and started pushing his cavalry off to the right to begin his standard flanking maneuver. Like a bull responding to red the Persians sent their cavalry out wide to their left to shadow Alexander, and started stretching their lines to the left to keep Alexander from flanking them.

 There's a reason why bullfighters use a large brightly colored cape to get a bull's attention. A bull is a very nearsighted animal, and it takes a lot to get their attention. This is to the bull's disadvantage, as it can see the red cape, and not the sword in the bullfighters other hand. The bullfighters standard tactic is to get the bull to not only chase the cape, but to do so on a specific line and drop his head to gore the offending cape at a precise point. If the bullfighter can train the bull to taking this line and dropping his horns to strike at the cape right next to him a small 2-3 inch gap between the bull's shoulder blades will be exposed to him, with the horns to low to protect when he stabs in with his sword. If everything works right the bull will be dropped once his horns are too low. Of course, if the bullfighter misses he is unprotected, and the bull wins.

 While Alexander was riding to his far right, pulling the Persian cavalry along with him, he had a unit of peltasts trailing him. The peltasts are light infantry that can move quickly, and they are armed with slings and javelins to throw at the enemy, and swords for self protection. The peltasts were behind Alexander's cavalry, opposite the Persians and it was a dry dusty day so the Persians didn't see them there. As Alexander keeps pushing further and further to his right, and the Persians keep edging out (to their left) to keep him from turning the corner on him the Persians start getting stretched out.

 As you pointed out the Persians are a larger group, but they lack cohesion, or an ability to stay in neatly ordered ranks when moving. As they stretch their line gaps start opening between different units. Given time they could have corrected this easily, and used their superior numbers to fill in, but time is something Alexander won't give them. When Alexander sees a gap open up wide enough to run through he cuts back. Instead of moving out to he right slowly he cuts back and charges at full speed back to his left, back to the center of the battlefield. The Persians elite cavalry swing around to follow and block him.

 This is where Alexanders peltasts come in to play. When Alexander cuts back the opposite direction his peltasts are now in the open right in front of the Persian cavalry. Instead of charging back towards Alexander across open space the Persians charge directly into a hail of projectiles from a peltasts unit that to all intents and purposes had just materialized in front of them out of thin air. It wasn't enough to destroy them completely, but it broke their momentum just long enough to keep them from blocking Alexander, who is now charging a gap in the Persian lines at full speed with 7,000 elite cavalry at his back.

 If you watch American football you have seen this move hundreds of times. The ball is snapped, the running back moves right with his blockers, the linebackers and safeties move to intercept him. At the last second he cuts back, running against the grain through a hole that has opened up in the defense. Running back hits the opening he saw at full speed, runs through it, and scores a touchdown. This is a common but effective American Football move, pioneered by a man named Red Grange who left a young West Point cadet (and captain of the Army football team) named Dwight David Eisenhower with a permanent limp using it.

 The Persians had a huge army, but the numbers were fluffed with contingents from all of their conquered territories. Their own units, their heavy infantry and their elite Bactrian cavalry (commanded by Darius kinsman) were what really counted here. Alexander had pinned the Persians best infantry units in contact with his infantry in the center. He had stretched the Persians best cavalry off the edge of the playing field and pinned them there with peltasts. He had found a gap in the Persian front line and was charging through it at full speed. At this point there wasn't a single effective combat unit standing between Alexander and Darius. Darius fled the battlefield. It was that or commit suicide. Once Darius was gone the non Persian units all quit. They weren't thrilled about fighting for their slave-masters in the first place, they certainly were not willing to continue the fight after the Persian king had run away. The battle turned into a rout, and Alexander was able to invade Persia proper virtually unopposed.

TRUE,AnimuX,,,"Unfortunately, these confrontations on the high seas between whale poachers and protesters continue because the government of Japan has turned whaling into a never-to-be-cancelled spending program for the benefit of fisheries bureaucrats (amakudari) who expect to one day get high paid jobs in the same whaling industry that's currently propped up by government funding. The whaling is not done for 'science' or for 'tradition' (as if that were a valid reason) and it's completely irrelevant to Japan's food security and economic prosperity.

In fact, Japan's whaling industry has a long history of regulatory violations that dates back before anything like Sea Shepherd existed. Historically the whalers have hunted protected species, killed undersized whales, hunted out of season, hunted in off limits areas, exceeded their assigned quotas, and more. They even hired foreign poachers to kill more whales and smuggle the unreported, illegally gained, whale meat to Japan. So, nobody was surprised when Japan lost the vote on whaling in 1982 and continued killing whales anyway after all commercial whaling quotas were set to zero by the International Whaling Commission in 1986.

Since then, Japan has continued shooting whales in the Southern Ocean and in the North Pacific. Today Japan's government claims it is killing whales for 'research'. This is done specifically to undermine and defy other prohibitions and restrictions on whaling set by the IWC. Japan believes as long as it officially pretends to kill whales for 'science' then the rules don't apply -- citing Article VIII of the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling as a loophole. However, other nations do not agree and the IWC has repeatedly called on Japan to stop killing whales. The government of Australia filed a legal case against Japan's whaling with the International Court of Justice -- oral arguments were heard last summer -- a ruling from the court has not yet been issued.

Japan annually kills endangered fin whales, endangered sei whales, vulnerable sperm whales rare Bryde's whales, common minke whales (many from the threatened J-stock), and Antarctic minke whales. Coastal hunts also include up to 20,000 small cetaceans each year, like dolphins, rare beaked whales, and a Dall's porpoise hunt called 'clearly unsustainable' by scientists.

Regardless, demand for whale meat in Japan is so pathetically low the government failed to sell 75% of the catch in 2012. Much of the whale meat is fed to children in compulsory school lunches and last year the government stated its intent to serve whale to defense forces too. In a 2012 survey of Japanese citizens, 89% of the respondents stated they had not purchased any whale meat in the last year. So, it seems if the government did not force whale meat on children most of them would never even know the taste of it. So much for 'tradition'.

As for the 'science', in 2002, in an open letter published in the New York Times, twenty-one scientists (including three Nobel laureates) stated emphatically, “We, the undersigned scientists, believe Japan’s whale research program fails to meet minimum standards for credible science.” The letter specifically states there is no compelling reason to kill whales in order to obtain data from them.

In 2003,  published in BioScience, IWC scientific committee members supported the 2002 rebuke of Japan’s whaling programs. The scientists stated, “Japan's scientific whaling program is so poor that it would not survive review by any major independent funding agency,” and when it comes to misrepresenting commercial activities as science, “there has rarely been a more egregious example of this misrepresentation than Japan's scientific whaling program.” They also explained that the vast majority of publications resulting from these programs have absolutely no value for the management of whale stocks.

As Australia's representatives explained to the world court, the so-called 'research loophole' was only ever intended for limited use for critical research needs. Japan cannot simply play pretend, continue the same bad behavior and regulatory violations of the past, call it research, and proceed unchallenged. However, Japan's status as the world's 3rd largest economy has effectively suppressed any meaningful response from other nations. 

Thankfully, Sea Shepherd Australia continues to thwart the whale poachers when national governments fail to enforce their own agreements. For several years, the whalers have returned to Japan with only a small fraction of their intended catch as a result of direct interference from activists. In 2013, the whalers were left with the lowest number of whales killed since the whole research scam started in the 1980s. Hopefully, the number of poached whales will be even smaller this season.",0,1388981503,,0,1388982178,3,ceifoj5,t3_1uhz95,t1_ceifoj5,t3_1uhz95,1431818150,2133,FALSE,worldnews,t5_2qh13,2133

TRUE,Rc2124,scholar,[First] [Last] on [Server],"Not even low level dungeons... Pretty much anything. 

I queued in progress for High Level Dungeons last night, and randomly got WP. The healer had left about 30 seconds into the dungeon, which I thought was odd, but sometimes things come up. I said hi, and the PLD said he was new to the dungeon and was excited to run it. At that point, the other two DPS dropped as well. The healer I replaced had dropped immediately when s/he saw the, ""Someone is new"" message. It was obvious why they left even if they didn't say it, and the tank was clearly hurt by it. I decided to stick around because I didn't want a fresh 50 to think that everyone is an asshole in this game. I explained the dungeon to him, and we waited for a little bit to see if anyone else would come, but noone did. So we decided to see how far we could get. As a PLD-SCH combo we didn't have much DPS, so every fight was extraordinarily slow, but he was a very attentive and receptive tank. I guided him through and explained things as we went, while unsuccessfully trying to get FC and LS members to queue up to help us out (some tried, but apparently got sent to other WPs). And wouldn't you know it, we got all the way to the second boss by ourselves. We didn't quite have the DPS to beat it before it hit some sort of enrage timer I never knew existed, and we wiped a few times before deciding we wouldn't beat it with only a few minutes left on the clock. I knew we wouldn't be able to beat the Tonberry King anyways with how low our DPS was. I asked what server he was on, and it turns out we're both on Faerie!

We immediately friended each other after, and I know we're going to stay close friends from here on out. He thanked me profusely and was really happy that I stuck with him and taught him the dungeon. He said he takes the game slow because he has a stressful job and doesn't have a lot of play time, and it meant a lot to him. He said if I ever wanted anything crafted I could just ask, because he and his fiance have all crafts to 50. It cost me nothing to be nice to him, and it was honestly a lot of fun running with just a tank and getting to know someone. I still can't believe 3 people left because he was new, and it really saddens me to think about it, but I made a close friend. Thing is, the four of them all could have been close friends if they had all been nice to each other in the first place. I don't understand the decisions people make sometimes! New people are people too you know!

2. ¿Decisiones correctas?. En mi opinión si es necesario nuevas reformas en el país, PEMEX no podría estar peor y hay que arreglar la situación, pero no creo que esta sea la forma correcta de hacerlo. Yo lo entiendo de esta forma: Los políticos están consientes de que no son capaces de dirigir PEMEX pero tampoco quieren dejar de estar a cargo (ellos aman el poder y también la cantidad de dinero a la que tiene acceso para poder robarlo) así que lo más lógico para arreglar el desastre sin necesidad de cambiar de directores es traer a alguien para arregle el desastre (dígase inversión privada). ah! por cierto, muchos de los políticos mexicanos ya compraron acciones de las compañías que van a intervenir en PEMEX; solo buscan lucrarse y no el bien de la nación.

She told me I would have to cope with being a failure for the rest of my life. She made me feel worthless. But you know what? Here I am, Ms. Mueller! *Here I am.* We've all dealt with tough times and made it through with flying colors. And from here, the future looks pretty bright...for all of us. Thank you.""

Before the last sentence has fully left Chandler's lips the stadium explodes in thunderous yelling and clapping. Caps shoot up from the gathered graduates' bleachers like confetti. Ms. Mueller sits stonelike, barely smiling, holding her defense against the barbed glances of her colleagues. Who does that? say the whispers, though whether from between or outside her wrinkled ears she does not know. Who tells a kid that? Jesus, some people. Good for him for speaking out. I seriously wonder why she's even a teacher.

So do I. Sometimes, so do I. I was a young teacher, too, once, just like all of you--happy, sensitive, full of confidence...back when grades meant something and children learned how to think hard and work hard and overcome failure and people knew that success isn't a roadway to be paved for the successful to walk smoothly but an obstacle course that makes you a little stronger every time you have the option to quit and you say, goddamn it, I'm not fucking stopping now!...

Her blotchy cheeks twitch, imperceptibly.

I'm sorry, Chandler. But I'm not sorry that it hurt. You have so much fire, so much drive, but you weren't convinced you needed it. The road was too smooth. Most of these kids here, they came in with their dry-weather tires and were told to take a spin around a nice little track and got handed a little gold medal as they finished, one by one. You needed a reason to be better, to study harder, so you could know yourself and know your potential. Maybe you'll decide to become a teacher yourself, to give the next generation the guidance and encouragement that they need, to give them a shoulder to cry on when they run into crabs like me. And you'll tell them, sweetie, you can do it! Old Miss Mueller doesn't know how special you are...you can prove her wrong, right? Let's prove her wrong.

And whoever your student is, I hope she does. 

And I hope you do, Chandler.

Everyone else always told you, but I never could. Maybe I could tell you now...you're all through, you're all grown up, and I'll never see you again. No, what am I saying, you wouldn't believe me...I played my part too well. Maybe I can just think it. Maybe that will be enough. 

I'm proud of you, Chandler.

And I- 
I love you.

Go far.

Run the obstacle course.

Prove me wrong.

The teachers and students congregate, laughing, shaking hands. Parents and teachers are introduced, couples take photos, imaginary toasts are drunk from Sprite cans. Joy suffuses the air, for no gathering is more joyful than a gathering of young people who have shared in a once-in-a-lifetime accomplishment by getting through four years of work, and are getting ready to retire into a seemingly endless summer with seemingly boundless energy and truly boundless confidence. 

Ms. Mueller walks slowly through the sweltering parking lot. Her 1992 Mercury Esquire requires a kick to the door while pulling the handle in order to open. Her hands are not very sweaty, since they have not been shaken. She returns to her one-bedroom apartment, in which pets are not allowed and the A/C sometime dies on the weekends. She hangs her purse on the door knob. Sits at her desk.

It's time to start drawing up the curriculum for next year.

I hear 'Give me your passport' in the voice of a man I don't know, from a face I don't recognize. Blood and adrenaline surge from my heart faster and more rapidly than I have ever felt. We pull into a parking lot, I open my door and wait patiently until that fucking asshole works up the courage to fight me.

He steps out and yells something I don't hear. I tell him that I'll give him one more chance to get back in the car without saying a word about my passport ever again. He says 'passport' with a wiley grin and expects me to be the same cowering boy that I used to be. The same kid who loved him and adored him and wanted nothing else but to be just like him. 

I connect the quickest and hardest fist I've ever thrown against another person directly onto his chin. Blood spurts out of his mouth with the second blow. He hits me twice above and below my right eye. I completely lose my shit and wail on the left side of his face until it is a broken and bloody ruin.

Using another PC to create it, that will create a Windows 7 USB thumb drive boot drive.  Make sure your thumb drive can hold it.  Probably up to 4gb (assuming).  Follow those instructions exactly, using the Windows 7 USB/DVD Download Tool.  It isn't just as simple as throwing the .iso file onto a thumb drive.  THAT WILL NOT WORK.  You must let the program use the .iso file to make the drive bootable.  After you create that thumb drive make sure BIOS is set to boot to USB.  Let me know what happens.

Have you tried a different DVD rom drive to run the windows boot? 
Try using an external USB DVD drive using one of the 2 media:
Win7 recovery disk (made on a different PC of course), or the original Win7 install DVD.  

I'm sure when you say CDrom you really mean DVD.  I just want to clarify because Windows 7 doesn't use CD and it's disks will not be read in a CDROM drive.  I doubt thats the case since the drive you are using should automatically be DVD on that laptop.

He pissed on our deck, threw rocks at my dogs and friends and was a terrible example for my younger brother.

Anyway, its my sisters 18th birthday. Her and her friends are hanging out in the living room, Brian is in the basement, pestering me, knowing I don't like him. I'm minding my own business, trying to play N64. He keeps smacking the back of my head. Fourth time I told him to knock it off before I hit him back.

Challenge accepted, apparently.

He grabs a plastic bat and cracks me in the back of the head. Game over, Brian. I grab the bat, grab him by the throat, and beat the shit out of him. His face is bleeding everywhere, then I threw the bat aside and worked the torso, throwing him on the ground, stepping on his hands and arms. Soon, I need to pause and regain my energy. He runs up the stairs, full of tears and blood and runs home. I go back to playing N64.

My mom sees him. My sister and her friends see him. My brother saw it all and is bawling. My moms boss, (my first future boss) sees this kid who got the shit beat out of him run out of the house. My mom comes downstairs to ask what I did. I looked at her and yelled ""**I hit him! I hit him and didn't stop until I couldn't hit him anymore!**"" She told me to wait in the basement. I did. Fuck it. Brian told his mom that my sister got her friends to beat him up and throw him against the coffee table. Brian's mom, Fat Slut comes up to our front door, in panties, a tank top and a baby on her hip, saying she's gonna beat somebodys ass. My mom tells her to get off our property but she won't budge. 3 18 year old men tell her to leave, my moms boss tells her to leave and my dad, just getting home, says ""get the fuck away from my family."" Fat Slut asks who beat Brian, I walk right up to her and said ""I did. And ill do it again if he walks into this house again, then ill kick your ass."" Fat Slut storms off to beat Brian for lying to her.

I won. Earned the respect of my sisters friends, proved to Brian that I was a force to be reckoned with, and made a lasting impression on my future employer. Got grounded for 4 days. Brian and his fucked up family moved away afterwards.

TRUE,fuufnfr,,,"Alright, nobody will believe it, but here's what's happening.

Basically, this guys is correct.

But here's the deal, there's good guys, and there's bad guys. Both terrestrial and off world.

Bad guy aliens already made a deal and transferred some tech to the bad guy humans in change down here around the middle of the last century.  Basically, there's a hidden, runaway society on this planet with suppressed super technologies including free energy devices.  But first...

The general story is a bunch of bad aliens showed up here tens of thousands of years ago and have been enslaving humanity in one form or another since then.  

Fast forward to now times.

Good guys aliens have become aware of what's happening here on earth and some have decided they need to help.  There is literally a space war happening out there and we've been quarantined.

The good guys aliens are a mix, so are the bad guys.  Bad guys are the reptilians and their grey minions.

It helps to think of it like Star Trek out there, that's actually a very accurate depiction of it.

Some of the aliens helping are even actually humans, just not humans from this planet.

So yeah, there's that whole prime directive thing about non-intervention. But here's the deal. The bad guy aliens have already screwed up our natural evolution real bad and basically we can't progress anymore while they got their boots on our necks.  So it was decided to allow forces to intervene and get rid of the bad guy aliens so we can go evolving with out the interference and oppression, basically so we'd at least get a chance to do things on our own for once. 

They are not going to take care of our terrestrial problems, that's going to be up to us.

The bad guy aliens control us because they control the Cabal that runs most of the world.  Who is this Cabal?  You all know them as the secretive group of nasty people and what most people refer to as the Illuminati. Many will argue that it is the Masons, or the Vatican, or the Rothschilds, or the Rockefellers, or the Bushes, or the Queen of England, blah blah blah.

The truth is, It's parts of all of them. In various levels of involvement and performing certain tasks they all collude together.

The common name now given to this collective is ""the Cabal"".

[Here's a good backstory on their saga](http://www.reddit.com/r/greenlight/comments/1fclio/backstory_this_is_quite_literally_considered_the/)

Anyway, they good guy aliens are cleaning up things in the background and once the bad alien threat is totally removed (it mostly under control already) then it will time for us to clean up our own mess here on the planet.

How do we stop the Cabal?  Well, that's being done now also, on two fronts, with [The Plan](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRziYS-PZ2U) (mass arrests of the elite criminal class) , and [Neil Keenan](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnC1_o2Rmqk) (legal acquisition of the [Global Collateral Accounts](http://www.reddit.com/r/greenlight/comments/1fyibp/a_brief_history_of_the_global_collateral_accounts/)).

Back to what this guys was saying.  The bad guy aliens shared some crazy tech with the bad guy humans in charge down here.  And now, good guy aliens are taking the bad aliens out, so we can have a chance at taking out the bad guy humans who were working with them.  If all goes as planned, once we take out the trash, the good guy aliens will share some awesome wicked tech with us.  They're not just going to give it to us, they will help us to develop the crazy stuff we already have but is being hidden from us.

Free energy, replicators (constructors), stuff that can clean up the planet (even radioactive pollution), and healing techs  that have been described as even capable of growing back limbs.

Should be fun.

now, my uncle was brilliant. he grew up in the same small town my dad did, but came up with infinitely more ways to fuck someone over. he had taught me a trick called the ""sponge bomb."" buy a very porous sponge (one that holds a lot of water) and get it absolutely soaking. wring every ounce of water out of it, and start squishing it; get it as small as you can. wrap it in twine as tightly as you can, then let it sit. i did for two weeks, as i had the time to wait from their extended stay. when it's fully dry and you cut the twine off, the sponge will hold that smaller shape. 

then, *find a toilet*.

the nice thing about the site was that once the box office was open (it was all outdoors) anyone could use the bathrooms. so, i did. the trick is to *flush* and *then drop*. not the other way around. *flushing* and *then* dropping will make the sponge go further before it swells up and blocks the pipe. 

i made 6 of them and deployed them into separate toilets (i think there were 10 in all). two days later i contacted my friend who still worked there and asked how bad it was. apparently the damage was reaching into the $50K range. they had to replace all the fancy satellites (and they were *very* fancy) as well as clean the river of shit i'd caused right at the entrance.

After being removed, he was placed in multiple foster homes where he experienced more neglect; physical, sexual, and mental/emotional abuse; the loss of contact with 4 biological siblings, not to mention anyone he formed an attachment to while with a family.
I adopted him at the age of 7. He has been in therapy since that time (he is now almost 16) and remains on several medications to help him function in a ""normal"" way. He has many emotional scars that will never fully heal. He has incredible learning difficulties, most likely due to little stimulation in the critical first years and multiple emotional traumas that have changed how his brain functions.
His birth mother was not able to care for him or his siblings. I love him with all my heart, but should his mother have had an abortion? Absolutely. Was ""giving him up"" for adoption an option?

TRUE,themeaningofhaste,astro,Grad Student|Astronomy|Pulsars|Pulsar Timing,"There's a couple of things I've seen in this thread so hopefully I can answer some stuff. I know Scott and he's been pretty excited about this for awhile. Timing of this system has been an ongoing effort at Green Bank because of the crazy geometry. You have to nail down where in the orbit the pulsar is, which isn't quite changing sinusoidally anymore, but is more of a long term sine wave with a shorter sine on top of that (see Figure 1a, I can see it in the free version though it's small). In Figure 2, you can see that there is an outer white dwarf in the red orbit, with the gray orbit as the inner binary. The pulsar is closest to the ""center"" of the system. 

I will say that this is a bit sensationalized because its a news article but this system really is interesting. This goes beyond the three-body problem, which is typically a Newtonian problem, though not always. Various pulsar systems have been used to put massive constraints on general relativity thus far. The most famous example of this is probably the [Hulse-Taylor Binary Pulsar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSR_B1913%2B16), which won the 1993 Nobel Prize for an indirect detection of gravitational waves. Gravitational waves are like ripples in spacetime and when the two pulsars orbit around each other, they radiate away gravitational energy, causing the orbit to decay. They measured this decay by timing the deviations of when the pulses arrive at the Earth from when you'd expect them to arrive (given where the pulsars are, how they are moving, etc.), and found it to match almost exactly with the prediction from GR. In that wiki article, you can see a plot of the data (red) and the prediction (blue). Note that the blue line is not a fit but the mathematical prediction from GR. Pretty cool!

Now, one way that people who study gravity quantify the effects of gravity is by something called the [PPN Formalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameterized_post-Newtonian_formalism#Beta-delta_notation). GR will have certain values for these parameters (0's or 1's, depending on the parameter) whereas other versions of gravity will have different values. In this way, we can compare the effects of one model of gravity with respect to another. If you scroll down to the [accuracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameterized_post-Newtonian_formalism#Accuracy_from_experimental_tests) part of the same page, you can see the bounds that have been placed on these parameters. The closer those bounds are to zero, the more we constrain that GR is the right model for gravity in the Universe. You can see that some of the bounds are pretty good. For example, 0.01 means we've measured it to 1 part in 100. If you'd prefer to think of it another way, it's like saying it's deviation from GR is 0.00+/-0.01. However, most are smaller than that, you can see that the Hulse-Taylor system constrains one of them fairly well, with a bound of 4x10^-5, but then you see the alpha_3, the self-acceleration one. That has a bound of 4x10^-20. That's enormous. You've constrained it to within 1 part in 25 quintillion if I worked that out correctly. 

Pulsar timing has given some of the greatest constraints on gravity and we're working on trying to constrain gravity further by making direct detections of gravitational waves using arrays of them in the sky. This system is the first of its kind found, with three highly relativistic objects all in orbit around each other, and this paper pretty much just says here is the discovery and the dynamics of the system, and hopefully future study will show some really strong constraints of gravity from it.

""Alright, here goes. I'm old. What that means is that I've survived (so far) and a lot of people I've known and loved did not. I've lost friends, best friends, acquaintances, co-workers, grandparents, mom, relatives, teachers, mentors, students, neighbors, and a host of other folks. I have no children, and I can't imagine the pain it must be to lose a child. But here's my two cents.

I wish I could say you get used to people dying. I never did. I don't want to. It tears a hole through me whenever somebody I love dies, no matter the circumstances. But I don't want it to ""not matter"". I don't want it to be something that just passes. My scars are a testament to the love and the relationship that I had for and with that person. And if the scar is deep, so was the love. So be it. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are a testament that I can love deeply and live deeply and be cut, or even gouged, and that I can heal and continue to live and continue to love. And the scar tissue is stronger than the original flesh ever was. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are only ugly to people who can't see.

As for grief, you'll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you're drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it's some physical thing. Maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it's a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive.

In the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what's going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life.

Somewhere down the line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O'Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you'll come out.

Take it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don't really want them to. But you learn that you'll survive them. And other waves will come. And you'll survive them too. If you're lucky, you'll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks.""

it's not a right of first refusal, it's a pro-rata share of the next round. investors who invested via a convertible note often don't get it, either. it isn't by any means a default.

the pro-rata allows the investor to maintain an ownership percentage (which is frequently important to institutional investor's limited partners) - it has nothing to do maintaining the value of what they own. if it is an up round, the value of what they own goes up.

pro-rata is most important in a down round - if a new investor comes in at a lower price than the previous valuation then all the previous investors get crammed down. this lets them prevent that.

TRUE,Izlandi,,,"&gt;Thank you, valuable information right there. I'm surprised Östermalm is that expensive, not knowing any better and looking from Google Maps it looks like Södermalm, Norrmalm or Kungshölmen would be more attractive. Is there a district you would recommend ?

Östermalm has always been an extreme ""upper-class"" district in Stockholm. It's quite secluded (not a lot going on, except for Stureplan) but it's still very close to the more vibrant parts of the city. Södermalm (or Söder for short) is more ""hip"", and many of the buildings aren't as ""nice"" as what you'd find on Kungsholmen or Vasastan/Birkastan (the area around Odenplan&amp;St:Eriksplan). It will be expensive to live at either of these locations, and if you aren't planning on buying an apartment you are in for hell. All of these are nice areas so it all really comes down to personal preference (and money, of course). 

If you can score an apartment anywhere ""innanför tullarna"" (in the city) you're set, public transportation is excellent. It wouldn't be more than 20 minutes for you to Östermalmstorg from anywhere. Use [SL](http://sl.se/en/Visitor/Plan-your-journey/) to see how long it would take. Consider areas like Fredhäll and Kristineberg (still close but not as sought-after as the ones previously mentioned). 

Also, if you are set on working around Östermalm it's worth checking out areas to the southwest like Liljeholmen and Årsta. The red metro line (which goes to straight to Östermalms torg without any changes at the central) runs that way, so from Liljeholmen it would still only be 12 minutes to get there. Those areas are a lot cheaper, while they still have a nice reputation and are fairly close to the city (compared to, say Hässelby or Vårberg). What I'm trying to get across: be ready to commute. Most Stockholmers do, myself included (and I live on Kungsholmen).

TRUE,takemyworlddown,,,"I was 12 years old and had a Playstation 1 for Christmas. I had two games with it, one of which was Tomb Raider 2 that I was very eager to play. Take into account that I was brand new to having a games console and up until then I had only played on a Commodore 64.

So I had the main menu loaded up and scrolled through all of the options - as far as I was concerned the Passport icon was only for game settings and the option for ""New Game"" didn't come up automatically, so I decided that selecting ""Lara's Home"" was my best bet, since that was the first thing I had read about in the manual that came with it.

For three days, I played on Lara's Home. After playing the shit out of the obstacle course, running helplessly into the groaning butler and desperately trying to find the dual pistols, I was getting a bit tired of it by the third day.

Luckily, my cousin, a few years older than me, visited just after Christmas and had owned a PS for many years. He listened with pity on his face as I told him about my very boring experience with the first level of Tomb Raider.

And, of course, I watched in amazement as he selected ""New Game"" from the passport and I got to play the actual first level of Tomb Raider 2, with dual pistols, enemies and even cutscenes! I was so excited that I didn't even feel stupid about it until many years later.

TRUE,sleepinxonxbed,,,"The Simpsons now is a lot different from the Simpsons during their golden era. When the show started it was very much focused on the characters placed in every day slice of life scenarios. We saw how much the family loved each other and felt a strong emotional connection to them, [""Do it for her""](http://parallelevision.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/do-it-for-her.jpg) is one example. The reason why the Simpsons was successful was because the family loved each other and their friends no matter what. Every one has their flaws and shortcomings, and that's what made them feel so down to earth and human that they could be people we know. That's why each episode in the beginning golden era had a sense of timelessness that can be enjoyed no matter how old it may be.

Ever since the Simpsons have grown massive and taken on many years, the writers have taken the direction of being relevant to our times. The love between the family and friends is still there as evidenced in this episode, but the main theme shifted towards modern relevancy and grand adventures. There are episodes focused that focuses on technology such as media piracy, ipads, video game consoles, things that seem to break our imagination of the world of the Simpsons. This is an ageless family from the 90's, but they've acquired our modern day technology which sort of messes with our perception of the show. Yeah they're portraying feelings and problems that we have with our own technology, but these are just petty first world problems whose gimmick won't last years from now.

There are episodes where they frequently go on trips around the world and can do as much damage as they can with no repercussions. It's all fun at the moment, but this too breaks our perception of what the show was. How are they affording this? This isn't the same Homer Simpson who's (occasionally) working his ass off and scraping by to get what his family needs. Homer was (and still is) the loveable idiot that does what he can for the family. Take for example the very first episode where Homer had to spent his Christmas bonus to remove Bart's tattoo and had no money left to buy anyone presents and how he struggled to do what he can and eventually found Santa's Little Helper. That's the kind of character we can empathize with, not the Homer that can do outrageous things without consequence. I don't remember when for certain, but there were times where I felt like Homer was just an outright asshole that didn't redeem himself at the end (besides Frank Grimes, we were *meant* to hate Homer then).

Now I'm not saying that early Simpsons episodes were extremely realistic, take for example the episode where Mr. Burns wanted to buy all hundred puppies to make some clothing (See my vest! See my vest! See my vest!). That episode was surely exaggerated, but it touched our inner child and played out how we wanted to be the heroes when we were just kids. And the episode of Homer's repressed memory over the mystery corpse in the quarry which turned out to be Mr. Smithers' father (I can't believe I can remember this completely! But if you can picture an episode in it's entirety in your head then you know that it was something really special) It's episodes like these that flesh out the silly but loveable Simpsons universe and exceptionally touches our hearts.

Ever since the Simpsons have grown bigger and the episodes have become more extravagant and unrealistic, the universe the Simpsons had created for itself is broken. The Simpsons hasn't gone to shit, their approach to each episode has changed. That's why ""Steal this Episode"" still is a good episode, but not in the same right as the golden era episodes. There's probably plenty of holes in my argument (I sucked at high school English) but this is my sentiment as a viewer as to why I loved the show and why I don't enjoy the newer Simpsons.",0,1389008307,,0,1389076145,1,ceimnui,t3_1uir1t,t1_ceimnui,t1_ceikdfm,1431821517,491,FALSE,television,t5_2qh6e,491

This is one of those times where the modern media really fails us as football fans in explaining exactly what has happened at Manchester United.  I often complain that they focus too much on irrelevance and not enough on the actual business of football behind the scenes and this is an example of where it could have helped.

I'm not sure what anybody else was expecting here but Man United are right about where I thought they would be. I think they'll finish higher than this but their form is somewhat predictable.

United as a Club has completely fell apart and it is the job of David Moyes to rebuild it.  It has fell apart because the Club in the modern era was built entirely to Ferguson's exacting standards and methods.  Every single person in every department of the Club knew what they were doing every day and what the ultimate point was.

Clubs falling apart after the movement of a Czar isn't new. United fell apart after Busby left, Liverpool got worse the more contrived the boot room system became.  It's natural.  

I think United fans should remember the words of Ferguson before he left.  He's a proper football man, as is David Moyes, and they both know the scale of the task Moyes has undertaken and the time it will take to bear fruit.  United can either studiously water their crops over time to create a vast sustainable empire once again that will provide riches for generations or they can dump nuclear waste on their land and grow tomacco.

For me, the real test of the Glazers as owners starts today.  You can talk about money and whatever but to most people it's an irrelevance, United have been ultra successful and the manager has been given what he wanted.  So far so good for the Glazers.  The test starts right now because we discover whether they are the seasoned and patient businessmen that the Edwards family were or just another kneejerk bunch of twats who are sacking managers on ridiculous timescales.

I think Moyes has certainly made mistakes, or rather a single mistake.  I think he tried to transition too quickly from Ferguson's staff to his own staff in the first team which created unneccesary pressure on himself.  This can be forgiven however as I see what he was trying to accomplish.  He knew that this would be a difficult period of transition and he wants to snap it as quickly as possible rather than do it piece by piece.  Managers often do lack patience in transition, AVB had the same problem at Chelsea.  Funnily, Ferguson did the same mistake when he first joined too.

I see people who have called Moyes unambitious because he has said that United played well when they didn't.  This is a man who had a job for life in a stable Premier League team where he was beloved and he decided to pack that in and move to the most famous Club in the world and succeed the best ever manager in the game, to take on a rebuilding job the like of which has never been done in the modern era of football.  Unambitious?  Do me a favour.

You see, Manchester United was a club built in Ferguson's own image and everybody took their lead from him.  He was an imposing figure yet if you meet him he had this working class charm that made you want to fight for him.  David Moyes is a similar figure but doesn't yet covet the same respect and loyalty from everybody at Manchester United.  There's no possible way that he could, that anybody could, most of the people at United were directly employed by Ferguson or employed whilst he was the manager.  In time, Moyes will have the same respect bestowed on him, that's all that it needs at the minute, just some time for him to get his feet under the table.

Some fans believe that David Moyes isn't the man for United.  I challenge the idea that they even understand what United is as a Club.  David Moyes is pretty much the prototypical Manchester United manager, if you had to walk away and design a man who would manage them, it is him.  He's fierce, he's tactically well versed, he has a superhuman work ethic, he believes in youth promotion, he plays with wingers, he inspires loyalty and fight from everybody around him.  Those who don't see this have never been to Everton away under his tenure there.  Moyes managed to turn that place into a lion's den in how ferocious the atmosphere was and how the team played, and make no mistake this developed under him and will wane without him, managers have a major effect on atmospheres as any United fan will tell you (or City fan for that matter), he will do the same to Old Trafford given time.  

So I suppose the problem here is that fans have underestimated the mammoth of a task that Moyes has to accomplish and pundits have over-simplified it.  It will take Moyes several years to get United built in his own image and it will be better off for it rather than start some roundabout of managerial changes.  And I warn United fans, I'm a fan of a Club that has had probably 30 managers in the past 30 years.  Once you start down this path of swapping in and out managers, you can never come back from it.

One last thing to note.  I find it interesting how many people when this was announced said things like ""Moyes will need a transition time"" but have now decided that he should be gone in January.  Transition time is a term used to denote the time it takes to sweep away the mentality of the old regime and bring in your own mentality.  Essentially, how long it takes to forget the old manager and buy into the thoughts of the new even if it conflicts with what the old manager would say.  For a manager who casts the shadow of Ferguson, this will take 3 or 4 years, not 3 or 4 months.  Bobby Charlton, Alex Ferguson and others at United understand this so appointed a manager who can rebuild United and have the wide shoulders it requires to bear the load of expectation from the fans and media.  They think they found their right man in David Moyes and all piss taking aside, so do I.  I hope that they both fight his corner in the boardroom and I'm sure they will.  These people understand United as a Club, understand what makes it successful and understand what makes it special.  

Moyes will be fine if the fans just shut up and let him do his job.

TRUE,catmoon,,,"We need to stop conflating education and job training. They are really two separate things. 

Professional degrees and traditional college educations serve two different purposes. One gives a person a specific skillset for a trade, the other gives the person a broad understanding of history, philosophy, and art. The idea of a professional undergraduate degree really didn't come around until the Industrial Revolution.

Now we find ourselves in a situation where even liberal-minded people discourage others from pursuing interests in the arts or history because you won't be a useful worker bee without an engineering degree. You can't read an article about education without ""employers"" being quoted. 

Well, I have an engineering degree and I am often aghast at the educational background of my engineering peers. They missed out on history, art, and philosophy. Many brag to me that they don't even read books, as if that is something to be proud of. They are uneducated in my mind, skilled but uneducated. 

There can be great and terrible consequences to having capable people go so uneducated and I will always be on the side that encourages a broad education for all.

I saw your thread and I thought I'd post what information I can to help out. I lead a T5 coil group as a War OT, and I'll try my best to give you our run down for T4. We run T4 with a 2 Magical/2 Physical combination, but adjustments can be made for Knights and Soldiers with little recourse to overall raid DPS. This is by no means a flawless strategy, but it has been working for us for 2 months, even when replacing various DD with inexperienced members. 



**-P1-**



* OT pulls while MT conserves resources for P2.

* Tomahawk &gt; Heavy Swing &gt; Flash &gt; Maim &gt; Blood Weapon + Berserk &gt; Overpower til Pacification &gt; Keep wrath stacks + Maim refreshed til P2

*MT runs NW in last 10 seconds to anticipate P2



**-P2-**



* MT at NW location, OT at NE

* DPS Focus MT targets, then switch to OT targets.

* OT opens with Flash &gt; Heavy &gt; Flash &gt; Skull &gt; Flash &gt; Butchers on Soldier, then I lay my Storm's Path combo on the Knight for the 10% DMG reduction.

* OT uses any defensive abilities with CDs under 2 minutes. Generally I just use Featherfoot, Thrill of Battle and maybe a Foresight if I'm feeling nervous.

* OT pulls his Knight and Soldier from NE to N to avoid melee DD gaining passive aggro on spiders at the end of the phase.



**-P3-**



* MT grabs Dreadknight, all ranged/healers, as well as melee and OT stack directly behind DK to minimize the time it takes to feed the spiders.

* MT slowly kites DK from NW position to S position as DD pop all CDs and kill asap.

* OT keeps Storm's Path active, (will usually pop unchained during this point as well), but stays relatively conservative with his TP/MP.

* At 50 seconds into this phase you want to have roughly 50% TP remaining, with 5 wrath stacks available.

* At 50 seconds use Heavy Swing, then run to East-Central position to anticipate P4.



**-P4-**



* Skull Sunder + Focus Target first Rook.

* Run West-Central, Butcher's Block second Rook.

* Blood Weapon + Berserk + Overpower. Both Pox should be relatively synced, so just stand just anticipate and dodge when needed. 

* BRD should play Ballad during this phase, DD should AoE when possible with melee focus the Rooks.

* When both Rooks are dead, conserve TP while maintaining Wrath til end of phase.

* At 50 seconds left use Heavy Swing &gt; Skull Sunder and then run to mid, while MT runs NE.



**-P5-**



* DD Kill Knight/Solder &gt; DK

* Butcher's Block Knight in Center, Tomahawk &gt; Heavy Swing &gt; Flash &gt; Skull Sunder &gt; Flash on Soldier, then spread your single hate combo out between the two where enmity is required.

* OT must avoid using as many defensive CDs as possible in this phase! Holmgang if things go sour, as you won't need it in P6.

* DD and OT switch to DK when Soldier and Knight are dead. Apply Storm's Patch, while maintaining wrath stacks.

* At 50 seconds into P5 use Heavy Swing &gt; Skull Sunder, then run to mid.



**-P6-**



* Having everyone except MT stacked in center for the start of this phase is very helpful.

* MT picks up second DK ASAP.

* Butcher's Block the Knight, Tomahawk the Soldier, Overpower the Spiders.

* Take notice as to whether or not you have top enmity on the Rook, as you don't want to start kiting if you do.

* After Rook is dead all ranged and healers move to directly behind the two DKs, giving the OT room to kite in a circle rather than an arc.

* OT stagger all CDs while Kiting with Overpower. Vengeance &gt; Forsight &gt; Thrill of Battle &gt; Featherfoot + Covalescence.

* DD Focus P5 DK, then Knight/Soldier.

* When Knight and Soldier are dead OT feeds 2 spiders to last DK.

* Stack up, pop all offensive CDs. Healers spam AoE when enrage starts.

- NiP (Mimer, Malunoo, Bjergsen, Freeze, Deficio) lose in EU LCS playoffs to Gambit and ATn. Not only do they not qualify for Worlds but they also don't qualify for the EU LCS Spring Split in 2014.

- NiP releases Mimer.

- Rekkles finally turns 17 (swear that kid was 16 for 5 years) and finally becomes the starting ADC for Fnatic. While Rekkles was always under contract with Fnatic he was 'on loan' to Copenhagan Wolves for (approx) 6 months. He'd play in CW's Challenger team but wear a Fnatic jersey and play under the name 'FNC Rekkles'. 

- NiP adds Kev1n and hyrqbot from SK roster as starting toplaner and jungler respectively and Malunoo is demoted to substitute player. Kev1n comments that he wanted to join NiP and hyrqbot went with him because they're best mates etc.

- Freeze starts practicing with a so called 'EU super team' (Jwaow, Shook, Froggen, Freeze, EDward) but nothing really happens except a fuckton of reddit drama because nearly all the players are stuck in contracts. 

- Copenhagan Wolves jungler Shook leaves the team for 'an offer he can't refuse'. Team announces that soloqueue superstar Amazing (Diamondprox approved) will replace Shook as the new jungler and Greek superhero and occasional underwear model Forg1ven will replace Rekkles as the new ADC.

- NiP adds talented Danish ADC and former Lemondogs substitute MrRalleZ as their new substitute.

- NiP re-negotiates Freeze's contract and confirms he'll be on the team heading into 2014.

- SK Gaming announces it's roster as it heads into relegations, Fredy122 top, Svenskeren jungle, Jezis midlane, CandyPanda ADC and Nyph support. Nyph is announced as team captain and as the man responsible for building the team. ocelote steps down to substitute until the end of the year when he will leave the team.

- Bjergsen announces he's leaving NiP and TSM pay a huge release and transfer fee to get him playing in NA. Bjergsen then reaches Doublelift levels of fame and gets the adoring fans and Twitch revenue to match.

- NiP announces it has added Lemondogs players Nukeduck, Zorozero and Mithy to the NiP roster as midlane, toplane and support respectively. Nukeduck and co give up their guaranteed LCS spot in the pursuit of more money (NiP are a richer organisation than Lemondogs) and a better infrastructure (NiP actually have a gaming house whereas LD had it's players living in a hotel practicing in ESL studios.

- NiP releases Kev1n from his contract and 'helps him join a new LCS team'. Current NiP roster consists of Zorozero top, hyrqbot jungle, Nukeduck midlane, Freeze ADC and Mithy support.

- EDward rejoins Gambit.

- CLG (trying out TrickZ for the jungle role and Aphromoo for the support role), Cloud 9, Fnatic and Gambit battle it out in the 'pro tournament' at IEM Cologne. Rekkles and Liftlift reignite their rivalry with trash talk and Fnatic fans breath a sign of relief as Fnatic win the series 2 - 1, CLG fans seem happy with the score as well (1 round is better than 0) and [Rekkles and Doublelift hug it out](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BWRA5Ax1Mc) and Rekkles says Doublelift is a big hero of his (d'awwww).

- Cloud 9 get stomped by Gambit 2 - 0. Highlights include Meteos doing Red while Gambit shove 2 turrets and Darien building AP on Shyvana. Gambit then crush Fnatic 2 - 0 and no one really cares cause Fnatic fans are just happy they didn't lose to CLG and win the whole tournament, yey! Reddit instantly proclaims that Gambit are the best team in Europe and with EDward Gambit would've likely crushed those noob Koreans in the Doujin Pink Shovel.

- NiP, SK and CW battle it out in the 'amateur tournament' at IEM Cologne. CW fails to lose a single game and (obviously) wins the whole event, NiP panic and withdraw from Dreamhack Winter and all online events they were scheduled to appear in and give 'we need to practice as much as possible' as the reasoning.

- SK attend Dreamhack Winter alongside a Polish team called KMT (also qualified for the EU LCS offline qualifiers). They look pretty terrible through but, thankfully, their opponents are a bunch of amatuer HoN players so they make it to finals with a few 2 - 1 victories. They then lose a decisive game 1 to KMT and are about to lose game 2 until KMT pull of a huge throw and SK seemingly wake up and start playing well in game 3 as they win the event. (Funfact: This was the first LAN 1st place in the history of any SK LoL team). 

- Tabzz joins Alliance alongside Wickd (top), Shook (jungle), Froggen (mid) and Kazmitch (temporary support player). Alliance takes over EG's spot in the EU LCS (both Alliance and EG are owned by the same guy Alex Garfield, EG is generally seen as the NA brand and Alliance as the EU brand).

- ATn announce that Kev1n has joined them as their new toplaner and that Kerp (Krepo's German evil trackball mouse using twin) will be moving from toplane to midlane, everyone says goodbye to the Eloking of old ForrellenLord and a few cranky redditors celebrate that casters can't continue to beat that nickname to death anymore. 

- The remaining 3 EG members (Krepo, Snoopeh and Yellowpete) move to NA, buy out Velocity's LCS relegation spot and pick up NA rookies Innox (top) and Pobelter (mid) with the aim of competing in the NA LCS.  

- Former Lemondogs jungler Dexter leaves the organisation and announces he's temporarily moving to NA to try out as the starting jungler for CLG.

- Lemondogs announces it's new roster, Myw top, ImSoFresh jungle, Shylaya mid, CrazyCaps ADC and Zeriouz support. Fans give them the affectionate nicknames: who, that toxic wanker, that Frenchie, who and who respectively.

- CW beating MYM 3 - 1 and qualify for the EU LCS!

- Alliance crushes Team Dignitas in an NA vs. EU showmatch and everyone declares Alliance as the greatest team in Europe. Meanwhile SK beat Supa Hot Crew XD (not related to XD.GG) in a very tense and exciting series 3 - 2 and re qualify for the EU LCS!

- Bjergsen's debut with TSM is against the new Lemondogs lineup and, unsurprisingly, Lemondogs get brutally fisted for an hour and a half. Highlights include: ImSoFresh counterjungling the enemy Wraiths with Amumu while TSM push down 2 turrets (\#worth), Bjergsen doing a Faker impression and 1v3ing LD with LeBlanc and ImSoFresh getting fed on Vi and proceeding to build Full Damage (Cyanide commented *'that build was so soloqueue not even soloqueue does it'*).

- EU Redditors demands Lemondogs heads on a stick as is tradition when an European team loses to an NA team (good thing it doesn't happen often).

- NiP loses in a huge upset to Polish team 'KMT' 3 - 0 and fails to qualify for the LCS. All NiP members played terribly and were, as you'd expect, ridiculed for it relentlessly by Reddit. 

- Some intelligent, witty and (no doubt) handsome redditer posts a post called [*'I have collected evidence showing that NiP intends to buy LD's LCS spot'*](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1t05o1/speculation_i_have_collected_evidence_showing_nip/) which does what it says on the tin. More shitstorm from Reddit follows.

- EG qualify for the NA LCS in a dominating 3 - 0, Gambit beat XXDG.XD 2 - 0 in a very trollish manner (Amumu support, Warwick top) and ATn beat CLG (in an actually decently close) 2 - 0. Fnatic then go full retard and lose to Cloud 9 2 - 0, highlights include Renekton mid, Hai crushing on Kassadin and xPeke trying to move Kassadin and realizing he's actually a Renekton. NA fans go back to calling Meteos 'the best jungler in the world' and all is right with the world.

- Some NA teams beat some other NA teams and qualify for the NA LCS (I wasn't paying attention to be honest). I do know that one team had a black guy (like actually black, not that sort of black that Aphromoo is) in it who played Lucian a bit and roleplayed as Lucian in the trash talk intro vid and he had an Asian duolane partner, [they even won a super serious and not all parody award.](http://esportsexpress.com/2014/01/esex-lol-awards-2013/)

The other things which need the said attention and funds are more of an operations problem than of finance. Our Mars mission cost a fifth of what a planned 'Statue of Unity' is going to cost. NASA's projected budget for 2013 is about $ 18 Billion, which will approximately be 0.5% of the total US budget. ISRO's allotted budget for fiscal year 2013-14 is $ 950 Million, almost 19 times less, and is about 0.33% of the total Indian budget. So, no, ISRO is not taking a bite out of the poor and hungry Indian's pie. In fact, through its remote sensing and communication programs (IRS and INSAT), we are only helping build an essential infrastructure for the country. Then, there is disaster management: we saved millions (of lives and dollars, both) by being well prepared for the cyclone Phailin. That is where maintaining cutting edge technological capability through R &amp; D pays!

1. The probe was interactive. While I always stress that it was  NOT a dream -- these memories were permanently imbedded -- the Nucleonic beam functioned like lucid dreaming. Picard's own mind filled in a lot of the blanks. 

2. The Kataanians wanted him to ""walk a mile in their shoes"" -- but that required neither marriage nor kids. Picard secretly missed having a family. That was elucidated very subtly in the Writers Draft of ""IL"" in the original Captain's Log I wrote, which the producers eliminated.

3. Yes, the scientist on the team that created the nucleonic beam played the role of ""Eline."" But, if Picard had been gay, she probably would have appeared as a friend or roommate or fellow council member, not a wife. The Beam had that much leeway, depending on Picard's subconscious.

4. Remember, the Probe sought HIM out. Not Picard specifically, but ""one man good and true,"" Green Lantern style. If Kataan was a very family-centric community, maybe it looked for someone with a subconscious that wold go that way.

There would have been a lot of difficulties. If Hitler had started to conquer Switzerland the Swiss army had the plan of going into the Réduit. This was basically giving up a large part of the country and going to hiding in the mountains. Sounds maybe stupid (giving up all your cities) but the strategically most important part of Switzerland are all the passes over and the tunnels going through the mountains (e.g. [the Gotthard tunnel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gotthard_Tunnel)) These are very important passages to travel north - south in Europe. By hiding in bunkers throughout the Alps we could have still guarded these passages.

And to add to that there were plans to destroy these tunnels which would have basically made any conquering more or less meaningless.

Also it is rather difficult to fight an enemy in the mountains especially when that is their home territory. 

The next point is that the axis powers wouldn't have gained that much from conquering Switzerland as they didn't really depend on having those geographical points. 

Also noting the Swiss military was at that time quite large (proportional to the number of citizens) which has to do with our military system (every man has to do military service and is in sort of reserve after that service so if we would mobilize we could effectively more than double our numbers in rather a short time.)

And the last point (which some Swiss people dislike to admit) is that we also held diplomatic relations with all sides of the war. We did hold a lot of the money of all contenders and we also didn't (at least openly) support either side of the war. So no party had a reason to attack us. Last thing was that we also really held ourselves out of the war and just secured our country. Even though some of our cities were bombed we didn't threaten anyone nor did we declare war. 

Add to that that we have always been rather a bit ~~isolationist~~ non-interventionist (like not joining any big country groups or alliances and thus didn't have any reason nor obligation to join the war.

I have to say I cannot guarantee that this is all 100% correct. I'm Swiss and this is also a topic that interests me a lot. And I've also discussed this a lot of times before. 

 I also have some other reasons but for those I'm really not sure if they are just speculation or have valid proof so I'll leave them out.

TRUE,klaviersonic,,,"As someone who has studied a lot of theory, from 16th C. Counterpoint to the analytic writings of Heinrich Schenker and Hugo Riemann, I would say that most of what you need to know about ""theory"" is the most practical application of it. I think a lot of beginners confuse ""theory"" with basic musical vocabulary. Understanding what the Lydian Mode is and how it relates to a Major 7th chord is not theory, it's a prerequisite to basic musical understanding! Theory is when you're able to separate the middle and deep structure from the surface musical events, which is useful when unraveling the multiple layers holding Beethoven's Eroica Symphony together, but probably a lot less useful for somebody trying to compose a symphony (or a dance track) as a personal expression or artistic statement.

A lot of Theorists were on track to becoming decent composers before falling down the rabbit hole of ""advanced theory."" Now they spend their time obsessing over pitch-class transformations, but can barely harmonize a pop tune and certainly would lack the pure melodic artistry of a W.A. Mozart or a Bob Dylan.

What most musicians want to gain from theory is an intuitive grasp of how to write a sweet tune, or a funky bass line, and harmonize it with sexy voluptuous chords, or how to improvise a solo over chord changes, creating an emotional progression, and telling a story. To do this, a basic understanding of the IV-V-I chords in every Major and Minor key is the bare necessity, but obviously not the key to opening up the entire art of music to anybody. The foundation has to be there though, and it's not a theoretical task. 

Get to the keyboard everyday, play the V7-I in every Major Key, and the V7-i in every Minor Key, around the Circle of Fifths. Be able to write the same progression on paper in every key, with the key signatures written out. This is the Karate Kid Wax-on/Wax-off boring chore that needs to become subconscious for it to work. If you take more than a split second to figure out the Dominant of A-flat Minor, you haven't mastered the basics yet. Once you do though, understanding Chord-Mode/Scale relationships, extended/altered chords, and progressions/substitutions/reharmonizations will come really easily.

Some resources I've found helpful:

http://danadler.com/misc/Cycles.pdf //Scale-Cycles &amp; ""Giant Steps""


Even all this won't prepare one to actually write a simple melody really well, or to write multiple lines that interact harmonically while being beautiful melodies separately. You have to use your ears, study intensively the music you like, and tons of music outside of the particular genres you're comfortable with. Little stylistic nuances separate an authentic passionate expression from a stiff academic imitation. There's a world of artistry in connecting a handful of tones together, that all the theory in the world is lacking to fulfill. Transcribe as much as you can, this is the best teacher, and the way music has always been taught. J.S. Bach never studied harmony in the academic way it's taught today. He sang in the boys chorus, played the violin, developing a sense of pitch and harmony. He transcribed numerous concerti by Vivaldi and Marcello, acquiring a feel for stylistic gestures and musical language. He walked 250 miles to meet the greatest organist in the world, Buxtehude, and directly absorbed the technique and history of keyboard performance and baroque improvisation through him.

About a week in I find a body of a cray fish that I assumed died in the night, so I went outside and buried it in the court yard, gave it an honourable send of.

I get back to the tank and see that there are still 6 cray fish, and I distinctly remember that I only had 6, and 6-1=5. So I shrugged it off and just assumed I miss counted in the beginning.

Come the next few days and I find at least 4 more bodies, but there are still 6 live crayfish in the tank, I assume that I have lost my mind and spend countless hours awake trying to figure out what the fucking fuck is going on, theres no way that they can have babies that grow up that fast, my friends aren't sad enough to keep buying more and putting them in when 1 dies (OR ARE THEY?!?) So I strongly believe that I have lost my mind/I own Satan's fish and this honestly ruined me, I just could not find a logical answer and it was driving me insane.

TRUE,LowkoTV,,,"For anyone on mobile data or whatever, wondering what the video is about!

In this video I cover a relatively easy build order for new or returning Zerg players for StarCraft 2: Heart of the Swarm. This build order is easy to execute after a few hours of practice. It will allow you to beat your opponents.

Maybe you have completed the single player, maybe you have 1000 games logged and can’t get out of silver, but either way, I expect that you know how the race works and how the other races work. You need to know the basics of the game, such as the importance of Queen injects.

In this video I will cover a +1 Missles Attack, Glial Reconstitituion timing attack: A Roach Timing push. But before we make any Roaches, we will try to get a max saturation on 2 bases with a total of 41 Drones (16 + 16 on Minerals and 3 + 3 + 3 on Gas). The early game defence will be done by Queens, 4 of them. After we get all necessary upgrades going, the Lair is done, the Drones are out and the Queen injects are hit we start pumping out Roaches until we hit the timing of around 110 supply at the 9:30 in game minute mark.

The build order:

- 14 Spawning Pool

- 15 Hatchery

- 15 Queen

- 17 Overlord

- 2x Zerglings

- @First Queen: Second Queen

- @Natural Hatchery: Third Queen

- @Second Queen: 4th Queen

- 5:00 Double Extractor

- 100 Gas: Lair + Evolution Chamber

- A little bit later: Roach Warren + 3rd Extractor

- @Evo Chamber: +1 Missles Attack

- @Lair: Glial Reconstitution (Roach Speed)

- At max saturation (32 on Minerals and 9 on Gas), make as many Roaches as possible.

- Push at Roach Speed and +1 Missles Attack.

It’s quite easy to practice a build order, but what you don’t want to do is jump into a game of StarCraft 2 blindly. Make sure to practice this a few times before executing it versus a real opponent. Maybe you need 100 custom practice games, maybe you need 5, but either way: Practice before laddering. Because you will get frustrated otherwise. And frustration sucks!

TRUE,oneanddoneforfun,,,"I just want to preface this with a disclaimer: This is MY approach, which has been exceedingly successful in enriching my life with the company of amazing, attractive and worthwhile women. While your results may vary based on environment, execution and other variables, this is not so much about how you do it as why you do it, and your general attitude concerning personal interactions with people you find interesting.

Perhaps the most important position to adopt is not to be too deterministic about approaching strangers. Approaching a stranger with dating/sex as your primary motivator is putting the cart before the horse a bit. Your first motivation should be simply to interact successfully. That means just being good company and enjoying good company for their own sake. That nervousness you feel when approaching a woman, that you don't feel when you talk to a guy? That's what I'm talking about.

The people who find cold approaches most easy and successful are people who are simply happy to be good company to anyone they talk to, male or female. This general air of friendliness and approachability bypasses the ""salesman awareness"" we all have (the feeling that triggers, for instance, when you get a phone call and you KNOW they're trying to sell you something, and you just want them to go away). It's ""I'm not asking anything from you but some pleasant conversation, and I'm not offering anything more than that either (at this point)."" When your goal is simply good company, if all you get out of your interaction is some pleasant conversation with an attractive person, you're still WAY ahead, and you don't feel defeated or terrible about yourself when it doesn't go well. You just roll on to the next pleasant conversation with the next attractive person, rather than feel like you just blew your shot with ""the one."" When you lower the stakes, you risk less and still get the enjoyment of the game, and it's a lot easier for a woman to reject your approach if she thinks you're just trying to fuck her or con her into a date (which is often just pretext for trying to fuck her).

This shift in objective gives you time to determine if this person is someone you actually WANT to know more about, and I promise you that anyone worth having is going to appreciate that opportunity to do the same. You'll find that, in many cases, the person you cold-approach ends up having nothing going on, or raising red flags that you'll be glad you gave her time to reveal before you took it further. We're not talking about a half-hour here-- If you can find a way to keep her attention for five minutes or more, you usually have a LOT more usable information about her suitability than if you just said something nice about her hair and gave her your number.

If you find, after a comfortable amount of chit-chat, that she's worth your time, don't overstay your welcome. Find a natural reason to take off while there's still a little momentum in the discourse (usually looking at the time and saying ""Oh, damn, I've got to run"" will do the trick), and suggest some means of non-invasive interaction. A phone number is fine, but email is perfectly good too. Just some way of communicating that you enjoyed your chat and would like to continue the interaction later when you've both got time. If she gives you a phone number, text her right there and then. If it's a fake, you know right away and save yourself a lot of hassle. If it's not, now she has YOUR number and the door is open for HER to initiate further contact at her convenience.

Overall, this advice is only useful if you're looking for the company of a worthwhile person that could potentially become an ongoing dating/relationship situation. If you're just looking to get laid, you might find that cold-approaching outside of situations that advance that agenda (clubs, bars, etc) is going to produce mixed results (and invite a lot of chaos and crazy drama into your life).

In any case, good luck. :)

TL;DR: The world doesn't need another pick-up technician, but it definitely needs more good company. Be good company. People like good company. After that, the rest handles itself.",0,1389028935,,0,1389030560,1,ceis9ro,t3_1uj7kq,t1_ceis9ro,t1_ceio2nv,1431824219,170,FALSE,socialskills,t5_2r275,170
TRUE,KillerHoggle,,,"**Edit: I know this is a controversial topic and a lot of people will disagree with me, but please consider, rather than downvoting it would be better if we could discuss this. Downvoting just hides it and prevents debate, where we'd be better off discussing how we can get past this system or improve it rather than just trying to censor opinions we disagree with.**    


I'll probably be downvoted to hell for this, but I can kinda see where the /r/funny mods are coming from. The subreddit is for funny pictures or funny text stories. Stand up shots are basically funny stories or jokes pasted next to a picture of the comedian. For /r/funny, they'd probably prefer that be a text post because otherwise people will just copy all text into a picture format to get karma from jokes. So if it was a funny picture where the picture itself had content and the text was related to it, they'd probably allow it. But I imagine with the case of stand up shots, seeing a load of text with some random, non related picture (apart from it being the person who said it), would seem like an excuse to get karma rather than share the content which could be shared in a self post.    


I noticed in the /r/funny sidebar this rule:    

6. No Pictures of just text	Make a self post instead.     


Which kind of backs up the point I'm trying to make about /r/funny moderators logic. Althought a stand up shot isn't a picture of just text, it's a picture of just text with a persons face next to it, which doesn't really add anything to the text.    

The whole point made about webcomics, in my opinion, doesn't make much sense since in webcomics the actual comic is picture content and submitting it as a link makes sense. Often in webcomics the text itself doesn't work and the pictures help add to the humour. Stand up shots are completely different from webcomics and comparing the two is nonsense. One relies on pictures for the joke, the other is just a joke with a picture added for the sake of it.    


As far as I can see from the rules of /r/funny, there's no rule against submitting a joke that would be in the form of a picture in /r/standupshots but submitting it to /r/funny in text format in the form of a self post. This will allow you to share the content all the same but also prevents people just turning funny stories into jpgs for karma.      


Also, /r/funny does help advertise /r/standupshots in it's sidebar in the very rule section where they mention stand up shots aren't allowed.    
 

Sorry if you disagree with me or feel I'm wrong. I am a fan of stand up shots and a subscriber here, and have been for a long time. I just feel that a lot of the points in this image are misaddressed and the confusion stems from the reasoning behind the banning of stand up shots; it would seem the /r/funny mods are doing it to stop the very karma whores and power users OP here seems to be against himself. /r/standupshots is one of the few subreddits which encourages posting text based content in the form of a link post, allowing the user to gather karma for text content. Whether that's good or bad is up to debate but the /r/funny mods decided they didn't want people to use that system in their subreddit in case of abuse and I think that should be respected.

TRUE,youwillbefineandhapp,,,"My biggest piece of advice is quit researching about DP/DR or any mental health disorders while you are in the process of healing. You need to isolate your life and put yourself in a position where you are living the notions of a healthy individual and the person you want to be. 

1) Don't start diagnosing yourself with anything(I self diagnosed with brain cancer, schizophrenia, Alzheimer, and almost anything you can imagine!). You are not sick and you can be cured. You are not suffering from any incurable disease. I've walked your shoes. I was so numb I couldn't cry when I wanted to. I was so lost I didn't know the people I was looking at anymore. My life was a blur and I thought I was a lost cause. I wasn't and am not a lost cause! I'm happy! I smile now! I laugh at how I lived this experience for such a long time and it's over!

2) There isn't a thought you have thought that isn't normal. You think you are just over analyzing and over thinking everything but it's actually normal. You might think some things you think are sick and twisted but it's not. You don't have to answer the bad questions you may ask yourself or the terrible thoughts that might go through your head. It's normal. You anxiety is the root of all of this. You have to slowly instill thoughts of positive thinking. I'll be honest...it's hard but you can do it. I thought I couldn't but I did and slowly I noticed myself not thinking the negative questions as much and slowly I was thinking less and less bad and more and more positive. 

3) Remind yourself that this is just a phase that will pass. This is just a bad day, week, month, or year. This doesn't last forever. You are rock bottom and things will only move up from now on. Today is better than yesterday, this week is better than last week and so on. Put in a CD that brings you to a time you really enjoyed in your life. Put on a movie that was amazing. It'll seem a little weird watching it now but you'll find it refreshing to get a feeling of something bringing you back to a place you enjoyed. If you experience anxiety because of it remember this is just your anxiety controlling you.

I personally believe anxiety is the root to all of this. You become so attached to anxiety that you live your life in it. You detach from everything because you fear to not fear. I know it sounds ridiculous but from my 5 years of DP/DR that is what I have learned. I learned to control my anxiety and when I started doing that I noticed improvement. I didn't ""cure"" my anxiety but I realized once I didn't let it eat me away I no longer suffered from this anymore. Everyone of you may have a different way of coping with anxiety but my advice to myself was to take my anxiety head on and force myself to feel it.

TRUE,Synarus,,,"My mom always tells this crazy story from her many days flying first class.

Two years ago she was on a plane that had just boarded and was sitting on the tarmac about to pull away from the gate. Sitting next to my mom was a typical business guy asshat who was on a phone call yelling at someone on the other end. A very nice flight attended comes over, leans over my mom and says ""Sir, you're going to have to turn the phone off, the cabin doors are closed."" (Of course if this was economy class she would have been more forceful, but she gives him a small warning) 

The guy quiets down but he does not get off his phone. At this point the flight attendants are doing the safety protocol speech as the plane backs up and all of the sudden the guy starts yelling again on the phone. Another flight attendent, this time more forceful tells him to turn off the phone. The man turns to her and says ""Fuck you."" She gives this 'humph' face and then turns and goes out of sight.

It is at this point of the story that my mom reminds everyone listening that many pilots are veterans, they are military men and do not take that type of crap from asshats. My mom hears a door slam open and out of the cockpit comes the pilot. He is so angry you can see the veins on his face. His eyes bulge as he yells in rage, ""WHAT DID YOU SAY TO HER?!!? This is my aircraft and in case of an emergency I expect every passenger to follow the commands of my air staff. You disrespecting her, disrespects me and puts every person on this plane at risk!""

The asshat now being borne down upon by this massive angry ex-soldier cowers, puts away his phone and stammers an apology. Without missing a beat the pilot continues ""You can take your sorry and shove it! You are not going anywhere! It is a federal crime to disobey an order from your air crew and you can tell whoever was so gawd-damn important on the other end of the phone call that fact after you talk to TSA."" The pilot goes back into the cockpit, pulls the plane back to the gate. Some uniformed police come in and take the guy off.

Dead silence on the plane. As my mom always closes the story, ""As god is my witness, everyone in unison takes out their phone, waves it in the air and shows that it is clearly in the off position,"" just like the ""tickets"" scene from Indiana Jones.

TLDR: You mess with the flight attendant and you mess with a pissed off pilot.

TRUE,maleslp,,,"Hi. Speech-Language Pathologist here. I believe what OP is referring to is called a speech sound disorder. It's one of the more common ""articulation"" disorders found in children when they're developing their sound systems. What (I think) OP is referring to is technically called ""gliding,"" as both [r] and [w] sounds are considered liquids and glides, respectively. The [r] sound (a liquid) is substituted for a glide (the [w] sound), hence the name. [Here](http://calleteach.wordpress.com/2010/01/10/sounds-of-english-nasals-liquids-glides/) is a quick rundown on what liquids and glides are (and nasals too if anyone wants extra-credit).

There are a lot of theories, but essentially we don't really know what causes these sorts of disorders. Many believe it's a neurological ""cross-wiring"" when the sounds are developing in children's brains, others believe it's bad habit, and some would attribute it to other things such as hearing difficulty (if you can't hear the sound well, it's hard to produce - think of a deaf person speaking) or other disorders such as autism spectrum disorders.

[Here](http://www.asha.org/public/speech/disorders/speechsounddisorders/) is a quick guide to speech sound disorders from ASHA, the American Speech-Language Hearing Association for an official, non-ELI5 guide.

EDIT: Just to be clear - if a child has a speech-sound disorder it DOES NOT mean that they have a hearing loss or autism. Often, if a child DOES have a hearing loss or some other type of disorder, a speech-sound disorder can also be found in the child. That is also why when I (or any speech-pathologist should, really) am performing an initial diagnostic on a child, I will make sure hearing is OK and do a family interview for any other speech/language related disorders in the family history (among other things which I won't go into here). It could be a symptom of a larger problem, but it may be isolated - you always want to check.

You either are one of these or you are not which is the opposite of how most are using them here.    

IF we are talking solely about diets this gets even more simple.   
 -Veganism is the practice of abstaining from all animal products.    
  -Vegetarianism is the practice of abstaining from the consumption of meat (red meat, poultry, seafood, etc and the flesh of any other animal)    
- Pescetarianism is the practice of a diet that includes seafood, but not the flesh of other animals.  
  
You CAN NOT be a vegan if you use any animal products in your diet.   
 You CAN NOT be a vegetarian if you eat any meat in your diet.    
You CAN NOT be a pescetarian if you eat any meat that is not fish.  
  
To call yourself any of these when you don't follow them, or because you don't like to have to explain yourself, is wrong and lazy.  You are just doing a disservice to those who actually define themselves correctly.  
  
""I'm a vegetarian that eats fish"" is not possible and only further confuses those who aren't educated on the subject.  Saying ""My diet is similar to that of a vegetarian but I eat fish"" would be a much better answer or statement.

This was in the late 1970s.  I was seated on a plane when a *very* young girl, maybe 5 at the most, was flying unaccompanied. She was escorted to her seat by her grandparents who were loving and kissing her goodbye. They nestled a padded cooler under her feet and said goodbye, crying and holding tissues to their eyes.  She was returning from a visit and on her way back home from Maryland to California.  

The attendants checked on her regularly and she was so quiet and well behaved.  But she kept unbuckling her belt to bend down and unzip the cooler and check inside.  She seemed to be getting more distressed as the flight from Maryland to California progressed.  I finally asked her ""do you have a pet mouse in there?"" with a smile ""...or maybe a rabbit?""

She looked up at me and her eyes welled up with tears.  ""No it's Maryland crab cakes.""  Then she burst into tears.   ""Mommy said to bring home Maryland crab cakes so nana packed them.  Mommy told me to not lose the crab cakes or she'd spank me forever.  What if someone takes my crab cakes?""  She just just started to sob.  ""I can't lose the crab cakes.  I can'ttttttttttt lose the crab cakessssssssssss.""

The passenger ahead of her was a good-old-boy used car salesman type who turned around and said ""Shaddup KID.""

I was so heartbroken for this kid who felt such pressure to deliver mom's precious cargo to her.  I said ""Let's lock them up with a magic key.""  We zipped up the cooler case, the I made as if I was locking it.  I put my invisible key inside her pocket.  ""There.  no one can take your crab cakes.  Now you can take a nap or read if you like.""   She said ""Okay.   You have to watch them for me also.""  I said ""You bet.""

Once we landed and she was escorted off the plane by the attendant, her mother was waiting for her in the gate.  She took the cooler from the girl and said ""Come on.""  Mom turned around and walked ahead of the girl, carrying the cooler and she didn't take the girl's hand or anything.  

The girl was ahead of me several paces and turned around and waved at me as she followed her crab cake delivery.

I think about her constantly. She's an adult now and I hope she is happy.

TRUE,OGLothar,cust ielift,98% Chimp,"This does not directly address your question, but may be of some use anyhow. I did some cooking, testing and weiging of bacon because I didn't like the stats on the back of the bacon packet (they don't account for cooking). 

So here's something I posted in /r/keto a year or so: 

All the MyFitnessPal entries seem to be about the same. About 200 calories or more from two slices of bacon, and a lot of that being fat.

So, I cooked up four slices of bacon, weighed them before and after and came up with the following:

They started out at 118 grams, ended up at 38 grams cooked (medium crispy, not brittle) and lost a total of 35 grams of fat that I poured out of the pan and weighed. [3] Yummy 

According to normal raw bacon stats you might think you're eating about 450-500 calories each time you eat 4 slices of bacon, when in fact it's more like 145 (in this case).

This might help some of you if you're actually counting calories (as I am, trying to stay at 2800 in a weightlifting program).

I was horrified when I realized I was limiting my potential bacon intake on a vicious lie. Of course, if you're eating your bacon totally raw, disregard all this, my Inuit friends.

For those of you that this might help, I entered this into the MFP database as "" Compliments Sobey's Maple Bacon (after cooking)"" - do your own tests, but these stats should be close enough to most store bacon brands. Certainly closer than the raw stats are.

Happy baconing.

Packed movie theater, my SO and I got seats toward the front so we could sit in the middle and not be surrounded by people. The trailers hadn't started yet and our row was one of three or four that was empty. Prospects looked good. 

Then, a gaggle of pre-teen girls show up and sit down a few seats over next to us. They're laughing and talking really loudly. One of the girls brought their parents and they didn't seem to mind the obnoxiousness. So I'm thinking to myself: this is gonna suck. They're giggling at every tiny thing in the trailers, and literally every other line that an actor says is repeated in a stupid voice and followed by giggles. Ugh.

And it did suck. I didn't think it was possible to giggle at every single moment during a mostly serious adventure movie, but they sure fucking did it. I got to the point where I had to Shh them. I couldn't take it anymore. Is anyone reading this surprised that my sshh'ing did absolutely nothing? They stared at me and kept talking. Not bothering to whisper at all. 

Honestly I'm surprised I was the only one, as the people behind us just have been irritated but were silent. Whatever. 

The movie ends and I'm pissed as ever. It literally was my worst experience in a movie theater (even worse than when I went to opening night Harry Potter 8 and the same thing happened- not as bad though.)

My SO took me to Coldstone and treated me to some icecream because you could basically see the steam coming out of my ears. Guess who walked in after us? The fucking preteens. They recognized me immediately and obnoxiously and loudly shushed me in the crowded ice cream shop. My face was so red. 

It was worse when I had to walk by them and they bombarded me with almost yelling shushes, which I didn't know was possible. I said ""fuck off"" and spent the rest of the night regretting not talking to their parents or having them thrown out of the theater. Next time? I'll give you one fucking shush to shut up and I'm talking to the manager. You're not there to talk, you're there to shut up and watch the movie. 

If you wanna giggle and repeat every sentence and be obnoxious, don't go to the movie theater and act surprised when people want you to shut your trap. There are few things that piss me off more than people who can't be courteous to others enough to sit silently through a movie. 

Tl;dr: I don't go to PG-13 movies anymore because people are shitfaces

TRUE,layinbrix,,,"The real lingering issue in this article is a conflicting interest between the small-scale 'natural' farmer/rancher and the large scale livestock producer.  These check-off and marketing order programs were established to bring market power to an industry that previously had none.  The majority of ranchers aren't producing a value-added animal (i.e. grass-fed, or no hormone added livestock) so when they go to sell their cattle at auction they get whatever price is being offered by the packer.  Ranchers are close to the bottom of the derived demand chain; beef consumers decide how much product they want, beef retailers decide how much they need to buy from the packer, packer decides how much they need to buy from the rancher. The auction is where cattle producers are given a price to take, it's the free market in action. 

If a company wants to boost sales of its product, it advertises.  The typical rancher selling cattle at auction won't benefit from advertising because they don't have a differentiated product to promote.  This is why the National Cattleman's Beef Association exists, they are a government sponsored program to boost industry level demand for a specific product.  The check-off program is subsidized by the government, and the $1 per head of cattle sold is mandatory, because if it weren't free riders would create a market failure.  Nobody would voluntarily pay in, but everyone would enjoy the reward. 

The NCBA isn't run by your typical industry lobbyists, it's run by ranchers, just like how any other check-off program is ran by a group of the industry producers. Small scale hobby farmer/ranchers, although growing in market share, aren't even close to the majority of U.S. livestock producers.  NCBA focuses on the issues they believe are important to the majority of the cattle industry; they're focused on profit and efficiency.

TRUE,jerf,,,"Haskell has a thing very like Go interfaces called Typeclasses. One of the big differences is that the typeclass can declare a class as one of the incoming parameters, and then use that ""same"" type as an outgoing parameter [1]. In Go terms, it's as if you can write this:

     type Num interface {
         func add (value SOMETYPE) SOMETYPE
     }

Where ""SOMETYPE"" is actually a variable ""type"" itself, not a type with that name, and then implement it as:

    type myint32 int32
    func (l myint32) Neg (r myint32) myint32 {
        return l + r
    }

    type myint64 int64
    func (l myint64) Neg (r myint64) myint64 {
        return l + r
    }

and then use it:

    func test () {
        var a32, b32 myint32
        var a64, b64 myint64

        fmt.Printf(""%T %T"", a32.Add(b32), a64.Add(b64))
    }

and have everything typecheck out, with the final Printf yielding ""myint32 myint64"".

Thus,

    abs :: Num a =&gt; a -&gt; a
    abs a = if a &lt; 0 then -a else a

Translates to: ""The abs function takes something that implements Num called 'a', and is then a function that takes in a value of that type and returns a value of that type."" That could be a 32-bit Int, in which case you get a 32-bit Int back, or an arbitrary-sized Integer, or anything.

In fact you can't get ""null"" or anything like ""null"" out of that function in Haskell. (At least not without contriving a fake example, and it still wouldn't be a ""null pointer"".) You can't pass anything in that doesn't implement Num; the compiler won't let you, just as Go won't let you pass a value to a function expecting an interface that doesn't implement that interface.

I haven't spent enough time on it to be sure, and I'm not sure this would work, but I've been tossing around the idea of trying to figure out how to make this Go-ic enough to work in Go, too. I haven't had the time to really sit down and hammer through the problem to see if it can be made to work. It certainly doesn't just come right over, I'm not yet convinced there's nothing that can be done, though.

(Also, incidentally, that code is buggy. ""&lt;"", less than, is not part of the Num interface. For that you need ""Ord"", which is Orderable. In the actual [Num interface that ships with Haskell](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.6.0.1/docs/Prelude.html#g:7), ""abs"" is actually one of the elements of the typeclass itself. This example doesn't actually compile.)

Just to make sure we get into two more chases later in the month but used my friends car and it couldn't keep up. About 6 months later I get pulled over by a cop and he asks to search my car because it matches the description of someone impersonating a police officer trying to pull over a newspaper delivery woman.

I went through a similar experience several years ago, and I think you can add more to it.

Isolate yourself in this pursuit and give it enough time and you will find yourself not just happy, but satiated. And if you're lucky like I was, you'll hear from her again. You'll see that her cheating wasn't because of any unhappiness with you, but with unhappiness with her self. You'll hear all about how her life has fallen apart without you. She'll start to cry as she tells you that her mother's health is failing, but her mom even insists that you were good for her. And as her heart bleeds into your hands, and you remember the familiar happiness that you've shared, you can tell her to eat a bag of dicks and hang up on her because you've found so much more.

TRUE,O_is_for_Olive,,,"My husband flies a lot for work (he makes Delta Diamond every year), so he's got a ton of crazy stories about insane passengers; the most recent and ridiculous, however, took place on a trip back from Hawaii.

While he's waiting to board the plane, he's noticing a distinct smell of body odor.  He's doing the whole ""wait, shit, is that me?"" panic, trying to surreptitiously sniff his own armpits, when he notices that a bunch of the other people waiting are all doing the exact same thing.  Figuring that it's either someone else, or that there are, like, a stockpile of raw onions nearby, he stops thinking about it.  Until they board.

Because of all his Delta miles, he's in first class, in the aisle seat.  He sits down, and pulls out a book.  The window seat next to him is empty, and stays that way for a while, so he's thinking, cool -- empty row!  Then, just as boarding is finishing, suddenly, this horrible, pungent smell just FILLS the cabin.  It's so bad that he said literally every passenger in first class reacted, snapping their heads up to see what in the smelly hell just walked on the plane.

It was a young-ish woman, probably late 20's, early 30's.  Very hippie-chick style, wearing sort of a flow-y top over a tank top.  And she smelled like she had not bathed in daaays.  Seriously, best guess is that she'd spent a week at a sweat lodge, and hadn't cleaned herself since.  And, of course, she plopped herself down right next to my husband.

Now, like I said, he's a seasoned traveler, so he's used to a lot, and his tolerance is pretty fucking high, but he said this woman's smell was so bad that his eyes immediately started watering.  The flight attendant came over, and the woman ordered a Mai Tai; then she pulled out a book, and started highlighting passages.  Meanwhile, call buttons are beginning to light up like crazy, with pretty much every other passenger on the plane being all, ""Oh, HELL no"" about being stuck in a metal box from Hawaii to L.A. with someone who smells like she fucked every member of Phish back in 2006, and vowed to never bathe again.

Anyway, over the next fifteen minutes while this woman sits there reading obliviously, my husband watches as the poor flight attendants have multiple whispered, nervous conversations at the front of the plane, all the while staring at this smelly lady.  My husband is alternating between texting me in horror and making eye contact with the attendants, and he's doing the Wide-Eyes-of-Terror at them, and they're nodding at him and Wide-Eyeing right back.  By this time, my husband is nervous that he's going to get a migraine because the smell is so overwhelming, and people nearby are wrapping shirts around their faces to combat the odor.  Finally, the gate agent approaches.  She asks the woman to follow her to the front, where apparently, they gave her some soap and a new shirt, and sent her into the bathroom.  

A few minutes later, she emerged wearing a new shirt, but still smelling atrocious (""THEY GAVE HER SOAP, BUT NO INSTRUCTIONS,"" my husband texts miserably.  ""Can't they SEE she doesn't know what to do with it?  SOAP IS HARD FOR HER"").  She sits back down, and promptly orders another drink. 

Another few minutes pass, with more wide-eyed-silent-""help me""- face from my husband, as well as increasingly *not* so silent complaints from other passengers nearby, until finally, it becomes apparent that if action isn't taken, there's going to be a big ol' mutiny in the first class of a Delta plane.  At this point, two agents approach the row.  Now, this lady had the window seat and my husband was in the aisle, so this entire conversation had to take place with him awkwardly in the middle, pressing himself against his seat back, but the agents lean in and tell the woman that, sorry, she just can't ride on the plane; she smells too bad, and she's not fit to fly.  She's incredulous, and keeps saying, ""Just because *you* think I smell?"" and ""This sounds like a lawsuit to me.""  Meanwhile, the agents are being as friendly as they can be, explaining that they will happily put her up in a hotel for the night so she can take a shower, but that they can't allow her to board another Delta plane until she's cleaned herself off.  She didn't make that much of a scene, and they all gathered her things and walked off together.

The best part, though, was that right before she stood up, she complained that she had an important meeting back in L.A., and absolutely *had* to fly out that afternoon; in response, one of the attendants smiled and brightly said, ""Well, *we* can't help you, but I think there's still room on a United flight!""

My husband said it was one of the most surreal travel experiences ever. 

**TL/DR: Sorry, United.**

**Edited to add: Holy shit, my first gold! Thanks, sweet someone!  And thanks to everyone for your hilarious and kind comments. And I guess thanks, too, smelly lady, wherever you may be. (Meanwhile, sorry, husband, for capitalizing off of your misery.  Uh, loooove yoooou!) Anyway, y'all are awesome.  And you *smell* fantastic.**

TRUE,soonami,flag2,Van Winkle Family Reserve Rye,"Here's my impression of expert wine tasters and sommeliers, I feel like a lot of them get by with knowing more than you and memorizing vineyard names and other people's tasting notes. If you remember that Robert Parker gave the 2008 Bordeaux first growths a very high score, then you can probably comment a lot on a 2008 Lafite without having tried it. You could say it's very fruity with jammy blackberries, stewed plums with notes of tobacco, cedar, leather... People are easily influenced in their perceptions, especially som's. Most ""wine experts"" aren't in the business of tasting and reviewing wines objectively, but **selling** wine. Would you trust a car salesman to tell you which car they have the best? They would tell you the most expensive one you would buy is the best!

Back to whiskey, there is a huge spectrum of what people like and what's acceptable. Some people like whiskies that have burn from alcohol like barrel proof offerings and others like something proofed down. Some like spicy Rye, others prefer the mellow sweetness of wheated bourbon. Some people like smooth, long aged bourbons like Pappy's, where as others like fiery, younger bourbons like Wild Turkey Rare Breed. Then there are Scotch drinkers that adore the smoky, briny, peaty, Ardbeg and Islay offerings but hate Sweeter, sherry finished malts like Macallan and Aberlour. There's a place for all of it.

However, if you go within a same category, (cheeseburgers or 12 year old wheated bourbons from Buffalo Trace), you narrow the range of subjectivity. It's like saying what kind of apple is the better for baking. I'm not saying apple is a better fruit than an orange or which is better to eat out of hand. In a specific metric or product, which performs best. In this case, I think that for 12 year old wheated BT juice, more people, in a blind tasting would say that the Lot B is better.

**Company Websites**    
To find companies, you can check the rankings in the [Life Insurer's Fact Book](https://www.acli.com/Tools/Industry%20Facts/Life%20Insurers%20Fact%20Book/Documents/FB11Ranking.pdf).    

Alternatively, you can check the SOA's [directory](https://directory.soa.org/) and look for life actuaries in a particular state or city.

[Ezra Penland](http://www.ezrapenland.com/)    
[DW Simpson](http://www.dwsimpson.com/)    
[SC International](http://www.scinternational.com/) posts salary ranges for their job listings    
The minor ones are great too, they'll contact you on LinkedIn if you have a profile.    

**Job Boards**    
[Indeed.com](http://www.indeed.com) is the best.    
Monster.com and Hotjobs are pretty awful now.    

**Networking**    
Call your former colleagues who've moved on to other companies.

My granddad past away some time mid January that year (my birthday is January 21st). When my dad went to make the arrangements for the funeral, the last thing my mom told my dad before he left the house was, not to put the funeral the following Saturday, because it was my birthday.
If you haven't already guessed it, my dad did indeed manage to have the funeral on that following Saturday, open casket and everything.
It ended up being the weirdest day in my short little life at that point. Family members in tears saying goodbye to my granddad and then turning to me with a birthday gift. 
On top of that, this was my first funeral and the first time someone in my life had passed away, and I was just old enough to actually understand that granddad was dead and gone and he would never take me fishing or rides in his classic car anymore, which all made me very sad and had me crying a lot that day!

Bonus info: On the day my granddad passed away, he had just come home from his daily morning walk. He then went and sat next to my grandmother in their living sofa, took her hand and said to her: ""I love you honey, and I think I'm leaving now. Thank you for my life.""
He closed his eyes and passed in the sofa next to her, holding her hand. (they were married for 55 years)

I'll go through your profile anyways, but you really should read the FAQ on messaging.  That is a crazy bombardment and obvious copypasta, and coupled with your so-so profile pic, is going to be a non-starter for most women.

**Photos**

dump the seal, jumper, and haiiiiiiiii pic.  Switch the best lit one to your primary. Keep the beach one. Then go and get a photo taken of yourself with something other than a potato somewhere not in your bedroom!

**My Self Summary**

You aren't ""just"" a guy.  you are probably a fun to be around Pharmacology student.  Everyone on OKC is looking for someone to speak too, how are you unique?

**What I’m doing with my life**

Don't be lazy, and especially don't admit to it!

I'm a Pharmaceutical Science student living in Manchester ~~. At the moment I'm a bit lazy with it all, but I still~~ and am doing pretty well.
I have a part-time job at a pharmacy where ~~I work weekends (and occasionally evenings). It's quite a good job; I'm good at it and~~ it has been a very good experience so far.

~~Away from all the formal stuff I just want to have fun times, I try my hardest to go out and do things that I've never done before. And it'd be great to have a person to have an adventure with.~~ (say something along the lines of ""I like going on adventures, just recently i [insert adventure].""
I also play the guitar and ~~would love~~ (am always looking for) someone to jam with.

**I’m really good at**

You are a first year Phara student?  Is that actually a scientist?  Say Chemistry and make a joke about losing your eyebrows in high school or something.  I think that will go a lot further and show some personality, unless you really are by the book.

Rambling in a negative.  best foot forward.

**The first things people usually notice about me**

hard to not be braggy here, but the hair is perfect, the smile is offputting, and the eye thing is interesting!  good work having an interesting genetic marker!

**Favorite books, movies, shows, music, and food**

don't say you aren't unique.  A little more wouldn't hurt, because a book worm, movie junkie, or music geek would pass immediatly.  Maybe not the music geek.

**The six things I could never do without**

dump the first line.

Some of these make you sound inept, but they are creative.  If you aren't having success, I would go with options that make you sound a little more confident.

**I spend a lot of time thinking about**

it turns off.  everyone knows that.  I can prove it to you. You are going in the right direction though by thinking outside the box.  I would leave this until you think of something equal or better, but know that it is not the best.

**On a typical Friday night I am**

OMG you sound fucking desparate!  Just leave this one blank.  And fuck you for being able to drink at 18... goddamn america.

Someone said to put things like this in.  At 18 it is fine, but as you are the youngest you can be on OKC (i think) you will be pining for older women who are likely looking for older men.  The following basically applys to every section:  How are you more mature and yet more laid back and fun than a 21 y/o who is trying to get with the same 18 y/o girls you are?  What makes you different and better/more compatible?

TRUE,ThatGirl_Tasha,,,"This was pre 9-11 . .  . (and ya, I was just a passenger but it's still a ridiculous story).

Older Southwest planes used to have lounge seating up front where first class would normally be, two rows of seating that faced each other. 

Staring directly at a stranger for four hours, awesome.

The plane was full and pre 9-11 you could bring a ton of shit on board -two good sized bags, food, a huge purse etc. 

The flight attendant went through the aisles trying to get everyone to put their stuff in the overhead because the floor was filled with everyone's crap. 

The woman in front of me had a lunch cooler type bag. The attendant asked if there was any liquid in it and the woman said *no*, so the attendant put it above -over my seat.

The lady across from lunch cooler lady had a massive floor length fox fur coat on her lap (and she was a big big woman-going on six feet and obese), so this coat was HUGE. 

The flight attendant tells her it has to go above in the compartment. The woman sort of flips out and goes on and on; arguing loudly about how this coat costs as much as a car and stuffing it into a small space will ruin it. The flight attendant was on the verge of calling dad over to settle it (the pilot) when Sasquatch fur woman gives in reluctantly.

The attendant assures her she will be very very careful not to compress it too much. And again it goes in the compartment over my seat.

Thirty minutes into the flight the guy next to me perks up suddenly and asked me, ""Did you feel something?"" 

And a second later I did. 

Something was dripping on us. 

Looking up there were lines of fluid all over the button area and what started as an occasionally drip was now like a drip a second in several places.

The attendant came over and searched through the overhead. Lunch cooler lady was the culprit. The bag contained a huge thermos of chicken soup. Lunch cooler woman declared she didn't count it as a liquid earlier because it was in a sealed container.

Then out came the coat, completely soaked in chicken soup. 

And thus began the great stare down of 1999. The two women across form each other, on a flight from Maryland to Vegas that had just finished with take off. 

I have never had such a case of the giggles along with a complete stranger in my life. Every time another drip came down it would start again. 

TLDR; *wore chicken soup for a cross country flight, was worth it for the entertainment value.*

My step cousin/whatever you want to call her, Christy, called fakename back after she sent a Facebook message, linking her to this story.  Christy said nothing much about the story (not surprised) but that she would consider bringing her kid over on her way through town in March.  Haven't seen her in some time and neither has the rest of the family.  I'm not holding my breath, but the phone call is the first in a long time.  Maybe this story is bringing up feelings of how great a person her mother was and she'll want to be around family?  I don't know.

In more exciting news:  I 100% believe this is you... however, I think if you had a picture of Charlotte you would be the only one to know for sure.  My sister says she has one from age 7, 8, or 9 maybe.  She'll find it, confirm it's the right sister with my step mom (5 step kids, 1/2 kids, and whole kids on that side and all girls), and I'll upload it.  If not, my step mom looks enough like Charlotte that I may just get a picture of her from that age.  Other than the hair color, you'd think it were Charlotte.

About 5 or 6 rows up (not at all in first class) was a fairly large gentleman who was still awake, and there was no one else around, so I started talking to him. He was friendly, and told jokes, and had candy, and the flight attendant kept on bringing us drinks and peanuts long after they stopped even looking at everyone else, which was cool. They also kept on apologizing to him, and asking if he wanted them to make me leave him alone, which I thought was funny. Some time later, I ended up falling asleep next to him, and he got me a blanket, and let me rest. When I woke up, my mother was apologizing profusely and was dragging me off him and ushering me to the back of the plane (both my parents smoked and this was the 80's). When we got back there, she scolded me for embarrassing her, and then didn't talk to me for the remainder of the flight (she was grumpy like that). As we were getting off the plane he came over and told my mother that it was ok, and that I kept him entertained, and that he hates flying by himself, and then he gave me a hug and signed something for her.

THIRD EDIT:

You can have fun while being productive, but I thought I should clarify what I meant by the first edit after the post got a little attention. By ""be productive"" I simply mean don't waste your time in only having fun.

Be productive together.

Work on projects together, have shared goals, etc. Grow together, don't just have fun together and stagnate.

Be productive together with friends.

Team sports for example, or a trivia team. Something whereby you and your partner can feel part of a larger group which caters to both your needs. This will help you grow together, as in the context of the group, you will be thought of and seen as ""a couple"". The other points in the list aid in preventing this becoming a drawback.

Be productive on your own (away from partner).

Having your own goals separate to theirs will of course help you grow as an individual, thereby giving you more to share in the relationship, but also just happier within yourself.

The honeymoon period WILL end. Trust me. It is not joint ecstasy that forms a solid bond, it is facing adversity together that will make you stronger. Not to mention the mundane day to day stuff: the annoying habits, one partner wanting more sex than the other, the repetition, and the fights about who should do the fucking dishes. Underneath the calmer waters, the relationship is either growing in strength or gradually being eroded away. The latter can be stopped if you both realise this is happening and are both committed to working on it.

Speaking of work, long-term relationships require constant maintenance. And sometimes, hard bloody work. This shouldn't be one sided, though, a partnership implies that you are both in it together. When you find yourselves up Shit Creek, you both better start paddling.

Some relationships do have an expiry date. Sometimes you grow apart - if you are ready to move on to the next stage of life it can be hard if your partner is holding you back. And you don't have to put up with abuse or cheating. 

Learn to love yourself, and find fulfilling things in your life because your partner isn't there to fill those holes. Yes, you will carry one another through the tough times, but your partner can't be expected to solve your deep-seeded issues. It is important to look after yourself, and have some time to yourself, especially if you have children.

And finally: having children is one of the hardest challenges you will face as a couple. It will test you, and you will probably find yourself actively disliking your partner, and many of you will consider separation.

At the end of the day, it's awesome having someone by your side, fighting in your corner. :)

First, let me preface this entire thing. About 90% (I did the math and as everyone knows, pilots are good at math*) of the posts here revolve around one personality. The person that thinks the crew is out to get them. Here's the bottom line - tell your friends: We want to get to the destination as much or more as the passengers do. We often have a VERY short time in our hotel to get dinner, sleep, and be back at the airport for another day already. Delays cut into that. If it is our go home leg, we'll chew through steel to get home. But everything we do is about safety first. The company may fight us on that, but it's our lives and we do our best to keep the flight safe. So, if there is a delay it is either warranted or out of our control. Also, we only get paid when the aircraft door is closed, so while we are sitting there waiting, we aren't on the clock. (There are airlines with different pay rules, but the vast majority follow this structure).

K story time: It was a bad weather day into St. Louis. We got struck by lightning. It happens. We get priority to land because we can't be sure what damage occurred. Once on the ground, I do a walk around and see the damage. The outbound flight, the last of the night, is cancelled because the plane is down for what I would think are obvious reasons.

We didn't have a hotel for the night, as we were supposed to take the plane back out. So while waiting for news from crew scheduling, we were supporting the gate agent. Man, people were PISSED. Insisting we go. I point out the window at the melted wingtip and large scorch mark on the aircraft. One lady got in my face and screamed, ""Do you think I give a fuck about your paint job?! Get me on that plane and get me home, or you'll be sorry!""

Needless to say, that lady didn't go on any flight with us the next day. Don't fuck with gate agents (or crews that are nice to them).

*We are horrible at math. That whole math this is a myth. Math is dangerous in a cockpit.

tl;dr: Hit by lightning. Visible damage to aircraft. Passengers still want to fly - with thunderstorm that caused damage still in vicinity for that matter.

Invest in being happy, invest your time in others and socialising. 

There's countless things that you could be doing outside of your career, but also *because* of your career so your different efforts all co-exist and benefit eachother. If you're in a good place in your job then that means that you're in a good place to enjoy your life even more than you already are!

That said, don't feel like you *need* to improve yourself but rather just have goals that you work towards in a pace that you enjoy. 

I've found that being happy pretty much consists of ticking the following boxes once a day:

-Doing something fun

-Doing something social

-Achieving something 

-Exercising


These things can all be done to as small or large an amount as you want to but if you aim to do them all each day, to some extent, then you'll find that you're damn happy.

TRUE,OpenWideSayAah,,General Dentist,"**Re: Why most GPs have not adopted the clark preparation instead.**

**TL:DR; most dentists can't afford a surgical microscope; the matrix system required to do his technique properly is very expensive, and modern sectional matrix systems have caught up to the innovations introduced by Dr. David Clark.**

#1 - most resin composites average 5-7 years before failing.  Patients are typically aware of the longevity difference between silver and resin, and most choose resin anyway.  So your technique has to last an average of 5+ years for it to beconsidered a ""good"" filling.

#2 - Dr. Clark's technique is simply a modified slot prep technique.  Slot preps have had mixed results, and success rates are influenced by a number of factors (type of bonding used, rubber dam usage, layering technique used, etc etc).  Most GPs were never trained to do slot preps well, or have no idea what a proper slot prep looks like.

#3 - As far as I know, Dr. Clark's technique hasn't been around long enough to be studied and published in a peer-reviewed dental journal.  As it stands, it is just his office and his little clan of followers that perform class 2 preps in this manner.

#4 - Even if his technique was published in a peer-reviewed dental journal, most GPs don't know how to read a research article past the abstract, and will lump his technique into the rest of the ""slot preparation"" articles, which, as I had mentioned before, is a mixed bag.

#5 - Dr. Clark claims that doing his type of conservative type slot prep ""requires"" the use of a microscope.  That alone is cost-prohibitive for most general dentists to achieve desired results.  I personally have 4.5x loupes and do it just fine, especially for larger areas of decay.

#6 - Dr. Clark's system of restoring class 2s in this way is reliant on an ""all-translucent system for buccal-lingual curing"".  Until the Triodent V4 Clearmetal came out earlier this year, the only all-translucent system for buccal-lingual curing is the Bioclear matrix System invented by, guess who?  Dr. David Clark.

Don't get me wrong, Dr. Clark's system is really good, but, the Matrix system cost for Bioclear is 2-4x more expensive than a similar all-translucent system (The Triodent V4), and when so many dentists are beholden to piss-poor insurance payouts, that can be the difference between open doors and closed ones.

#7 - Dr. Clark's class 2 composite technique takes a LOT of steps.  In the marketplace of ideas, his technique competes with modern sectional matrix systems and modern bulk fill composites.  I can use a standard sectional system and sonicfill and be done in 2 minutes without changing my technique or re-training my assistants.

**Keep in mind** that Dr. Clark's technique was introduced at a time when most dentists were using Tofflemire bands and wooden wedges.  Basically, trying to kludge it together using tools originally developed for amalgam.  At the time of introduction, his technique was truly ground breaking and revolutionary.

However, Garrison and Triodent have co-opted some of his ideas, and you can achieve similar results without the complexity of Bioclear.

Finally, **the prepped premolar photo is misleading.**  Dr. Clark's photo of a GV Black prepped premolar that fractured is not actually prepped in the style of GV Black.  In fact, that premolar is a textbook example of how NOT to prep for amalgam, and a perfect example of why you don't put amalgam into a composite prep.  Note the rounded edges and line angles.  That's wrong, and if you put the amalgam in that prep, you are GUARANTEED to get fracture lines.  You need sharp line angles and a **perfectly flat interproximal box** in order to avoid the type of fracturing that is occurring.  Whoever prepped that amalgam didn't know what s/he was doing.

That being said, the Bioclear Matrix system is AMAZING for anterior class 3 and class 4 resins.  I highly recommend every general dentist to add this to their repertoire, especially for the price-oriented patient who cannot afford lab-fabricated ceramic veneers.

**TL:DR; most dentists can't afford a surgical microscope; the matrix system required to do his technique properly is very expensive, and modern sectional matrix systems have caught up to the innovations introduced by Dr. David Clark.**

DISCLAIMER:  I receive no financial compensation from Dr. Clark or his company.  I do use the Bioclear Matrix System, although not exclusively.

EDIT:  Reddit gold?  Oh you....!  *_*

EDIT 2:  I might as well add a couple of additional thoughts:

**The advantage of sticking with Dr. Clark's technique and system is:**
1.  Universal technique for both anterior and posterior teeth, even though it might be different than what you are used to
2.  Reduced instrumentation and simpler setup.

Back of the envelope: putting up sufficient antennas to service Omaha's size and density would require about 3 antennas per sq km.  If we assume they can do them cheaply, that still puts us at $100MM, but $200MM is likely a better estimate.
So to enter your market, t-mobile would need to bet $100-200MM on infrastructure.  

Then, it typically costs about $300-400 in marketing and sales expense to acquire a cellular customer.  T-Mobile has about 13% market share, so they might get 100,000 customers if they continued their national trend.  So we're looking at another $30-40 million dollars outlay there.

That's costs, let's get to revenue.  The average cell phone bill is $47.  So now we're looking at spending $130-240MM to drive $4.7MM/mo in total revenue.  Not profit, revenue.

T-mobile earns just under 30% EBITDA margin, so that $130-240MM investment is looking to return about $17MM/yr of profit, assuming that people in Omaha convert as well as people in other metro areas.  But realistically, the sort of person who chooses to live in Omaha is less likely to be highly digital (not a judgment, mind you, it's just part of the culture).  The smart phones are likely to use smaller data plans, more people are likely to be on budget plans, etc.  

So realistically, T-Mob would be looking at $130-240MM investment to make more like $8-12MM/yr of profit.  And that sucks.

The only players who can afford to make that sort of investment are the market leaders who can reasonable expect to: a) obtain a much larger portion of the market than T-Mobile, and b) charge each customer more money than T-Mobile would charge.

Over the next few months, I became more and more constipated and my rib cage began to protrude. The pain and discomfort in my rectal area got worse. Only sitting in the tub made the discomfort go away. I tried to self-diagnose and treat (almost a doctor, right?), but nothing worked. Eventually, I got an appointment with a gastroenterologist. but he was really backed up and it would be like a month before I could get in. Anyhoo, eventually the constipation became too much and I had to go the ER. I hadn't lost any weight, but the doc in the ER thought my legs looked really thin, so he ordered a CT. Stage IV colorectal cancer, all throughout my liver. The reason my weight didn't go down was because my liver was enlarged and I had fluid in my abdomen.

There is one thing I suspect we get wrong.  Is that in too many suicide cases we blame mental health as a cause, when in my opinion it is often a symptom. Our health system can treat the symptoms and manage them but they cannot solve the cause.  Like what you mentioned, for many young their prospects are very poor.  After living overseas for many years I don't blame many of the young for being depressed here.  As a society we neglect many of the things they need to be happy.  Until we start to treat the causes as opposed to the symptoms I suspect it will continue to get worse and suicide is a huge issue in Australia.  If I am not wrong we have one of the highest suicide rates in the world.

Some thoughts on the causes:

1. Urban deserts. In my opinion we have separated urban and working environments too much.  Suburbs are very much like deserts in the day.  This tends to detach working and home life.  I suspect for many young it makes everything around them look pointless as it is not attached to their welfare.  I think young need to be around working adults.  We need to spread shopping and business areas more evenly through suburbs so young are more exposed to people working around them.  It also means shops and cafe's would be nearby, which can act as gathering points.When I was in Singapore, nearly all the public housing had shops and eating places on the ground floor.  It provided a much more inclusive environment for young there.  They could always walk down to the shop below them.  It also gave them near by working opportunities and encouraged them to mingle with others near by.

2. Cost of living.  Cost of living in Australia is very high. Average house prices are one of the highest in the world in terms of how many years you have to work to pay off a house. We also rate very poorly on affordability indexes as compared to other developed countries.  That means people here have work longer to get a house than most other countries.  In terms of housing we are poorer than most countries and yet we have very high productivity requirements for workers.  That means stressful working environment coupling with high living costs.

3. Lack of opportunities.  There are very few productive opportunities in Australia.  Most real wealth here comes from what people own.  If you own real estate, a farm of a mine then you can get income from that and do well.  However for a young person who does not own any of these, and with high living costs there is little chance for them to compete which will likely depress them.  If our economy was set up to reward productivity instead of control or ownership(we are rent economy which is why we have no manufacturing) then young would see these opportunities and it would give them something to look forward to.  They would see, hey i get this job, its not to hard and then i can have this house etc.  At the moment, many are stuck with their parents or kicked out to rent single rooms with little future prospects.

4. Lack of social support network. We tend to have very small and separated families. We have an obsession with moving away from extended family and parents.  This means young are often only exposed to a few role models, often their immediate parents.  It means if there parent is bad, they have no alternative role model who looks after them. Extended families often do better, because in the case the parent is bad, then the parents parent or the parents sister may step in to ensure the child has a good role model.  It also means, that for example, if their parent is depressed, or maybe a drinker, they get the full brunt of that depression or drinking. In extended families, other members are their to soften the blow.

5. Work environments, Drug and drinking culture.  It is my opinion that a large portion of Australians are completely unable to handle the alcohol. We have a culture that encourages people to go out and get blind drunk.  The problem with this in my opinion is that it tends to ""numb"" culture.  It makes us too tough. People put up with a lot of things that are wrong because at the end of the day they will go get drunk to forget.  Over time this tends to compound.  For example, lets say a young persons parent is a drinker but the child is not.  They see their parents life, who goes to work, does a job they hate, then each even comes home depressed and then goes our to get drunk and forget the miserable work life.  The child who may not drink will see this as a depressing prospect, that the only way they can avoid how miserable life is, is to get drunk.  If you go to china, you will often hear expats complain that the locals don't work hard, they are always talking and taking breaks. The difference is, they work longer, but the work environment is actually much more enjoyable than an Australian work environment.  Our working environments are very very rigid and formal which tends to make them un-enjoyable.  If we could adapt our culture to make working environments less stressful and more enjoyable I suspect it may even help with the obsessive drinking culture- but both would have to change hand in hand, otherwise one may lead back to the other.

I could go on for ever, but it really doesn't surprise me we have such a high suicide rate. We have so many problems that in my opinion are ignored because of the ""tough"" culture in australia or are taboo to talk about. Its an environment problem that we need to change.  The mental health is the symptom, which after many years probably starts to feed on itself.

The problem with gaslighting (you know, other than the obvious ""emotional abuse is problematic"" argument) is that you no longer trust your own feelings, because you start to internalize the abuser's trivializing of them.

TRUE,MangoPip,,,"Sorry mate, abbreviations are a curse - when we start up a section we issue a Notice of Energisation for that area. This makes sure that everyone on site knows exactly what is going on - it must be discussed at all of the contractors' morning meetings. Usually these are issued 24 to 48 hours ahead of time. It is a safety system, and I have found it really good in the past, means that if you accidentally spray an area with water due to a pipe leaking or similar, the contractor who might have decided to mix concrete in that area should be aware of what is happening. Trivial example, but hopefully you get the idea. 

I have only learnt by experience, but there is a book by Martin Kilcross called ""chemical and process plant commissioning handbook"" which looks pretty good, and gives you a good idea of why we do things in a certain order, and why we have so much paperwork. Are you client side or on the engineers' side of things? If the latter, they will have lessons learnt from previous jobs that would make a good read before you mobilise to site. If you are on the client side, usually you will be doing a heap of optimisation once the engineering firm has handed over to you, so it is really good to have a good handle on the process and potential areas that need focus. Make sure you know exactly where your role starts if you are client side - there are contractual issues that could bite you in the arse if things aren't done according to the agreement. 

Remember to punch list in good time, especially if the contract is EPCM, and the push towards the end will be to get the engineer off site because they are costing lots of money. 

Having an electrical/instrumentation engineer with you is really important too - they are worth their weight in gold towards the pointy end of things. 

Not sure on LPG: LNG plants but we use radios to communicate - get someone to explain the etiquette to you before you use it - and never, ever swear at or abuse anyone over the radio, fastest way to get kicked off site. 

There is loads of other stuff, but it sounds like you have the right positive attitude, which is 80% of what you need! Best commissioning engineers I have worked with are the guys who will do whatever is needed to get the job done, who will pitch in to help where needed, and who have a plan for each day of what they need to do, and at the end of the day if things haven't happened, they know what to do to achieve it tomorrow. Sometimes you have to be a bit of a nag to get stuff done, guys have their own priorities which aren't yours, but generally they will understand why you are being so persistent, and will help once they can.

TRUE,Penultimatum,,,"I hate analogies like these regarding privacy. Just because somebody doesn't have a problem with the NSA recording their phone conversations doesn't mean that they're fine with them taking video of their bathroom or something. The bathroom is reserved largely for **personal** uses, whereas a phone has a much broader range of uses.

I tried thinking of a good analogy, but I couldn't come up with one. So instead, I'll give a scenario in which I would not be comfortable with a roommate gaining certain information, but I have no problem with the government having the same exact information.

I would be very disturbed if I found out that I had a roommate who snooped on my computer and looked through my browsing history. This would disturb me for many reasons, of which I will list the ones I can immediately think of:

* My roommate invaded *my* privacy, targeting me specifically and nobody else (or very few people else, such as perhaps my other roommates). This makes it **personal**.

* My roommate had an ulterior motive which is unknown to me and affects me personally. Their actions are not transparent in the least, nor were they expected.

* My roommate chose to find out this information through an unconventional avenue. If they had a friendly motive, they could've just asked me personally. If they had an unfriendly motive, well, they had an unfriendly motive.

Let's say that the NSA is recording everyone's browsing habits. I'm *not* disturbed by this and I'll say why, in part echoing the reasons I listed in my bullets above:

* The government is recording *everybody's* habits, not just mine. This makes it **impersonal**.

* The government is doing it with a motive I do not consider wholly unreasonable (preventing crime) and it is at least making a show of explaining its motives. Their actions are somewhat transparent (though admittedly not as much as I'd like) and they are expected.

* The government does not have an easier way to record my browsing habits than directly through me or my ISP. They *could* ask me personally, but seeing as they're trying to prevent crime, I would be unlikely to outright disclose any incriminating actions I may have taken. There is little to no chance of their motive being fulfilled in any more comfortable manner.

I do think that the government should be more transparent in the motives for its recording actions and in disclosing what information it chooses to record. However, even disclosing what information the NSA chooses to record is risky. It's for the same reason so many online communities' admins (especially in gaming, e.g. Riot Games) choose not to disclose the particulars of why somebody has been banned. If they release what information they record, there is a potential for criminal activity to occur more frequently again, as now people know which channels of communication to avoid and - by process of elimination - which channels to use for such activities.

Recording is a useful approach for preventing crime, especially in today's information age.

TRUE,SoulLessGinger992,,,"They/it appears to be a grey whale. This is especially interesting since baleen whale twins is something that's never been recorded in the wild. That said, no one is certain if that's because it rarely happens, or because twins cannot be maintained by the mother. Mysticetes (baleen whales), a group which includes the grey whale, usually nurse their young for 4-11 months, depending on the species. The larger the species, the longer they nurse. The fat content in whale milk is extremely high, usually 40-50%, to allow the calf to quickly grow blubber and to become large as fast as possible. Large whale calves are only susceptible to predation when they are very small, so growing as fast as possible is the main priority. In addition to that, most baleen whales migrate to warm waters to give birth, and warm waters are extremely nutrient-poor (read: no plankton or small fish), so they're largely fasting. That means that most whale mothers are getting the calories that goes into the calf's milk only from their own fat stores. 

So, because of all these factors, it would be nearly impossible for a large mysticete whale to successfully raise two calves to adulthood. And that's where the question comes in. If a whale were to give birth to viable twins, does she reject one or try to raise both and they end up starving (and potentially the mother as well since she would be drained by the milk herself). These conjoined twins would obviously not be able to survive since it's unlikely they can successfully swim or hunt (yes, baleen whales do hunt to a degree). It's likely this has nothing to do with Fukushima at all, since low dose radiation has never been shown to increase conjoined twins. Conjoined twins are something that does happen in the wild in both live-birth species and those that hatch from eggs. It's uncommon, but only just as uncommon as it is in humans, so it's nothing to freak out about. If we start finding dozens of them, then I think we can start to worry, but this is probably something that happens once in a blue moon, just like human conjoined twins, but we never find them since they would likely sink to the bottom of the ocean after birth/death.

Edit - Adding TL;DR - This is fascinating as hell, whales almost never have twins and conjoined whale twins have never been documented. This is also likely has jack shit to do with Fukushima.

TRUE,jayblackcomedy,,,"I like the college circuit a lot.  They kids are fun and the pay is great.  There are only two real problems with the college circuit (aside from the travel, which I deal with in a moment):

1. The shows are very rarely in traditional show spaces.  Very often, you're in a student center or a bar on campus or in the cafeteria.  This means you have to adapt to many different situations and that can be difficult.

2. The pressure to do well is always high.  You're being paid a lot of money and the kids don't *know* that they're show space is difficult (""Why should our cafeteria at noon in front of 300 kids who didn't know there would be comedy be any different than a comedy club?"")  So, unlike a club, where you might shank one and have management be understanding, the colleges expect for the money that they're paying that you're going to do well no matter what the circumstances.  This is very similar to corporate and I would say the *most important thing* is that you be consistent no matter what.  A guy who can get a 7.5 *every time* is a lot more valuable to colleges, corporate, privates, and the military, then a guy who gets a 10 when the crowd is good and a 5 when the crowd is bad.

Now, the travel.  Yeah, it can be tough.  When my second kid was born, it got *especially* tough.  My wife is moving to half days this month and she's a teacher (so summers are off), and I think that will make things a lot easier as it will reduce her stress.  But there's no getting around it -- if you are going to do this, it'll make things hard at home.

The psychological toll of being on the road by yourself is high as well.  Most of the shows are done by yourself, so there isn't even an emcee or feature to hang out with.  Also, if you have a string of one-nighters (a ""block"" as they're called in college terms), you might be spending every morning flying or driving somewhere, every evening performing, and the rest of the time questioning every decision you've ever made.

I'm pretty okay with being alone and my wife is pretty good about letting me go do this crazy thing (especially now that she can relax a little bit at work), but even for me it's very tough.  If you're a really social person, I would expect it would drive you half insane.  Either way, that's something to consider on your way in...

You know, slogged after the 9-6 grind, the usual feeling, like somebody bashed you head in with a blunt object, thinking of what you're going to do for dinner, then, that moment of clarity, a tiny miracle, an epiphany, oh yeah, she will be there. Or if I get home before her I will shortly hear her keys on the lock and move to the door like a giddy child.  
  
She was usually home first. She'd hear me coming and greet me at the door, sometimes with little to nothing on. Sometimes she'd lock the deadbolt and I'd hear her giggle as I turned the key and bruised my shoulder at the same time.  
  
We grew to be somewhat childish in our off times. Not everyone does, but our bedroom passed through to the bathroom then out into a hall and back into the bedroom and was separated by French doors. This was conducive to a chase and she'd make me run her down when I wanted it.  
  
When you live together, sleep side by side each night you get to know your own quirks more intimately. You are a mirror held to each other. You get to know that you steal pillows and blankets and that sometimes she'll sit up in bed and mumble some question of nonsense to no one. When you put your arm under her she’ll protest, she’ll say your arm will fall asleep but you won’t care.

You sort out who likes the shower head pointed high, who needs it low. Same with computer chairs.  
  
You've got, by default, somebody to worry about you. Take care of you when you are sick. Wait up when you're working overtime. You come home to the TV on and a bowl of soup on the kitchen table.  
  
You shop together. For me, shopping no longer seemed like a chore. 

I ate better. She was a good cook. As a sales rep, she traveled a lot for business and so she'd spend half a day before a trip making my favorites and freezing them in gallon bags and labeling them in marker. She was afraid when she was gone I'd eat junk, like a kid, and she was right. I often dismissed the freezer bags of the things I told her were my favorites and loaded up on pizza, McD's, chips and coke.  
  
So this leads to the most important piece of advice: don't be the one to clean the place out when and if things come to an end, if you can help it. Or take some help.  
  
Standing there with cardboard boxes ready to be folded, six months of memories destroyed me.  
  
Cardboard boxes are such an indignity, then. They are blank and ugly and brown on the outside and when you put things in them it's like they are gone, eaten up. It's not even the sentimental things, not even the nested leather heart boxes from Bombay Company you got her one Valentine's day, or the handmade beer cozy she made you in return because she was broke, but the little things, most innocuous things.  
  
Like hair ties. Yes, hair ties were everywhere, and imagine having to pick them up one by one, or be cleaning and have one pounce on you, the fist of rubber clutching strands of her hair.  
  
Then the things you have to throw out because you can't see any possible way to keep them. You open a freezer and there they are staring back at you, each neatly labeled with her handwriting and date, long expired, and a little smiley face, a bag of bacon and kale soup, some empanadas, glittering there right where you had left them, a freezer full.

He listened solemnly as Royce introduced the knights who had accompanied him, then said, “My lords are welcome here. You know our Maester Colemon, of course. Lord Nestor, you will recall Alayne, my natural daughter?”
“To be sure.” Lord Nestor Royce was a bullnecked, barrel-chested, balding man with a grey- shot beard and a stern look. He inclined his head a whole half inch in greeting.
Sansa curtsied, too frightened to speak for fear she might misspeak. Petyr drew her to her feet. “Sweetling, be a good girl and bring Lord Robert to the High Hall to receive his guests.”
“Yes, Father.” Her voice sounded thin and strained. A liar’s voice, she thought as she hurried up the steps and across the gallery to the Moon Tower. A guilty voice.
Gretchel and Maddy were helping Robert Arryn squirm into his breeches when Sansa stepped into his bedchamber. The Lord of the Eyrie had been crying again. His eyes were red and raw, his lashes crusty, his nose swollen and runny. A trail of snot glistened underneath one nostril, and his lower lip was bloody where he’d bitten it. Lord Nestor must not see him like this, Sansa thought, despairing. “Gretchel, fetch me the washbasin.” She took the boy by the hand and drew him to the bed. “Did my Sweetrobin sleep well last night?”
“No.” He sniffed. “I never slept one bit, Alayne. He was singing again, and my door was locked. I called for them to let me out, but no one ever came. Someone locked me in my room.”
“That was wicked of them.” Dipping a soft cloth into the warm water, she began to clean his face... gently, oh so gently. If you scrubbed Robert too briskly, he might begin to shake. The boy
was frail, and terribly small for his age. He was eight, but Sansa had known bigger five-year- olds.
Robert’s lip quivered. “I was going to come sleep with you.”
I know you were. Sweetrobin had been accustomed to crawling in beside his mother, until she wed Lord Petyr. Since Lady Lysa’s death he had taken to wandering the Eyrie in quest of other beds. The one he liked best was Sansa’s... which was why she had asked Ser Lothor Brune to lock his door last night. She would not have minded if he only slept, but he was always trying to nuzzle at her breasts, and when he had his shaking spells he often wet the bed.
“Lord Nestor Royce has come up from the Gates to see you.” Sansa wiped beneath his nose. “I don’t want to see him,” he said. “I want a story. A story of the Winged Knight.”
“After,” Sansa said. “First you must see Lord Nestor.”
“Lord Nestor has a mole,” he said, squirming. Robert was afraid of men with moles. “Mommy
said he was dreadful.”
“My poor Sweetrobin.” Sansa smoothed his hair back. “You miss her, I know. Lord Petyr
misses her too. He loved her just as you do.” That was a lie, though kindly meant. The only woman Petyr ever loved was Sansa’s murdered mother. He had confessed as much to Lady Lysa just before he pushed her out the Moon Door. She was mad and dangerous. She murdered her own lord husband, and would have murdered me if Petyr had not come along to save me.
Robert did not need to know that, though. He was only a sick little boy who’d loved his mother. “There,” Sansa said, “you look a proper lord now. Maddy, fetch his cloak.” It was lambswool, soft and warm, a handsome sky-blue that set off the cream color of his tunic. She fastened it about his shoulders with a silver brooch in the shape of a crescent moon, and took him by the hand. Robert came meekly for once.
The High Hall had been closed since Lady Lysa’s fall, and it gave Sansa a chill to enter it again. The hall was long and grand and beautiful, she supposed, but she did not like it here. It was a pale cold place at the best of times. The slender pillars looked like fingerbones, and the blue veins in the white marble brought to mind the veins in an old crone’s legs. Though fifty silver sconces lined the walls, less than a dozen torches had been lit, so shadows danced upon the floors and pooled in every corner. Their footsteps echoed off the marble, and Sansa could hear the wind rattling at the Moon Door.

TRUE,rpfile,AIOTD,AstroBin Image Of The Day 2013-10-22,"that is correct. ACR, lightroom, photoshop, iPhoto, the Digic processor in the camera making a jpeg - all of them apply a stretch and a saturation boost to the data before it is shown to you.

this is essentially because a CCD/CMOS sensor has a linear response to light, but the human eye has a non-linear (exponential/logarithmic) response to light. so if you look at a raw image from your camera, it is very dim and does not look like what the eye would see when stimulated by the same light. with astrophotography it's *really* bad because we're recording so little signal and have to stack to boost the SNR.

with astronomical images, we have to start with the linear versions for a couple of reasons. the first is that we need to (or want to) calibrate the images to remove fixed patterns (like the bias signal, or the dark (thermal) signal). also we want to correct vignetting with flats. if we were to let someone or something stretch the image before these defect corrections, they would come out all wrong. the dark signal, for instance, is a linear function of time. it is possible to use a master dark of 1800s, for instance, and simply multiply it by 0.5 in order to apply against a light frame of 600s. if you let the image become stretched somehow this scaling will not work.

another reason is that for certain operations (background extraction, color calibration, and deconvolution) the images must still be in linear mode for the algorithms to work right. 

PixInsight and other astro image processing packages (DSS, etc.) use an open source package called DCRAW to open CR2s (and other DSLR raw files). it is always invoked in a way that does not touch the data, in fact it also requests that the data even not be debayered. what you get is a greyscale image with all the color filter data interspersed together (just like it is on the sensor.) further on down the pipeline, after calibration, you debayer the images making them 3-plane RGB images, then register them, then stack them and only then do you apply a stretch.

this is why pixinsight and other astronomical tools have ""screen stretch"" functionality - so you can see what you are working on when the image is still really in a linear state.

also because there are 2 green pixels in each 4x4 bayer matrix, usually even a terrestrial image will have a strong green cast when opened in linear mode. anyway the upshot is ACR is doing *a lot* of processing behind the scenes to make your images look nice. in astrophotography we have to do a lot of that stuff by hand…

hope that helps, i tend to go off on tangents…

TRUE,blaaaarg123,,,"First off, I don't disagree with you. In most situations, your SO should come before your friends. That's why you are in a committed relationship with them.  
  
That being said, I want to explain ""the other side"" a bit.  
  
I am single. Most of my friends are in serious relationships. Most of the time, they do a pretty good job balancing the friendship vs. the relationship.  
  
However...even with that, I can't even count the number of times I have had plans with a friend and they have cancelled or left halfway through because their SO had a bad day, or felt sick, or ""missed them"".  
  
Like I said, I truly believe an SO should be a priority. And I do not necessarily blame my friends for rushing to their SOs sides--they are just being good boyfriends/girlfriends. I'm sure that when the day comes that I am in a committed relationship, I will behave the exact same way.  
  
But as that single friend...it's VERY hard not to just wish your friends' SOs would just man the fuck up. I have bad days, I get sick, and you know what? I deal. I may text a friend and see if they're free or whatever, but I certainly wouldn't expect them to drop everything to come to my aid at the slightest whim (as seems to be the case whenever a friends' SO texts them). I try very hard not to think this way, because like I stated above I do not necessarily fault my friends for being good boyfriends/girlfriends. That does not mean that I don't feel like crap every time I get ditched, or every time I think about the fact that if it was between being there for me or being there for their SOs, my friends would choose their SOs every time. Sometimes, I'm reaching out to a friend because I need someone to talk to, or because I've had a terrifically crappy day, or because I'm feeling lonely and just want some company. Watching that friend leave in the middle of our planned dinner that I've been looking forward to for a week because their SO had a crappy day at work or something just makes me feel low and unappreciated.
  
I guess what I'm trying to say is, keep the friend in mind. Yes, it's important to make your SO a priority in your life. But at the end of the day, your SO should know that you are always going to be there for them. You will ""go home"" (emotionally or physically) to your SO. Not to your friends.

TRUE,MorganFreemanAsSatan,,,"Satanism is sort of an umbrella term for a lot of religions that share a common identification with the literary figure of Satan.  In the world of poetry and literature, the mythology of Satan came to mean many things, and these very characteristics became quite popular around the time of the Romantic period.  Prior to the Romantic period you had Milton's Paradise Lost, which combined with the Ophite Gnostic view of the serpent as a positive figure of enlightenment, spawned the Satan archetype that most so-called Satanists revere.

It became a character of self-reliance, independence, sovereignty, freedom, opposition to tyranny, revolution, pride, science, sex, pleasure, and other such once-maligned characteristics.  Go and read Milton's Paradise Lost with modern eyes, and you'll find in Satan quite the amiable character, at times.  And as I said, during the Romantic period, this Promethean characterization of Satan was even more entrenched: Carducci, Byron, Blake, Baudelaire, Twain and Goethe all have quite a bit of ""Satanism"" running through them.

That said, you can go different directions with this mythology.  The Church of Satan, for example, takes some of the character traits of Satan and combines them with a Nietzschean or Randian egoism, which turns out quite a bit differently than the more traditional Romantic/Gnostic stance of Lucien Greaves/The Satanic Temple.  But because the former has a historical precedent in the form of Anton LaVey founding ""Satanism"" as a legal religion first, the Church of Satan types tend to say that everyone else is either a poser or a fraud, that is, they alone are responsible for the modern Satanic paradigm, and mythology, because they made it legal -- even though much of the literature they draw on is far older than themselves.",0,1389069002,,0,FALSE,1,cejbbpi,t3_1ukpl7,t1_cejbbpi,t1_cejag8c,1431833394,27,FALSE,news,t5_2qh3l,27
TRUE,cunctatrix,female,♀,"First - about the comment about women in the media - sure, it's not like the media completely ignores any political statement Hillary Clinton or Sarah Palin makes, but they still spend way too much time talking about their hair, makeup, clothing etc. Not worth the precious airspace. And there definitely are people who will never look past women's looks (e.g. the people who obsess about how Palin's ""such a MILF"" and don't give a shit about her political career, or vice versa, people who talk about how disgusting and fat famous women are without paying a moment's attention to their incredible life accomplishments). It's not like they're looking at these women on a dating site or something - they're reading about them in the news or something. As an intelligent, ambitious, and high-achieving woman, that sort of shit is really frustrating to hear. I don't expect everyone to be attracted to me; I do expect to be able to get respect and (when appropriate) recognition for my accomplishments from my male friends and colleagues.

Anyway, to the main point, what really kind of turns me off about the whole PUA thing, even if in a ""nicer"" package like you say, is that it tends to focus heavily on making a woman want something she doesn't already want rather than trying to make sure she and her male partner are both getting something they want and having their needs met. It's a subtle difference but an important one. Trying to change someone's desires - ""how do I make her like me?"" - is inherently paternalistic. It's saying that your view of what she should want is more important or more correct than what she actually wants, which devalues and disrespects the woman. Seeking to provide her what she actually wants aims towards a mutually beneficial exchange that respects both parties as equals who both have equally valid and worthy desires and needs.

I think a lot of stuff that has been mentioned (like eye contact, not approaching from behind, etc) can be easily rephrased to fit in a framework of fulfilling women's needs and desires. Generally, women want to feel safe (thus don't approach them from behind), they want to be able to trust someone they're talking to (see id), they want to have a good time (thus smile and joke with them), they want to feel like you're actually listening to them and being engaged in the conversation (thus eye contact) and so on and so forth. Insofar as PUA offers this advice, it can fit within the framework.

However, it seems like PUA pretty much just gives advice to how to get and maintain women's attention, how to get them in bed - basically how to make them happy enough for your own ends. It's not about actually making women happy - their happiness is a means to your ends. Particularly with respect to the pursuit of casual encounters, that PUA seems to ignore the importance of teaching men how to please women in bed suggests to me that the focus is really making women change their desires rather than fulfilling women's existing desires. The main reason, imho, that women do not engage in casual sex or seek it out as much as men do is because of the [orgasm gap](http://www.alternet.org/sex-amp-relationships/orgasm-gap-real-reason-women-get-less-often-men-and-how-fix-it). Women are far less likely to experience an orgasm in a heterosexual encounter than men are, and the gap is particularly large with ONSs and casual sex. As the article above explains, women who have sex with women have orgasms at much higher rates than women who have sex with men. Women also average the same amount of time to orgasm through masturbation as men do through intercourse. So, basically, it's not that it's 'naturally difficult' for women to orgasm; it's sex with men that is the problem. Which is understandable to an extent - if you (men generally) come easily, then you don't need as much effort from the other person, so you have less of an incentive to make sure they come so they do the same for you. Understandable doesn't mean excusable though.

Thus, we have a situation in which women's expected outcome from a heterosexual encounter is much lower than men's, and that's especially true for casual sex. (At least with longer term things, there's some possibility of teaching.) So of course women are going to seek out casual sex less than men. It's not that women don't want good sex - it's that they know they're not going to get it, so they don't even bother. (In my experience, about 90% of hookups are ""meh"" to godawful. I can do a lot better than that just by staying at home and taking care of myself. Most of my girlfriends have described similar experiences.)

If men want more casual sex, or even more sex in general, they have to work on their skill. Even if you're *just* looking for a ONS, women talk, and that will impact your chances. I've had women I don't even know warn me about a guy's actions in the sack; I've also heard dirty details and gotten 'recommendations', which I have subsequently pursued (for hookups, a lot of my friends and I are fine with sharing - this isn't the case with a lot of friend groups, but you'd be surprised how much gets around. Also, Lulu's a thing now.) Plus, it's always nice to have the option of repeat business when the business is good. Generally, though, the more guys work on their skill (and COMMUNICATE! ask her what she likes! if it feels good!), the more positive sexual encounters women have with them, the more women will be down for casual sex and the easier it will be for both parties to find mutually satisfying sexual encounters.

If PUA can do all this, and do it while respecting women's autonomy, wants, and needs, I don't really see a problem with that. In fact, it sounds pretty great. (Though it would be nice if it were a two-way street, and there was more good advice out there for women to find and/or approach interesting, good men!) I just feel like PUA is rarely if ever versed like this, and I feel like there's a real lack of attention to the orgasm gap, which ends up causing problems for both men and women.

It is very, very detailed. The names might not match perfectly but it should be close.

Does your board have load-line calibration? You never say what type of board you have. I hope it is a z87 board. If it is an H you are pretty crippled in your oc ability. Anyhow, follow that guide. As reference I use:

43 multiplier for core and uncore

1.128 as my vcore

Enabled all the power saving options

Load-line calibration at high

Voltage input at 1.8

Vring at 1.125 (I think or it may be 1.15)


There are some other settings too but be sure to read that overclocking guide in depth. This is a long process. You have to feel it out. Don't rush it. Don't try and push without understanding everything and what it does. Doing that will result in the OC you originally posted (bad) or even worse a chip that dies very quick. This isn't a quick game and there are no fast rewards. CPU's are expensive don't wreck it by not taking your time. Treat it like an old sportscar. You don't just take the car out and rev the shit out of it. You learn what it likes, you treat it right and all of a sudden you're really moving. Be patient.

TRUE,ainrialai,,,"&gt;It's not really relevant, you didn't buy and sell slaves, I didn't buy and sell slaves, people did that hundreds of years ago

This is true, of course. No one alive today is in any way responsible for the Atlantic slave trade or the actions of their ancestors. However, the reason black slavery is still relevant is not only the social implications it's had on American society (and I mean ""American"" as in ""the Americas""), with respect to racial attitudes and discrimination, but also the direct economic effects that exist today. 

Take the United States for example. For centuries, slave labor was a major contributing factor in powering the economy of the country and its colonial predecessors, enriching an entire owning class. When slavery was abolished, the owning class retained ownership of the land made profitable by the slaves and the generations of profits produced by the slaves, while the erstwhile slaves were left nothing but their persons. They had to turn around and sell their labor for a cut-rate wage, often to their old owners. It's as if the slaves had been pushing the owners for generations, building up centuries of acceleration, and then, from a standstill, had to start running to catch up with them. But, in reality, the only way to make any progress was to continue to push them, just under different terms. And, in 1865, they found themselves destitute in a society that had started centuries before by people who had come to claim small plots of their own land. Even non-slave-owners who had some form of property had a big advantage over the freed slaves.

Of course, there were many poor and dispossessed white workers at the time, who were often treated just as badly as the former slaves by bosses and owners. The history of these oppressed workers also echoes to the modern day, with the white poor outnumbering the black poor, though the *rate* for the latter is higher. But it is still important to note that, while social mobility is a daunting and often unrealistic prospect for the poor of any race, it is somewhat easier for the white poor. The economic descendants of the past owning class, the modern capitalist owning class, are still largely white, and still biased towards their own ""in-groups,"" which has been documented in studies showing intense hiring discrimination based on race. The effects of slavery even hurt white workers economically; at the time, slavery lowered wages, and later, the racial attitudes built up by the white owners during the slave period were used to keep white and black workers divided, helping the owners break unions and keep down wages for all workers.

So you see why black slavery in the Americas is still an important thing to understand, I hope, and why efforts to make people ignore it or think it's not really relevant anymore are harmful. In an economic system in which wealth is heritable and property ownership is the main engine for economic profit, an entire group of people starting out at a massive disadvantage can never be expected to just correct over time. The playing field was never leveled, as property ownership has continued to be passed on in uninterrupted lines within the capitalist system, and so a black worker born today is still economically disadvantaged with respect to a white worker of similar economic standing, though of course both are in shit positions in comparison to the owners, and have much more in common with each other than with owners of their own respective races. White people in general don't need to answer for black slavery, but rich owners of productive property are tied up in systems of repression that date back to the institutions of slavery.",0,1388534600,,0,FALSE,1,ceefv8b,t3_1u48ce,t1_ceefv8b,t1_ceee6d6,1427910672,98,FALSE,AdviceAnimals,t5_2s7tt,98

I guess my point was that it's the absolute minimum, because it's (largely) unskilled labor. Give it a few years and that job could be replaced with a Roomba.

This of course doesn't apply to everyone or every company, but I personally feel that my ""minimum"" lifestyle is achievable at the minimum wage. We can't let people starve, but they don't really *need* to be able to afford large apartments to themselves and bigscreen TVs when they can live comfortably with others (also likely in similar financial situations at low level jobs) while buying a TV at Goodwill for a buck (was dropping things off there yesterday, 30+"" CRTs are only $1). Even a working car can be found on craigslist for under $1000 if you're careful. It won't be pretty, but it's enough to get by.

This is just my relatively unpopular and rarely voiced opinion, but a minimum is pretty much only there to get you by. I will say that some of my feelings on this come from me being pretty handy -- I would buy things that needed work for cheap and use them for as long as possible. I understand that many aren't comfortable buying used or less-nice things because they can't fix them if anything happens. I still try to remain as objective as possible but no one can experience minimum-wage living from every angle so I'm likely not considering all possibilities, such as a low paying job while supporting a family.

**but we don't lump them together like that though do we?** we call them [differentiating between the victim from the enemy helper] fucking collaborators which is what they were.

So when OP strips out the victimhood of many african peoples by combining them with a whole fucking continent of other african peoples' he's doing a massive disservice.

Prior to colonial slavery there was no large scale systemisation of slavery, slaves were never considered chattel or anything other than human. Yes it existed, but thats like comparing, the early ford car with oh i dont know a Toyota pick up truck. bad example but you get my point.


Its a very colonialist mindset to simply label africa as 'doing it to itself'. They were provided the tools, the impetus, the financial backing and crucially the forts and order numbers to supply the demand for slaves on the plantations, which was all headed up by, you guessed it, colonials.

Then people cry racism, and say its religion. bullshit. Aside from that one skewed reference about ham being punished, there's no reason in there for mass production line slavery.

You could look at early [pre slavetrade] european paintings of africans dressed as civilised without any exaagerated features or much differentiation with white peoples and see that no, a racism mindset did not play a part in colonial slavery.

Rather, slavery caused racism [or a lot of it] rather than the other way round. Reasons and justifications were backdated using theological, faux scientific [think django -leo dicaprio philosophies], faux geopolitical, and many other reasons which all are largely bullshit to keep the economic presses rolling.

The difference between how racism was viewed in the americas versus the carribean [ the formers one drop of blood theory and low black population relative to whites versus the carribeans colour hierarchy theory where whiter was seen as higher up the socioeconomic ladder and there were a larger majority of black slaves relative to a white population] and how these all played and shaped factors in treatment of non colonials for years to come",0,1388536270,,0,1388536510,1,ceegfec,t3_1u48ce,t1_ceegfec,t1_ceecx78,1427910411,163,FALSE,AdviceAnimals,t5_2s7tt,163

TRUE,Cyridius,,,"When people bring up joking and religion, people compare Christianity and Islam as if they're the same thing. They. Are. Not. They're religions, but their importance in societies in which they are dominant is radically different. Before nationalism, the idea of nationhood, all of that, there was only *religion*. People identified by *religion*. This is where Islam is. If you get an influential figure and they say about Americans; ""Yeah, you guys are all fucking stupid. I hope your soldiers step on an IED over there in Afghanistan, it's all you imperialistic fucks deserve"" - this is guaranteed to piss off Americans, except a few who have some really thick skin. 

This is what you do when you mock Islam. It's like calling a black person a nigger. They identify themselves as *black*. It is what they are. They were born that way, raised that way, they *live* that way. If you tell them to go back working in the cotton fields where they belong, you, again, get a really angry reaction from black people. 

Progressive, Westernized Muslims don't care if Islam is made fun of. That's because they're *Westernized*. The society they are a part of does not place emphasis on religion as a core personal identifier. In non-Western - or ""core"" Islamic - countries, Islam is to them what being American is to you, or being black is to Obama, or *whatever*. 

I'm all for free speech. I don't care if people are offended, and I don't believe in censorship in the slightest, but acting as if making fun of Christianity and making fun of Islam is the same thing just shows a fundamental lack of comprehension of the mindset behind those people you are offending.

If you wanna look at people shitting on Islam, Omid Djalili is a funny guy and he does it fearlessly. How many white men do you see go on stage and take the piss out of black people? *Very* few. How many blacks do you see go on stage and rip on black people? A lot. People are acting as if this is unique to Islam, but the kinds of ""jokes"" people want to make are the insanely bigoted or offensive ones(The sad and typical ""Muslim blowing up"" joke is like the black man being a criminal joke - it's funny but if you're not one of them you're going to start pissing people off), come up with a tasteful joke about Islam and you wont draw attention to yourself.",0,1388538768,,0,1388539028,2,ceeh8cp,t3_1u435c,t1_ceeh8cp,t1_ceefgou,1427910035,425,FALSE,worldnews,t5_2qh13,425

&gt; It is important to understand the definition of unconditional love to be able to give it, it is the kind of love that expects nothing back, places no limits, and does not set any ideals or conditions on what it should be.

Translation: You are being unreasonable, setting boundaries and expecting me to abide by them. If you *really* loved me, you would let me do whatever I like, and do whatever I ask.

&gt; When you love in this way you do it without expectation of reciprocity and with no preconceived notions of how or if they will express love back to you.

Translation: Your expectations that I love you back are wrong. If you truly loved me, you wouldn't need me to love you back.

&gt; This is the kind of love you see exhibited by parents and children, brothers and sisters, true friends, and the best of romantic relationships.

Translation: You're my child, so this is how you should love me, without expecting anything in return.

&gt; When you love someone unconditionally you do not set limits or boundaries on that love, not circumstances that would cause you to withdraw it, there is nothing that would cause you to not love the person.

Translation: You are a bad person for cutting contact with me and refusing to give me all I want just because I'm an abusive monster.

&gt; Even if the other person does something that you feel is intentional, it is overlooked if you are truly committed to unconditional love.

Translation: You need to overlook anything I did that you didn't like so we can get back to the important task of telling you everything that you're doing wrong with your life.

&gt; You do not try to control the actions of the other person, nor do you tell them that you will not love them if they act a certain way or do a certain thing. When this kind of love is present both partners feel more secure and neither of them seeks to control the other.

Translation: Don't try to tell me what I can and cannot do with your life, and I won't try to control you, so long as you do everything I tell you to.

&gt; Since there are no boundaries or conditions the people in a relationship of unconditional love do not have to worry about the other person leaving or not loving them over a particular situation or behavior. Siblings in most cases are a good example of this, even though they may have quarrels and disagreements throughout their lives the bond between them remains unbroken and their love continues through any and all conflicts.

Translation: I OWN YOU FOREVER BECAUSE YOU CAME OUT OF MY BODY.

&gt; If you love someone unconditionally you will want whatever is best for them and you will always give them the freedom to seek out the things that really give them happiness. You will let them learn things for themselves and explore situations and experiences that they feel will make them happy, even if you think that you know what is best for them. Although they may make bad choices and do things that are wrong you will always be there for them and never judge them if you truly love them unconditionally.

Translation: I love you even though you are a failure who is doing everything wrong with your life.

&gt; Can you see room for improvement in your relationship? Do you place restrictions and limitations on the one you love? When you truly love someone unconditionally, you place their needs and their happiness above everything else, including yourself. Remember, just because you love someone in this way it does not mean that they will return their love to you in the same way. Are you ready to love unconditionally?

TRUE,cityoflostwages,tax,Big4 Asset Mgmt Audit/Tax (US),"First of all, it's good that you're looking ahead and considering careers you may be interested in. I'll try to answer some of your questions:

1. Not really. I wouldn't worry about reading ahead on accounting as you'll have plenty of time to do this in college. In highschool try to get involved in some business related activities, leadership positions (student gov or student clubs), or volunteer. Keep a high gpa and work on extra curriculars!
2. For California the top school is USC(top 5 in the country), you can get a job pretty much anywhere coming out of Leventhal. I'd put UCLA as #2 for southern california recruiting and CAL for #2 if you're aiming for NorCal. SDSU is a good third option for the SD market. SJSU is also recruited at in the bay area and UCR/UCSB. FYI this is just my opinion regarding the schools as I'm sure other people here will have a different opinion or recommendation. That 3.5 gpa you are referring to is your cumulative university gpa, not your highschool gpa.
3. Audit, Tax, Advisory are the three in public accounting. Private accounting is different and can vary. You should be able to google for differences or use the search feature here as it is a common question.
4. This can vary. Big4 tends to be 50-60k starting, mid-tier firms are roughly competitive to this, and more regional firms are slightly less. It will also vary with audit vs. tax. versus advisory positions.
5. Some would say yes, a lot of the people here would say no. In tax I sit at my desk most of the day, answer emails, talk to clients, and do a ton of work on my laptop with excel and other accounting applications. The physical effort involved is very similar to computer programming, just a different skillset and knowledge-base that you are learning and working with.
6. I can't really say what sort of college you should be looking for. Go to one with a strong accounting program and good recruiting(see california schools listed above). After that it will be a personality fit with what school feels the most comfortable. Don't worry about what classes you should take until you get into college, most full accounting majors are very similar in their curriculum.
7. This is a great idea if cost is an issue. USC and UC schools are very transfer friendly and work with community colleges to setup transfer programs. SMCC in santa monica for example feeds a ton of students to usc/ucla. However, 4 years in a university is a great experience and would be much more enjoyable if you can afford it. This also gives you 4 years of recruiting with firm recruiters on campus instead of only 2.
8. Public accounting firms generally don't hire interns unless they are juniors in university as they want to hire them full-time afterwards for a post-graduation start date. You are better off finding some small businesses that need help with basis accounting work to get a feel for it. Most people don't have accounting work experience prior to university but you'll have plenty of time to build it during your 4 years.
9. First and foremost, a great gpa. It doesn't need to be a 4.0 but many accounting firms have a gpa cut off between 3.0 and 3.5 so you want to do great in highschool and great in university as far as academics go. Next is either job experience(part-time is fine or even on campus work) or volunteer/leadership experience. Try to get involved in student government or become an executive board member of a student club or become heavily involved in a hobby you are passionate about. Recruiters want to see someone who is well-rounded and who can maintain a high gpa while being a leader on campus or in their community. All of the above schools should have accounting student organizations you can join.

TRUE,rsdancey,,,"The United States is finely balanced between two blocs of voters:  People who want to use wealth redistribution schemes to level the economic landscape, and people who are ok with the idea that there are people on the extreme high and extreme low ends of the economic spectrum.

Through a quirk in the way our politics developed there is a sizeable group of voters who SHOULD be in the wealth redistribution bloc based on their household incomes and their needs, but who ARE in the winners &amp; losers bloc.  This quirk has troubled political observers for 50 years.  It is primarily due to the fact that there are a lot of poor evangelical Christians in the United States that care more about abortion than their personal household checkbooks.  Strange, but true.

To keep the government from creating a European-style national health system the forces that don't want one have boxed single-payer healthcare into the idea of ""Socialism"", and have defined ""Socialism"" as Anti-American.  They have spent 100 years telling anyone who will listen that the outcome of a single-payer healthcare system will be a reduced quality of care, rationing of healthcare services, and a lack of choice about who your doctor will be or what treatments you can receive.  They are effective with this line of argument because it is all true - every national health service in Europe, Canada and Japan does these things.  There's no effective advocate for the other side of that argument, that helathcare costs have spiraled out of control because of the unique economics of healthcare (you'll pay anything to stay alive), and that universal care, even if rationed, is better for society than having 20% of the population live in fear of getting sick, and with healthcare costs triggering bankruptcies for many households where someone suffers a catastrophic illness like cancer or chronic heart disease.

In the last Presidential election, 52% of the voters picked the candidate that represents the wealth distribution bloc, and 47% picked the candidate that represents the winners &amp; losers bloc.  But it was just 8 years ago that the election went the other way, and there's good reason to think that it's a tossup now based on candidate personalities and campaign discipline who will become President.  Due to our strange Electoral College system who becomes President is now determined by a sliver of voters (less than 300,000 out of 330,000,000 residents) in 5 states:  Ohio, Florida, Virginia, New Mexico and Nevada.  With elections decided on these kinds of slim margins, there's an all out war to fight for a few voters who may change from Republican to Democrat in any given election.

The theory is that if enough new people are enrolled in some kind of new government mandated insurance plan, a batch of these ""swing voters"" will be captured by the value of the plan - once they have it, they'll never give it up (see: Social Security).  Those voters will forever after vote Democratic to protect that healthcare insurance, effectively locking in Democratic Presidents barring a personal meltdown or a major event like a war or another 9/11.

So the Republicans and their operatives are fighting with everything in their power to convince people to kill healthcare expansion before the lock-in occurs.  Worse, they're worried that once there's a lock-in, it will enable the Democrats to go for a full-scale single-payer national healthcare system: a system they cannot get with the current divisions in the electorate (which is why we didn't get one in 2008 even though there was a Democratic House, a Democratic Supermajority in the Senate and a Democrat in the White House).

For the GOP, this is literally a life or death struggle.  If they lose, there's a non-zero chance the Republican Party will become so marginalized that it will break apart (which is how the Republican Party was born in the first place; when the Whig party tore itself apart over the issue of slavery in the 1850s)",0,1388543611,,0,1388544088,1,ceeiqxo,t3_1u48ku,t1_ceeiqxo,t3_1u48ku,1427909329,22,FALSE,explainlikeimfive,t5_2sokd,22

  When the crew awakes they discover the cryogenic pod unrepaired and eventually after some hope and mystery, discover Eli's body frozen in a chair. Attempts to thaw and resuscitate fail. But instead of dying, it turns out that Eli discovered a way to upload himself into Destiny's system via the chair interface and we soon discover that he is still alive and well in the main computer banks.  He unfortunately is told that Chloe's pod malfunctioned and she did not survive and has to deal with that. It is then revealed that Destiny's computers are doing ""uploads"" of data utilizing an exotic transport technology to some ""receiver"" located somewhere in their new galaxy. 
  
  This opens up to a whole story arc of Eli riding the data stream and discovering the location. Eli is then able to virtually explore the new facility utilizing a holographic remote presence interface he activates. The facility is immense, and spans across an entire planet placed at the edge of a series of black holes. Eli soon finds a way, via a cloning lab, to resurrect himself a new body and transferring his consciousness into it.  It succeeds, but unfortunately now he is physically at the command station instead of Destiny, as due to the ship's power constraints he is unable to establish a stable gate connection, but he is able to help the ship remotely in unique ways as he discovers new technologies and features of this command station.  All the while he slowly creeps into a depression, sulking over the death of Chloe, and ultimately pondering his ending up alone in this vast structure.  
  
  This command station is eventually discovered to be a center of operations, with ""broadcast stations"" throughout the universe, all connected at this hub. Soon it is shown that this is the staging area for not just sending seed ships and what not, but it can directly dial into alternate, adjacent parallel universes where a group of ancients is still alive and well.  The entire command station tunnels through multiple universes, tapping into them to power the reactor, like a large multidimensional ZPM. It is revealed that this is the origin of all stargates in the universe and the source behind the transmission of Zero Point technology.  
  
  Eli is soon able to establish contact with this group of ancients in an adjacent dimension and after some convincing, is able to get information about the command station and Destiny. It is eventually found by these surviving ancients, who have forgotten their history and are delving into what is considered their lore, that there are dangerous implications of the technology in the command station and the ""Signal"" that Destiny is traveling to is essentially some sort of interference from the command station's power reactor, a side effect of tearing through universes that balances the energy out, but it is growing unstable and could cause an unraveling. 
  
  It is revealed that this was known by the ancients and spurred the solution to use destiny, and a hidden device on the ship to detonate and ""Seal"" the rift to ensure it doesn't collapse and take with it our entire universe.  The ancients in this other reality were suppose to return and complete the task but due to them forgetting and also utilizing technology to adapt to their reality over many generations they can no longer safely transverse back into our universe. The shutdown has to occur together, with Eli initiating a shutdown from the command station in conjunction with Rush on Destiny, in order to complete the process.   
  
  The crew reacts strongly to the premise of dying with Destiny and there are frantic efforts to get off the ship. As Destiny approaches the destination, Eli is finally able to establish a gate connection with Destiny and evacuates the crew to this command station. As part of the final solution, Destiny's gate then autodials into the command station's power reactor, locking those gates in sync. Being pressed for time, he is unable to connect to any stargates anywhere, except for one mysteriously erratic gate. With limited options, as once the shutdown is complete there will no longer be any power in the facility, they connect to this gate and the crew steps through. This gate is revealed to be located behind a waterfall embedded into a long lost, overgrown structure, with the crew being thrust out the gate, shot down a long moss covered water-slide like formation, rocketing through the waterfall, and splashing into a beautiful pool of clear water. Eli stays behind to initiate the shutdown process, which will cause him to be stranded at the edge of the universe.  
  
  The final moments are with Rush, at the Helm interfaced to the detonation device. Destiny approaching a glorious sight which is the signal. The device launches and the explosion occurs, tearing apart space and time, plunging the ship into the rift causing it to vanish. The shutdown happens, the command station power reactor powers down, leaving Eli stranded by himself in this darkened silent facility, alone, as he contemplates his fate. It turns out the explosion melded Rush with the rift, him becoming one with the edge fabric of the universe, and ultimately reaching a God-like existence, able to transcend and travel through space and time at will. And due to this, he is able to reverse some action in the past and take Eli home, ultimately restoring the universe to how it was meant to be.  
  
  The series ends with Eli appearing in a beautiful field, Rush by his side near a group of the rest of the crew.  It is a typical reunion of characters but stepping out from behind the crowd is Chloe, alive and well. It is revealed Rush was able to travel back in time, go to the Destiny and repair her cryogenic chamber to prevent her death. The only ones that remember her death being Eli and Rush, shielded from those temporal changes due to the entire shutdown process. It is then revealed Rush's Omnipotence was a temporary side-effect as he fades away into the background noise of the cosmos, his essence being utilized by the ancient technology, as the seal, the ascended guardian of the rift. The entire cast tearfully says their goodbyes and makes amends as he slowly disappears, with the final shot showing Rush's eyes wide opened, in joyful awe, as his last echoing words are ""I can see it! I understand!"" 

After he vanishes, someone says ""Where are we?"" The camera then pans away and pulls back, showing the group in this field, surrounded by dense jungle, as it slowly zooms skyward you can see the temple structure, and the outline, and it reveals that it is not a traditional temple, but the remains of a large, seed ship, crashed long ago and overgrown with jungle, hidden over time. It appears to be Destiny, thrown back into the distant past through the rift. With possibly some help from Rush, or maybe the ancients, to give them a gate to escape to.  The camera continues to zoom out revealing that they are in fact on Earth, that they have made it home.

That's incredibly low.

As for the threads themselves, it has everything to do with curating content, and (almost) nothing to do with people just being mean.  Downvotes on posts are (usually) nothing personal, but simply the way the community, (namely those who browse /r/starcitizen/new specifically), helps dictate what rises to the top and is subsequently seen by those who only browse /r/starcitizen with the default 'hot' sorting, or who only see posts from here when they pop up on their own front page.

Daily duplicates of the same half a dozen questions do not belong near the top; sorry, they just don't.  But they do deserve to be answered, and if you'll notice, 99.9% of the time, they are.  There's a surprisingly large number of us who answer questions from newcomers on a daily basis, and have been doing so for... well, a very long time.

If a question comes up that I think the community as a whole needs to see, I'll definitely try to help push it towards the top, but if it's something that's been answered three times this week, I'll make sure it's been answered, and then let it fade into the black.

Instead of encouraging newcomers to make four new threads in just over 24 hours ([wink,](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/1tz0um/does_rsi_have_plans_to_prevent_the_goons_from/) [wink,](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/1u02oc/ive_fallen_in_love_my_freelancer_is_all_the/) [nudge,](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/1u4gbo/how_will_insurance_fraud_be_detected/) [nudge...](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/1u4rl7/meta_why_is_there_so_much_negativity_on_this/)), maybe we could encourage people to use the [**'New player Q&amp;A + FAQ'**](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/1step3/new_player_qa_faq/) to ask their questions; it's been stickied to the top, in one form or another, for almost a month now. :)

TRUE,[deleted],,,"It is good that all of these emotions and areas of personal value are coming up! When we hide from or ignore our issues it festers and grows. When these issues grow stories of fiction and fantasies are created by the mind. From there we lose sense of who we really are and make rash decisions on a mind obsessed with fictitious story we made up! Be aware of what is real and what is not real. 



If I were in your shoes, I too would have these concerns and desires. I would definitely think about ending a relationship over unsatisfied sex. As much as I love a person, there is still the fact that I am a man and I have a penis which can overcome logic and common sense. 


My advice is clear communication. Be wise about your approach to the conversation, this is not an interrigation and a meeting to decide who is right or who is wrong. This is a conversation to RELATE with eachother and talk about something that could end your partnership together. 


Express yourself with sincerity and avoid ""YOU!"" statements. Don't be accusing or come off as the enemy. Anytime we say ""because you do this"" or ""it is your fault"" we become an attacker and destroy the bonds of love.


Use ""I"" statements such as ""I feel that..."" or ""I would like you to...""  You don't have to avoid the ""you"" just make sure that the statement is coming from an ""I"" priority.  example ""I would like us to be close and would like us to be happy together. Therefore I feel it is important to tell you something that has been on my mind. I respect your choices and I would like to you to hear me out about how we go about sex""


Don't expect instant results or an instant turn around! After a conversation that burdens the ego, a person needs time to settle and digest the experience.


In the end, one of you has to accept, give in, be willing to change, be willing to ask, be willing to be open and forthcoming, or meet somewhere in the middle. Maybe she will not fulfill all your sexual desires by next month, but maybe she will take steps to get there.



Also consider that there could be an emotional memory from a trauma that happened in her past that might make he resistant to sex. I know I've dated some girls who were sexually molested and raped but had not known about it until they had a memory flashback in their adult hood. Perhaps it was the upbringing....


It is important to come at this issue with a willing spirit and ask your partner to do so as well..


Always end on a positive note too (always start positive and end positive... the ending feeling is what a person remembers about the experience anyway).... ""... and I feel if we work together as a team on this that we can really grow closer as a couple and open up to new possibilities for us. You are my partner and I would like you to be my partner in this.""


And this is true, you really have to work as a team and talk about this stuff. You can't conquer it on your own and neither can she... You need to be supporting of her as she opens up because when someone opens themselves up to you like that they are fragile and need nourishing loving vibes coming from you. Amd her part in this is to be willing and open to new things.... Explore options with her... even ask her what is needed for her to do this... or what you can do to help if she needs it... Express that you don't want this for you, but for us... That you want this to also be a positive experience for her!



Hope this helps, blessings ;)



and don't take everyone's advice on reddit at face value, not even mine... a lot of negative people who have had similar experiences will side with the part of you that feels ""justified and right"". I've seen many relationships crumble because someone listened to the advice of a ""friend"" who was looking out for them when they were really just angry with their own past and taking it out on the guys girlfriend.

TRUE,Xelif,,,"More specifically... the liquid iron-nickel outer core surrounding it.

Let's start from the top, actually. Assume you're digging in the middle of North America - say, Kansas. First you'd dig through rock. Lots of rock: 50 km of it. At 12.2 km deep - the deepest humanity has dug through continental crust, at the [Kola Superdeep Borehole](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kola_Superdeep_Borehole) in northern Russia - it would already be quite hot, 180 degrees Centigrade or so. It would just get hotter from there: just 3 km later, it would be 300 degrees Centigrade.

At about 15 km, the rock would transition from brittle to ductile - instead of shattering, it would deform, like very, very hard putty or Play-doh.

At 35 km or so, you'd hit the Mohorovičić discontinuity, or ""Moho"" for short. Congratulations - you've just hit an important scientific milestone! You're still in the *lithosphere*, or area of solid rock - no magma yet. We know what the Moho is - it's an abrupt boundary between basalt and peridodite/dunite. We're just not quite sure what mechanism creates such a smooth boundary.

When you hit maybe 150 km deep, the temperature will be around 1300C, and the rock will finally kinda-sorta liquefy. You've hit the *asthenosphere*! This is the ""ocean"" of kinda-sorta liquid rock that the plates move around on top of. I say kinda-sorta liquid because it's not liquid; it's a very ductile solid - the asthenosphere has roughly the consistency of honey. It's still composed of rock, though - you'll find ""ultramafic"" (rocks comparatively rich in magnesium and iron, and poor in silicon) rocks uncommon at the surface like peridotite, dunite, and eclogite.

You dig some more, and around 350 km deep, suddenly everything's solid again! Or, at least, relatively more solid. (At this point, I've given our dear readers who study rheology - the study of deformation and flow of liquids and ductile solids - multiple aneurysms with my fuzzy terminology.) The vast majority of the mantle is actually quite solid, because it's under incredible pressure from all of the stuff above it.

Now it gets boring for a while. You descend through another ~2500 km of solid mantle. There are some features that might be interesting to a geophysicist, but that's about it. You'll dig through the remnants of the Farallon Plate, which has almost entirely subducted underneath the North American Plate. (The Juan de Fuca Plate off Washington and British Columbia is a small leftover piece; the margin will eventually violently rupture, causing a huge offshore earthquake which will cause a tsunami which will be funneled down Puget Sound - bye-bye, Seattle!)

Around 2900 km deep, it starts to get more liquid and more metal. You're getting close to the liquid outer core: a ball of molten iron and nickel. By 3100 km deep you're in a vast ""ocean"" of molten metal.

Finally, after another, even more boring 2000 km, you bang up against the solid inner core - at this depth there's so much pressure that, as with the solid mantle earlier, the iron and nickel is solid, despite the temperature. 1200 km of digging through solid metal later, you've reached the center of the earth.

More realistically, you'll be devoured in a fiery explosion of lava somewhere between 30 and 150 km deep. Remember the recurring theme of ""this is solid because pressure""? Well, remove the pressure, and the rock will instantly melt.

VS is over priced and very poor quality. Despite the super sexy models and commercials, their bras warp, twist, bend, shrink, stretch, or do any number of things. Hand washing does little to prevent the demise and destruction of VS bras and panties. Their garments are poor quality, and over priced. I have spent years dealing their their flowery, sparkly, shimmery, and scratchy as all hell booby and coochie death traps before my body and my wallet called it quits. 

I sucked up my pride and went to visit the old ladies in Macy's lingerie department. While I may have been embarrassed as an old women poked and pulled and prodded, and rushed into my dressing room while my bits were on display, I walked away with the most form fitting, comfortable, and supportive bras I have ever known in my whole life. The pain of fitting was temporary. The enjoyment of a REAL undergarment was worth it. I bought five bras and a bag full of undies (in my defense it was a sale, and I had a coupon, but that's incidental information here)

It's been two+ years since I payed that traumatic visit to Macy's, and I don't regret it in the least, as I have yet to wear ANY of my VS undies, and I wear my Macy's every single day.

The author's claim is wrong because reaction mass ejected from a rocket has both mass and velocity, and therefore also momentum.  By imparting momentum on the reaction mass in one direction, the rocket gains momentum in the opposite direction.  It doesn't matter what state the reaction mass is or the medium it's released into.  Even in the case of a gaseous reaction mass, Graham's law of effusion shows that gas escaping a pressurized container through an opening has velocity.

The author's analysis is flawed in two ways.  First, the principle of free expansion only applies when gas can expand into a vacuum in all directions; in a rocket, it can't do so until after it exits the nozzle.  Second, he assumes the pressure of the system is zero in his work equation, while ignoring the fact that rockets operate at extremely high combustion chamber pressures.

Instead of focusing on 90% of what I said, you chose to focus the bulk of your reply on the one good-natured snark about you posting so much as the self proclaimed new guy.  So let me explain to you, one possible option, as to why people are having an issue with this post in particular.

You've come into a sub that's existed for well over a year, taken a quick glance around over the course of three days, and decided we're not doing a good enough job.  You've looked at a handful of the *thousands* of posts over the past year, and taken it upon yourself to tell 17,500 people, how they should be voting.

Let me explain something fundamental to you: This sub and it's subscribers, have been doing an amazing job at being friendly to newcomers, and as a community, is fucking amazing.  Let me say that again, since you may not have heard me:

**This community is fucking amazing.**

So for you to come in and tell all 17,500 of us that we're harboring such negativity, and that we shouldn't curate what little content we have the same way we have been for over a year, is wildly condescending, and a giant slap in the face to those of us who have been working so hard to help shape this community into what it is today.

So maybe next time you find something new, instead of coming in and shitting all over it, you should hang around for more than a few days before you decide that you know better.

But what the hell do I know about it.

If you truly love a woman's beauty you're going to do your best to initiate and interact with it IN REALITY, not DIGITALLY. This is coming from the guy who can have multiple O's, I understand what it feels like to have a truly strong appreciation of the female body, but trust me, it's a lot better when you are more interactive and less of a voyeur. That would be showing true love for a woman's beauty, not going for the pixels but the real deal.


I mentioned in my other thing that I occasionally have fantasies but those come and go and give me a different feeling than porn, and even softcore pics I know give me the same tastes as porn, except with the mild exception it's like I can try to make excuses and that is already a problem that I know to avoid. You're already trying to do the same thing with porn, except the only difference here is you are looking at a more 'covered-up'/censored version.


I don't think it's just up to us that's trying to say ""No"" here, you are probably saying No to yourself as well.


Edit: I know that the OP here has said a particular subreddit that may cause others to relapse, but come on. I've seen guys here that say explicit sexual experiences (And how that relates to porn being a problem) and others asking if bikini pics or anything else is the same as porn, and people don't downvote those!

I'll take a shot at it.


&gt;The devils went down to Georgia and they were looking for a bowl to steal

&gt;They were playin out of their mind, put TAMU way behind, and had em beaten under their heel

&gt;They came across a young man throwing that football and running it hot

&gt;and ole Cutcliffe jumped on a hickory stump and said boy let me tell you what

&gt;I bet you didn't know it but I got football players too


&gt;and if you care to make a dare I'll make a bet with you

&gt;now you play some pretty good football boy, but give the devils their due

&gt;I bet a chicken platter of gold against your soul cause I think we're better than you

...

&gt;The boy says my names Johnny, and right now it looks like you might win

&gt;but I'll take that bet you're gonna regret cause I'm the best theres ever been

&gt;johnny drop on back to throw and sling that football hard

&gt;and some demon receivers joined in and the touchdowns sounded something like this

[cue a 38-17 run by the Devils/awesome devil solo]

TRUE,webb34,empty-xbox-day-one,,"No. You can't just throw shit into the ""Turn off"" menu. That is breaking the own systems rules and it doesn't provide anything for the user. That menu is *specifically* harder to reach than normal because it contains ""non-forgiving functions"".

In UI design you try and make it so the user can make mistakes. Click a menu? Press B to back out. Accidentally start making a message? Press B to back out. Accidentally press the jewel? Press A to jump right back in because you start out highlighting the game itself. And so on.

If you turn off the system, that's it. There is no coming back from that. You have to turn the console completely on again. Anything you were doing is now gone. The same applies for turning the controller off.

That's why they have to make *absolutely sure* that you want to get into this menu.

There is literally no point in throwing anything else in there.

But you want to simply throw in various sections of a particular app into this menu? No. Absolutely not. You aren't fixing a problem. You are routing around it in a horrible fashion that breaks several rules and guidelines, that are backed up because it would *definitely* make the UI harder to work with.

By old dashboard, do you mean ""Quick Guide""? The menu that popped up when you hit the jewel on the 360's controller? Because also no.

The current system, believe it or not, is actually *vastly* superior. Look at the dashboard on the Xbox One. It is *constantly* running in the background. You press the jewel and BAM there it is. No waiting, no hesitation, no loading, it's just there.

From that one button press you now have *immediate* access to potentially 10 things within a single button press. You have the game itself, whatever you currently have snapped, the option to unsnap it, a full selection of all your games and apps, the disc tray controls, the Friends app(which I will get to in a second), and 4 other apps that are your most used.

What did you get on the 360 within one button press? The option to go to the dashboard, and ""Friends"". 2 things. Clearly inferior, especially when you combine it with the fact that the guide isn't constantly running and takes a while to come up, sometimes upwards of a minute.

You've already acknowledged a major problem:

&gt;Right now the way to get to friends/achievements/party is kinda a hassle and this could make it easier.

**So why are you trying to jury rig some workaround for it? That never ends well. You need to fix the core of the problem.**

How do you fix it? Well, you already have the app right there. When you click on the large tile to the left of the main app tile, it opens up the ""Friends App"". This app is the problem, as you said. 

So what about it do we change?

Well I actually covered this about a month ago and made some mockups for potential alterations to a couple sections of the UI.

You can find I'd go into them here, but there was a lot. Instead, you can find it here:

http://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/1s798d/potential_improvements_to_the_ui/

Notice how in my alterations(for the Friends app at least), I never break the established rules of the system. I'm simply changing the organization of information within that app to be more efficient.

As for some of the other alterations, I didn't break the rules. I *changed the system.* There is a major difference.",0,1388557585,,0,FALSE,1,ceemh27,t3_1u515l,t1_ceemh27,t1_ceem639,1427907493,1,FALSE,xboxone,t5_2xbci,1

TRUE,rainbowblight,,Destructo Girl,"Oz may have come across as a one-dimensional character, but he was just deep and introspective.  Just because he didn't demonstrate any extreme emotions on a regular basis doesn't mean that he wasn't experiencing them (i.e., ""Earshot"", ""New Moon Rising"").  What I saw between Oz and Willow was instant chemistry.  They just understood and trusted one another.  Guided each other.  I loved the moments when Oz was clearly head over heels in love with Willow before he knew her, Willow's cluelessness while she was blinded by Xander, and their adorable moments once they were together.  I just loved the effortless flow of their love story, and the abrupt way in which it ended has always rubbed me the wrong way.

Additionally, while making Oz a werewolf was probably unnecessary, couldn't you argue the same for making Tara a witch?  In a world where the paranormal is normal, I thought introducing a werewolf character was inevitable.  Why not a regular character, and why not as someone we would have to see struggle with it on a regular basis?  Granted, they probably should've waited until they had the budget to make a werewolf not look so... awkward...

Seeing different relationships on television is an essential part to entertainment and definitely helps to promote diversity.  I am absolutely not arguing that fact, and I'm very happy the Willow/Tara relationship was an important factor in your personal story.  However, I think it deserved to be told better, perhaps with a counterpart to Willow as dynamic and compelling as she was/is.

TRUE,Mickey_Maus,writ-pop,,"I. Architecture

Shan Zi is by no means a pretty city. Like mold on a rotting tree, it has spread with no particular plan in mind and with little regard for appearances. Situated upon six islands at the mouth of a river, connected by various bridges and tunnels, the city is a complex mess of tungsten towers, concrete tenements and ancient structures repurposed for commercial use. The only commonality is the near constant smog and the sickly spectrum of neon lights. The streets are metal, old and rusting, and encrusted with the filth of five-hundred years of commerce. The buildings tower above like impossibly tall trees, sprouting walkways, vents, pipes and cables, all tangled together to form an industrial canopy. 

Certain alleyways are so densely covered that no light reaches them. In fact, the city has grown so that there are almost two distinct levels, upper and lower. The upper level sees the sun, built about half/three-quarter ways up the towers (though this varies by location), upon sheets of metal and long bridges. Some bridges are wide boulevards, built by the city engineers, sturdy and reliable, complete with railings, walls, and even buildings. Others are little more that planks of wood on rope, swinging hundreds of feet above the underworld . 

The lower levels are the base streets. Damp and dark, lit only by artificial lights, these areas are home to all things nasty, and a haven for criminals. Not even the city's famously brutal police force dares go down there unless severely prompted. Illegally bored tunnels, and thieve's dens built into crumbling structures from a different time. Shacks and shanties, grottos of murky seawater and collapsed sinkholes-made-bazaars. The lower levels, and below them the sewers, are two worlds better left unexplored.

At the center of the city is the Citadel, a monolithic fortress with no windows, only doors. Fifty stories tall and a mile in diameter, it is the administrative center of the city-state and acts as the capitol building, central jail, military headquarters, treasury and temple. No one knows how or when it was built, only that it contains thousands of rooms and holds some of the greatest treasures in the world. Though the city has been besieged seven times, the Citadel has never once fallen.

II. Commerce 

The Grey River runs through the badlands like a shining stream of silver in a plain and ugly rock. Beginning in the mountains to the south, it is the final stop for badlanders looking to peddle their wares or buy exotic items. The mountains are rich with minerals, Tagrium and Ozillium, gold and iron, copper and jewels. Shan Zi holds a monopoly on the trade of these highly sought-after materials. The Gods' Metals specifically–Tagrium and Ozillum, alone nothing special, but together they form an unbreakable alloy, lighter than steel and more flexible than aluminum. 

As the only major hub in an otherwise desolate desert, it is the destination of all travellesr passing between the fertile kingdoms of the East and West. The city is fabulously wealthy, but—due to its unfortunately scarred surroundings—highly dependent on food imports. A city of fifteen million does not feed itself, after all.

Its 3 major exports are: machinery, godsteel, and automatons. 
Its 3 major imports are: foodstuffs, textiles, and spices

- - -

III. Famous People

*The Voice –*
	
The Voice is an Impossible–a biosynthetic humanoid, a thinking, living machine. But not only that, the Voice is the leader of these peoples. Imps (as they are dubbed, sometimes disdainfully) are most majorly concentrated in Shan Zi. Since they are superior to both men and the other races in nearly all ways, there have been numerous consecrated efforts to eradicate them. They have persevered however, and made Shan Zi there home. 

The Voice speaks for the Consciousness, which many Impossibles believe to be the collective embodiment of the will of their race. What makes the Voice unique is that she has lived for more than a thousand years, since the fall of humanity and the dawn of the New Era. She is one of the few beings to remember the old days. 	

She is immensely influential. A single word from the Voice can mobilize the great majority of Impossibles to war. She can cut of all trade to the outside world and strangle the Grey River. She possesses ascendent psychic powers, and is said to be the only being capable of challenging the Allsight—omnipotent god-emperor of the Eastern and Western Kingdoms. The Voice is feared and respected by subjects and enemies alike. Though the Council Assembly makes most decisions in Shan Zi, she is essentially the de-facto ruler. 

The Voice is rarely seen. She spends much of her time atop to Citadel, in a specially made monastery. 


*Kulur the Unyielding –*
	
Five hundred years ago, the forces of the Allsight came down upon Shan Zi in full might, intent to wipe the Impossibles away permanently. Kulur was chosen to be champion of the Voice. What was unusual about this, was that he was a man. A man of enormous stature, power, and ability, but a man nonetheless. Still, with the city besieged by God and the world, very few Impossibles complained. In the three years the city was under siege, it is said Kulur killed over ten thousand attackers, including seven Grand Marshals, six Dukes, three Archmages and two of the Allsight's earthly avatars.

In the final battle for the city, the Allsight transcended realms and crossed into the Waking World, for the first time since the days of old. For six days Kulur battled the Allsight, the physical manifestation of god on Earth. Each day he was slain, and each day the Voice resurrected him to fight again. On the seventh day of the battle, Kulur—his body so warped by the waters of the river Styx that it was virtually unrecognizable—stepped onto the field to fight once more. The Allsight, seeing that neither the Voice nor Kulur would yield until they were ground into oblivion, and taking pity on the tortured champion, withdrew his forces on the stipulation that Impossibles would never again leave the Badlands, or the ports of his trading cities. 

The Voice agreed, and the war ended. To this day, Kulur is feared among the subjects of the East and West Kingdoms, and revered by humans and Impossibles alike, as a symbol of resistance against the Allsight.

*King Shadow –*

Only one organization has openly opposed the Allsight, within his own borders, and persisted. The Cabal is a crime syndicate with frightening power and influence, and he is their leader. Dubbed King Shadow by his enemies, there is little known about him, other than the fact that he has supposedly lived as long as the Voice, and has never once been seen. Does he even truly exist? Both the Voice and the Allsight believe so, as they have both tried to eradicate him and his forces from their domains. But they have never been successful. Though no one knows King Shadow's place of birth, nationality or race, it is believed that his headquarters is somewhere in Shan Zi.

IV. Unique Items

Godsteel is an alloy of Tagrium and Ozillum, two ores found only in the great unnamed mountains in the southern Badlands. They are mined exclusively by the citizens of Shan Zi–made almost exclusively in Shan Zi, and sold almost exclusively in Shan Zi. Still, the Cabal runs a lucrative Godsteel black market, selling to the Two Kingdoms, and the various other client states of the Allsight.

Godsteel is unbreakable, light, and flexible. Though it must be molded before reaching its final form, it is still easy to manipulate and is used for a variety of things—from the tiny parts in automatons, to the gears which power the Allsight's great machines of war. It does not rust, but also cannot hold an edge. Oddly, when left out to the grey sands of the Badlands, it tends to deteriorate. No one knows why.

- - -

V. Ruling Body

The Council Assembly is an elected body of officials. It creates and passes all the laws in Shan Zi. Made up of one hundred representatives, it is generally evenly split between city-dwelling humans, Impossibles, and an array of various miscellaneous New Races. 

Council members are reelected every five years, though this is a fairly recent development, as of the last three centuries or so. Before that, only highborn could take seats in the Assembly, and once they were there, they were there for life. In those days, it consisted of nearly a thousand members, and was very inefficient. The Voice was, on multiple occasions, forced to make decisions that would otherwise be below her. 

Eventually, she grew fed up with the Assembly's constant stalemating and infighting. She disbanded the old Assembly, barred previous members from sitting on it, and held elections in which any free citizen of Shan Zi could run or vote. The old members were outraged, but after a crackdown by the City Enforcers, their voices were silenced.

Though chaotic at first, after several decades of careful guidance, it has become a semi-efficient governing body. To pass a law, they must have the approval of 65% of the committee. Laws can also be struck down by the Voice if she deems them harmful to the overall development of the city. She rarely intervenes, however.

TRUE,Oh_Fiddlesticks,,,"Fasting (nothing passing the lips, water only, or a certain food, etc.) has been done by humans since time immemorial for personal, spiritual or practical reasons. It is as much a psychological process (If not more so) than a physiological one. People, especially in this day and age, like to extract hard facts from everything around them and anything that cannot be quantified or catalogued is to be razed to the ground. Don't mean to get all high minded on ya, just framing the discussion. People (for and against) think juicing is 'Dr. Zamfram's Magic Elixir of Goodness' but it's pretty basic in its premise. 

As stated in this thread, researching juice fasting is not 'sexy' enough for foundations with limited grants and funds. There have been studies done on medical liquid diets such as MediFast, OptiFast, etc. but are not the same. There are some basic/common sense (For some) things to consider though. 

Crash dieting in any form is bad; it is not the same as fasting or whatever word you wish to use. It's not the same because the stated end goal/result is not the same. People drinking the Hollywood Grapefruit 6 day wonder diet want to lose 10 lbs. for vanity and vapidity. Fasting is done for inner/personal reasons for the purposes of some goal of renewal or a transformation of one's life (Again, this is more mental than physical); if you do it for weight loss alone, you've already lost the battle. You'll run to Papa John's right after you slam that last glass of juice down. 

It's true that, physically, you will not drastically change your body in a week or two after punishing it for decades; and after you are done with your fast, the body will have either expended or expelled the nutrients you drank. Aside from the mental aspect, juice fasting helps point you in the direction of food that will be better for you so that you continue a life sea change. A diet (contrary to the American definition of something one does 5 days before a wedding) is sustainence that a being eats steadily for their LIVES. It has to be a permanent change.

Detoxing/cleansing is another misnomer; the body is always detoxing and cleansing. If it did not, blood poisoning and other nasty things would occur. What is different when juice fasting, is that you are intaking much more fluid which helps speed things along. Almost everyone is dehydrated; your thirst signals only kick in when you are already about a quart low. If your piss isn't clear as glass, you aren't hydrated to the optimum levels. It's similar to running an engine that is rated for 5 quarts of oil but you only have 3 in it. Sure it will run; but the pumps may not be able to lubricate the top of the engine, leaving critical parts exposed causing premature breakdown, overheating etc. EVERYTHING in your body, and just about every process requires a liquid of some type. So, naturally, when you are drinking tons of fluids, you will feel better. It takes about 7 years for your body to entirely replace all the cells it has to become a whole new body; you aren't going to turn into Adonis with 1-2 months of juicing. A note though; you better wash your produce if it's not pesticide/chemical free (And wash it anyway, e. coli sucks) because if not, you'll be drinking all that pesticide with your kale. Kinda ruins the whole detoxing bit eh? 

They (people who are questioning you) will also have the misconception that juice is fruit only and that is bad for you; duh, don't juice fruit only for a fast unless you are vying for the land speed record of ""person who got type 2 diabeetus the fastest"". Vegetables for a base, fruit to taste. 

The other thing people will knock is that you will be deficient in some way from juice fasting; news flash, unless you are a dietician/nutritionist or have your diet planned out by one, I'd bet a month's worth of pay that you are deficient somewhere. And anything is better than the average American diet. This is not a diet in the sense that it will be the new way you eat. It is a temporary event to re-adjust you (So chill out with the 'ZOMGZ WHERE SI TEH PROTEINZ!!!1!). You won't die; the human body can 'run without oil' for a while; trust me. The body will adapt and pull what it needs from less than optimal sources to complete its jobs (Think adipose tissue; lots of good stuff stored in there. and if you are already weigh a buck fiddy, raise calories; don't want you wastin' away). If the guy that runs Soylent didn't die drinking his concotion (Although he got sick; became iron deficient, etc.) then you should have no problem drinking what the good Earth provides as long as you follow proven recipies others have done. Now would I recommend doing two months like some do? Probably not unless you were especially knowledgeable in particular deficiencies for the specific types of food you were juicing and could compensate for that. And the time limit is also a safeguard against idiots pounding kale/spinach and ending up with renal issues after two months due to oxalates. After about a month, I would start blending and introducing nuts, seeds, diary and other food types to start to plug the gaps from the previous month because by then, the juicing has done it's job with resting your digestive tract (You won't need to worry about any of this if you are only doing a week or so juice). Hell, I've heard of people doing water fasts for more than a week which is just insane to me; they must have horrible stomach pains. 

Above all this stuff though, it's mostly mental. It puts you in a different frame of mind. Retrains your palate so you don't pine for that cheeseburger; you instead desire the bed of romaine w/ red peppers salad of luciousness. And it makes more accessable, and you accept,  these strange new alien foods in a way that is easier than eating a 4 lbs. plate of them (Like some people like to say 'just eat the real thing' pfft yea ok). And to those that disagree that juicing helps rest your digestive tract; brother, you don't have Bruce Lee machine gun punching your gut every 10 minutes while you're digesting food like IBS does so let me just stop you right there 'kay?). 

PubMed.gov has some papers on liquid diets, nutrient dense diets etc. nothing specifically on the efficacy of juice fasting that I could find; Vanderbilt did a study on liquid diets that I'll link below:

Start taking notes in a notepad. When he states something material to your job, rephrase what he says to confirm you understand and write that bitch down. 

&gt;Even worse, he does not let me (or anyone else) make any decision in my team on my own.

Try to aim for a middle ground then. Hear our his solution first if possible. Then present a much more outlandish version of your decision.  Make your decision seem much more detailed and extreme than it actually is, but pinpoint the areas that you *actually need* to put the company in his better spot. Keep parts of what he presents and mix in his ideas with your decision - choose your battles to fight and argue. \

&gt;His main problem seems to be that I dare to disagree with him

Pretty much what I said above. Pick your fights and wars - at the end of the day, he holds the trump card. Make your version of things work with his. Compliment his ideas, even if they're bad ones. It'll make you appear to be on the same page. 

&gt;All in all we both expected something different from my promotion. He needs me at the moment because our department is understaffed

If he keeps shutting you down, try to at least get one of your ideas used and presented forward for each project. Keep insisting. If you present a list of 10 things and narrow it down to only 2-3 you want to actually use, it'll be much easier to get those 2-3 ideas forward. Become a fucking brainstorm - present so much shit, argue so much shit. He claims you're in the disagreeing role of the work relationship *use it to your advantage.* Point out the flaws in all of your ideas, but also point out the flaws in his. Seem indecisive with your ideas and show him the thought process from point A to B while eliminating the ""dumb ideas."" You concede. Not every one of your ideas will be used. Let's say you have 2 things you want/know the company needs. If you present 2 forward, you cant expect to ""get your way every time."" But if you present 6 forward, eliminate 4, agree with him on why 4 are bad ideas, then you can much more easily get your way on the two. It'll make him feel right and give him power 66% of the time. In reality, your 33% is the 100% you want approved. Illusion of control.

TRUE,King_of_Avalon,,,"It's not necessarily that it's too small for America. Here's how it works:

In most of the planet, cars are made to international safety standards called the UNECE standards (United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, although it's now international and has little to do with Europe). Just about every country on the planet is a signatory to the ECE standards, and those who aren't will still accept them, *except* the US and Canada.

The US has got its own incompatible safety standards called the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. In many cases, the FMVSS is actually worse than corresponding ECE standards; the rest of the time, like headlamps, it's just arbitrarily different. Canada has the Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, which are basically just the US FMVSS copied and pasted into Canadian law. 

Aside from the differences in design specs like bumpers, headlamps and certain car interior finishings, the main difference between ECE and FMVSS is that ECE parts must all be type approved and tested individually before a car can be certified. This means that every single part on a car must undergo testing to ensure that it meets ECE standards in one of the member states before it can be used. One it's approved by one member state, it's valid in all others. On the other hand, the FMVSS requires no such type approval. Manufacturers simply have to 'promise' that their parts meet FMVSS standards, or else face fines and consequences if too many people start dying because one of their parts fucks up.

As a result of this, car manufacturers wishing to sell a certain model worldwide have to make three versions of each car:

* ECE left-hand drive
* ECE right-hand drive
* US/Canada FMVSS/CMVSS

As a result of the large costs involved in retooling a car only for the American/Canadian market, most manufacturers won't even dream of spending all of the money to rebuild a model unless they think that it will be a reasonable success in North America. Consequently, the US and Canada actually have a shockingly low number of car models available compared to most other places. [Here is an article](http://automotive.about.com/od/AutomotiveTrends/a/We-Investigate-Why-Certain-European-Cars-Are-Not-Sold-In-The-States.htm) that also explains why this happens. 

It's entirely possible that if the US had access to the enormous lines of subcompacts that the rest of the world does, they might actually be modest sellers in major cities, and the car companies would break even. At the very least, they could decide to only import a few to sell just to test the waters and see what happens. But until the US opens up and starts allowing ECE safety standards, we'll never know. 

**EDIT**: Just to add a bit more information for those interested, [here is the Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Forum_for_Harmonization_of_Vehicle_Regulations) about the World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations, the relevant body of the ECE that makes the international standards. You can see under the section for 'North America':

&gt; The most notable non-signatory to the 1958 Agreement is the United States, which has its own Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards and does not recognise UN type approvals. UN-specification vehicles and components which do not also comply with the US regulations therefore cannot be imported to the US without extensive modifications.

This is the law that trips up all those people wanting to import JDM Skylines into the US; according to US law, only cars older than 25 years may be imported if they don't conform to the FMVSS. In Canada, it's only 15 years or older where they don't have to conform to the CMVSS. It's also worth noting that Canada is currently negotiating a massive free trade deal with the European Union, and that deal will include Canada recognising all ECE regulations in addition to FMVSS-compliant vehicles, so it's a good time to be Canadian. 

Another thing that's worth pointing out for those of you interested in economics is that this is a prime example of a [non-tariff trade barrier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-tariff_barriers_to_trade). Of course you're free to import whatever vehicle you want, but of course, [it has to conform to *our* standards only](http://i.imgur.com/dnBIPlA.jpg) (this is in effect a non-monetary way to subsidise the US automotive industry). This is further compounded by other non-tariff barriers such as the [Buy American Act 1933](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buy_American_Act) and the Buy America provision (s. 165) of the [Surface Transportation Assistance Act 1983](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buy_America_Act_%281983%29#Section_165:_.22Buy_America.22_Act); in case you were wondering why all American police cars are Chevy or GM or something like that, there's your answer. Another great example would be the [Fair Packaging and Labeling Act 1966](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Packaging_and_Labeling_Act), which in effect forces the repackaging and labelling requirements of all products sold in the U.S. and is a huge source of contention between the EU and the US. It's also had knock-on effects on Canada's metrication programme that linger until today. In fact, in many ways, the US is internationally infamous for its levels of non-tariff barriers (the lack of use of the metric system being another huge one that has enormous effects on construction/engineering/building materials and paper products, to name just a few examples). Even things that seem as innocuous as [electrical mains voltage and frequency](http://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/d/db/800px-Map_of_the_world_coloured_by_voltage_and_frequency.png/400px-800px-Map_of_the_world_coloured_by_voltage_and_frequency.png) (AC, such as that supplied to most homes) has massive implications on what can and cannot be sold in the US. Electronics manufacturers have to pay close attention to voltage tolerances in their products, and completely rework any spinning motors due to frequency differences; these are especially important for any device designed to heat up, or which has a motor inside that spins. Another example would be mobile phones; there are two issues at play here:

* North America uses [different frequency bands](http://cion.us/cvimg/chinavasion-world-gsm-frequencies-map-500.jpg) than the rest of the world. Therefore, only phones that can operate on three or more bands can actually 'roam' internationally. The rest of the world uses 900 and 1800 bands, North America uses 850 and 1900.
* There are two main types of mobile telephony technology: those based on GSM, and those based on CDMA. The entire planet uses GSM (your unique subscriber information is held on a removable SIM card), but North America and Japan also use CDMA (a non-removable chip inside the phone carries the information). In the US, AT&amp;T and T-Mobile are GSM; Verizon and Sprint are CDMA. Therefore, even with the differences in frequency, if you're a GSM customer you'll probably have no problems roaming internationally if your phone is quad-band, as most smartphones are. If you're a Verizon customer, you'll have extremely limited functionality abroad unless you go to Japan or Canada.

In short, if you're in the US, virtually everything you see around you is made to entirely different specifications; nothing you have could likely be sold abroad, and vice versa. This is by design, and it gouges the American consumer both in terms of price and choice. And for the Republicans to be the free-trade shills that they are, it strikes me as interesting that they're the primary proponents and creators of such barriers.

TRUE,Enchanted_Bunny, points,3∆,"JIf you are arguing on the basis that a fetus is a human being with the full rights of any human being, you cannot justify a rape exception. The fetus has no control over the circumstances of its conception. Since we do not penalize people for things they didn't do, then this argument requires that rape be irrelevant to the situation, which negates the ""they freely chose to do this"" argument.

&gt;as a modern society we generally try to afford individuals as many freedoms as possible provided they aren't infringing upon the rights of another human (current or future)

An unwanted unborn child is infringing upon the rights of its mother. Let me give you an example.

I decide to take a drive one day. I know the risks involved with driving. I know that many people die in car accidents every day and that I'm taking a risk. I do things to mitigate that risk. I wear my seat belt, keep my car in good working order, etc. 

So I go out and I get a text while I'm driving. I know better than to answer it, but something just doesn't click for me that day, and I start typing. I never see the woman with the van-load of kids. I slam into them. Dazed, I wake up in a hospital bed. A doctor and a policeman are talking to me. They're telling me something...something about some ""new procedure."" They know I was texting and that it was my fault.

Next thing I know I wake up but I feel very weak. I look over to my left and there's a woman. A doctor is in the room and he explains to me this is the woman I hit with my car. Since we are of the same blood type, they have joined our circulatory systems together so my heart can pump blood for both of us. This puts strain on my heart and makes me very weak. The doctor says I will have to remain like this for 9 months until the woman recovers. I tell him I didn't consent to this. He tells me I should have thought of that before texting and driving. He says if I remove any of the needles or tubes I will be charged with murder and thrown into prison. Then he leaves the room.

Here is the million-dollar question: is what happened to me in the above example just? Notice that leaving myself hooked up would most definitely be the *right* thing to do. I am not questioning that at all.

But, should I be *forced* to give up my bodily autonomy in order to support another human beings life? To go back to reality and get rid of the fictional dual-circulatory-system, should I be legally required to donate an organ to this woman? The phrase ""legally required"" is key here.

Right or wrong is irrelevant to the law. The law allows many ""wrong"" behaviors and actions, because not allowing them would be repressive. We know it's wrong to lie, but it (usually) isn't *illegal* to lie. We have to face the consequences of lying on our own.

My pro-choice argument is that the preservation of freedom *requires* us to have bodily autonomy. People only have a legal ""right"" to life if their bodies can support life on their own. Forcing other people to sacrifice their bodily autonomy for the benefit of others is over the line. We regularly allow people to make end-of-life decisions for others who are in a situation where they cannot maintain their lives on their own. The question of right and wrong here is irrelevant. What really matters is the legality.

Bodily autonomy is essential to freedom and human rights. That is why I support the legality of abortion.

TRUE,myWorkAccount840,,,"Both drives are already full of data.

One of the drives is filled with structured data that represents electronic files that have been stored onto it (the ""full"" drive), while the other drive only contains random data (the ""empty"" drive).

Both drives contain the same data-holding equipment, whether it's a rotary hard disk drive, or a solid state drive. Think of that equipment as a series of on/off switches. In the ""full"" drive, all the switches are set deliberately, in the pattern of the data that we want. In the ""empty"" drive, we haven't set the switches to anything, so they don't contain ""real"" data, they just happen to be set a certain way, that doesn't mean anything.

In either case, though, you've still got the same set of switches to store the data, so they weigh the same. Adding data just means flipping various switches, not building more switches to flip.

Going deeper into things, though, there are two parts to storing data on your hard drive. The first part is the ""switches"" I've already mentioned. They store the data you've put onto the drive.

The second part is a big list that tells your drive where all the data is stored. So adding a file to your drive involves two parts. First the drive flips all the switches it needs to store the data, then it adds to the list that tells it where all of the files are stored.

This means that in order to ""delete"" data, all it needs to do is to erase the data from the *list*, so that it knows those switches aren't being used for anything any more. Once the data no longer appears in the list, the drive doesn't know it's there, it only knows that there's new ""empty"" space it can use to fill with more data.

In this case, the data that you asked the drive to store for you is still there, in the position of the switches, but the drive no longer knows about it, because it no longer appears on the list. If you asked the drive to store the data for you again, it couldn't simply say ""Oh, I remember storing that once, let me just put it back on the list"", because the list is the drive's *only* memory of where the data is. Once the data is out of the list, the drive forgets about it, and if you ask it to store the same file again, it will just make a new copy of the data and add that copy to the list.

What this means, though, is that we can actually run software that can ""undelete"" files for us by looking at areas of the disk that the disk itself believes are empty. Many file types, such as pictures and sound files, begin with what we call ""header"" data, which gives basic information about the file such as how long the audio lasts for, or how many pixels wide and how many pixels tall the picture is. We can use disk-scanning software to read the empty areas of the disk and try to use this information to piece together files where we know enough information from the file header to make a guess at what the file looks like on the disk.

Do you have a plug in CO detector that just goes into an outlet?

Guess what, that CO detector is going to be FAR less effective than one put either on the ceiling or about a foot down from the top of the ceiling on a wall (this is the same thing for smoke detectors you need to mount them a bit down off the ceiling when they are on a wall otherwise they will sit in an area of low/no air movement and will be less effective at doing the job they were designed to do)


Don't believe me? okay, lets do this, go get your CO detector that plugs into the wall and look at the back of it. You may notice now (at least if its not 15+ years old) that you can slide a plastic cover on the back of it off right near the prongs that plug into the wall

Do it, and you should see that your CO detector actually has a cord!!

This is because they should be mounted HIGH, and not LOW.

TRUE,CursoryComb,brown,1,"Ok, I'm with you 100% on this, and this stupid argument that we didn't have competent QB play, like QBs are some stock material guaranteed to get you X number quarterback rating.  So I went through and looked at some differences using QB Rating (not the best but easiest to find) which isn't the best, so I also put in Team Pass Success Rating.

Team (+/- wins) QB Rating - '13 - '12 ([Pass Success Rate Rank](http://wp.advancednflstats.com/teampage.php)):

Bills (=) - 75 - 82.2 = -7.2 (29th) *New Rookie QB

Jags (=) - 71.8 - 74.7 = -2.9 (24th) **Same as previous year**, Chad, Career 75 Rating, Henne

Bears (-2) - 96.9 - 80.4 = +16.5 (5th) Tresmen was able to work McCown into above average play (3-3 majority snaps), **but same QB situation as last year**

Cards (+5) - 83.9 - 63.1 = +20.8 (9th)  *Brought in an average veteran (to Campbell's 76)

Chargers (+2) - 105.5 - 88.5 = +17 (2nd) **Same exact QB as last year**

Eagles (+6) - 102.7 - 78.6 = +24.1 (16th) **Same exact QB as last year**

Chiefs (+9) - 88.6 - 63.8 = +24.8 (18th) *Brought in an average veteran

**Browns (-1) - 75.7 - 73.6 = +2.1 (32)**

Here's what I get from all this information.  It was probably a good idea to get rid of Chud and Norv.  Four of these teams had the same exact QB situation and 3 of them got a huge increase in performance for those same exact players.  Two others brought in ""average veterans"" and, instead of relying on them, used balanced offenses to cope with average play.  Alex Smith's rating went way down, but the team didn't need him to be great.  Carson Palmer stayed at roughly the same rating but the defense played lights out.

The mistake the Browns made was relying [solely on passing the ball](http://i.imgur.com/YaE7OwY.png) more than every other team in the NFL!  Maybe we had below average QB play, but all mistakes are magnified if all you do is pass.  You have about the same number of mistakes per throw, but since you throw so much those mistakes happen much more often.

**We had an INT rate of a fraction more than 2% which is almost dead middle, average.**  Andy Dalton by any measure would be an awful QB if he didn't have a successful defense and ungodly amount of talent around him.

My whole point here is that competent QB play most likely stems from some combination of coaching, supporting cast, amount of use, and the player themselves.  Of course every player has a ceiling, but we really did get average QB play. 

I'd throw my blame 60% Front Office, 30% Coaching Staff, 10% QBs.

An interesting aside is that our Pass Success Rate actually went down from 42% to 39%, but we threw the ball over 100 less times last year.",0,1388589260,,0,1388590905,1,ceergl5,t3_1u4icr,t1_ceergl5,t1_ceeg7c9,1427903863,12,FALSE,Browns,t5_2s1wh,12

I'm 34 now.  As a teenager I worked every day after school and every weekend--I never had any fun.  In college I lived at home and commuted, worked most nights and many weekends--Never went to a single party, never took a trip, etc... Graduated and spent my early 20s living at home, worked salaried but spent 60+ hours per week at work, my weekends were very low key, basically a hermit.  I watched the friends I had in college pair up with girls, take trips, live in interesting places... I was at home.  

In my late 20s I met a great girl, we were together 5 years, but I was always planning and worrying... she was more a free spirit (but responsible).  She wanted to take a trip, I calculated exactly how much we'd have to save each month to be able to do it and then that would become a wet blanket over other things because I wanted us to save for a house and be able to be single income parents... We got the house, but she left because she just wasn't really happy, I think I wasn't exciting enough and was too worried about the details of life and money.

I've spent the past 2 years trying to discover who I am, and I'm realizing that I'm just a boring person... the only interesting things I've done have been with my ex's... 

I am 34 now, and I refuse to wake up one day after my 40th birthday and realize that I spent what are arguably the best two decades of my life worrying about money and avoiding fun because of the cost.

The whole purpose of earning a living is to live.  Sometimes people are in a circumstance where their lives are boring or limited out of necessity, and that's fine... but if you have the option, get out there and do things!

Carbon Monoxide (CO) is the bi-product of partial combustion, i.e. Material not burning at 100% efficiency. It is colorless, odorless, tasteless and can silently kill you without you even knowing what is occurring. Fire places, oil burners, dryers, anything that produces an exhaust in your home, has the potential to leak into your home, exposing you and your family to this toxin.

Depending on the concentration (parts per million, or PPM) of CO in the air, effects can range from nothing at less then 35ppm over 8 hours, to headaches (100-400 ppm over 4 hours) nausea and dizziness (800ppm within an hour), confusion and convulsions  (1,600 ppm in 20 minutes - at that concentration death will occur in 2 hours) at 3,200ppm death will occur in 20 minutes, at 6,400ppm respiratory arrest and death in less then 20 minutes, and at 12,800 death will occur in 1-2 breaths. 

What is important to realize here, is that for every 1% of oxygen that is displaced in the air, 10,000ppm of CO is present in a leak. So if you have 35ppm of CO in the air, only .0035% of the air is actually CO, making this gas extremely hazardous to your health.

CO is also highly explosive at a concentration of 12.5-74.2%.

In certain states in the US, NY being one of them, it is now law to have a carbon monoxide detector in every private residence.

Edit: to add to the points before, yes CO displaces oxygen. Their molecules are extremely similar. 

CO is dangerous at low concentrations because of it's affinity to hemoglobin in the blood. Hemoglobin is 200x more attracted to CO then O2. The only way to quickly and safely remove CO poising from the body, is through a hyperbaric chamber. It is extremely difficult for CO to be removed from the hemoglobin once attached.

Apparently you can't save during the VN (story) scenes, nor can you save while you're in the middle of a dungeon.  Sometimes they make you do back-to-back dungeons without giving you a chance to save, which people seem to complain about.

Once you're at the town map menu, press the start button and navigate to the Save menu by hitting R or L.  The button you're looking for is セーブ (save).

What you don't see is that Jamal and his Mother were neglected and abandoned by his Father, Paul. Paul was physically abused, never shown affection by his father Chris, because Chris would work everyday of his life doing menial tasks in a company where only White people could see advancement despite the fact that he had been there much longer and had more experience and skill. He quickly reasoned that his Son would have to work like a machine to have any chance in such a cruel and unjust world. And in order to cope with the stress, he picked up a drinking habit that inevitably spilled over into the home. Chris's Father was a very hard worker too and never had a chance to go to school because his Father Wesley was lynched at the young age of 23 by a groups of drunk closet racist while simply trying to walk back home from a farm field. 

So until you realize that these types of situations have played out THOUSANDS of times, then you will NEVER understand why slavery is relevant, and why in your seemingly small mind Black people seem to always bring it up.  All those years of hatred, discrimination, injustice, social hinderances, rape, murder, neglect etc heaped on to Black people for all those years. 
Where do you think it goes?? You think a tiny fairy comes flying down to sweep up all those negatives into a little bottle and tuck it away behind a rainbow so that they can't do any more harm to anyone?! No. ALL of those horrible negatives penetrate the next generation and the next, and then are compounded by people who think that since slavery happened yesterday that Black people are just supposed to move forward as if the playing field had been leveled now.  I guess that's why it took this long to have a 'pseudo-Black' President? Because things have been so equal and fair immediately after slavery? Right? 
Perhaps if Jamal's ancestors were not harassed, belittled, abused, raped, cheated, robbed and killed by the ancestors of James Andrew Johnson's, then perhaps his lot in life might be a little different. Perhaps Jamal's 15 kids are a direct result of James' ancestor having 15 slaves.

While still tasty it lacks substance, made to satisfy the lowest common denominator with poor taste and a low budget. 

What started as a delicious cheese pizza got more and more complex, everyone had their own ideas on what a good pizza tasted like and kept adding ingredients pepperoni, olives, sausage, life was good. Variety was what made the pizza great and it worked for many years, then people stopped agreeing on ingredients. Vegetarians refused to let pepperoni even be on one half of the pizza and eventually pizzas stopped being made for awhile because of it. On top of that, a corporation bought the pizza parlor and converted it to a franchise. 

Now instead of the people having a real say in the choice of ingredients, the company has decided to put their interests first, using lower quality ingredients and hiring employees at minimum wage that give terrible service. To make up for the decrease in quality and service, the company started creating cheap, ridiculous, wild, unsustainable promotions; ""4 pizzas for four dollars!"" ""try our new lasagna pizza"" ""... with pizza rolls baked right into the crust"" and their best seller the deep dish bacon cheeseburger pizza, a pizza overloaded with cheese, made from a ready-made crust mass produced in a factory barely able to support the weight of its own ingredients. People became content and even started embracing the deals and stopped noticing the decline in quality and were only interested in the next deal or superfluous ingredient that the company would throw onto the pizza.

Eventually people forgot the taste of real pizza and became mostly content with the company's way; sure people still argue over the best way to slice the deep dish bacon cheeseburger pizza, whether adding crushed peppers or Parmesan cheese is good and there are some traditionalists who want the pizzas go back to how they were but they are all buying eating and purchasing the same pizza so in the end it makes no difference.

TRUE,lshiva,,,"I spent about 2 years planning the trip, and 5 years saving the money for it.  In the US I stayed at campgrounds or free campsites in city parks (Kansas and Missouri allow it along the Transamerica).  In Australia I camped, or stayed at hostels.  Mostly hostels once I found out they were charging equivalent prices and had them all over the place.  In the Outback I often just camped on the side of the road.  Far enough away from the road to avoid crazy drunk driver crashes, and often behind some natural barrier to avoid the curious.  In Asia hotels were from $5-$15 so I just stayed there, especially since camping isn't as big a thing.  Some people I talked to had luck asking for permission to camp in people's yards, but I really appreciated the running water, wifi, and privacy that a room afforded me at the end of a day.  Europe was back to camping again, but as in most larger cities I would get a hotel room so I could explore without worrying about my stuff I ended up staying in a lot of hotels in Europe.

My planning started with me brainstorming a giant list of all the cool things I'd heard about in the world that I wanted to see.  Then I made a basic plot of a route that would take me past most of them.  Then I started reading about the areas I would be going through in travel books, traveler journals, weather reports, and anything else I could find.  I started putting together a rough estimation of distances between places, figured out how long it would take me to get from place to place, looked at visa requirements, border crossings, elevation maps, and so on in order to get an even more detailed idea of where I needed to go.  Cross-referencing climate with travel dates let me shift my schedule around so I could avoid winter throughout the whole trip, flying to Australia in the northern hemisphere's fall, and crossing over the equator to the north as the seasons changed again, heading north with the spring.  All this turned into a giant spreadsheet with daily mileage estimates, rest days, tourism days and so forth.  I plugged in estimates on prices and used that as a budget to plan for how much I needed to save.  

While I was doing all this planning I also started doing more and more tours in the US.  Lots of overnight camping, and once or twice a year a week or two long tour.  Around Lake Michigan, Seattle to San Francisco, RAGBRAI, the KATY trail, the Natchez Trace Parkway.  Lots of rides to test out gear, find what worked for me, and most importantly of all, test my enjoyment of spending long days on a bike and nights in a tent.  I put on thousands of miles doing that, and in doing so was able to be confident in my gear, my own abilities, and my knowledge of what I was capable of.  Quite a long way from my very first tour.  On that one I actually carried a spare blanket because my sleeping bag wasn't warm enough at night, and I had to walk my bike up lots of hills.  Now I know what it feels like to spend hours riding to the top of a mountain pass, and minutes coasting back down the far side.

It's easy enough to just toss some gear together and hop on your bike.  If you're really interested in it, start doing some overnight camping trips with your bike.  In less than 24 hours you can get a good idea of how prepared you are for it.  Also, check out AdventureCycling.org if you're in the US.

Yes.  This is a good way to view your path.  It would be different if you were a nun/monk but that is not the case.  We all live in the world and our practice of meditation needs to be used in a way that helps us move through the world in a harmonious way...cultivating a state of mind that supports engaging with the world with grace and dignity.


&gt;confronting this fear in a harmonious way


Do you know anything about Judo, the martial art?  One of the principles of Judo is to be like water.  To yield in order to overcome.  To be fluid and flexible enough to move with your ""opponents"" energy/attack as opposed to fighting against the ""opponent"".  By this method the Judo master uses the ""energy/attack"" that their opponent throws at them to solve the problem by redirecting the ""energy/attack"" in a way that diffuses it.


What does this have to do with meditation?  :  )  It is directly related and here is why.   Meditation can allow us to view challenges, ""problems"" from a completely new perspective.  From a place that is not rigid, no, from a place that is accepting, flexible and fluid.  This is not an easy path, it requires courage.  NOT fearlessness but courage, study the difference if you are not sure you clearly understand.  Via meditation we learn to accept and acknowledge everything that arises.  We learn to face anything that comes up during meditation without grasping after it or running away from it.  This is fundamental in the development of the courage we need to face our fears in the ""real"" world.  To face all that arises in the real-world directly...honestly...with as much compassion as possible.


Part of what happens when you practice an effective form of meditation is that YOU change, your mind is transformed.  This can result in learning to relate to friends and family in new ways.  Sometimes this means that you will lose interest in certain things/activities that used to be a glue, a common activity that helped hold you and your friends together.   


There can be many ways to look at this but lets just narrow it down to two.

1.  This is where the Judo comes in.  The concern was that others may view you as boring in ""normal"" social situations.  Instead of worrying about this (and allowing that worry to prevent you from socializing or causing you to behave anti-socially) YOU use that worry to motivate you to socialize in a healthy/harmonious way.  You have through your practice of meditation developed your skill of concentration.  Put that skill to use when you are in social situations.  Challenge yourself to focus ALL of your attention on the person you are interacting with.  Use that focus to notice interesting things about that person and to pay incredibly close attention to what they are saying to you.  Use your skills to become a master of listening.  This endears you to people and will allow you to make insightful and interesting comments in response to what the person you are engaging with says.  

2. The second part is (this may seem paradoxical) recognizing that it is not healthy to force yourself to do things that you do not enjoy or spend time with people who do not share your interests and values.  You may need to seek out new people and friends that more closely share your values and interests.

When my father died, I was on a plane coming up to see him.  We'd been estranged (his choice) for several years, but in what turned out to be his final year, I initiated a reconciliation, which he surprisingly welcomed.  So, at least there's that.  He'd always said he didn't want a deathbed vigil, anyway.
    
Mom &amp; I were extremely close my whole life.  When she could no longer live alone, she insisted upon moving in with me.  This hurt our relationship, but given circumstances I won't go into, it was the best choice.  I took care of her by myself for eight years while her health steadily declined.  Even through our mutual strain, we remained very close, and a different bond formed (role reversal). We shared a fondness for Christmas; it was always a special time for us, looking at all the pretty decorations everywhere and singing carols.  Three weeks before Christmas, doctors said there was nothing more to be done.  On Dec 11th, she died in hospice.  If my fiance had not been with me that week and the week after, I don't know how I would have gotten through it.

Mom was not at my wedding.  She has not been able to enjoy my four wonderful stepchildren.  She will not be here when my first grandchild is born this month.  I will never again hear her laugh.  It's been four years, and though my life now is wonderfully happy, a passing memory can bring back the initial grief as if it just happened yesterday.  You just have to deal with it, but isn't it wonderful to have had someone for so many years who meant so much?

I know she's free of pain now.  I know that she had outlived--by several years-- every life expectancy estimate given by each of her doctors.  And I know that the reason she hung on so long is because she wanted to make sure I wouldn't be alone...she said this to my than-bf when he told her he had the ring and planned to propose to me.  And didn't she just LOVE knowing that before I did!

Cling to humor.

I'd create a vast lake with a several tile long patch of land in the centre.  I'd build all facilities necessary for life - bathrooms, stalls, even entertainment and carousels.  I'd even put a maintenance man in to clean the spills and a mascot to keep children happy in their newfound home. 

And a new home it would be for all the guests I hand-selected to live on the Island.  They may have wanted to leave the Island, having a home and family to return to, but after a few weeks they would learn to like this land and their new ""family"" of guests.  They had everything they could possibly want, and I was in the financial situation where I could offer them all services for free.  Life was a heaven for them, whether they liked it or not.  

But I was not a fully constraining God.  If the guests truly wanted to leave the Island, there was always one way out.  A massive, custom designed Loop-de-Loop roller coaster was the only method of leaving the island, capable of launching the riders off its end.  It was expensive, terribly so, but some antsy guests were willing to do anything to return to their past lives, and I was kind enough to grant them their wish.  As they'd excitedly board their final ride on the Island, they'd feel excitement yet apprehension, as though something felt terribly, dangerously wrong.  

The ride would take off.  Acceleration would launch the riders at incalculable speeds through the loop.  As they reached the end of the track, reaching towards the sky, they'd realise they had made a terrible mistake.  They would launch, and from above see the park sprawling below them, in the distance the town in which they lived in.  Some could even see their homes, and for a moment forget their terror for their longing.  

The ride car would then fall.  They were far past the lake now, hurtling towards the ground at a hundred miles per hour.   Some would cry.  Some would pray.  Some would laugh.  Some would apologise profusely, begging me to let them back on the Island and forget they ever wanted to leave.  All landed in an explosive, fiery crash that caused bumper cars to jitter all the way through the park.  They denied my heaven, let's hope they found their way to a better one. 

Yeah, I seriously wish I could get RCT to work on Windows 7 though lol

TRUE,angryfirelord,,,"Fedora doesn't include subpixel rendering in the freetype package because it's patent encumbered. If you disabled it in Ubuntu, you'd probably encounter the same thing. Therefore, you can try two things.

-Install freetype-freeworld. This package is in the RPMFusion repository, which you'll have to enable. Once the new freetype package is installed, you can install the gnome-tweak-tool and fiddle with the hinting settings. In addition, you can place a configuration file in $HOME/.config/fontconfig/fonts.conf. I've found some examples from other distributions which you can try:

https://wiki.debian.org/Fonts#Subpixel-hinting_and_Font-smoothing

http://duganchen.ca/writings/slackware/fonts/ (scroll down the page to find it)

Don't put it directly in your $HOME path as it was [depreciated](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/Fontconfig2.10#Release_Notes) a little while ago.

-Install infinality. Some people like this, others don't. It's certainly worth a try. This requires setting up another repository, but it's quite easy to do so.

&gt; rpm -Uvh http://www.infinality.net/fedora/linux/infinality-repo-1.0-1.noarch.rpm

&gt; yum install freetype-infinality fontconfig-infinality

If you don't like it, just remove the two infinality packages. However, I would not mix freetype-infinality with freetype-freeworld so make sure only one or the other is installed.

Just remember that font rendering is subjective.

Edit: One thing I found that helped was getting a better monitor. My previous monitor was 7 years old and I had to keep it at a 1024x768 resolution or the fonts in its native resolution would be too hard to see. I got a new one and everything looks a lot better. But I see yours is set to 1366x768, so I'm assuming you installed it on a laptop.

TRUE,Mispey,,,"I just posted this in the other identical thread, but since a lot of people are confused I am just going to copy paste it here. 

Let's explain this, because I hate when people pretend everyone reads the articles on Reddit.

**Here is what happened and how it happened:**

When you have an app you need to create a way for the app to talk to your servers. You basically write your own little App&lt;-&gt;Server language. You do things like give the app a way to say *""I am looking for a new picture, can you give it to me. I am Mispey and this is my secret code""* and the server says *""Thanks for the secret code, Mispey...here is the picture data""*. This is called an API. The secret code is (basically) your password. 

If you study this language you can learn the language and then make scripts that do essentially the same thing and pretend they are the official application. It is not possible to grab the snapchats of others because of the secret code that is required. Nearly everything sensitive requires a secret code, except for one function....

There is also a way for the app to take the phone numbers from your address book and ask to return an account, if there is one, attached to a certain phone number. This does not require any sort of secret code (and the secret code wouldn't help anyway, since everyone can theoretically get their own secret code). This is part of the finding your friends feature on Snapchat. 

It turns out that this could be run in bulk. If you knew every phone number of every snapchat user it would only take about a day to generate a listing of every account-phone number combination. There is now a rate limit on this, so it cannot be run in bulk so easily but it is still possible to scrape phone numbers and be easily circumvented as of the time of this writing. 

Someone made a script that put in any particular phone number, real or not, and tried to see if a user account came back. They basically tried many popular area codes and went for it (XXX-000-0000, XXX-000-0001, XXX-000-0002 and so on). If they got a result they logged it into a database. This is how SnapchatDB was created.

The company, Gibson Security, informed Snapchat of this possible vulnerability a long time ago. Snapchat did not deal with it. They then published the information about how the exploit worked as part of a disclosure document. **SnapchatDB acted on this information and published it with the last two digits of any phone number deleted. Anyone else could have done the same thing but with the full phone number.** In fact, you should expect a new version of the DB to come out without deleted phone numbers. It might not happen, but someone else has a copy of this DB with full phone numbers. **This means that if your phone number is not on this list it might be on ANOTHER LIST.**

This is the Full Disclosure document that fully documents the API: http://gibsonsec.org/snapchat/fulldisclosure/

The part about grabbing phone numbers is near the bottom. 

**Why does this suck?**

* Because Snapchat had a lot of time to act on this (GibsonSec first contacted them 7/27/13, then released this without full disclosure publicly 8/27/13, then again full disclosure on 12/27/13, then Snapchat responded for the first time saying it is not an issue and difficult to create a database, then someone created a database before NYE) - That's 5 months total. 

* Because Snapchat told us that this was challenging to do, but it was actually very simple and took very little time (a matter of days) to collect all of this data

* Because the app worked in a way that made the user feel as if the phone number was not findable from a username, therefore giving out your snapchat username was relatively ""anonymous""

* Many people did act on this anonymity, for example girls on GoneWild might be finding out a lot of people have their personal phone number now. ",0,1388607613,,0,1388629425,1,ceexk3m,t3_1u5rmd,t1_ceexk3m,t3_1u5rmd,1427900945,182,FALSE,technology,t5_2qh16,182

TRUE,[deleted],,,"Part of my job is as a resume writer, but I try to keep up with networking and career consulting, too, as it helps with planning the resume side of things. I found a disc set once called ""The Hire Road"" - it's not very great production-wise (you can tell they were on a limited budget), but the content in it is awesome. They do a great job showing you how to go beyond online job boards, which are honestly the absolute worst way to get a job.

If you don't want to go buy something to help with job hunting, then I highly recommend the following:

First, get a polished resume. Seek out someone who can do it professionally. Even if you don't have a lot of money, trust me, it's worth it. Getting your resume done professionally will help you focus your goals and objectives, and it will help you figure out where you want to focus your job hunting endeavors. If you're feeling lost, seeking out a career adviser or vocational counselor is good, too.

There are plenty who offer online services (the small business I'm a part of does), but in your case, I'd actually recommend finding someone close to you, who you can talk to in person. A lot of resume writers like to hide themselves, never have contact with their clients, just write the resume and pass it on - that can work, but you sound like you're going to be in a more difficult position than most, and I think a good conversation would probably help you figure out where you need to go.

Second, learn about LinkedIn. Seriously. LinkedIn, if used properly, is where the job scene is at. You can't approach it passively like most people do, but if you start right now polishing your profile, being an active part of groups you find interesting, and posting updates that show you're smart, intelligent, and looking for a recruiter, it's not too hard to get feedback. At the very least, if you include a link to your profile on your resume, it should give any potential employer a chance to see who you are in more detail. It can only be a good (even great) thing if used properly.

Last, but not least, set a rigid schedule for yourself and stick to it. Recognize that right here, right now, your new job is to find a job. You are not unemployed - you are self employed. That means that you will work 40 hours a week, and your new job entails:

* Getting your resume in order
* Getting on LinkedIn and polishing your profile
* Networking with friends and family to see if they know of any open positions they can help you with
* Applying on job boards and proactively sending out your resume to companies you're interested in (even if you don't see an opening - the opening oftentimes means it's too late)
* Sticking to a rigid schedule (wake up early no matter what, have consistent ""working hours"" no matter what)
* Working out three days a week, the exercise will keep you motivated
* Learning new skills and reading new books - if you aren't working, then you should be making yourself more employable all the time

Anyway, sorry for the big speech. I deal with people every day who are in situations similar to yours, though, and I know from personal experience just how depressing and overwhelming things can be. Breaking things down into a list that you can follow will help. The worst thing you can do is just start spamming the job boards. That's a waste of your time, and it will only make you more depressed, as it's the most inefficient way to find a new job and you'll start to wonder if anybody really wants you as you apply for the 500th position without getting any feedback (been there, done that, never doing it again).

I really hope this helps. It's a sucky way to start off the New Year. But you *can* take control of the situation and come out better off for it. I've seen others do it over and over again. Best of luck to you!

I never met my biological father. He cut and run before I was even born. I have two sister's that I've known all my life. But a brother and sister that I didn't know existed until I graduated high school. I keep in contact with them regularly. One day Cassie (the sister I've never met) asked me if I wanted to talk to Ellis (my bio-father). I told her very politely no. She left it at that for a few weeks, and then she asked me again. Again, I said no. This time a few months went by before she asked again. And when she did, I told her that I have a dad. I've had a father in my life since I was around 2 or 3. He married my mother when I was 6, and he legally adopted me as his son when we moved to Nebraska from California in '95. He's the man that's been there for me. He's the man that punished me for sneaking out. He's the one that was there at my basketball games, my wrestling matches, my track meets. He was there when my son was born. He was there when my best friend and love of my life left me. And he was there this morning when I dropped by to say hello. That man is the reason I am the person I am today. I'm never going to see Ellis. I'm never going to talk to him. And I'm never going to ask him why he didn't want me. Because I found someone who did want me. And he's a hell of a dad. And I'm a hell of a dad because of everything that he taught me. I tell him that I love him, but nowhere near often enough. I know that this little speech doesn't have to do with James Avery passing. But its the first thing that came to mind after I watched that clip about Will's dad leaving. The question at the end ""Why doesn't he want me man?"" It really got me. But I found an answer. An answer that applies to that situation, mine, and I'm sure countless others from my reddit brothers and sisters. He didn't want me, but that doesn't matter, because the right one did want me. And that made every difference in my life.

Rest in peace Uncle Phil.

Buggy or not, the attention to detail in Battlefield 4 shows to me that they're passionate about their work. They're a friendly and dedicated bunch of people, and I don't believe for one second that they intended for things to end up this way.

Then you've got EA. They've got DICE on a choke chain, where constant greed and gross incompetence completely ruins the experience from the consumer's perspective. Whether we like it or not the two entities are attached. You can't punish one without punishing the other. Therein lies the problem.

It's a sensitive situation because if history has taught us anything about EA, it's that they'll sooner throw their development teams under a bus than to blame themselves on the failure of a franchise. So as much as I'd love to watch EA go under right now financially through some unprecedented recall on Battlefield 4, it would most likely end up being misconstrued as consumers no longer having any interest in the Battlefield series. Yes, EA is that dumb.

They most recently blamed the failure of the Medal of Honor (reboot) series on [""combat authenticity""](http://www.tomshardware.com/news/Medal-of-Honor-Warfighter-EA,20805.html). That franchise is now on hold indefinitely as a result. Okay so their decision to stop investing in Medal of Honor made business sense. *However* the reason they gave for its failure pretty much shows how out of touch they are with what was really wrong with the game.

I feel like if we all asked for a refund on Battlefield 4, it'll be Battlefield's turn to be next on the chopping block. And in reality this is not purely the fault of DICE, but rather EA itself who insisted that it be rushed out the door when they knew the game was incomplete. So yeah, it's a lose-lose situation.

Slavery and mistreatment of human beings is not some competition. It should not be a dick measuring contest to ascertain who had life worse throughout [documented, Western] history.

Furthermore, and i think ultimately, whenever slavery is brought up in an American context, no one is talking about a universal concept of slavery. If we are going to talk about that universal concept, then let's arrive at a universal answer: it's wrong. Period. 

We need to have a *What We Talk About When We Talk about Slavery* forum, or something. Whenever slavery is brought up in the aforementioned American context, it references the *specific* social construct of race implemented by the Virginia House of Burgesses and the resulting, *systematic* centuries-long dehumanization of black Americans that has had reverberating and lasting effects on both social perception and stratification.

Taking as balanced a perspective as a I can, I believe that the narrative of black Amerians must stop centering on seeing them/ourselves as [former] slaves. That bullshit narrative so quickly perpetuated by our so-called ""black leaders"" creates more problems than it attempts to solve. I understand that American history has been largely terrible for black Americans (and i say this meaning black Americans as a whole, because I know that someone will more than likely bring up the Irish argument), but if *all we do* is focus on history, then this cycle will continue. Lines have to be drawn somewhere, I believe, but no one seems to want to do that because ""black people were mistreated"" is such a comfortable fallback position to take. Black Americans love to invoke the Civil Rights era without invoking the spirit of the era, which was the create a positive *future* for Black Americans. In the spirit of Thomas Paine, the Civil Rights era was not about carving out a niche for the people marching, but for their posterity.

TRUE,[deleted],,,"This goes front page so much, but it's pretty much the only picture that I don't mind seeing again and again. Reminds me of a night a long time ago.

I used to go to a bar every thursday where they'd sell you a mug for $5, and you could get 50 cent refills forever and ever on it. After I had consumed god knows how much pisswater college bar beer I got a text from a friend who had been permabanned from the bar for pissing off the deck onto the street. He was at the bar across the way.

I get over there and he's fucking wasted, talking to these two extremely attractive, excessively drunk girls who probably weren't of legal age. Oh god they were hot.

See this bar had a special deal of their own. You could buy a fishbowl of liquor that probably would serve 5 people, 9 if they weren't alcoholics. So I bought one and we all shared it. Well an hour later the girls exchanged numbers with us and left, we both sat there, falling off our stools drunk. Two more hours to go before the bar closes.

I take the fishbowl with me to piss and return it to the bar and on my way to the bathroom I notice there are a fucking lot of fishbowls sitting places...some half empty. So I discreetly dump all those fishbowls into ours, piss and get back.

He asks if I bought more, and I tell him how I got it. He pauses and goes ""You're a disgusting but brilliant man."" It wasn't even purely that drink, people had dumped other stuff in there, we could smell beer for sure but we didn't care.

We get to the bottom of the bowl and there's a wadded up napkin mixed in with the ice, oh god it was so bad. After a lot of laughter and some minor gagging we leave and run into the girls who were waiting for a cab. Ten minutes later we're at their house and the one who I had been talking to all night about anthropology shows me to the bathroom. A few minutes later I've got her bent over the sink just fucking her senseless, apparently I was her post-breakup romp or something I don't remember I was drunk and enjoying breaking a year long dry spell.  

For whatever reason the thought of the napkin could have been a fapkin crossed my mind, such a random and inappropriate thought for some of the best drunk sex ever. I saw myself in the mirror just as my cheeks puffed out to blow. By the grace of Sagan's taint I turned and exploded into the open shower. 

Game over. Sex is done. I'm leaning over the tub producing these magically smooth streams of blue vomit. It was a miracle how smooth they were. That's all I could think about was it looked like a fountain coming out from under my nose, no stray drops or streams I don't know how I managed it. I have never thrown up that much volume before, it was absolutely astounding. 

Thankfully the wateriness meant I didn't clog the tub because I was ready to gtfo. We left and I only ever saw her once or twice on campus, we never spoke.

It's always nerve-wracking at first, but you can learn to truly love anywhere you live. Assuming you're an optimist and you move to a reasonably decent place, it will generally go something like this:

* **Weeks 1 to 2** - feels like a vacation; you have an awesome time exploring this fun new place

* **Week 3 to Month 3** - you'll start to second-guess yourself more and more as you realize you have no friends and you start to discover the downsides of your new location; gets progressively worse until month three, give or take, when you'll have an ""oh no what have I done?"" moment

* **Months 4 to 6** - although you'll still be somewhat down on it, it will get progressively better as you learn to just accept the downsides and focus on the benefits of living there

* **Month 7 to Year 2** - you'll start to make real friends and become more attached to it; it will be 'home' 

* **Year 3+** - you'll either start to get tired of it and want to set out for a new adventure or you'll just keep on loving it and want to stay for the long haul

Overall, moving to new places has been an awesome experience that has really helped me become independent and expand my perspective on life. I'd highly recommend it!

[Collapse of Complex Societies by Dr. Joseph Tainter](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0R09YzyuCI)

Venue: Grand Rapids, MI future.org meeting


The evolution of social complexity concerns the change from societies that were small with few distinctions other than those based in biology: age and sex, to those that are large, differentiated, and highly integrated.

Hunter-gatherer societies have only a few dozen distinct social personalities while modern censuses recognize 10,000 to 20,000 distinct occupations.

Concepts of complexity, e.g.: physics, biology.  Tainter means two
things:

* Differentiation and specialization in structure and function and behavior.  More parts and more kinds of parts.
* Increasing integration and control of behavior.  As number and types of parts increase, mechanisms to bind these together as a system.  Without integration and organization you don't have a system, you merely have an assemblage of parts.

Examples which superficially appear to be complex systems but aren't:

* 1942 N. Africa landings:  500,000 different types of military artifacts.  Julian Steward.  This _wasn't_ a complex system, ships were loaded poorly.  Consequence:  when unloading in N. Africa, guns arrived w/o gunsights or ammunition, no gunners.  Proper operation:  combat loading:  load in reverse order to need on landing.  Not a complex system because of lack of organization.  Great differentiation, poor organization.
* Opposite:  drummers at Bejing Olympics.  Low structural diversity, very high organization -- all the same.  High level of organization, but no differentiation and structure.  Hence:  not a complex system.

#### The Irony of Complexity

Complexity can be counterintuitive.  Complexity simplifies (hence: it's not complicated).  Complexity is an elaboration of structure and control, it simplifies and channels human behavior.  This is why complexity exists: it makes systems function.  

Financial crisis of 2008:  high diversification, little organization.  Hence, not a complex system.  A failure of complexity.

Again:  structure and organization are the elements of complex systems (differentiation?), and complexity simplifies and regularizes.  

What is a collapse?  When a society rapidly loses an established level of complexity.

Post-collapse societies are simpler, have fewer parts, are less well-organized, and often are smaller.

#### Examples of collapse:

* Western Roman Empire, 5th C AD (followed by Dark Ages of Europe)
* Classice Lowland Maya of Guatemala, 9th C AD
* Hittite Empire of Anatolia (Turkey), 13th C BC
* Minoan Civilization of Crete, 14th C BC
* Mycenaean Civilization of Greece, 12th/11th C BC
* Western Zhou Dynasty, China, 771 BC
* Harappan Civilization, Indus Valley, 18th C BC
* Egyptian Old Kingdom, 2181 BC
* Olmec Civilization, Mexico, 5th C BC (?)
* Teotihuacan (~700 AD) &amp; Tula (12th C AD)
* Huari &amp; Tiahuanaco, 11th C AD)

In the Americas:

* St. Louis Indian Mound culutres:  Cahokia (13th C AD)
* Casas Grandes (14th C AD), Chacoan (11th C AD), Hohokam (15th C AD)

#### Misperceptions about human complexity:

* It occurs simply because people invent things. (Contrast:  ""before his time"" -- Leonardo, early (Roman) inventor of Aluminum))

* Complex society ""civilization"" is an accomplishment -- an accumulation of many things invented over time. 

Problem with that:  complexity isn't free.  It has a cost.

#### Complexity in problem solving:

Complexity costs.  The costs may be metabolic or measured in some currency:  time, money, energy.  Ultimately:  energy.  For biological systems:  calories.  For humans ""the accounting is more subtle"":  money and annoyance.

But ultimately, metabolic, hence energy costs.

Before fossil fuels:  complexity meant _people_ worked harder.  People had to work harder to support complexity.  Which means that human societies don't have any intrinsic tendency to increase in complexity, contrary to popular assumption.  There are real reasons _not_ to increase in complexity as it costs more, simply because it costs and people have to work harder.

Why do societies become more complex?

* Complexity increases because it solves problems.  E.g., hybrid cars, new types of institutions, new activities.  Casablanca landings in WWII
* Problems are often solved by developing more complex technologies, adding new positions and social roles, or conducting new kinds of activities.

E.g.:  Complexity responses to the 9-11 terror attacks:

* Proliferated structure:  New gov't agencies (TSA, DHS), reorganized others, increased organizational control over people's behavior.  We've increased complexity.  And it costs us:  taxes, regulations, products we buy, annoyances.
* Complexity costs -- costs can be metabolic or measured in currencies.
* Complexity in problem solving is an economic function.  Complexity has costs and benefits.
* As simple and cost-effective solutions no longer suffice, institutions develop solutions that are more complex and costly.

Economics of complexity:

* What are economics of social or institutional complexity?
* Complexity has benefits
* Higher complexity costs
* Changing complexity changes benefit/cost ratio of complexity
* Changes in the benefit/cost ratio of complexity can mean
different futures for societies.
* Diminishing returns to complexity.  This can profoundly
influence society's future over long periods of time.
* Higher complexity requires societies to acquire more energy to support complexity (e.g.: fossil fuels).  At the same time,
having cheap energy permits and facilitates even higher
complexity.  So complexity _requires_ energy, but having _cheap_ energy permits us to develop more complexity.  This is the energy-complexity spiral.

Energy and complexity go up and down together.  You cannot have complexity without energy, and if you have energy, you're going to have complexity.

Like I said, i've done this, and you will NOT regret this decision either way. It's fast, cheap, looks great and is reversible.

A bright light in the detection frequency of rhodopsin instantly breaks down the rhodopsin that has built up - it's really sensitive stuff. Rhodopsin's detection frequency goes down as the wavelength increases. Red and Dark Red have highest wavelength in the visible light spectrum and rod cells (rhodopsin) is essentially non-reactive at these wavelengths. So your Rods can't ""see"" red light. They are blind to it.

TRUE,[deleted],,,"&gt; If you don't like who you are, where you are or where you're going, you won't be happy with yourself, you won't feel accomplished.

I don't mean for you to take this as an invitation to a flame war -- but man, lots of women are with guys who aren't happy with themselves and aren't particularly accomplished. Furthermore a lot of guys who make stupid choices, work meaningless jobs, don't have any real spectacular talents do fine with women. They are still flying high because sex is so validating. Let's not delude ourselves that this doesn't happen, it is an ego boost.

Hooking up with women is very easy in certain circumstances. You are on vacation somewhere nice, you are in a hostel and everyone there likes you, you are drinking somewhere where there are a lot of other singles hooking up and it's expected, you headline in a band in a pub on St. Pat's, etc. Women aren't particularly perceptive judges of men, most just go with the flow. And they get horny or lonely like everyone else.

If you want to get laid, environment and context are everything. You want to look social and popular. You want to be clean, fit, and smell nice. You want to be sexually confident, etc. You don't want to be a relentlessly self-improving introvert, and that's something of a recurrent theme here.

So all this ""crossover value"" bleeding into your dating life?  I don't know if I really buy it. I had some good friends who stayed at home and were great guitarists who loved their passion, they still struggled badly with women. Dating is its own specific skill like a muscle, you use it or you lose it. Whenever I focus on my career, spending time in the gym, or kicking around in the mountains, my dating life dies. Whenever I do my ""PUA impression"" (I can't stand the community though) I meet girls -- because I am approaching and actually taking chances. And surprise, surprise whenever I have sex, a little validation, and a kind ear, pillow talk and some TLC, I'm suddenly a lot happier. This will be uncool but I question how happy anyone really is during long bouts of celibacy. I'm certainly not.

Essentially I'm trying to say it's not just about you. Guys who do well with women not only have some good qualities, they are also in the right place at the right time, can recognize when a woman is interested, and know the right way to open and pursue an interaction. Focusing on only the 1st (good qualities) is going to hurt you in your dating life. For those good qualities, external things like good friends and a social life / education or career credentials / lots of leisure time / desirable lifestyle, etc. are probably more important than a passion. More women need balance than excellence.

Caveats apply for age, situation, and my own overgeneralizations. Exceptions are everywhere. Like I said Buddah, don't take it as a knock on you personally -- but I think this is a Princess Bride style fantasy we have (and I used to), where we vanish into thin air, come back 10x times the man we were, and our problems are solved.

From what I've seen : In the meantime a lot of girls will couple up with men they probably shouldn't and go off the market, you end up with a lot of money from your career and semi-proficient talent in things you mostly choose because they seemed nice to you in your living room. Or you get a girl and get a whole new set of problems to deal with -- just because you're now the perfect guy, doesn't mean you'll recognize the perfect woman -- and that time you spent self-improving won't give you relationship tools.

What I'd say to OP, is that you should keep trying, in moderation. You need to keep dating because the longer your break is, the harder it is to get back on the horse. Not dating is *nice*. No disrespect, no bullshit, no disappointment. I like it so much it's really hard to get started again. But buddah is right that you need to unfuck your mindset, because you need to change if you're not happy with who you are. Liking yourself will solve so many things in your life -- it just won't necessarily solve dating. And you need to be prepared to be happy with yourself and your life if it doesn't work out, because you still have decades to live.

1. Plan how you're going to get to your friends house.

2. If you are not leaving now, look and apply for jobs from now online. Once you get there you may have an interview already set up.

3. What if you don't get a job in the first month, it happens to the best of us, you need a backup supply of cash.

4. Expect to get into problems with your friend. Usually issues around money.  If you have no money, make sure between your job hunting, clean up the house (don't do his laundry though), make sure you pick up your mess. Make dinner etc.

TRUE,Cristal1337,,,"I am severely disabled (muscle illness) and one day, as a young lad, maybe 17 years old, a father came to me after school and asked, out of the blue: ""Would you have been happier if you never lived?""

People around suddenly turned their heads towards us, awaiting my answer and all I could think of was: ""Did he really just ask that?""

Luckily, I am not someone to blurt out the first thing that comes to my mind, but it did take a couple of seconds to formulate a good response: ""I have a happy life and I wouldn't have had one without the chance to live.""

The man elaborated: ""I'm sorry to ask this, Spain is currently debating the abortion laws and I just wanted a first hand opinion on it.""

Back then, I already had put a lot of thought into abortion laws, but I didn't have the time to tell him the story of my life. So I simply said: ""That's OK, I was quite surprised though. In my opinion, abortion is a personal choice. You have to keep the options open for all sorts of reasons. For example, pregnancy complications. It's a difficult subject. However, I am for abortions.""

It's difficult, indeed. There are health issues, economic issues, emotional issues, social environment issues, political issues...etc. So many reasons to have an abortions. A disability becomes irrelevant, because no human wants to raise a child in a fucked up world. However, even in a perfect world, I think having a choice is best. 

My disability only became apparent when I grew up. My parents didn't know till it was too late for an abortion. Luckily, I lived in a very social country and my father earned plenty. Of course, having a disabled child causes some friction. Pretty much everything had to be catered towards me and that caused frustration. They wanted the best for me and gave me what they could. My sister was also frustrated, she didn't get the same amount of attention as I did. Having a disabled child weighs hard on a family, even in the best circumstances. I was the black sheep by nature and I knew it. It made me depressed for years. 

I am 25, living alone and on social benefits because I can't make a living (although I am a freelance translator for extra cash). A social worker visits me once every two weeks to help me with my household and to cook some meals. My family is a bit sad because they think I can't become happy this way. However, I've never been more happy! The past three years of my life, the moment I moved out, were a blast! Whatever people think others need to be happy doesn't matter. I make my own happiness.

Still, if a mother thinks she is more happy with an abortion, it's her responsibility to make herself happy. If she feels her child will never be happy and that thought makes her sad enough, then I think it justifies an abortion. Who are we to tell people how to become happy?

-[This](http://www.thekitchn.com/weekend-cooking-homemade-thinc-45499) is my go-to recipe for company/impressing people.

And because I can never help myself from sharing just [one](http://www.foodiecrush.com/2013/06/cookie-smores/) last ""recipe"". While this isn't so much a recipe as a ""why didn't I think of that""...everyone should know about these!

Oh boy :) I love these types of topics! 

So, the first step to impressive food is to season just about everything. People often forget to add salt and pepper during the cooking process, but just those simple things can make a world of difference. (Make sure you taste as you season as well. Adding too little is *always* better than adding too much!)

TRUE,wiseman207,,,"Here are my notes:

00:35 - With no enemies active, the worst that can happen is a group will wander in (very rare).  Hunker Down reduces visibility, so there's no reason to use it unless taking enemy fire is imminent.

00:41 - Dashing into unexplored territory gives you no time to react if you uncover something.  It's better to explore on your first move only, and take cover on secure ground.  Side note: cover isn't terribly important until you wake an enemy up.  It's better to explore and move to a more defensible area of the map, using Overwatch to cover in case something wanders in.

03:00 - Hunkering down here might not be the best idea.  Though it really reduces your odds of getting hit, you are conceding to let the enemy take a free shot at you.  Hunker Down works best when you don't have a good shot *and have a plan to improve your position later*.  If you're planning to bait with Overwatch or slug it out in a firefight, your better options for lead members are to either shoot or break line of sight to bait enemies closer.

04:00 - I think for this map in particular, defending this thoroughfare near the drop point is bad, since there's little good options for maneuvering (and that Sectoid spawn you hit is common on this map).  More generalized advice would be to look around for good ingress points before moving, and make a decision to move there, rather than turtling endlessly.  Look to gain tactical advantage instead of trading blows in a slugfest.  On this map in particular, taking the street behind the wall, or moving into the cars by the garage are good ideas.  Your rookie in the back is wasting his moves dashing between sub-optimal positions here.  Again, always take time to analyze a map and form a plan of ingress, and when enemies come, look for ways to maneuver into an advantage.

04:27 - Use pistols agains 1HP enemies to conserve ammo.  This move is a good offensive move, but you have to recognize that you're hanging your trooper for return fire from the other Sectoids here.

04:47 - Overwatching with enemies in sight is a bad move, since they don't have to trigger Overwatch to fire at you.  You're giving them free shots.  Either shoot, break Line of Sight, or Hunker Down if there's no other options.

I think a good way to approach an XCOM fight is to look at Shots-Fired-vs-Shots-Returned when dealing with enemies and cover.  I'll illustrate with an example.

Let's say a soldier moves up to Full Cover and meets 2 Sectoids.  The sectoids both maneuver into firing position.  There's no way to prevent the soldier from being shot without killing the Sectoids.  If you move up a second soldier without killing anyone, you could lose 2 men instead of one.  However, if you have a good chance of killing 1, then you'll only take 1 retaliation shot; so in this respect a soldier in heavy cover is as good as any other.  You can move up as many soldiers into full cover as you want to support the first, as long as you have a good chance of reducing the number of incoming shots (and potential casualties).  If the rest of your troops sit back, you're basically giving the Sectoid a free shot at best, worse it may move to a more defensible position, or reinforcements will show up.  This is only one example, but you can apply this sort of math to any fight.  You're as vulnerable as your weakest member, and you should aim to reduce return fire as much as possible, without jeopardizing additional men.  Attack aggressively when you have a chance to clear the threat, and protect weaker members with offense.  Spread your lines and get to better positions while the enemy is distracted by your toughest, best-covered members.  Turtling is admitting that ""this is the best I've got"", and you're going to take whatever losses the RNG chooses.  Better to do the math and try to make the most of it.  If it's you're all-star captain on the line, gamble those rookies and get the frags out.

Your men will take many more shots than any individual alien ever will.  Avoiding incoming shots is *always always always* the best defense.  Count potential shots from the enemy as sure hits, and anything less than 100% sure kill as a potential failure point.  Before taking a risk, calculate it out roughly in your head to make sure it's your best try.  Break line of sight, slink around when you can, leave yourself retreat points and hiding spots, and go for flanks for the aim bonus.  Never ever let an opponent shoot at you if you don't have to.

09:28 - We knew that Sectoid was there.  It may have made better sense to retreat to the truck, or make a break for the room to get wall cover, rather than hanging your men on the garage door like that.  It's hard to tell.  Remember, Overwatch only works when you have LoS on a moving target, so that Sectoid can play peekaboo on the cars all day.  Better here to fire, attack, or move away.

10:20 - Enemies who you do not witness moving should be assumed to be on Overwatch!  If you must move into Overwatch, dash for the defense bonus.

An 80% chance to hit here is a gamble.  If you missed, there was a good chance you'd get flanked and killed.  It would have been better to use a grenade (or at least have one ready via another soldier, in case you miss).

You used grenades well, but you might want to ""check"" them first.  For example, with that last grenade, you could know that that Sectoid was as good as dead, and then take other shots before swinging with it (and not worry about hanging your men on the garage door).

TRUE,ksclee,,,"rwallin, I believe you just found a very good piece of couplet that is at least 90 years old. 

A couple of small things first: 

(1) chasingxshadows nailed it on most of the characters and information, excepts the third word should be 詳 (detailed) instead of 祥 (luck). So it makes more sense to mean ""Moral character and integrity are detailed and clear"". 

(2) You are definitely right to put them on the front door because they are couplet (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Couplet_(Chinese_poetry)). However old Chinese passages and characters are written and read from left to right, so you should hang the first frame on the **right** hand side of the door and the second frame on the **left**, like [this](http://img25.artxun.com/sdb/oldimg/29ff/29ffff2f3700188eab4965ba4cf3b639.jpg) and [this](http://img15.artxun.com/sdd/oldimg/d7a3/d7a3bae2f789df37d7e08344793a5fcc.jpg) and [this](http://blog.jxcn.cn/UploadFiles/2013-6/5820722605.jpg). 

(3) On the small prints (and that's the interesting part): 

First frame: 饒合理夫子回國紀念

* 饒合理, Harry Fleming ROWE (1869 - 1946), is an American Methodist missionary. 
* 夫子 is a respectful form of addressing a teacher from his students. 
* 回國 means returning to the country from aboard. 
* 紀念 is commemorate or in this case, a memento. 

So the full sentence means (the couplet is a) memento for the teacher Dr. Rowe when he was returning to the country (presumably from China to US).

Second frame: 金陵神學美以美會學生仝贈

* 金陵 is the old name of Nanjing in China. 
* 金陵神學 as a whole is The Nanking School of Theology, before it merged with other theological seminaries and formed [Nanjing Union Theological Seminary](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanjing_Union_Theological_Seminary) later on. 
* 美以美會 is [Methodist Episcopal Church](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodist_Episcopal_Church). 
* 學生 is students. 
* 仝 is the old form of 同 which means ""together"". 
* 贈 means ""giving"" (some gift). 

So the whole sentence means the couplet is given (to Dr. Rowe) as a gift by the students from Methodist Episcopal Church of The Nanking School of Theology. 

From the very limited information online, ~~饒合理 (sorry I can't find a English translation of his name)~~ Dr. Rowe had a doctorate degree in theology in 1916 and had been preaching in China most of his life. He was the Headmaster/President of The Nanking School of Theology in 1921. He was also noted to have convinced a US billionaire to donate part of her heritage to the School, which worth USD$12m (not confirmed). Note that 金陵神學 was the official name of The Nanking School of Theology from 1912 to 1917, so this couplet may very well be from that period of time. Or when he was retiring and going back to US, then that would probably be a bit more recent, in 1930s or so.

TRUE,OverWilliam,,,"Speaking from a psychology standpoint, this sort of behavior is generally categorized as 'Ambivalent' or 'Anxious' attachment, and indicates a deep-seated, almost catastrophically poor self-worth. It is often linked with foundational relationships, like those with her primary care givers, in her childhood and early adolescence. Frequently, individuals like this grew up under pressure from their (often well-meaning) parents to ""perform,"" in whatever manner they deemed appropriate, in order to ""earn"" their love. Therefore, she grew up believing that she did not inherently deserve to be loved, but that she was, in a sense, ""only as good as her last show."" Individuals with Ambivalent attachment frequently flip back and forth between clingy and deliberately hurtful because they ultimately don't have the internal, subconscious assurance that they are worth loving. Once they begin reaching a point of true intimacy with another person, they instinctively and reflexively sabotage that relationship out of fear and self-loathing (""I don't deserve him, I'm holding him back from finding and loving someone worth caring about""). It sounds like a pity party, but when these things sink into the core of how a person sees themselves, it is nothing short of tragic.

That's actually a really sad story. It sounds like you both endured a lot of pain and hardship that has roots back in her childhood. I don't know her or anything else about her life circumstances-- and to be fair, I could be completely off base. But I hope she eventually finds healing.

Influence: XVI Oppression  The Tower Um.. well.. its a forbidden joy. Something you aren't or weren't supposed to touch. Because I peeked ahead, its definitely a lover or love or feelings that has you conflicted.

Past: 9 of swords.  Sadness and Depression/Loneliness... Not a good history with this feeling. 

Recent Past: VI The Lovers.  Venus. You've recently developed feelings for someone but it has you completely foiled. This is a good card overall but for some reason I get this nagging that you're so very fearful. Smile :)

Future: XX Judgement Making a Choice and going with it. Listening to advice and heeding warnings/signs. Also you'll finally be able to stand up for yourself. [See final outcome]

Destiny/Goal: 2 of cups The relationship card. You want to make sure a relationship is the right relationship and is feasible.

Direct Revelation: 4 of Rods/Staves Finally laying down roots, setting up a foundation for family/marriage matters. I keep getting pulled toward it as an elopement because of that Tower as an influence. 

Environment: 8 of swords Pinned down. Your environment has you cornered and it seems like there is no way out. Have patience and you'll be able to escape. 

Emotions: Princess of Swords You desperately need to communicate in order to have your piece said and be able to express yourself. Remember that your tongue is used for defense and attacking.

Final Outcome: IV Power Freyja Miss, it looks like you're going to be accessing your inner power this new year. This love looks like it gives you strength even though it seems to be unpopular. It looks like you'll be able to say things you've been wanting to say for a long time. Even if this relationship isn't what you expect, it is the catalyst for unlocking your identity, yourself, and your inner/outer power. Heed it. 

January: XX Judgement This is when you make your decision. Listen to yourself, and be wise. 

February: Princess of Swords  Stick to your guns and be ready to debate others about your choices made in January. You'll feel ready to get out.

March: 8 of Swords You'll feel very repressed and like you can't get out. Hold on Until April.

April: 7 of Pentacles You'll have saved enough money by then to do what you want to do. Make sure to assess and to carefully calculate needs and wants and to also remember to plan for emergencies. 

May: 9 of Cups You get your WISH! Your plan has worked and you are out of your old mental/emotional/physical environment. You did it!

June: 6 of staves Victory! You'll have done it exceedingly well, and you'll finally be able to realize that you win, and when you win you win a lot. Revel in your optimism. Look Up :) 

July: 10 of cups Happiness. The successful culmination of a happiness/related venture. Life just keeps looking up.

August: Justice VIII It may be a legal matter that pops into your life, but I see it as more of a need for reflection. Can you be doing something better? More efficiently? Be more objective.

September: Queen of Swords  You'll have truly come into your own. You'll be a very powerful person indeed. Make sure to NEVER allow cruelty to tempt you. That's the dark side of air/queen of swords.

October: 6 of Swords A bit of traveling, either metaphorically or physically will happen. I think its more of an intellectual movement.

November: Strength XI  A test/feat of strength will be preformed this month and even you will be impressed with you. Stay strong and practice a mantra every day. If you see a mountain, climb it. It's the right way.

TRUE,Latama,,,"It is an Italian made picklock stiletto from 1958 or 1959. The handles are stag horn. The ""INOX"" is short for 'inoxidable' which means 'rust free' or 'stainless'. It looks to be a 9"" (23 cm) model. The blade style is known as a ""flat grind"" with a swedge or small false edge on the top.

The way you can date this knife is that it is a picklock. A picklock is the oldschool pre-1960 style of blade release where you lift the round tab off the blade pin with your fingers to close it. After 1960 they changed to the modern ""swivel bolster"" where you pivot the top front bolster and it lifts the round tab, which enabled you to close it with one hand.

This knife also falls into the ""transitional"" period of Italian stilettos. The transitional period was late 1958 right after the U.S. switchblade ban, through 1959. Production was moving from the old school picklock to the swivel bolster, and moving from high carbon steel bayonet style blades to stainless steel flat grind blades. The transitionals will have a combination of these old and new parts, like a new swivel bolster with an old carbon bayonet blade, or an old picklock with a new stainless flat grind, like yours has.

The knife was probably bought in Italy, France, or Spain. It looks to be in great shape and the red dot safety does make it a little more desirable to collectors. 

Take care of it and never sharpen it. Having the original edge on the blade is a huge plus to the value.

Before the Euros and their brand of greed under the guise of Christianity destroyed the Americas, Africa, India, and the Middle East, there were thriving cultures leading the way in science, medicine and technology.  People and cultures were forced to adapt to the European way, and not necessarily for the better.

The ""white"" populations have pillaged and now control a large portion of the world's resources.  This isn't because they are white, but because the Euros were lucky in their geographical origin.  If they had been closer to China or the Mongolians, they would have been destroyed.  For ""white"" America, it is shielded by two oceans that are difficult to cross easily.  

China has an ancient and grand culture that, if it had been situated in Europe, could have far exceeded the Romans.  The Egyptians were among the leaders in science and medicine.  The Arabs merchants built the beginning of our modern accounting and business practices.  Chinese, Indian and Persian scholars made great discoveries in mathematics.  

However we don't know about many of these because the conquer writes history.  Discoveries attributed to Europeans had been found out by other cultures many years, decades, and even centuries prior, but those were wiped out by the invaders.  European wars have destroyed countless centers of knowledge and culture that existed in these once great civilizations.

When I discovered shortly after that dying isn't the end, but the beginning, I knew that the options 'death or transition' kinda got narrowed down to just the one option, transition.
I lost much, as many people did when they realized they had to live on. Life has been incredibly hard at times, and no, you can never fix the past, or get back the wasted years of self loathing. 

But I can tell you this - despite all of the hardships, sorrow, and loss, the immeasurable comfort of finally being who you should have been is enough to wash it away. That first time when a stranger looks at you and smiles, not because you are different, but because *you are you*, it is something that can stir even the darkest times away. 

Let me ask you - what makes a 'real' woman? A uterus? A vagina? Maybe some breasts is all it takes? Or how about years of growing up as a girl? None of that, NONE OF IT, makes you a girl. It is a small part of a much larger picture. Would you say that a woman who has a mastectomy is no longer a woman? Or maybe cystic removal, like some of the girls I knew from high school? Does my having a vagina now, post SRS, make me a woman? Does my coworker, a FtM transman having a vagina make HIM a woman? It is all about perspective. 

I can't possibly tell you that it will be easy, and I don't know your situation to tell you that it will get better. But I can assure you of this - some day, someone will smile at you, and all the hardships you've gone through will vapourize in that instant.

Yet they consistently say women should never be judged for their appearance, as has been mentioned here before.

TRUE,barrelomo,,,"I can and can't relate to this. I've moved around to 5 major US cities in the past 6 years. The freedom to live a gypsy-like lifestyle is definitely liberating, and each time I land in a new city it is exhilarating and you truly understand and feel what possibility means.

My family respects my ambition and desire for life experience. This is a combination of getting lucky with having the parents I do, and me being articulate for my aspirations in life. They give me certain latitudes, like not guilting me this Thanksgiving when I was still getting on my feet after a recent move, (to Chicago as well, loving it!) and couldn't afford to travel home. Luckily a fellow redditor graciously had me over for their Thanksgiving (reddit is your family too goddamnit!) I visit when I can and make the most of our time together, otherwise technology is amazing and my 3 year old nephews can use skype as well as I can, that helps. 

However I had a significant other (S.O.) in my past city, and the relationship took and huge blow and ended mostly due to the sentiment that you're having. He wanted to move with me and even had a job opportunity lined up. But his family threw a tantrum and basically guilted him into staying around for their sake. I completely respect his decision and we both maintain a loving friendship, but where we used to plan our future together now a lot of what we talk about are his regrets of staying behind and the emotional burden his family has become. If things change—now I'm haunted by what I feel is a lack of respect his family has for him and the decisions he makes for his life, and how he chose acquiescence and regret over possibility and adventure. This may seem like an oversimplification and it is, but it's an educated one as I was a key sounding board for him in the decision process.

Of course being communicative and assertive (as necessary) with your family is what's going to make them see you as a mature, whole, and independent individual that wants to seek experiences to bring back and enlighten those you care about most. What I think is amazing and really greasing the wheels is technology. If you make smart choices in your finances and save judiciously, family is always only less than a three hour flight away (Continental US version). Skype is instant, and is real, meaningful connection and conversation as long as you're willing to see it that way.

I'd also like to quickly point out that closeness between family members is irrespective of distance. Hell, my best friend lives 700 miles away and she's no less my best friend. The result of our closeness and understanding of each other is respect for who we are, and encouragement for where we all want to go. My parents quit their high-paying city jobs several years ago and started a Sheep farm in the hills of Appalachia. They have absolutely no business sense, the farm is definitely in the red, and I hate the way my father keeps the books. But they love doing it, and this is their dream. And as long as that stays the way it is I'll keep helping my dad do his books, and my mom with the marketing. Once my savings gets to the point I'll even become an investor. That's family; **encouraging and supporting each other's dreams,**. I'll support the way they wish to see themselves, not how I want to see them based on my own desires and stereotypes. Everyone evolves, and I can't expect my parents to be exactly the same people they were with the same hopes and dreams as when they raised me. Thanks to google docs I can help my dad with his books, together, 200 miles away. We can shoot the shit, and get shit done. 

If you truly feel as though you're the one who makes the decisions in your brain, whether or not you feel as though you could pick up and move to Paris isn't your family's problem, it's yours. I suggest you start sharing your aspirations with them. If you're family is anything like my ex-SO's they will laugh, or tell you how unrealistic or difficult this will be, and it's not worth it. They aren't telling you about how you leaving and chasing life will challenge their world view, and how difficult that will be for them when the truth hits them. Expect this, and keep sharing. I would hope you are even asking about their hopes and aspirations as well.

Next, move. You don't need to move to Paris, move across town, or to the next town over. Say it's because you wanted a bigger yard or it was cheaper, but start to show them how even when it takes 30 minutes more to get to their house, you're still their son or daughter, cousin, etc. Call them more, get them used to other ways of communication than what they are most comfortable with. Part of your family duty as the newer generation is to not let the older generations stagnate themselves in the comforts and nostalgias of the past. Teach your grandma to use a fucking ipad, and to facetime you whenever she wants.

By this point you'll start to see a change. You'll probably start to be seen as a leader within your own family / generation. What a foreign concept! Family's have leaders! You'll start to receive more trust and respect than you're used to, and this coupled with their love will be such an encouragement, it might even encourage you to chase your dreams. And since you've been sharing them with your family this whole time, they'll support you—maybe not financially, but emotionally and with guidance—on this journey. 

One last thought, and this comes my personal experience with working with LGBTQ youth who have been kicked out of their homes. Your family, whether by blood, or those who you have a deep unbreakable emotional bond to,**is everything**. When a parent kicks a child out because they deny the future person that their child strives to become, they rob their children of any future. Sometimes this happens quickly, and kids end up on the street. Sometimes this happens over a long period of time, and it eat away at people well into adulthood and creates behaviors that erratically try to reach for where the heart aligned itself so long ago. A child or young adult (I worked with homeless individuals up to age 25) who has had these bonds severed has a snowball's chance in hell at becoming a responsible, fulfilled individual unless these bonds are reestablished or new ones are forged. We've put them up in their own houses, gave them work, gave them income, and they still fail back into homelessness because they have no one to fail back on. So working with homeless youth and their family led me to a tacit understanding which I'll try to make explicit: You need family (in the loose sense of the term), and your family needs to let you be you. In both of these you have agency and responsibility. *A brief programming note for any young'uns, especially any LGBTQ, reading:* If you are in a repressive home environment the law doesn't give you a lot of freedom to get away from this. Endure, have vision for your future, and when you reach a level of financial independence get out and create a family that loves you for who you are. So many redditors on here have stories of just this, and prove that your family doesn't have to be your blood. 

If you've made it this far, thanks for hearing what is partially my life's work and observation, and partially my continuously developing philosophy. I wish you every happiness for you and your family, and that none of you feel constrained and envious of those who have the ability and support to seek new life experiences. 

TLDR; The freedom and support my family gives me to seek new adventures gives us a level of loyalty and respect that strengthens our bond as a family and makes us closer. Assert your individuality, your agency, and pursue your dreams, no matter how reckless they may seem. Your family should, and eventually will, come to understand.

TRUE,slothyone,,,"I highly suggest you look up the book ""How to Stop Worrying and Start Living"", and read the chapter 1 about ""Living in Day-Tight Compartments"".  

The basic idea is that you need to 100% stop thinking about yesterday and tomorrow, and live 100% in the day.  People will create a storyline for themselves based on the past - for good or bad.  The thing is, you can't rest on the past to make you comfortable, or use it as an excuse - depending how ""favorable"" your past was.  You also can't look towards tomorrow to fix your problems, or to see what will happen.  By adopting this perspective, it forces you into action.  And, from my experience, makes you feel like a truly badass motherfucker.  Once you don't even think about the past and future except for practical terms (i.e. calculating how much you should save for the future lifestyle you want) - you will be pretty fucking icy cold because you've immediately removed sorrow/anxiety/regret, and a whole bunch of other weak emotions with surgical precision.  Enjoy that for yourself, because it's truly a reward.  Your emotions tell you how good a job you are doing with choosing what thoughts you focus on.  The better you feel, the better you know you're doing, and as a side bonus, you'll start getting more of what you want from others and from life.

One quote in the book that resonated with me is ""Every day is a new life to a wise man"".  If shit happened, forgive yourself.  Today is sacred, and most people only use a tiny portion of today's potential.  If you get in the habit of thinking that way, you will get the most out of today EVERY DAY, and you won't be held back by these arbitrary plot lines you've made up about yourself based on your past that you are projecting into the future.

I truly don't mean to put down other advice on this thread or sub, but I think this sort of high-level advice will result in greater overall happiness than more specific ""tactics"".

Awesome, I flew into Kerala my first time too. 3 months, you'll be able to see a lot of India depending on how often you're on the move. But yeah, India is pretty dirt cheap or pretty expensive depending on how comfortable or uncomfortable you're willing to be ha.

The first time I was there was for about a month, stayed in guesthouses/hostels, traveled via the good to average train carriages (or sleeper buses when there wasn't any), went to about 15 different cities and ate most meals at restaurants and all up it cost me $800 for the whole month. You could definitely do it for a lot less, since I went to way too many places the first time. After you've dealt with the almost unavoidable Dehli belly, give the street food a go, they are amazing and is about 25cent for a full meal, restaurants maybe $1 to $5 (pending how fancy it is.)

Don't know if you've been to any other developing countries before but remember to haggle for everything besides food and trains/buses. Lot of people will try to scam you as well, honestly, just use the website below to book for every country train and buses, saves you from lining up (Indians have almost no concept of such a thing) at train stations and getting hassled by scammers.
http://www.cleartrip.com/ for trains and planes
http://makemytrip.com/ for buses.
Buy it online, print it out and you can jump straight on the trains with it without being bothered by anyone!

For location suggestions, the Kerala backwater is pretty nice, you guys have to go to Hampi, the landscape, the boulders, the ruins, amazing. While you're in Mumbai, make sure you take a day or two to go see the ajanta and ellora caves, like Ankor wat but carved into a series of caves. Taking one of the mountain trains up to the hill stations (Ooty, Darjeeling, Shimla) is worth a few hour train ride as well. 

Don't know when you guys are going but if the roads are open really recommend the extreme north via the highest road in the world into Ladakh and Kashmir, quite a different feeling from the rest of India, you're on the foot of the Himalayas, slightly more Asian faces up there, monasteries. More extreme landscapes there.

Can tell you a lot more if you want ha, but I'm sure you want to discover everything on your on! But if there's one main tip I have, is just go there with an open mind, Especially if you haven't been to a developing country before. India is gonna be super busy, chaotic, insane, you can't compare it with anything else, other developing country can't match how crazy busy it is, but everything somehow functions. Learn to embrace it for what it is and that's when you'll enjoy it. I always say there's a lot of crap you have to go through with to see the good bits of India, but the good bits are so damn worth it.

TRUE,ainrialai,southamerica,General Lovecraftian Bullshit,"When the Zapatistas began their rebellion twenty years ago, they were unleashing new currents of libertarian socialism and drawing from long traditions of indigenous resistance and communitarian values. Pre-Columbian indigenous America was as socially diverse as any other continent, and even in the colonial era, it's difficult to paint all indigenous peoples with a broad brush. Still, the indigenous Mayan communities in southern Mexico should be noted for their strong communal nature. The development of the hacienda system during the colonial era, then, introduced a strictly hierarchical system of private landownership that clashed with these indigenous farming communities.

The haciendas, large estates owned by members of a small economic elite and worked by dispossessed *campesinos* (peasants), outlived the colonial system that had birthed them. There's a lot of Mexican history to cover here, but I'm trying to get to the Zapatistas quickly. Before the Mexican Revolution, the country was under the rule of Porfirio Díaz, indirectly and directly, from 1876 until 1911, a period known as the Porfiriato. To quote a [post on the Mexican Revolution](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1h0bsq/what_started_the_mexican_revolution_and_who_were/capqckl) I made six months ago, ""The *Porfiriato* was characterized by a corrupt ruling elite, repression of civil liberties, heavy foreign ownership of Mexican land and industry, rapid economic growth, a modernization of the country, and the growth of the cities. The loss of communal lands (and corresponding growth of the *haciendas*) created a climate of alienation amongst the indigenous and rural peoples that would lead to the explosion of the Mexican Revolution in 1910.""

When the Mexican Revolution did come, it was less one revolution and more many revolutions. Liberal frustration with the Porfirian dictatorship, led by Francisco Madero, unwittingly opened the door for the radical movements to rise to greater prominence in Mexico. Ricardo Flores Magón, the anarchist labor organizer who had been a major figure in resistance to the Porfiriato and was exiled before the Revolution, led a short-lived anarchist communist revolution in Baja California in 1911 and was a figure of influence on the large anarcho-syndicalist labor movement centered in Mexico City. Among the other radicals his writings helped inspire was perhaps the most famous figure out of the Mexican Revolution, Emiliano Zapata. Leader of a great army of dispossessed peasants and indigenous peoples in the south of Mexico, Zapata fought for major land reform, ultimately assassinated in 1919 by the state that had emerged from the Revolution. A version of his plan for land reform had been included in the Constitution of 1917, however, and his imagine would be used for decades to come by the Mexican state. I'm greatly oversimplifying the Revolution here, for brevity, as there were a lot of ideologies and factions at play.

Eventually, the state produced by the Revolution was consolidated and institutionalized under the National Revolutionary Party (PNR), which would become the Party of the Mexican Revolution (PRM) and, eventually, the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). This party would become the longest ruling political party in the world, staying in constant power from 1929 to 2000. During this period, the ideological orientation of the party fluctuated. Under leftist President Lázaro Cárdenas (1934-40), the oil industry was nationalized, labor rights were expanded, and land reform accelerated. However, later presidents were more capitalist. Political repression also picked up, with the [Tlatelolco Massacre in 1968](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1jt6st/tuesday_trivia_askhistorians_wide_world_of_sports/cbid25t) and the mass voter fraud against presidential candidate Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas (son of the late president, who broke from the PRI) in 1988. By the 1990s, the PRI was ready to fully embrace neoliberalism and the Washington Consensus.

Land reform had effectively slowed to a crawl by this time, but the final straw that sparked the Zapatista uprising was the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). It required the stripping of Article 27 of the 1917 Constitution, removing the provision for land redistribution, allowing the foreign ownership of Mexican land, and removing protections for communal indigenous land. Zapata's key ideological contributions to the Mexican state, after a long period of infidelity, were effectively destroyed. Thousands of poor and dispossessed indigenous farmers lost their only hope when land reform was ended. A group of mostly indigenous leftists, radicalized by increasing repression and neoliberal capitalism from the Mexican state, had been organizing for a decade, but really gained traction with the communities following these new developments.

So, on 1 January 1994, the day the NAFTA came into effect, the Zapatista Army of National Liberation (*Ejército Zapatista de Liberación Nacional*, ""EZLN"") declared war on the Mexican state and 3,000 guerrilleros seized control of much of the state of Chiapas. Though they had no centralized leaders, their spokesman, [Subcomandante Marcos](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/71/SubMarcosHorseFromAfar.jpg/474px-SubMarcosHorseFromAfar.jpg), cut a dramatic figure that immediately seized the public imagination. The EZLN immediately released its revolutionary program, the [First] Declaration of the Lacandona Jungle ([early EZLN documents available here](http://lanic.utexas.edu/project/Zapatistas/chapter01.html)). They made clear the libertarian socialist nature of their revolution, with ""revolutionary laws"" surrounding labor, agrarian, and women's rights. For two weeks, they fought the Mexican state until a ceasefire was called. Pushed out of the major cities and much of the state, they retained (and still retain) control over a significant portion of indigenous territory.

Marcos began giving interviews and the EZLN made use of the internet to raise global awareness of their struggle and build pressure on the Mexican state. An uneasy standoff has persisted since, allowing the Zapatistas to focus on the governance of their territories and national and global advocacy for their ideology, rather than on constant violence. Though their governance style has been heavily influenced by anarchism and libertarian socialism/communism, the EZLN has rejected all political labeling other than ""Zapatismo,"" and has not actually demanded the disillusion of the Mexican state so much as its fundamental transformation and decentralization. The Zapatistas claimed to be engaging in the Fourth World War, against the forces of neoliberalism, which had emerged victorious from the Third World War (what we would call the Cold War). It's hard to keep within the 20-year rule here, because there have been so many developments in the indigenous liberation movement since 1994, from the growth of the participatory democracy of the Good Government Councils to the launching of the nationwide ""Other Campaign"" to the anarchist ""Oaxaca Commune"" in the neighboring state.

The Zapatista rebellion was not an immediate success in that they neither precipitated the overthrow of the Mexican state, nor retained control of the state of Chiapas at large. However, the EZLN did hold on to territory spanning many indigenous communities, in which the line between community member and Zapatista has been blurred, and has been very successful in propagating a new ideology of communitarian socialism and indigenous liberation in an era of neoliberalism. Though 1994 is now fair game for questions here, the Zapatistas are certainly not history in the sense of belonging strictly to the past, as they are as active now as ever. They continue their struggle and have become radical icons for solidarity and resistance in the global struggle against modern neoliberal capitalism in the developing world over the last twenty years.",0,1388647212,,0,FALSE,1,cefc1xb,t3_1u6wko,t1_cefc1xb,t3_1u6wko,1427894047,82,FALSE,AskHistorians,t5_2ssp3,82

No atheist teaches anything. Atheist schools don't exist. In retrospect I should have stopped reading here.  

&gt; The agnostic view makes sense, and can be applied to other parts of science

As I just said, 99.9% of atheists are **agnostic** atheists. You are literally arguing with something that doesn't exist. You're arguing against a strawman. 

&gt; Dedicing that ailiens doesn't exist is also a belief

There is a difference between the **positive** statement ""I do not believe there is a God"" and the **negative** statement ""Due to a lack of evidence I am inclined not to believe"". Most atheists are the second example: they don't positively state there is no God, but rather are agnostic atheists because of a lack of evidence for the existence of God(s). They aren't saying anything, their beliefs are merely a product of evidence. No one says ""aliens do not exist"", they merely assume the default position that we don't know due to a lack of evidence. 

&gt; When you build a belief system like atheism on fallacies

Holy fucking shit was is wrong with you? My brain almost exploded trying to process that retarded sentence. ""Based on the evidence provided, do you believe in a supernatural Creator of the Cosmos?"" ""No."" The. End. That's it, that's all atheism is. How can a position that consists of 1 single statement be founded on a fallacy? ""A lack of evidence makes me think there isn't a God, but I dunno, man"". ""OMG YOU'RE RETARDED YOU'RE BUILDING A BELIEF SYSTEM ON FALLACIES!!!!111"". Like... what?

&gt; Christianity also has many denominations, so disagreements internally in your religion doesn't make it less of a religion.

My brain is going to implode. Christians still have a binding creed and those that differ greatly from Christian theology become their own religion. There is NO CONTRADICTION IN ATHEISM BECAUSE THERE ARE NO STATEMENTS MADE TO CONTRADICT ONE ANOTHER. It's like being silent and not saying a word. 

&gt; A cell based structure

... what? So the fact that people can discuss ideas across various mediums means that there is a doctrine, and therefore religion? By that 'logic' every piece of information able to be communicated is also a religion. This makes no sense whatsoever. Also, since there is no central, unified centre for atheism, if 2 people discuss ideas regarding the non-existence of God, this has 0 impact on atheism as a whole. You honestly believe some atheists in China care about what 2 15 year old atheists in Australia are saying? I can't wrap my head around this. Terrorists have a goal, and ideology, a purpose and unified reason for their actions, atheists have none of this. 

&gt; You teach the belief that deities doesn't exist

Yes. You said this already. We don't teach anything. We come to conclusions through various means, that's it. I was Christian for 21 years, now i'm not. Why? I explored the Bible's origins and found it to be nonsense and unbelievable. Others never heard of God, some may have lacked personal experience etc. This doesn't make sense. 

&gt; That your religion is simple, and unintelectual doesn't make it something unique

ok...?

&gt;  If you don't belive there is no religion, why aren't you just agnostic?

What is wrong with you? Why are you mindlessly ignoring everything i've said to you? 99.9% OF ATHEISTS **ARE AGNOSTIC**. Even Richard Dawkins said he was an agnostic atheist. Atheism does not have to be a positive statement; that is *gnostic atheism*, the belief that there is definitely no God. 

&gt; Asserting that something doesn't exist, while saying you don't know to hold a tiny grasp of scientificness sounds much like the fallacies religious people will use to appear more scientific

If I read this correctly, you're criticising agnosticism, but throughout your past messages, including this one, you're saying that you SHOULD be an agnostic. 

&gt; Do you make up doctrines about the answers of every scientific question?

I understand English isn't your first language, but this doesn't make sense. ",0,1388650717,,0,1388650954,1,cefcv7z,t3_1u76k3,t1_cefcv7z,t1_cefc6k4,1427893595,5,FALSE,atheism,t5_2qh2p,5
TRUE,MajorPolstan,,,"I don't think I've seen any Indian on reddit arguing that the West is not better than India when it comes to women.

What the Indian redditors oppose is the projection of India as a land of rapists and where majority of the men are rapists and most of the population supports the rapists and blames the rape victims. That _is_ racist. These cases from India are in news only because a large number of people are out on streets protesting against them . You hear about the cases of police refusing to register a complaint or harassing the victims because the police officials responsible for these actions are condemned and punished. The only reason you hear more about rape cases from India (as opposed to say, Kenya or Mexico) is because a huge number of Indians are out on the streets protesting against them.

Also, there is an unfair amount of attention being focused on _India_ (which is a not a bad thing until people start associating the world ""rape"" with India). There is a  constant stream of India-related rape news on r/worldnews. Let's talk only about [British tourists](http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/uk/138-britons-raped-while-abroad-last-year-spain-had-highest-number-of-attacks-29430631.html): 138 raped and 300 suffered sexual assaults in 2013. Only 1 of these happened in India (no these cases are not under-reported because these figures are from reports to the British embassy not Indian police). The only case that happened in India was 1 of the 300 sexual assaults - the woman jumping from her hotel room in Agra. That story was on the r/worldnews front page. What about the other 299 sexual assaults and 138 rapes in other countries? Did you see them on the reddit front page? 39 of these 138 rapes happened in Spain. (Yes, there were gang-rapes too - eg [this](http://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/303643/British-tourist-in-Costa-del-Sol-gang-rape-agony) or [this](http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/gang-raped-front-hundreds-clubbers-magaluf-2096376)) Would you say ""I wouldn't visit Spain with any woman""? Compared to many other countries in the Western world, the attacks on tourists are far less common in India and the stories of police inaction happen only in the poor/illiterate parts of the society.

Lastly, there is too much focus on _rapes_ because this issue generates more moral outrage and stirs up emotions. India has a law and order problem like any other poor country (yes, India is a very poor country - there are more poor in India than in Africa). Life is shitty for everyone, not just women. If you read the Indian newspapers, you will find tens of shockingly bad things happening to men as well - but everyone is focusing on rapes. I know most people here would say ""Attention will encourage India to improve condition of women"". I agree, but thanks to too much focus, rape has become an emotional political issue in the country. People are no longer having sane discussions but indulging in rhetorics. When the recent [gang-rape](http://www.jpost.com/National-News/Six-14-year-old-boys-arrested-for-alleged-gang-rape-of-girl-12-335778) involving 12 boys happened in Israel, the Israeli media had discussions like ""How do we educate young boys against these things?"", ""Is access to pornography a problem?"" etc. In India, the discussions happening are ""Why do Indian men rape? - oped by Feminazi"", ""Minister should resign taking moral responsibility"" etc. This particular case for example became a headline because the communist opposition party tried to parade the victim's body to gain political mileage against the ruling party (that's why the police tried to 'hijack' the body - they did not actually cremate the body, btw - the ToIlet paper headline is misleading).",0,1388650847,,0,FALSE,1,cefcw6n,t3_1u6xi5,t1_cefcw6n,t1_cef7jo7,1427893583,229,FALSE,worldnews,t5_2qh13,229

TRUE,MajorPolstan,,,"No conspiracy here, just politics. The police didn't actually cremate the body (the headline is misleading - read the full article. That's why Times of India is called ToIlet paper - it's like Daily Fail of India).

The girl's father is a member of the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU), a trade union arm of the the Communist Party of India - Marxist (CPI-M), which is the main opposition party in the state where this happened. When the girl died, the CITU carried her body around the city for 3 hours in order to get political mileage against the ruling party TrinaMool Congress (TMC). In fact, one report claims that initially the father wanted no politics, but his CITU comrades 'snatched' away the body from the family for their rally.

The CITU wanted to organize a ""condolence rally"". The state government realized that this might turn into a political snowstorm like in Delhi, where the ruling government recently lost and the newly-formed political party which organized anti-rape protests (among other protests) is now in power. So, it ordered the police to stop the CITU procession.

The allegations that the police 'hijacked' the body have been made by CITU and CPI-M members (which include the girl's father). The police actually deny that they tried to cremate the body - or even forecefully take it. They say that they took possession of the body after consultation with the family members.

Irrespective of whether the police forcefully took the body or not, they did not cremate it (unlike what the headline says). Even according to the girl's father and CITU activists, the police could not cremate the body because they did not have the death certificate. The body was returned to the family and was cremated by them.

The entire thing has turned into political slugfest. In fact the victim's father has lodged a police complaint against the ruling chief minister (who is also the health minister) for causing his daughter's death due to medical negligence.

TRUE,VerdigolFludidi,,,"Hi!

I'm an electronic artist, you can listen to my stuff here: https://soundcloud.com/amiran

A lot of what you need to know depends on the genre you want to make the music in, but most of the decisions I have to make when creating a song are decisions every songwriter, composer/producer has to make. If you want straight up tutorials, I seriously recommend **Warbeats** if you decide to use FL Studio: http://warbeats.com/Tutorials This guy has really good video tutorials up on youtube, they're amazing, crystal clear and just straight up to the point.

I've been doing EDM for about 3 years now and I still re-check some of his videos if I've forgotten some old tricks.

I'll give you a basic overview of the most important aspects you'd likely need to consider. When you are still learning a lot, you'll likely also want to just focus on one of these aspects. It takes time and effort to be good at every aspect of the song composition.

**Rhythm**

A good rhythm is important - especially in EDM (electronic dance music). If you can bob your head to it, you are heading in the right direction. The simplest rhythm you can have is the techno house 4-on-the-floor beat. Dubstep rhythm is characterised by half-time beats. There are tons of other rhythms you can think of though, including moombahton, drum and bass, jungle and so on. Once you get an understanding of how to make these beats, you can move on and make your own - and maybe spawn a totally new genre in the process!

**Chords and Keys**

You have to know about basic chords, keys and scales. A chord is C major, for example. If your song is in the key of C major, too, then the chords you would most often use are: C major, D minor, E minor, F major, G major, A minor. Sometimes a song is just one chord, repeating over and over again - think of psychedelic trance. Sometimes you have an incredibly complex pattern of chords. A sequence of chords that you repeat is called chord progression. For example, the famous 4-chord progression in C major would be C, G, Am, F.

**Melody**

A good song is often just characterized by a damn good melody. I would argue that in pop music, melody is THE most important part of the song. If your song is in C major (also Cmaj or just C), your notes that you would use to create a melody are C, D, E, F, G, A, B. You might want to add a kind of blues or jazz touch to it - then you can use the D# note on the key of C major.

**Song structure**

Once you have a good beat, a nice chord progression and a catchy melody, you have to move on and see the song in the big picture. Your song might just start with some aggressive beat and end with it, like a god damn punk song. Different genres are characterized by different song structures, too. Progressive house starts with a melody, a chord progression or just a simple 4-on-the-floor beat and then adds elements to it as the song progresses, making minimal changes at once. The structure I use the most right now is just plain ol' intro, verse, riser, chorus, verse, riser, chorus. In pop music you find ""verse, chorus, verse, chorus, bridge, chorus, chorus"" to be most popular, with maybe an intro and an outro, too.

**Instrument sounds**

In electronic music, one thing you find yourself doing the most is just finding the right instrument. It is important to know how to make your own instruments through VST-s from scratch, but sometimes just shuffling through massive libraries of presets is an incredibly fun process. I cannot tell you how to pick your sounds - most often it's just this weird feeling that you have to get, a powerful subjective ""this is perfect!"" feeling. Genres are often described by describing their characteristic instruments only - this is especially true for dubstep, where the ""wobble bass"" is very pronouced.

**Sound quality: Mixing and mastering**

This is something I really like doing. You instrument that you've chosen have to be the right level. Making a clean mix is important. A clean mix that has things going on in all parts of the spectrum sounds good on every device - be it your headphones, powerful monitoring equipment or just a cheap car stereo.

Your instruments should usually have a frequency spectrum ""space"". You create that contained space by cutting out sounds. A bass sound you'd probably low-pass (cut out higher frequencies), guitar and vocal tracks you'll probably want to high-pass (cut lower frequencies below the lowest note that the vocalist sings). You contain your instruments in their spaces, but overall your song should cover the whole spectrum.

This way the bass won't mask the melody and the melody won't make the bass muddy.

**Variety**

Try to be creative in all aspects of the composition. Don't stick to one rhythm, try to experiment with chord progressions and don't be scared to use really weird sounds that you've never used before.

For me, when it gets really bad is when you save up for that weekend holiday and you realize that the locations you are going, while they may even be the most beautiful sights in the world, still don't offer you any inspiration or solace.  It's just more stuff.  Even if you lived in such a beautiful place, you still get the feeling, ""It would get old after a while.""

The technology seems like it helps, but I'm not so sure anymore.  All of the knowledge in the world, at our fingertips...and we're still not happy.  We get on sites like Facebook and Reddit every day like there's something NEW there that we NEED to see.  It's just another addiction to useless shit that does nothing for us.

You can only stare into an empty smartphone screen and eat Easy Mac for so long before you think ""Surely, this isn't how people are supposed to live.""  

I also think the increasing trend of atheism is something this generation is going to wrestle with.  There was a time in many of our lives where 'God' was inspiration to live happy.  Someone to pray to that offered something to hope for.  Now, for those of us who aren't professional philosophers, we can't get back to that place we once felt with Religion.  I know that no one's coming to save me....I'm all alone.  Meanwhile, I've got all this shit that is supposed to make me feel 'full', and it doesn't

An improvement in state of mind and a good relationship with someone you love seems to help alleviate it a bit, but the longer I work and support my family through this life the more I start envying the lives of those Amazonian tribesman who live in the little grass huts and take Ayahuasca every day.  

I wish it could be simple.  I wish people could be honest with themselves and others.  I'm tired of all the lies.

Shit, that got out of hand fast.

**Edit:** I got so many positive comments, it's going to be difficult to respond to all of them. With this kind of response, I think it's safe to say that what I wrote here struck a bit of a chord with the core Reddit demographic.  I think the most important thing to those who feel the way that we do (I'm with you), is to acknowledge these feelings.  You can't appreciate the good and move forward, until you acknowledge the bad.  Maybe, now that we have all of this wonderful technology, we can set our children (the next generation) on a search for truth, meaning, and peace from the very start so they might avoid some of our pitfalls.

Congrats, you've made it.  Unlike the vast majority of the people who will read your words and mine, you've realized that you participate in a society in which you are essentially *required* to work, and your reward is some resources and time - what you do with them is up to you.  This is a realization that most people will spend their lives without.  No, it is not fair sometimes, but it is nonetheless the truth.

Some perspective: you have traveled further in your life in terms of miles/km than most people in all of history.  You have heard more languages, you have consumed more resources and you have killed more trees.  You have eaten more animals, worked more hours, been more productive, seen further into space, met more people and been exposed to more ideas than ever before.  There's a good chance that 250 years ago you would've been born, lived and died in the same country, probably the same county, and 500 years ago probably the same town.

You're right, it will get old after a while and there's *nothing wrong* with thinking that things are ""dull"" because quite frankly, the current life is the only one you've ever known.

Imagine that even back then, there was ""old"".  To clarify, when Caesar saw the pyramids, he was closer to the moon landing than their construction.  He could only ever read about what that was like, and likewise we can only read about him.  I'm sure peoples in that time had the same feelings you do, with a little bit less perspective perhaps.

Eventually, someone will look back on this time while reading a history book and go ""Damn I wonder what it was like when so few people could go to space.""  Ideally, they'll be reading it from some space station thing where beds are made from boobs and mountain dew isn't bad for you, but we can only hope.

But I digress.

What I mean to say is that you are lucky enough to have more time than ever and more resources than ever.  You won't be happy going to some exotic place because you know that it's not as hard as it once was - and nothing worth having comes easy.  So don't just go there, learn the history of the place (from ""the beginning"" - I would suggest Guns, Germs and Steel first, then everything about the location from then on), learn some of the language and the culture (widely exported for most places these days, but the more remote locations will require to you to hit a library).  Don't settle for the Cliff's Notes - read the whole book.  You have to *make* these things hard because it's too easy to book a flight and a vacation package these days and not actually press yourself mentally.  There's real value to ""expanding your horizons"" although in the modern time this means mentally more than physically.  I know people who've been to Vietnam whose sole exposure to their history begins when the US started supporting French Indochina - and many of them don't know where that name came from.  Đó là một sự xấu hổ.

Notice a pattern here?

Reading.  Always keep reading.

That's my advice to you, as long winded and unlettered as it may be.

You know what's more impressive than an old guy (or girl!) who has been around the world and exposed themselves to many ideas?  The same person with a giant library.  In fact, you'll rarely find an interesting, traveled, well-rounded (""Renaissance"") person who does not have a huge library.  Thomas Jefferson's library became the Library of Congress.

This was hastily assembled, sorry for any typographical errors.

TL;DR: ""It's never too early to start beefing up your obituary."" and you should work on making yours quite the novel - but novels are read, not watched on youtube.

P.S. You should hear my rant on ""a picture says a thousand words"".

Remember when you visited an amusement park while you were very young? When you arrived in the morning, you were almost shaking from the excitement and you (perhaps naively) thought that you NEVER wanted to go home.
As the day progressed you tried amusements one by one. Some bored you, some you retried numerous times, but the urgency you felt at first has faded leaving you to savour the individual experiences at a slower pace. Come evening you have become tired and the thought of going home seems more and more appealing, and when the park closes you tiredly follow your parents to the car remembering an awesome day, having only a slight regret that it has ended, and perhaps even being glad for the opportunity to rest.

We are all ""children"" arriving at the amusement park that is life. If you are not old, you aren't meant to be ready to accept your mortality. Instead savour the amusements/experiences you have, and come time the prospect of facing your mortality becomes less and less daunting. Some elderly describe death as an old friend, but you (and I, I'm not THAT old) cannot yet see it that way. And that is as it should be.

[Comparison of Quality of Care for Patients in the Veterans Health Administration and Patients in a National Sample](http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=718025) 

&gt; Overall, VHA patients were more likely than patients in the national sample to receive the care specified by the indicators (67% vs. 51%; difference, 16 percentage points [CI, 14 to 18 percentage points]). Performance in the VHA outpaced that of the national sample for both chronic care (72% vs. 59%; difference, 13 percentage points [CI, 10 to 17 percentage points]) and preventive care (64% vs. 44%; difference, 20 percentage points [CI, 12 to 28 percentage points]), but not for acute care (53% vs. 55%; difference, −2 percentage points [CI, −9 to −4 percentage points]). In particular, the VHA sample received significantly better care for depression, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension. The VHA also performed consistently better across the entire spectrum of care, including screening, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up. These differences in quality of care held true when we considered only those indicators (n = 72) supported by randomized, controlled trials (57% vs. 45%; difference, 12 percentage points [CI, 3 to 20 percentage points]).


[Vets Loving Socialized Medicine Show Government Offers Savings](http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aLIc5ABThjBk) 

&gt; Patients routinely rank the veterans system above the alternatives, according to the American Customer Satisfaction Index. Last year, the government program got a satisfaction rating of 85 for inpatient treatment, compared with 77 for private hospitals. The index, a University of Michigan project, found that veterans’ outpatient care scored 3 points higher.
&gt; 
&gt; Proponents say the agency also offers a model for restraining health-care costs. While an August report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found a “substantial degree of cost control,” it also said the comparison with private care is difficult because of the changing mix of enrollees in the veterans system and differing benefits.

FWIW, the general rule in the US the health care provided by the government almost always tends to be much better at controlling waste, fraud and abuse ([the rates in private health care](http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/news/news/2010-report-card.page) were double that of [public health care](http://cnsnews.com/news/article/medicare-and-medicaid-made-70-billion-improper-payments-last-year-more-all-spending) as of 2011); [more efficient and capable](http://www.ama-assn.org/resources/doc/psa/2012-nhirc-results.pdf) of delivering services (and doing so [pretty consistently](http://www.ama-assn.org/resources/doc/psa/2012-nhirc-comparison.pdf)); and [better at controlling spending](http://theincidentaleconomist.com/wordpress/medicaid-spending-growth-is-surprisingly-modest/). So again, the people saying that public health insurance is all scalpel jockeys operating in Civil War-era hygenic conditions on the government dime while the glorious free market works better and cheaper are either completely clueless or lying their faces off.

Yes, the whole cell doesn't need to depolarise. I imagine that you have a whole lot of little zones of depolarisation occurring all around the cell membrane, like little sparks, and some of these sparks can cause little sparks nearby, but the channels are too few and far between so you can't trigger an explosion (mass depolarisation). In fact, the normal resting state of the cell probably has all these little sparks flashing as channels cycle and small currents/potentials occur but they are few and far apart.

But near the Axon Hillock there are large amount of receptors packed in there, so a few sparks landing in there, set off a few channels, and then the surrounding channels and BOOM!

I'm pretty sure that there isn't an intracellular protein that travels across the cell. It is due to the effect of these areas of electrical potential, and a function of the electric fields generated across the cell membrane. Remember one channel depolarising creates current flow across the membrane and an electrical field spreading out on the surface of the membrane (radially). This electrical field strength drops (inversely proportional to distance squared) but still it is able to cause effects some distance away (from the point of view of the channel). So when one channel sparks it can trigger another channel that seems far far away from the point of view of the channel.

&gt;Rich investors are able to target moments of opportunity and make things happen. The shallow mass of capital controlled by ""the 99%"" can not be targeted (although new innovations like Kickstarter have interesting implications in changing that).

You're talking about capital investment and I'm talking about supply and demand. They're two parts of the process, but they're not the same thing. And you're right about capital, though it's hilarious that you denigrate the amount of capital the 99% have while championing those who keep that amount as low as possible.

My point is that it's useless to invest capital where there is no demand. For 99% of products you need the 99% of the people to generate the demand that scales enough to keep our economy growing. You suppress the income of the 99% and demand stagnates. That's pretty easy, right? The money of the rich does scale and make things possible. But the U.S. economy doesn't run on a million families buying a Mercedes and a yacht and hiring a personal chef. It runs on tens of millions of people buying Chevys and pizzas and paying for day care. The spending of the rich is great for Ruth's Chris' waitresses and marina owners, but you'll notice how many of those there are compared to McDonald's and movie theaters.

&gt; Who do you think invests in new technologies and ideas?

A lot of the time it's the government. I actually work in this sector, so think twice before you pull out a prefabricated talking point. I hear them all the time and they're the product of a political agenda, not an understanding of how things work. It's a long chain of events with lots of places for people to spend money. But fundamental R&amp;D -- where truly new technologies and ideas come from -- is too expensive and risky for most companies to take on in a big way. You've got your IBMs and others, but a lot of what you see reported as R&amp;D is taking a government-funded breakthrough and engineering it into a product. Meanwhile, billions and billions of your tax dollars get funneled through government agencies to universities and others who do the fundamental research that leads to breakthroughs. And look at the medium you're using: first computer? Government. Internet? Government. GPS (if you're on your phone)? Government. And when you get something with a flexible display? Government (in a consortium with industry and universities). When you can run it all off sun light? Government (again, in cooperation with a lot of people).

&gt;Care you elaborate? Actually make an argument? How is it different? As you make your argument, remember that regulation is enforced by armed law enforcement officers and leads to confiscation or incarceration.

""incarceration"" Ha! That's a good one. A guy sells an ounce of pot and goes to jail for decades. Bank executives launder a billion for a cartel and the bank gets a fine equal to a few weeks' worth of profit. The rich don't see much jail time and the corporations who insist they are people are very scrupulous about not being people when it comes time for somebody to go to jail.

But the difference is easy to see if you get out. I served in Berlin when there was still a wall and along the DMZ in Korea. I've been to the Balkans and Saudi Arabia. A regulation that limits your ability to trade is coercion, but it's not the same as the coercion that puts people in slave labor camps and works them to death. There's a vast moral gulf between the two, just as there is between the physical blow of a slap on the cheek and the physical blow of a brick to the temple. The language will allow you to flatten them all under one vague heading, but reality won't let them be the same thing morally.

Look, you've bought into one side and I've bought into something else. I'm sure we've both read the articles about how difficult it is to get people to change their minds. I've been poor, I've been all over the world (albeit in the Army) and I work in the heart of the military-industrial complex. Your arguments won't overcome my experience, and I'm sure my arguments won't overcome whatever education or experience formed your opinions.

The year was 1987, and it was the World Junior Championships.  Canada was playing Russia in Piestany, and after a long, gritty game, things started to go south.  

A little skirmish led into a shoving match, which turned into a fight, which turned into a line brawl.  The thing to remember here is that fighting was unheard of in Russian hockey.  It was considered savage, brutal, and unsportsmanlike.  Unfortunately for the Russians, this sort of play style was right in the Canadians' wheelhouse.  Aggression was our speciality, and we knew it.

The Russians had little to no experience with fighting, and most lacked the intensity and willpower to even fight back... While the Canadians threw punches, the Russians just tried to grab sweaters and sleeves and hold on for dear life.

Russians didn't fight... they just didn't.  Except for one kid.  At 19 years old, 5'11"", and 170 pounds, Russian forward Vladimir Konstantinov stood little chance against his opponents, yet he stood and fought all the same.  

As events escalated, officials tried desperately to break up the fighting... but the Canadians still fought, and so did Konstantinov. Having lost control of the situation, the officials left the ice... but the Canadians still fought, and so did Konstantinov.  Desperate measures were taken, as the lights to the entire arena were shut off in an attempt to stop the anarchy... but the Canadians still fought, and so did Konstantinov.

Four years later in his rookie season, Konstantinov's first defensive partner in the NHL would be a Canadian kid by the name of Steve Chiasson... and when his English improved, they discovered why.  Steve Chiasson was Konstantinov's first dance partner on that infamous night in Piestany, 1987.

When asked why the Red Wings drafted this little Russian kid nobody ever heard of at 221st overall, Neil Smith, a scout who attended the 1987 World Juniors spoke up... **""He was the only one of the Russians who fought back.""**

Vladimir Konstantinov would go on to be arguably the most feared and aggressive Russian in NHL history.  Notorious for his devastating open-ice hits, his defensive skill and puck handling often took players by surprise.  In '95-'96, he led the entire NHL with a plus-60 rating, and he finished second only to Brian Leetch in '96-'97 Norris Trophy race.  That same year, he helped lead the Detroit Red Wings to their first Stanley Cup in 42 years... and was subsequently paralysed in a tragic limousine crash.

[If you watch the footage from that evening, you can see Konstantinov start off in the bottom right corner of the screen... He's number 16 in red.  And it stayed that way.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZMEE7tlq6A)

TRUE,xathor,,,"Today I am wearing my crummy little $4 watch and if you are interested I will tell you it's story.

A few years ago, back when I was in the Air Force, I was deployed to Balad, Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.  I was in a small 3 man team that managed all of the base security forces tactical radios.  This included every radio that the patrolling units, base defense units, tower snipers and multiple entry control points used to also include radios inside of tactical vehicles.  Basically, if it was on base or around base and was a PRC-117, PRC-152 or ASIP radio, it was my domain.  There were a few additional type of radios, but that's outside the scope of this story.  

All of these radios, that everyone used to ensure base defense communications, relied heavily on a frequency hopping technology called SINCGARS.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SINCGARS if you want to read about it.  These radios ideally needed to have time manually entered into them to within 4 seconds of the primary timing master.

For timing we used a device called a DAGR, which is basically a GPS unit.  Everyone had them, and they typically run on batteries if not hard mounted inside a vehicle.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_Advanced_GPS_Receiver if you want to read about it.  I don't know if any of you have been deployed before, but sometimes batteries are hard to come across.  Also, the DAGR takes about minute to five minutes to get a GPS lock after it's been turned off for a while.  

Everytime someone would mess with their radio, pull the battery or get a new crypto loaded, the time would have to be reset.  Waiting several minutes to re-time a radio 20-30 times a day is a pain in the butt.  

At the time I was wearing a Timex Weekender that I had strapped to my pack that I wore all the time.  I had the watch strapped to a loop that was on my left shoulder so I could look over and see the time.  Well, sure enough that watch got smashed to bits one day while I was getting into an MRAP.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRAP if you want to read about that.

Where does this little Chinese Darch watch come into play?  Well, my birthday was about 2 weeks before I deployed to Iraq... my dad had given me this cheap watch as a gift.  I hadn't thought much of it and tossed it in my bag as I was packing for my deployment.  After my Timex got demolished, I grabbed the Darsh and started wearing it.

So what makes the watch special?  Well, like I mentioned before, pulling a DAGR out multiple times a day to reset radios is annoying.  I used to have a daily ritual of setting my Timex to GPS time throughout the day.  The Timex seemed to be very fast, gaining several seconds through a day.  It didn't take but a few days to realize that the Darsh is very, very accurate... losing about a second a week if I remember correctly.  This was a huge time saver for me, not having to worry about having to ensure that my watch was set on GPS time.  As an additional bonus, the Darch has proven to be quite durable.  After a 9 month deployment, it has some nice wear on the sides and a few scratches on the face.  

TL;DR:  I used a $4 watch to time an entire military network that ensured safe and reliable communications for base defense in a war zone for nearly a year.

TRUE,Skeletorfw,,,"Ahhhh sleep paralysis, my old friend...

First time ever it was formed of a more realistic multicoloured version of this illustration: http://imgur.com/nV0EPfc. It was floating about half a foot away from my face, and in my doorway I could see an abnormally large silhouette illuminated by light coming through the cracks. This was right at the edge of my eye-movement range and I could not move my head to see it more clearly. There were sounds of scrabbling and faint chatter from the foot and sides of my bed, but the sources of this were out of my eyeline. I had a very strong feeling of unease, could barely breathe due to the chest putting weight on my lungs, and I felt very cold. After a while I managed to move a big toe, then some more toes, then a finger and finally my limbs. As soon as I regained most of my movement the hallucinations faded.

This happened when i was approximately 14.

And for now the most recent time, last year:

I was lying on the floor of my SO's old room with them because they only had a single bed. The bed itself was on my side of the room, and as I faced that way the wrought black iron curls of the frame were at eye level. I drifted off to sleep and dreamt that I was in a theater, watching a production. Everything was blurry and hard to make out, but I noticed as I blinked that they became perfectly in focus with my eyes shut. They were disturbingly malformed pastiches of clowns, and there were silhouetted spirals in the background. I opened my eyes again and it was blurry, then closed them again to see in perfect clarity. As I did this a few times I realised that the spirals I was seeing were made up of the spirals in the ironwork of the bed, but even armed with that knowledge I could still see the grotesque puppet show style performance in a blurred manner.

I tried to scream for help but couldn't and so carried on blinking, recognising that this was in fact sleep paralysis, but still being absolutely terrified of the things I was seeing. I could perceive the music of the show faintly, and the sense of unease rushed over me again. I naturally couldn't turn my body, and so felt that there was something watching me from the doorway who I couldn't turn to see.

I focussed desperately on trying to get even the slightest sound out of my lungs and controlling my fear. The curls of the bed started to look more like a bedframe and less like projected stage design, and whilst the show became clearer in my eyes, the stuff which actually was behind the framework of the bed started to become faintly visible. Finally I could hear my voice making a little bit of noise, no words yet but sound was at least some progress. Eventually I managed to get a slurred version of the words ""hug me"" out which got more and more understandable each time I said it as I regained conscious control of my speech. Finally I woke up my SO and they hugged me and made me feel safe until the fear and adrenaline subsided.

It was weird to hear my own voice shouting in a slurred and incomprehensible manner when my logical mind was entirely conscious.

**NOTES:**

- A few things about this second story are interesting. The main point is that sleep paralysis almost exclusively happens when in a supine or dorsal sleeping position (on your back or your front) and so for it to happen with me lying on my side is certainly uncommon, though it is documented as being possible. I have a theory or so regarding why it is common to experience this on your back or front, but no evidence to back it up presently. :( Also it is interesting that I get the pressure, without the typical demon which a lot of people see. I get analogues, but certainly it's uncommon.

- It's tricky to learn how to fight out of it, and unpredictable whether you can manage, but a good thing to do is focus on control of your blinking and your eyes and then see if you can make a face muscle work, or maybe a little muscle like those controlling your toes. Then move up from there.

- To those who do not have it, I'd like to point out that it's kind of like having your logic completely there and sound, but with your imagination still in dream mode and running free and wild.

**tl;dr:** Initial experience had scary green skull and feelings of unease. Latest was perturbing and had various auditory and visual hallucinations. It was bloody terrifying but also interesting.

TRUE,JJEagleHawk,,,"Lived in London for a year. Some things I found unusual (as a midwestern American):

(1) It's been said already, but ""You alright?"" as a greeting is something I never really acclimated to.

(2) You don't say hello to strangers. Rare to even even acknowledge them. I thought that was just a big-city (London) thing, because I've definitely seen that in NYC, but that was true everywhere we went in England.
EDIT: Maybe just the few places we went; apparently Northern England (Yorkshire, instance?) is friendlier.

(3) The orderliness of escalators is awesome -- stand on the right, walk on the left -- yet for some reason sidewalks are a disorderly mess.

(4) ""Mate"" has a range of applications, from genuine friends to a sarcastic address to irritating strangers. (Of course, when you refer to that irritating stranger later to one of your mates, you might call him a ""bloke"" or a ""geezer"" to indicate that he wasn't a true mate.)

(5) Tube cars with no tourists on them are deathly quiet -- it's almost like Brits think eye-contact and conversation spreads disease. If you're on the Tube and talking, 8/10 chance you're a tourist, and 9.8/10 if you don't have headphones in.

(6) Charitable giving. It's tough to find people that don't have an automatic debit for a charity -- RSPCA, Bernardos, Cancer Research UK -- and tough to find a high street without a charity shop. I know Americans also give to charities but it seems much less compulsory. People (in Britain) often support charities solely due to a personal connection to the charity, whereas in the U.S. it's more (though not only) for tax reasons. (*H/T to /u/Alexinsfo)

(7) Pub culture -- people take their kids to pubs! Here, bars are lonely places where alcoholics and 20-somethings go to get hammered. There, pubs are merely socializing hubs. I rather like that, actually, and miss it back stateside.

(8) Panto.

(9) Just-barely-below-room-temperature ""real ales"". WTF, guys? EDIT: WOAH, Backlash unanticipated. Note I am not promoting traditional american-style lagers as a superior product.

**(10) Can't believe I forgot this one . . . but pull-string lights in the bathroom. Everywhere else in the house will have light switches, but the bathrooms in a lot of houses still have a pull-string light. (Don't get me started on split taps, either.)

I wouldn't be so quick on the ""no one can tell you"" stuff. It is hard to be truly helpful in some areas, but people do make noble efforts at it that are worth sharing from time to time.

It is mostly sweat though, years of it. Then again you also have these young upstarts like Porter Robonson who are barely born yet and are sudden popstars, but BT took him under his wing so what do you expect, heh.

I have arrived at a few tips that aren't often heard (which isn't to say im good at this or anything):

* Pick a single synth plugin and master the ever loving shit out of it, don't jump into another one until you are absolutely sure that it can't make the sound that you want (mine is zynaddsubfx), don't let the marketers rope you in (a lot of those tutorial lords are paid to endorse one plugin or another).

* All the brilliant mixing and mastering in the world will do nothing if your sound design and composition is shit

* You can get lost in tutorials, howto videos and books all damn day and not create anything, at a certain point you have to stop learning and start experimenting, I limit myself to 2 hours of instructionals a day and honestly that is probably too much

* And finally, nobody is grading you, so dont be afriad to cheat. If you dont know what chords will fit into the key you are using, whip out http://www.mucoder.net/en/tonespace/, if you have a melody in your head that you can't seem to plot on the piano roll, then sing it into an audio to midi converter, if you suck at playing the keyboard then get one of those shits that remaps all the in-key notes to the white ones, like [the shwarzinator](https://www.ableton.com/en/packs/schwarzonator/)


There are a couple more inspiring things out there. 

* Posted a little while ago showing westbam in 1994, (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfhVbHj4mPs), you'll notice that neither of them really know how to play the keyboard and just plink around until something sounds good, and that guy is a legend.

* Also the aformentioned Shwarzinator, an amazing performer that can't play an instrument and uses a plugin to fake it.

* This brilliant classic by james holden (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRWUZh5nD8I), released in the year 2000 was made entirely using Buzz, notable because it is freeware. Prime evidence of not needing expensive software and an army of plugins to make something worth hearing. What if I told you that modern freeware is better than the stuff that was out there in the year 2000?

TRUE,boojit,,,"In this specific example, there's nothing wrong with the way you did it in the second case; many programmers might be partial to having it written that way.

There is also an important distinction here about ""storing stuff in memory"" that you should understand, although you may need to progress further in your studies before you fully appreciate the details. Basically, both cases are ""storing stuff in memory"", it's just that in your second case, you're not keeping a *reference* (remember that word, it's important) to the memory location where you stored the stuff. This line here stores stuff in memory:

    Console.ReadLine();

As you know, it stores the string value of whatever you type in on the keyboard, until ""enter"" is pressed. It doesn't matter if you assign the output of this command to a variable or not, in either case, within the guts of ReadLine, it is allocating memory and putting the contents of what you've typed in that memory location.

When you do this:

    uservalue = Console.ReadLine();

What you're doing is you're saying, ""after you store what i've typed into memory, give me a reference to that memory location so that I can find it later, and call that reference uservalue"". 

If you don't create a reference to the output from ReadLine, then that memory usage will eventually get cleaned up (by something called a ""garbage collector"" no less). But as long as you have at least one reference to that memory location, then the garbage collector will leave it alone.

Lot of big concepts in there, is it making any sense?

1. The geographical interpretation of the City of London.

TRUE,In_The_News,,,"OOK since everyone is so wrapped up in the ""that's sexist"" argument, lets throw around things like historical context and gender politics of the time 

AT THE TIME women were only ""allowed"" to contribute columns based on domestic care and social notes.  They were not thought capable of the ""mental taxation"" required for journalism. 

People very much cared what she had to say because she frequently campaigned *in place of her husband* which was not only unheard of for the time, but gave her remarkable power in conveying presidential policy. 

She even had several pet-projects of her own that had national implications.  

Through all this she chose to continue to empower women.  Newspapers of the time would rather fold than be scooped by rivals. With two editions coming out daily, and the First Lady only allowing women in, it became an incredibly groundbreaking movement in journalism to put women in the position of political corespondents. 

It forced major corporations to hire women, publish their stories and stand behind their reporters as competent.  By having some of the biggest, most prominent media giants of the time stand behind women reporters, it gave females in general more credence.   

If she had allowed men in, no women's stories would have been published *at all.* The gender politics of the time dictated that *only men* were capable and worthy to be published on such ""weighty"" matters. 

In addition, having women write stories gave them a different perspective. Men of the time were very skeptical of Eleanor and looked for opportunities to undermine her and her missions. She seriously shook up the political, gender and racial norms of the time that rich white men running large media empires depended on.  Eleanor wisely did the modern-day equivalent of ""banished Fox news"" (except ratcheted up about 10 notches) from her addresses.   

Eleanor Roosevelt was a groundbreaking feminist at a time when feminism meant the difference between being able to go to the bank and make a withdraw without your husband's permission.  Or being able to take out any kind of loan. Or get a job that was not considered ""suitable"" for women. Or having to sign your paychecks over to your husband.  Being born in the late 1800s, she came of age during the Suffrage movement.  Think about that, *women didn't even have the right to vote.* 

This is coming from an Editor who probably owes her livelihood to Roosevelt bringing women into the journalistic fold. 

**Edit** Holy cow this comment blew up. Thanks for the gold, stranger. 

As cool as it is that this has spawned so much discussion, I was hoping to get away from simplistic rhetoric on sexism and highlight what a truly paradigm shifting woman Eleanor Roosevelt was. She took forceful measures to improve life for women, minorities and the poor. I would hate for all of her accomplishments to be overshadowed by her (at times admittedly, but necessary) heavy-handed methods to bring about change and truly pull the curtain on social/economic inequality and injustice.

I don't give a shit if your friend's uncle's 2nd cousin once removed was flung from an exploding tanker truck, he's obviously the exception. You're putting everyone else in my car in danger and on top of that, you argue with me even though I'm being nice enough to take you somewhere. You might as well say seatbelts cause autism because that's how fucking stupid that argument sounds.

Edit: since someone paid me in gold, I'll do the justice of answering the most asked questions:

*How does it endanger others in the car?*

Not wearing a seatbelt is dangerous for everyone in the car because you don't stop just because the car does. If you're strapped to the car, you still risk internal injury from the sudden deceleration but if you're not, you're going to continue in your path of motion (see Newton's first law of motion) and the only thing that's going to stop you is what you come in contact with; which could very well be anyone else in the car. 

*Statistically seatbelt deaths vs. non-seatbelt deaths are about 1:1*

There's a blurred area in those statistics. How many of those deaths were preventable with a seatbelt versus the amount of deaths that are prevented with one? There's no way to answer that so therefore the argument is invalid. ",0,1388685620,,0,1388709242,1,ceflcu5,t3_1u8pv1,t1_ceflcu5,t3_1u8pv1,1431768729,1925,FALSE,AdviceAnimals,t5_2s7tt,1925

I used to be 310.  When I started losing weight, I did it by controlling my diet, and then started doing dance dance revolution ( a game where you bounce up and down on a game pad )

I learned that you can, in fact, break a dance dance revolution pad, a little too easily actually.

When I started, I would be on easy mode for 30 minutes then collapse in a fat heap on the ground.  Sometimes just gasping for breath and wheezing.

Then I would get up, and generally do it again (I had a goal for 1 hour a day).

I did this for months before I got an exercise bike, which I promptly broke (too heavy for the seat), and then i got another one (I rode the seat all the way down for a couple weeks).

I still do exercise bike, and now I run, do adventure racing, swimming, climbing, hiking.

My ""Fat Problems""

I have asthma
I have/had bad knees (this problem barely affects me after I lost my weight)
I have no fullness reflex, I can literally eat until I throw up and never feel satiated, only time I ever felt what I think people call full is when I eat really rich foods like liver.  (I think it is full, I just don't want to eat more but I am not sure)

I have a nerve pinching problem, that when I was overweight made it so that some days I would writhe in pain when at work (programmer) unless I massive pain meds, and I would just sit at home on the floor crying when it was at its worse (around 2004 when I was around 280).

But, here I am.  

This kind of ""i can't fix myself"" or even ascribing that to others, really makes me angry sometimes.

I also don't like the fatlogic forums pre-disposition at times to think that fat people (general) are lazy.  Fat people just don't have the same goals.  I never really gave a shit about whether I was thin, until it became a serious health problem.  I never even thought in terms that the fat logic groups here assume.  I loved being overweight for the eating.

Even today, I eat a ton, and I exercise to compensate.  Sometimes, and I know it goes against this sub, that cake really does taste better than being thin.  It is just about priorities.

What I dislike is fat people who say they want to be thin, but then demonstrate fat logic to say they can't help it, and no one else should.

I see that abound here in the stories posted, and I think it is horrible and I think it should be fought against tooth and nail.

It is one thing to accept who you are, and not want to be bullied, quite another to argue that who you are is OK, and healthy, and fighting against a physical ideal which actually promotes health.

With Soldado not providing the expected goal output, many have called for Defoe to replace him in the starting XI. But Defoe is wholly incapable of getting his teammates involved in the same way that Soldado can. Defoe would have shot that opportunity into a defender, where as Soldado took the time to pick up his head and find a better goal scoring chance.

Furthermore, he's far more tactically aware than Defoe, working the wide channels when the team shape get's lopsided. Before Adebayor was back in action, that left Spurs a little headless in attack. But now with a second striker in the mix, it's made his distribution from wide positions far more threatening as there's a target to play to. Soldado's assist to Adebayor last week is a prime example of this.

TRUE,GeneralMillss,,,"Here's the thing about NASCAR, and stock car racing in general. As compared to other forms of motorsport, like road racing that takes place on a circuit, NASCAR does seem boring on the surface. However, that loop-de-loop is not as easy to do as it looks.

The way that I like to think of it is that road/circuit racing is like an obstacle course; agility and versatility are extremely important, although specializing in certain aspects of the event may or may not help you. NASCAR is like walking a tightrope. The car needs to be balanced at all times, and a minuscule error in input will lose you valuable fractions of a second.

But that's just the skill side of things. People performing a difficult task won't make that task interesting to everyone, and that's fair. As we know, motor racing is a contest to see who can go faster than the next guy, and fastest out of everyone by driving a vehicle.

The things that make motor sport exiting to me are the risk/reward scenarios, the strategy, and, above nearly all else, overtaking. Overtaking is exciting because there is always a moment where a mistake by either driver means everything could go horribly wrong. It's one of those things that make you hold your breath and wince, and then all at once let it go. No matter if it's my guy or his rival, a good overtaking move is just creamy smooth goodness to a racing fan.

Now, I should make note here that I do not consider myself a NASCAR fan, per se. I'm an F1 guy. One of the biggest ""problems"" they have been trying to solve in F1 as of late (and the decisions to this end are cause for much debate, but that's a story for another day) is the small amount of overtaking present in the sport these days. This depends heavily on the track, but your average Grand Prix will have 40-50 overtakes/passes a race, and often times, after the last round of pit-stops have been made, you can pretty easily predict what the podium will look like.

Then there is NASCAR. An F1 car is a 600kg fine-tuned laboratory on wheels, while a NASCAR sock car is about as technologically advanced as an Ikea book case, relatively speaking. But the racing in NASCAR is fantastic. Stop thinking about the simple looking tracks, and start thinking about how every one of those cars has a guy behind the wheel trying to drive out of his skin. Hundreds of overtakes per race. Every lap keeps you on the edge of your seat.

You could say that NASCAR is about as plain as racing gets, and that's the beauty of it. Just a bunch of boys having a go at each other with horsepower. There’s no stewards enquiries, no expensive courtroom battles; drivers in NASCAR settle their own differences. In NASCAR, if a driver hits you unnecessarily, you hit them back. So long as things don’t get massively out of hand, drivers get away with retaliation too.

You know, now that I think about it, NASCAR is a bit stupid. At the end of the day, it really is just a bunch of dopes spinning around a race track for fun. But that's why racing, and other sports for that matter, exist in the first place. To see who's stronger, faster; better. 

If racing isn't your thing, nobody should be offended that you don't ""get"" NASCAR.

Worse than that, the first Dragon Warrior game released in the US after the NES games was Dragon Warrior VII, released in October 2001, for the PlayStation. In October. 2011. PlayStation. US JRPG gamers were all playing Final Fantasy X, released in July of 2001. For the PlayStation **2**.

Electromagnetism relies on a concept that we call Gauge Invariance and assume to be one of the (if not the most) fundamental concepts of nature. It's kind of hard to explain in layman terms, as you need to have at least a little grasp of quantum mechanics. 

In quantum mechanics it's all about wavefunctions, that substitute the classical picture of a particle's 'state'. The wavefunction contains every information about a given physical system. 
And it seems like a mathematical artefact, that this state does not change, if you multiply it by an arbitrary number (in fact it can be even a complex number). This is what we call **Global Gauge Invariance**. 

Now what would happen, if we apply this locally? What if we multiply the wavefunction with different numbers depending on the position in space-time?
**Local Gauge Invariance** states, that such transformation should still be allowed and if we assume that to be true, than we are forced to introduce a new field, that compensates the effects of that transformation. This field has to be massless and if you look for it's properties you find, that it behaves exatcly like the electromagnetic field. 

So we say today, that electromagnetism follows from ""local U(1) gauge invariance"", which means exactly what I just said. (U(1) is another word for the set of complex numbers with an absolute value of 1; the language is the one of group theory, because more complex interactions as for example the strong interaction involve more complex gauge groups.) The particle's charge takes the place of some kind of coupling constant between the particlefield and the introduced electromagnetic field.

Now why did I tell that to you? 
The truth is, that this procedure does not automatically ensure that opposite charges attract and like charges repel. 
I never thought about it that way but i'm pretty sure that you can totally write down a theory in which it is exactly the other way around. 

So up to today's knowledge: 
We don't know why charges act the way they do. I know that this was a pretty long introduction for such a dissapointing conclusion, but I wanted to point out one thing: 
We know pretty well why there is electromagnetism in the first place and much of it's behaviour simply follows from this. 
It is just that to our knowledge it could work the other way around equally well and nature simply chose our way. 

EDIT: I have one little thing to add: as many other numbers in the standard model (for example the masses) the charges of the elementary particles are (until today) free parameters, that can be adjusted to fit the observed coupling strength. 
Of course, physicists hope, that a unified theory would explain those parameters. 

EDIT2: Zelrak is right. I thougth I could come up with a reversed-attraction-theory by altering the way the gauge transformation of the electromagnetic field works, but that doesn't make no difference at all as it is merely formal (you can always absorb the sign into the gauge function, for example). For the more technically interested ones: what can indeed be changed is the sign of the electric and the magnetic field, but if you choose to do so, then the force exhibited on charged particles also catches an extra sign (in classical terms **F**' = **-** (q**E**' + **v** x **B**')) and therefore stays unchanged.

Garage door openers manufactured after January 1, 1993 are required by federal law to have advanced safety features that comply with the latest UL 325 standards. Contact your manufacturer or installer for additional information. 

Test the reversing feature once a month.

First, test the balance of the door (see ""Testing and Maintaining The Garage Door""). If the door is properly balanced, then proceed.
With the door fully open, place a 1½-2"" thick piece of wood (a 2x4"" laid flat) on the floor in the center of the door.
Push the transmitter or wall button to close the door. The door must reverse when it strikes the wood. (Note that the bottom part of ""one piece doors"" must be rigid so that the door will not close without reversing.)
If the door does not have reverse, have it repaired or replaced. Have a qualified individual adjust, repair or replace the opener or door.

Force Setting Test
Test the force setting of your garage door opener by holding the bottom of the door as it closes. If the door does not reverse readily, the force may be excessive and need adjusting. See your owner’s manual for details on how to make the adjustment. Test the reversing feature after any adjustment.

TRUE,ENRN,,,"I am sorry to hear your girlfriend is going through this. Nursing is a funny profession where horizontal violence is rampant, especially for new nurses. It was likely some mean spirited, self aggrandizing long standing nurse wanting to show a new nurse how the standards have dropped since she went to nursing school with Phoebe in 55AD - observed this and either independently or with her brood wanted to make a point. The chances are a simple head bob, was passed onto management that she is regularly sleeping, missing call bells and one patient who has no legs and both arms in casts even fell, tended their wounds and got themselves back into bed all during one of her extended naps. They probably added that she wears no underwear, regularly texts inappropriate message, sings Rick Astley out loud and farts by the sleeping patients and blames them. Unfortunately there are some bad nurse managers, who like the drama as much as the lead nurse and happily play into it. 

My first job was horrendous - on my first day my preceptor told me that this unit was not for men as the patients required care only a women could give. It went down from there - a group of nurses regularly emailed the nurse manager that ENRN did this, or didn't do that. I would then be called into the nurse managers office where she would say I cannot disclose the incident to ensure the confidentiality of her staff, but I allegedly didn't change someones soiled sheets, refused someone pain medicine, or wouldn't hold a gentleman's testicles to help him sleep. With no specifics I couldn't defend the story, so I just assured her I was aware of the complaint and would work harder. This went on for a few months and then I resigned. When I left the nurse manager said that I was going to have a hard time in nursing, especially in acute care (this unit was med/surg at a regional hospital) and I should consider following my dream of becoming a truck driver.

Let your girlfriend know it gets better - many nurses get off to a rocky start. I didn't go truck driving school, but stuck with nursing. 2 years later work at academic medical centers in the ED - I have had no complaints and am confident in the care I give. Nothing like what I first experience has happened again. We recently got a new nurse manager, we all had an individual meeting with her - I told her, if there is a learning opportunity I am all ears, but I am allergic to catty bullshit - she laughed.

**[Biscuits](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2NP4WZJ-mI)** (later reprinted as ""Cookies"" in North America)   
*by Douglas Adams*

This actually did happen to a real person, and the real person is me. I had gone to catch a train. This was April 1976, in Cambridge, U.K. I was a bit early for the train. I’d gotten the time of the train wrong. I went to get myself a newspaper to do the crossword, and a cup of coffee and a packet of biscuits. I went and sat at a table. I want you to picture the scene. It’s very important that you get this very clear in your mind. Here’s the table, newspaper, cup of coffee, packet of biscuits. There’s a guy sitting opposite me, perfectly ordinary-looking guy wearing a business suit, carrying a briefcase. It didn’t look like he was going to do anything weird. What he did was this: he suddenly leaned across, picked up the packet of biscuits, tore it open, took one out, and ate it.

Now this, I have to say, is the sort of thing the British are very bad at dealing with. There’s nothing in our background, upbringing, or education that teaches you how to deal with someone who in broad daylight has just stolen your biscuits. You know what would happen if this had been South Central Los Angeles. There would have very quickly been gunfire, helicopters coming in, CNN, you know… But in the end, I did what any red-blooded Englishman would do: I ignored it. And I stared at the newspaper, took a sip of coffee, tried to do a clue in the newspaper, couldn’t do anything, and thought, *What am I going to do?*

In the end I thought *Nothing for it, I’ll just have to go for it*, and I tried very hard not to notice the fact that the packet was already mysteriously opened. I took out a biscuit for myself. I thought, *That settled him.* But it hadn’t because a moment or two later he did it again. He took another biscuit. Having not mentioned it the first time, it was somehow even harder to raise the subject the second time around. “Excuse me, I couldn’t help but notice…” I mean, it doesn’t really work.

We went through the whole packet like this. When I say the whole packet, I mean there were only about eight biscuits, but it felt like a lifetime. He took one, I took one, he took one, I took one. Finally, when we got to the end, he stood up and walked away. Well, we exchanged meaningful looks, then he walked away, and I breathed a sigh of relief and sat back.

A moment or two later the train was coming in, so I tossed back the rest of my coffee, stood up, picked up the newspaper, and underneath the newspaper were my biscuits. The thing I like particularly about this story is the sensation that somewhere in England there has been wandering around for the last quarter-century a perfectly ordinary guy who’s had the same exact story, only he doesn’t have the punch line.

The tellers are told to just do exactly what (and only what) the robber tells them to, to get them out as quickly as possible, so nobody gets hurt. 

The trick is not to get caught. Want to know how not to get caught? Rob a bank as far away from home as possible, so several hundred miles. Rob it on a Friday afternoon before a holiday weekend like Christmas, and make sure the bank is close to somewhere a business hands out bonus checks. This will net you around $10k per teller you rob. Wear a nondescript hoody, hat and sunglasses. Be in and out fast, and don't park too close to the bank. Now for getaways some people like banks near highways, but you can just as easily get away by hopping on some random back roads. Do all of this, and never do it again. Most bank robbers are caught because they get away with it once, and keep going back for more; this pisses the FBI off and they will find you and catch you (sometimes because some kids stumble onto something they shouldn't have).

Try watching ripples rebound across the surface of a bucket of water and then identify ""where the wave is."" Well, it's everywhere—but you're more likely to see the part of it that is a peak or a trough.

That's *kind of* what matter is like on a per-particle scale. Matter waves are probability waves where the peaks and troughs translate to the probability the particle will be detected there.

The analogy breaks down in that *if the particle is observed*, the whole wave ""resets"" to simply a sharp peak where the particle was observed. It'd be kind of like as soon as you see a water peak or trough, all the water instantly piles into a spike right where you're looking. Of course, to have the spike spill back down into a ripply surface within the bucket, you have to look away and let it do so.

TRUE,hiffy,,,"You have to distinguish between my explanation of a way of thinking and me *defending* a system of thinking. 

Everything you said could be true but that's not what we're talking about here. We're starting from the principle that you accept that the patriarchy is a real thing.

That said,

&gt;""Patriarchy"" can encompass anything from the government to a male student being the most popular person in school, from the way I've seen it used.

That's because it's used to describe our social system, which encompasses all of the above.

It may in fact not always be applicable, and then it'll be up for debate.

&gt;I don't know what media you're watching, but rape is definitely not glorified in US media and is a topic of great debate in most media. Rapists aren't glorified at all.

They're not *glorified*, but they're sometimes treated deferentially…

&gt;During the course of the delinquent verdict on March 17, 2013, CNN's Poppy Harlow stated that it was ""Incredibly difficult, even for an outsider like me, to watch what happened as these two young men that had such promising futures, star football players, very good students, literally watched as they believed their lives fell apart..."" ([wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steubenville_High_School_rape_case))

We don't have to stop at rape. The Game as played by PUAs is basically a playbook for eroding consent. 

Police officers deciding that rape is ""too much work"" is in of itself a political statement. Have you heard of the slutwalk? It started after a police officer came to a university and told students that one great way to avoid getting raped is to not dress provocatively - putting the onus on victims, blah blah blah, I'm not that qualified to talk about this.


&gt;Again, you claim ""patriarchy"" as if it's definite fact that it exists. You need to prove it, show evidence of it. ""Patriarchy"" in your sense of the word is extremely broad.

All I have to do is demonstrate that men benefit at the cost of women. 

You've admitted that pay gaps are real - even if the methodology changes the exact value. The BI piece you linked to is just an opinion column… okay so, let's sidestep CEOs. What about representation on boards of directors? What about percentages of female government representatives? Do you honestly believe that the lack of female programmers has to do with an innate inability to understand science?

I am not interested in debating these specifics. I am convinced by my own experience - as a guy, talking to other guys when no women are around - and by the evidence that I've seen. I'm trying to explain to you the worldview. And honestly, the patriarchy is a pretty uncontroversial idea. 

Much in the same way that our social system shits on black people.

&gt;Feminism is not solely over the allocation of power, and that's an extremely underwhelming statement about the feminist mindset. You speak as if all feminists have the same ideas about allocation of power.

Well, allocation of power is a pretty broad statement. How is it underwhelming? The goal isn't to cut your dick. And yeah, the whole point of my parent post is *people have different ideas when it comes to this stuff*.

As a final gesture, I'm going replace a few words in your post and you should tell me if it's an outrageous claim:

&gt;""White people"" do not, as a whole, act in a way that discriminates against ""black people"". Just as most ""black people"" do not hate ""white people"" as a whole for one ""white person"" discriminating against them. They blame the individual. ""White people"" do not subconsciously gang up on ""black people"" to be racist, nor do they act as one entity.

You don't need people to be purposefully being a dickhead for them to be perpetuating a set of rules that collectively makes life shitty for a specific group.

For me the key is getting the water to 34 degrees F, for best results.

Whatever you got to do to get there.  Dry ice is popular but not available easily to me.

I tend to do larger runs in a washing machine so I'll pre-chill 5gallons of water in the fridge then add that to the washer with ~2bags of ice and let it sit for 10-15.  Check my temps and start running material with water temp of 34 degrees F. Smaller runs are a lot easier to get to temperature quick because you don't need to have 25 gallons of pre-chilled water on hand.

To support Shaikoten's reasons of financial desperation, and as I wrote in a P.M. to Brosen87, Arnold came from a very wealthy family, that wealth unfortunately dwindled sometime in 1753-55, when Arnold's siblings, Absolom and Mary, died a few years apart - this drained the family's fortune, and Arnold's father unfortunately fell in to a serious alcoholism. This led to Arnold being unable to be privately schooled, and not becoming a merchant, but instead becoming a druggist. Anyway, what this all lead to was him volunteering in the British army during the French/Indian war, and he only served for a mere 2 weeks before returning home. After this, his mother passed away, and his father shortly thereafter - All in all, Arnold wasn't really well off, and I believe this partly contributed to his reasons for defecting later on.

In the Revolution, as Shaikoten said, Arnold had some great achievements - He was lauded as a great General, and everything Shaikoten said about him is more or less correct, a Patriot if you've ever seen one. After suffering a leg wound in combat, he had spent an alarming amount of money, even going so far as to drop over £1,000 ($78,000 in 2013) on a pipe of wine (Source: [Patriots](http://www.amazon.com/Patriots-The-Started-American-Revolution/dp/0671675621), p. 500). This lavish spending led to his fortune decreasing quite rapidly, but he was compensating for his debilitating leg wound that he suffered during the Invasion of Quebec, where General Montgomery was killed, which made him unfit for any active field command, rather putting him behind a desk. Just a couple of months before his treachery, he had been court-martialed, and narrowly avoided conviction, which led to him falling out of favor with Washington himself, who was at this point 'His Excellency, the Commander in Chief', but Washington respected him enough as a soldier to more or less just give him a slap on the wrist. Arnold had been given command of West Point in 1780 and had moved in just across the river with his wife, Peggy. She had also given him a child not long before this, and it seemed as if Arnold was finally happy and content. 

Only earlier in the conflict, Arnold felt he had been seriously wronged. He had been passed over for the promotion of Major General (6 Junior Officers had been promoted ahead of him, Benjamin Lincoln, Thomas Mifflin, Arthur St. Clair, William Alexander, Lord Stirling, and Adam Stephen). Washington took up Arnold's case and wrote, personally, to members of congress to try and sway Arnold's case, and pleaded with them not to make politically motivated promotions, as he felt it'd negatively impact other officers. He actually wrote a letter to Arnold on the 3rd of April, 1777, stating his surprise over not seeing Arnold's name in the list of new Major Generals, he urged him not to take any hasty action as he was sure it was simply a mistake. It wasn't. 

Arnold was again wounded in battle at the Battle of Ridgefield, again in the leg. This, he believed himself, led to the proper promotion of Major General, although he held no seniority over other Major Generals, something he bitterly despised. He submitted his official resignation in July of that same year, but this was soon withdrawn after Washington urged him to do so. Arnold's actions at Saratoga, especially having more than just a disagreement, more a full-fledged shouting match with General Gates, which ultimately led to Gates demanding Arnold leave the battlefield, were critical. However, in the second Battle of Saratoga (October 7th), Arnold returned to field duty despite his commanders wish, and was wounded for a third time in his left leg (Not a lucky streak), and Congress decided to restore his command seniority, but he felt as if it was sympathy, not his actions, that decided this 'restoration'. It left a bad taste in his mouth, and after being contacted in 1780 by John André for possible negotiations of defecting his command to Britain, he was probably given an offer he couldn't refuse. 

Given his prior 'insults' by the Continental Congress, he felt as if he was being mistreated and he felt as if he didn't receive the recognition he deserved. He had certainly been a valuable asset to the American cause thus far, why shouldn't he be treated as such? Taking Arnold's prior loans and funds put in to the Continental Militia and his general financial situation in to account, as well as his marriage to Peggy Shippen, the daughter of a very well-connected Loyalist family, £6,000 was a lot of money, on top of an annual £360 for his Brigadier General commission. I think this, as well as the fame he envisioned himself gaining with the British Army (Something he had desperately hoped would come out of his campaign in Canada), was enough to sway him. 

His own greed and rash decisions and ill temper had led to this decision, and his misinterpretation of situations certainly didn't help either. He had taken insults where none were given, and he had given insults where none were necessary, and he had tried to resign his command twice, and had probably suffered both mentally and physically from the 3 leg wounds and his young wife's apparent mental illness, it would've definitely taken it's toll on his mental health. This would also explain why he apparently left his wife alone with their child at Fort West Point, it could also be explained away by the fact that Washington was coming for a surprise visit, something Arnold most likely wasn't prepared for. 

Unfortunately for Arnold, the British army didn't really work out for him. He was promised a lavish £20,000 for the succession of his plot, but since it had failed, he was paid a 'measly' £6,400, and a pension of £360 yearly. Later, as a British Brigadier General, he had led some 1,500-1,600 men in to Virginia and captured Richmond amongst others, but unfortunately the Southern militia turned out and knocked them back, but the 'Southern Civil War' is an entirely different story for another day, and he left for England in 1781 to consult with Lord George Germain about the current war efforts, later dying in London in 1801. John André, the man who orchestrated Arnold's betrayal, was hanged as a common spy after three Patriots, one dressed in a Redcoat's uniform (Leading André to confide his purpose to him), stopped him on the outskirts of Tarrytown, and confiscated his incriminating documents.

TRUE,averagestalker2nd,ign,averagestalker,"Ok.  The official story is as follows.  In early July, I began to delve deep into the world of drugs.  I wanted to try heroin so I could write about it, I was curious, I was depressed, etc.  So I eventually found this chick through craigslist who had dope, and I went over to her house and tried it.  I quickly moved to the intravenous route. 

Within a couple months my life savings was gone, I was physically addicted to opiates, and my girlfriend at the time was kind of freaking out on me (girls generally don't like guys who slam dope).  In a complicated twist of events, this other girl I knew was very upset and called me while I was at work one night.  She was crying so I said I would come over and talk to her so she could calm the fuck down.  I had quit heroin cold turkey 36 hours previously for my girlfriend.  I had thrown away my syringes and sworn off the shit.

So I get to this girl's apartment and her roommate answers the door.  I can tell immedietly after seeing these girls that they are on some sort of substance, though I don't know what it is.  So I go inside and the girl who called me is just sprawled out on her bed and tries to get me to lay down with her, which i do.  She was pretty intoxicated because she was basically begging me to fuck.  I told her I had a girlfriend and that I couldn't.  Then I asked what the hell she was on.  Turns out she was on Ambien, a prescription for sleep that can provide hallucinations and blackouts if you stay awake on it.  I'm pretty good at sleight of hand, and I jacked 30mg (3x a regular dose) while she wasn't looking.  I quickly devoured it before driving home.  I was pretty desperate to escape the shitty sensation of acute opiate withdrawal.  My girlfriend was accusing me of fucking this girl, which I didn't do.  My dad had gotten me some liquor because he knew what I was trying to do.  I got home and took a shot.  I do not remember anything past this point.

I awoke (restrained) in a hospital bed, dry heaving and caked in blood and left with what little fragmented memories had managed to cling inside my mind.  My parents found me at 7am with an empty fifth of vodka, muttering incoherently.   They tried to get me to go to bed and apparently I refused. Bear in mind that I'm withdrawing from heroin, in an incredibly shitty girl situation, drunk as fuck, and blacked out from a shit ton of ambien.  They then procede to take the empty bottle and throw it away.

I snapped. 22 years of whatever the fuck has been going on in my head came out that night.  I went straight king kong on my house. I started smashing shit, punching holes, stabbing knives into the wall, just destroying as much shit as possible.  My parents locked themselves in their room and I apparently went into the garage and got an axe and used the  BLUNT end of it to smash the door down.  Right when I was about to get through the doorway, shadowy figures pointed flashlights at me and said ""freeze"".  I remember this as if it were a photograph.  Luckily I didn't charge the police, but instead ran into the guest bedroom and hurled myself out a 3rd story window... where I fell 22 feet onto concrete and shattered my left arm and wrist.  I picked up 8 charges (2 felonies have since been dropped) and permanently lost some function and sensation in my left arm.

I obviously relapsed onto dope because the pain was unimaginable and the percocet they were giving me wasn't doing shit because of my tolerance.  So the cycle started again and I basically said fuck it and went to rehab... I could write an entire god damn book on what happened next but basically i fucked this girl with big tits and a nice ass and did yoga and ate like shit and now I'm clean.  Chea.

Atheism is a lack of a belief in a deity. Full stop. There is nothing else to it. It's a *lack of belief* - it's not a belief in and of itself.

There are no a-leprechaunists. No one goes around saying, ""I don't belief in little Irish faeries with pots of gold. 

There are no a-golfers. No one walks around saying, ""You what what I'd like to do on this fine Sunday afternoon? I want to not walk around a big field with a bunch of small white balls and big sticks, and not hit said balls into scattered holes in the field. That's what I definitely don't want to do.""

&gt; instead believes that all the answers of the universe can be figured out through science (which funny enough is completely compatible with many Christian denominations including Catholicism)

Really? Let me recall something from a typical Mass for you:

&gt; ""Let us proclaim the mystery of faith!""

*Not* science.

Faith isn't compatible with science. It's just not. Faith tells you to believe in something because you are told to believe it. It doesn't matter if it's not really ""true"", you have to believe. So many times I did get in trouble in Catholic school, or in Confirmation prep classes what I asked questions... None of my teachers wanted to answer them, because they couldn't. ""You're too smart for your own good"" was something I hear many times - that doesn't smack of support for the basic tenant of science - QUESTION EVERYTHING! 

Religion is the reformulation of past mythologies: guesses, assumptions about universe, pronouncements made in search of personal power, all mingled with shreds of enlightenment. Always there is the unspoken commandment: Thou shalt not question! Millions have died because of it - questioning the Church in anything was at one time a death sentence, and can be that even now where the Church has a grip on political power.

&gt; My point is, it IS a belief that you cannot prove, because you don't have all the answers either.

I don't have to prove there are no gods. Every god humans have had has been put by the wayside as we've grown up as a species. None have been shown to exist. It's up to you to demonstrate why your god is different. It's a fallacy that you need to know ""all the answers"" first.

Fruit and whole grains in moderation (I have a cup of oatmeal everyday though). And absolutely no refined sugar and trash food or beverages other than water and tea. Also bread is out, although whole wheat bread is OK in moderation.

* Exercise: I started c25k and now I'm running 10k 3 times a week no problemo. I started lifting as well, I particularly do a mixed routine of bodyweight exercises and traditional lifting. Currently I can see the faintest signs of my 6 pack, the top two are visible now, my shoulders are wide, my traps are somewhat defined and my arms are not that big, but veins are visible.

* Progress measurements: I weighted myself daily and keep a log of it, I measured my body fat as well. Once a week I measured my waist, hips, chest, wrist and biceps and keep a record as well, every two weeks I took a picture of myself front and sides. Measuring often let you make adaptions and asses how effective your current habits are, I experimented with keto but found out that it didn't make me lose weight as fast as I was losing and that I was losing more lean mass than fat so I dropped it in time. You can experiment with different ideas and see how it goes with you.

* Positive attitude: when you feel down or that you don't see any progress, remember this is a long journey, not a race, look at your log, see how you were a month ago or two.

Thousands of years of patriarchy can perpetuate a shitton of detrimental romantic stereotypes. I'm not saying there's anything wrong with this point inherently; the problem is when you *assume* this is the ideal and base your entire belief system about relationships on this idea.

3. What is wrong with casual sex? If you don't want to have casual sex because you are afraid you won't pair-bond, then don't have casual sex. If you don't want to pursue a long term relationship with someone who has casual sex because you're worried they won't pair-bond with you for the long term, then *don't do it.* If you want to have casual sex, then do it with people who also want to have casual sex. I fail to see how an inability to make this decision is the fault of ""third wave feminism.""

How does third wave feminism cause detriment to your life? For a long-term, pair bonding relationship, you only need *one* partner. Just because you haven't been successful at creating that relationship doesn't mean *it's the fault of feminism.* It's just *hard.* Stop letting people convince you into blaming others or women or pseudoscientific ""evolutionary biology"" bullshit for your problems. The red pill is indoctrinating you to *blame* other things for your individual problems and accountability and leading you down a really messed up path. 

Finding a viable or ideal partner is *not easy*. Dating and finding someone that complements you and supports you and loves you for who you are is *not easy.* Building a lasting, lifelong relationship with someone is *not easy*. It's hard work. **Stop looking for shortcuts and excuses.** Stop letting others convince you into blaming women and feminists for your individual problems; problems that a lot of people have.

It's **okay** to have these love life problems; almost everyone does, but going to theredpill is similar to, and arguably worse than taking dangerous, unapproved drugs for weight problems or joining a extreme religion. Theredpill can help improve your confidence in the way that these two other examples can improve confidence or have peripheral benefits. But they are still deeply, deeply wrong. You *can* build intrinsic, lasting self-confidence without these things.

When you have to say, ""well I don't buy into the 'rape is okay' part"", then you should probably take a step back and say, ""what the hell am I really buying into here, fuck this fucking insanity."" Which you are doing; which is good.

&gt;I am, however, a 23-year-old virgin

This is a key point. It's okay to be a virgin. You are probably feeling intense pressure on this point though; many people do. That's okay. However, realize that this fact has *skewed* your view. You are *vulnerable* because of it, so subs like theredpill are trying to sell you a attractive/easy-sounding solution to your **vulnerability**. Just like weight loss scams and Scientology and other extreme religion. **Don't buy into it.**

Thank you again for making the effort to hear why theredpill is frankly, a horrifying place. Let me know if you need any clarification, explanation, or discussion on any of these points and I will be happy to discuss them with you.

So he’s seeking compensation in the form of cash.     
Bailey thinks he’s entitled to some monetary gain

Eminem says Bailey used to throw him around    
Beat him up in the john, shoved his face in the ground.

TRUE,PlushieChomby,,,"Wow. I typed 2,000 characters out and accidentally refreshed the page. I might cry a little. 

Round two, here goes: I'll bite, and try my best to explain things from my point of view, though please feel free to ask questions if I don't provide total clarity on what I believe on the subject. I also apologize in advance for the length. :) 

First of all, I'm a ""Christian"", though I fall pretty far from the average tree. I despise what the term has come to mean, and view it as a far cry from the ""little Christ"" meaning that Romans used to mock the early church. Organized religion has done and continues to do a great deal of harm (and a great deal of quieter, less publicized good, I'll admit) to the world around us, which is pretty much the opposite of what I believe Jesus intended. Rather I follow in my father's footsteps, believing religion to be deeply personal and devoting myself to attempting to walk the walk rather than spewing the talk at others, only talking about my faith when I'm asked, like in this instance. 

That said, I'm probably not your target audience, since churches tend to make me nauseous and sad, but since I fall into the religious category I thought I'd answer anyway. 

Honestly, it sounds like your Christian friend believes in a tiny little powerless god by that statement, and I completely disagree with the sentiment that God couldn't have accounted for *anything*, much less how much we multiplied. Then again, I believe God exists outside of the space-time continuum, and it would therefore be impossible for It to *not* know exactly what would take place, beginning, end and everything in between. 

Galatians 5:13-14 is one of many passages I've always liked, stating, ""You, my brothers and sisters, were called to be free. But do not use your freedom to indulge the flesh; rather, serve one another humbly in love. For the entire law is fulfilled in keeping this one command: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.'"" Mark 12:31 even says, ""The second is this: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' There is no commandment greater than these."" 

Needless to say, I spend a lot of time examining my actions in light of these verses, and others along the same lines. Am I behaving lovingly toward others, especially when they upset me? Am I patient when tried? Am I kind even in the face of ugliness? Do I feel envy or pride? Did I boast or dishonor anyone? Were my actions self-seeking? Have I been easily angered recently? Am I holding any grudges? Am I seeking out good and uplifting where I can, or am I commiserating and celebrating bad things happening to people who seem to deserve it? Am I embodying the values in both mind and action that I value so much? 

As someone who tries her hardest to do as little harm to and as much good for the world around me and the people inhabiting it that I can, it's simpler than you might think to boil down why I don't want to bear children. Yes, at points in history, human survival has been a concern. We are undeniably not at that point now. Thanks to modern science and technology, we no longer have to fear that one family will pump out twelve kids and only two will survive to adulthood. I'm sure it still happens, but it's nowhere near the scale it was before soaps and medicines and treatments that actually work came along. Hell, now we're at the point where your body doesn't even have to do the work to survive it once had to do. We have machines that will push blood through your veins for you, breathe for you, clean your kidneys, even flip you so your body doesn't suffer severe atrophy... the list goes on, while both expected lifespans and populations increase drastically. 

Meanwhile, mother earth has trouble supporting all her inhabitants. In just over 200 years, we went from 1 billion people to 7 billion people worldwide. That is fucking insanity. Earth has kept the majority of us alive so far, but the scars of our rapid multiplication are more visible with every generation. Reason One for my not wanting to have children would be that I'd like to not contribute to that scarring. Multitudes of other people will breed and I'm only a drop in the ocean, but it's one small, loving act to which I can readily commit myself: not hurting others by not contributing to the problem. Loving the people around me by denying my ability to produce other mouths to feed and feet to trample and little carbon dioxide producing machines. 

The second reason is this, my favourite verse in the entire compilation of books the councils of Laodicea and Carthage decided comprised the New Testament canon: James 1:27, ""Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress, and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world."" That's it: two things that both fall easily under the domain of practicing Real Love: taking care of those who have trouble taking care of themselves, and not losing yourself in a world ready to dilute you. 

I've done just about every kind of volunteer work possible. From suicide hotlines to pregnancy counseling to post-abortion counseling to multiple positions for battered women and children's shelters, from training dogs and cleaning their cages at the local shelters to AIDS walks and office work to visiting the elderly and doing their shopping/bills/taking walks with them, from doing music therapy and throwing parties and playing with children at the local mental hospital, to being a Big Sister and volunteering legal services and building houses with Habitat for Humanity. More than I've listed here, more than you'd care to read, and why? Because it's taking care of people. It's showing Love in a real way. The positions require exercises of patience, kindness, hope, joy... They exercise the things in me which I value and wish to continually grow, and keep me aligned with a very narrow, truly simple definition of the only ""pure and faultless"" religion. Helping the elderly and those in distress? Check. Taking care of orphans or those who might as well be? Check. Teaching adults to read, recording books for the blind... these all fall into the same category as the first two in my mind. I can make an impact, albeit small, on the world around me, by not having children - which allows me an incredible amount of time to make very real differences in the lives of those I can help. It feels more real, more honest, more loving, to take the time I'd otherwise spend training one or two spawn on how to be good people and instead devote it to enriching or positively altering the lives of people already *here*, rather than imaginary future children. 

I could be wrong, but I feel very strongly I'm on exactly the path which was meant to be most ideal for me, the path which spills the most Love into the world around me. Not having kids makes that possible in so many ways having them would limit for me. 

I guess I could have just summarized by saying, I personally think God's quite content, possibly sad about the sheer number of people that already exist on this planet, and is more than fine with my not contributing to the mass of people already here. 

Also, I'm 30, and while I've known for a long time that I don't want to bear children of my own, I can't say beyond a shadow of a doubt that in five or ten years I won't be in a place where adopting an older kid, not a baby or toddler, seems like exactly the right thing to do. I don't like small children, but I'm both a good disciplinarian and had an exemplary standard set by my parents on how to Love, which I've expanded upon greatly in my own studies and behavioral patterns. To be blunt, with over 100,000 children in America and an estimated ***153 million*** orphans worldwide needing adoption, it's incredibly difficult for me to understand how anyone who claims to follow Jesus Christ and wants children could even think of procreating themselves while the world is hurting so badly. I get it, lots of people want their own mini-me, they want to be pregnant or know they can breed, they want a kid from day one with the theory it'll somehow be special or different because they share DNA with it, but it kind of blows my mind how so many people can just skip right over something that seems so obvious to me. 

My aunt, one of only two who didn't pop out kids, was both a Christian and a social worker for decades. Although she was single, she adopted five children ranging from age 12-17 who desperately needed a stable home. I've seen the effects of how her being their rock, even in incredibly difficult circumstances, helped to shape them in amazing ways that I'm not sure would have happened had she not stepped up. She helped them with everything from PTSD to teenage pregnancy to getting them into college and helping them achieve their dreams. When she passed away a few years ago, I got to see all of them again (a few states over) and hear some incredible stories about how she'd permanently touched their lives and shaped their futures. I'd like to think someday I'll grow into being the kind of person my aunt was, but if I'm never in a place where adopting older orphans is viable, I'll still have plenty of time to help in non-parenting, positive influence, distress-relieving ways.... which, when you get right down to it, is what I believe God is asking of me. 

Wow, and I almost hit character limit. Sorry again for the length and I know I rambled a bit there, but it can be difficult knowing how to express things I generally keep to myself. I hope that provided a bit of insight into just this one religious person's view though. As Walt Whitman said, ""Do I contradict myself? Very well then, I contradict myself. (I am large, I contain multitudes.)"" But still, I'd be happy to answer questions if I was unclear or didn't make sense in any way. :)

There are different aspects that go into antenna design. I'm going to just talk about whip wire antennas. The antenna length is a large factor, as is the capacitance and inductance. Your speaker is a coil of wire and a magnet, so it has a high inductance. You are a capacitor in this circuit. The Aux cable is a length of cable so that goes with the length of wire in the coil of the speaker. These 3 values all contribute to how well the antenna works.

In this circuit the length of wire will pick up radio waves. The energy will then oscillate between the inductive part, and the capacitive part. Part of this energy will be used to drive the speaker. The more energy that is bouncing between the inductive and capacitive part, the easier it is for the speaker to take more energy.

It could even just be the Aux cable and you being a length of conductive material that are feeding into a transistor (think simple amplifier) that is powered on.

As is my tradition for all first time play sessions of a game: I had my tuna ready. I knew this was going to be a great experience so I didn't settle for princes, I went straight to John West and gave this shit the respect it deserved. 

Or so I thought.

After scavenging for a while, find wrenches and screw drivers as my character screamed of hunger pains, I came across some nourishing supplies. Hovering over a tin of tuna only to see the description of sardines pop up I felt a single tear roll down my cheek, as I wiped it away I realised I had just cried blood.

""Perhaps they haven't modelled the sardine tin yet and are just using the tuna one as a placeholder"" I innocently thought to myself, like a god damn fool. 

Within the hour I had witnessed the horror that was Dean Hall's interpretation of the one true fish of the tin. Along with the abomination known as the Sardine, the main market competitor within the maritime lunch sector of the almighty tinned tuna. 

Before long I found myself on the street outside my house, force feeding people disinfectant and shooting at every person that had come into my view. For a number of hours I continued in this manner before running out of steam, ammo and various lethal things that I could force down my neighbour's mouths.

Only then did I realise what had happened: True immersion. 

Though it was hard to accept this crime... this crime against fish packaging... I came to realise that it was necessary to trigger my deep psychosis that would allow for the DayZ experience to spill over into my real life away from the computer.

TRUE,JamesDK,,15Δ,"There's one giant reason why you should stay far, far away from TRP:

If it was going to work for you, it would have worked already. 

First, I don't think that you're really looking for what TRP is offering. At their heart, TRP and the 'seduction' community are about one thing: getting laid. You're a 23-year-old virgin, which means that you made it through high school and (probably) college, the horniest times in peoples' lives, without having sex. I don't think that casual, meaningless sex is what you're looking for. 

The thing is: TRP **will not** help you get a girlfriend, and I think that what you really want is a girlfriend. If all you wanted was a casual fuck, there was girl in your group of friends who you just *knew* was into you. Maybe she wasn't quite pretty enough, maybe she was kind of irritating or kind of dumb. Who cares? She was ''DTF'' and you knew it and you turned it down. 

The thing is: TRP doesn't teach you how to attract *women*: it teaches you how to attract a *very specific* type of woman. Believe it or not: women are people and, for the most part, people don't like being demeaned, insulted, intimidated, or disrespected. There is an extremely tiny subset of women who think as little of men as TRP thinks of women, and for those women: the only way to distinguish yourself from the 'herd' is to stand up to her bullshit instead of walking away. 

But ask yourself: do you really want anything to do with women like that: women who assume every male is a 'beta' milktoast loser until he proves otherwise by acting out? Are you ever going to have fun with a woman like that? Her default position is (and will always be) that you're not good enough. 

Imagine the exact opposite: that these girls believed all men to be violent rapists instead of losers. Instead of pursuing them aggressively, you needed to be ultra-careful and cautious in what you said and did. How long would you keep it up before you got sick of it? The *only* reason shit like TRP gets any traction is that it plays into gender essentialist notions that tell us that men are *always* aggressive and women are *always* passive. I think you know that's simply not true.  

This is the fundamental irony of TRP and all of the 'seduction' community': by putting up with girls that need to be 'neg'ed' and pursued aggressively to form attraction **you're still playing their game**. TRPers and PUAs deride 'beta' males who bend over backwards for women, but they're doing *exactly the same thing*. They're spending endless hours learning routines and tactics that have roughly the same success rate as **being a decent fucking person**. 

Women are wise to this shit. *The Game* came out, like, 10 years ago. My wife knows all about 'negging' and 'demonstrating value' and 'closing' from Jezebel and Feministing. When you act indifferent or 'subtly' put a girl down these days: she knows **exactly** what you're doing, and (unless she's the kind of girl that responds to that type of thing) she's just immediately ruled you out. Worse, she's going back to her table of girlfriends and they're **laughing their asses off** at your cheesy shit. ""Oh my God: he actually tried to 'neg' me!""

All of this is to say: TRP shit won't help you get a girlfriend, only works on a *very*, *very* small number of girls, is still (ultimately) doing everything you're doing because you think it's what women want, and (when it fails as it mostly does) makes you look sadder and more pathetic than you would have if you had just acted like a decent person.

TRUE,Jamesev93,,,"She was so perfect. It had been atleast 6 months since they had met, but in those 6 months what a transformation she had undertaken. She shed 40 kilos; none from her breasts; the perfect hour glass figure.

 She claimed she wasn't doing anything different, since she came back from her holiday in central Africa. The number of attentive friends that surrounded her signaled that something must have changed. No one knew what it was though.

The coroner couldn't work it out either. 

She was the image of health; beauty even. Every inch of her supple skin, perfection personified. It was a shock to all when her boyfriend woke to find her without a heart beat, though she was more radiant than the day previous.

The death was treated as suspicious. After all, a beautiful girl who'd made an amazing transformation, from anonymity to near stardom, in a matter of months; someone had to be envious. Men would walk from their wives, enchanted in the streets. The pied piper would have turned green with envy at the sight. 

The coroner checked the skin. Supple and soft to the touch, it was unblemished - despite the families assertion of scars and stretch marks. The coroner checked the hair for toxins. Nothing but the sweet smell of strawberry shampoo. The coroner then checked the blood. The red blood cell count, the white blood cell count - not just within toleration - it was scientifically perfect. He double checked, and triple checked. Truth be told he was sure of his work, but he could not bare the thought of having to ruin this masterpiece with a scalpel. Alas, the decision was made. The organs were revealed; Perfect in size and colour. The body was unparallelled. It was as though there was nothing left to improve.

Back at the funeral, open coffin of course,  the crowd had turned out in droves. There were men swooning at the coffin side, women both enchanted and envious of a corpse's ability; perfect as it may be; to take their mans' attention from them.

She coughed.

 Silence fell upon the room. She coughed and spluttered and they came running. All crowded beside the coffin. The eager want for this snow white to wake from this slumber was palpable. Then she opened her eyes. Her eyes wide with fear and pain. Her mouth, agape, let out a great puff of orange mist. It covered the beautiful black gowns of the women, the solemn silk suites of the men, even the garb of the attending priest. With that last breath of life, she was gone. Her aura had faded.

The rest of the funeral went smoothly, relatively speaking of course. But when he went home, Jim felt the wanton need to sleep, and sleep deeply he did. The next day was uneventful, and the day after, and even the days preceding it. 

Until one day he felt the eyes upon him.

Surely enough, he would find himself catching the glaces of women at work. Huddled around the water cooler they whispered and murmured, stealing as much of a glance Jim's way as they could. Walking the street, women would stumble in his presence. Usually an unknown, at clubs he was approached endlessly by loose women ready to give their lives for him.

He looked himself in the mirror. He looked the same as he always had. He picked up a picture from the funeral. He, in his faded black suit, stood gaunt over the other attendees. His arms were too long and his hair was messy. But his face. His face was, different? He held it beside his face in the mirror. His nose wasn't crooked anymore. His eyes, not so sunken. His jaw, chiseled. He took of his shirt. His muscles, defined, made the perfect guiding lines down... He extended his waste band, well, there was definitely a big improvement to say the least.

The next day, he walked like a new man. Astute in his conviction and self esteem. His tongue, once quivering at the though of talking to Ashley, was made of silver this day, and from this day on. It was Ashley who found herself at a loss for words. Jim's interest in her was something she had dreamed of, if only recently. She had not noticed him before in the office, maybe, through the barrage of unwarranted sexual advances, he had avoided her gaze. Yet, here she was, quaking, giddy as a school girl. She was at a loss for words. She could scarcely remember how the conversation went. She knew she had to be ready at 6pm, dressed to the nines, but apart from that, Jim's eyes, his beautiful blue eyes, the conversation was a sweaty palmed blur. She was under his spell, and she knew it. 

The next 5 and a half months were the best of Jim's life. His career had jumped, due in part to his confidence, but in greater part due to his ability to stand out in the crowd. Ashely was wonderful, an eager lover with the fervor of youth, attentive and dependable. Although their time together had been brief, he knew it in his heart: this is how his life would continue. 

He had purchased the ring. Held it in his pocket for the last two days. The next day he would wake early, make breakfast and slip the ring on one of the roses he had bought, ready for Ashely to wake to. 

However, he did not wake. Ashely found him, without a pulse. She screamed bloody murder. The knife was further twisted when she found the ring. She was inconsolable in her grief.

At the funeral the crowds turned out in droves. Work colleagues, friends and acquaintances he'd met along this last 6 month journey all felt a deep sorrow for Jim's passing. The coroner could not explain it, nor could he explain the deaths of the 150 other random men and women in their sleep that same night. Their only apparent connection was their beauty. As though they were angels that were returning to heaven. Jim looked as such. A body of a god, the face of perfection and a heart of gold. But he had passed, and the ceremony had began. The coffin was open, of course, for all to marvel in his beauty. Then, Jim coughed, and spluttered, and all crowded around with bated breath, eager for Jim to rise.

 He did, with pain in his eyes, his mouth agape...

I was probably like 10 years old at the time. So this bitch girl was a friend of my bitch cousin's, and I was stuck at her house for the day. I took a dead leaf and a dandelion (as pictured) and told her to hide the leaf somewhere on her, and I would use the dandelion as a magic wand to find it. So I'm pretending to scan her body looking for it when I make my way up to her mouth. I stop at her mouth and I'm like, ""Open your mouth"". She cocked this smug-ass bitch smirk that was made 100 times better when I jammed the dandelion down her cunt gullet. She's crying, my cousin's crying, I'm getting yelled at by grown ups, and the whole time I was just soooo satisified.

tl;dr bitch swallowed my seed

edit for people calling me the bully: you weren't there. This girl made fun of me and gave me shit for years, and I was a quiet weird kid that just had to take it because she was a girl and I was forced to hang out with her while I was babysat. This was one of the *rare* times in my childhood where I finally stood up against someone who was bullying me, and she was fucking fine guys. I didn't get in any trouble because my parents were proud that I stood up to her, and knew how she always gave me problems. Yes, I had a girl bully. Paint that picture in your head before you go calling *me* the dick, because that is fucking offensive.",0,1388713723,,0,1388758384,1,cefxhvr,t3_1u9i0x,t1_cefxhvr,t3_1u9i0x,1431774605,1983,FALSE,funny,t5_2qh33,1983
TRUE,Shirrapikachu,,,"Smoking weed on a daily basis -- now see, that's not the problem. It's the ones that smoke it everyday and they make weed a part of their identity. Totally acceptable to base your lifestyle and identity on pot, but if you switch that out for any other drug, suddenly it isn't. Weed is widely acceptable as a can-do-no-wrong sort of panacea, and whenever somebody has an adverse reaction to it people make up excuses like ""oh maybe it's just the strain"" ""you just smoked too much"" """"it was probably laced"" weed isn't the perfect drug for everybody. And chronic use can certainly be detrimental to your health, significantly less compared to other things, but still there. 

Also, some of you stoners need to quit acting so enlightened and ""holier than thou."" You raise a fuss when I look down on you for daily smoking, but you turn around and preach about how drinking is ""soooo bad for you"" because we all drink on the weekends. You have your drug of choice, and so do I. 

Don't try and pretend you can't get addicted to weed, either. It might not manifest physically but if you're smoking everyday and altering the reward system in your brain, you bet you're gonna be irritable and have cravings if you all of a sudden stop. 


EDIT:: alright, this apparently has been taken as a personal insult to all smokers everywhere and that I'm an anti-weed piece a shit. 
this was meant to specifically target the group of stoners that base their sense of self and how they live their life on a drug, and take it to the extreme. I know plenty of daily smokers that treat it like a drug, and smoke it to relax. They don't rant about how it should be legal because it *does so much good* and yada yada. They can go without weed, they don't need it. And that's perfectly alright. 

Personally, I smoke pretty regularly myself. I have a friend I encourage to smoke daily because it helps her OCD. but I have personally seen the negative side of it, when the drug *use* turns into *abuse*. 

if you'd rather stay home and get stoned, that might be a problem. If it's taking a big chunk out of your paycheck, that might also be a problem. If you can't imagine being sober past the one week mark... you might *have a problem.* 

It's the stoners that are vehemently pro-weed that refuse to acknowledge their beloved pot *could* have negative concequences and addiction potentional, that I have an issue with. 
Again: *I am not anti pot so quit taking this as a personal attack on you or the drug itself.* 

Edit2: I'm going to make an analogy here -- You see, I'm a furry. When people think of furries they jump to the ""all furries are sick and into bestiality/yiff."" I dont take it as a personal insult just because somebody doesn't like the very specific type of furry. I dont like yiff or anything. I just happen to enjoy foxes (doubtful I'd want to actually be one, however) and enjoy anthropomorphic artwork (non-sexual.) When I hear or read somebody ranting about furries and how sick they are, rather then become offended, I try and clear up some misconceptions. Also with furries there are varying degrees of how much their identities and life are balanced with their personal interests. Some keep it private while others make furry things a part of everyday life.

So, I may have worded my original comment poorly and generalized pot smokers, but I'm specifically talking about one kind of smoker -- dont take it personally. That was probably a really shitty analogy but I tried to make it personal and relate to me.

EDIT3: I'm really happy that there's a large number of stoners here that are level headed and self-aware enough to see the negative!  Go ahead and smoke, but don't pretend there's no negatives. I'm also not denying that there can be positives to daily smoking, there definitely can! weed is also fantastic for medicinal things, I'd recommend pot over some pharmaceutical drugs any day.

The black one's flown, but flies no more.

The tapping's ceased upon my door.

Feathers strewn like bodies lie,

As leaves are thrown by brooding skies.

And I am empty.

*

Seeds are left, untouched, alone,

While gloved hands take what fate has sown.

Silence roars as sound is silenced,

The quiet rages with quiet violence.

And I am empty.

*

Sprays and chemicals to kill

The memories that live here still.

To scrub away and burn what's left;

Leaving aching bars bereft.

And I am empty.

*

Beak-chipped paint and soiled floors,

Ever to happen, nevermore.

O’ friend and rival, captive of mine,

To loneliness I am consigned.

And I am empty.

*

The jailor paced and sat and wailed,

Through vicious tides of sorrow sailed.

Till one morn’ their joy did come:

Melting colours, feathers of sun.

And I am angry.

*

Forced inside, the inmate weeps.

To my cold floors, its tears seep.

Broken wings and broken mind,

Unwelcome prison, the victim finds.

And I am sorry.

Silence is silenced as sound is returned,

Feelings of coldness and hatred are spurned.

Emptiness gone, loneliness fled,

Desire to care takes over instead.

TRUE,proffrobot,,,"So there are a couple of issues in cryptography, and a couple of ways that quantum computers can help. First though, we need to know a bit about encryption, and in particular, about one time pads. The idea is this. Say you could secretly talk to a friend of yours, and agree on a big random string of letters, say 100 letters long, this is going to be your key. Then you go your separate ways. 

Later you want to send your friend a message no one else can read. Your message is going to be another 100 letter sequence. So you encrypt your message in the following way. To each letter you associate the letter in the same position from your key. Then you add them together in some way, say a+a = b and a+b = c, and b+b = d, z+a = a, something like that, it doesn't really matter what it is so long as it uses all the letters. Then you can send off your string, and no one can decrypt it unless they have the key and they can do what you did. 

The reason no one can decrypt it is because for every message you want to send, there is some key that will turn it into every other possible string of letters. And since they don't know your key, they can't know what message you started with, in fact, as far as anyone else is concerned, there is an equal probability that you sent any message. That means that given the eavesdropper doesn't know your key, they can't tell if your message says 'GOFORWARDS' or 'GOBACKWARD' and both are equally likely. This kind of encryption is called a one time pad and it is perfectly secure, it can't be broken by anything. The problem is agreeing on the key in the first place. You can't reuse the keys, if you do that then things aren't perfectly secure anymore. For example, say your key was just two letters long. Then in the above GOFORWARDS and GOBACKWARD we'd be able to tell which was which, the first two encrypted letters, the GO, would be the same for both messages. But then, FORWARD has an O in it, which would be encrypted the same as the O in GO, so we would know that if the second and fourth letter are the same, we definitely don't have the message GOBACKWARD. Going on like that we see how we can deduce some information about the message if our key isn't the same length as it. 

So, this encryption, so long as you do it properly, cannot be beaten, because you don't know what the message was to begin with. Even with a quantum computer, because they're not magic, and they can't know what the original message was, or know what the key was any more than you can. 

There are two things you can do with Quantum Computers that you can't do with regular ones that help with cryptography. The first, is that there are algorithms that rely on being able to have superposition states that let you break some types of encryption much quicker than regular computers do. Most encryption used in the real world, because we can't all be sharing secret numbers all the time, uses encryption which is secure, but not absolutely perfect. This kind of encryption takes a long time to break, but breaking it is methodical. The reason it's secure is because it takes such a long time to break. These are things like RSA encryption, and these are what the article is saying the NSA is building a quantum computer to break.

The other thing you can do with a quantum system is something called quantum key distribution. That's a way of sharing a secret number over a distance, and guaranteeing that no one else can know the number. Again, this works more or less by quantum superposition. If some eavesdropper looks at the messages you're sending, then they destroy them, and you can just discard them. Quantum Key Distribution would be great, because it would theoretically be unbreakable. Since I could share a secret number with you, and as long as neither of us told anyone we could use the one time pads to share messages with each other, and no one could ever read it. 

So in a nutshell. Quantum Computers help in two ways. They can break lots of cryptosystems that are secure by virtue of taking a very long time to break. They do this using some quantum mechanical effects to speed up the algorithms needed to break those systems. This is what the NSA is trying to build. They can also help by quantum key distribution, which allows us to share secret keys that we can be certain (by the laws of physics) that no one was able to directly intercept. We can then use those keys to encrypt things. ",0,1388720275,,0,FALSE,1,ceg0ib5,t3_1u9xt6,t1_ceg0ib5,t3_1u9xt6,1431776022,7,FALSE,AskPhysics,t5_2sumo,7

As a morbidly obese person, I consider obesity to be a personal failing in the same way that alcoholism or gambling addiction are personal failings.  I hate myself for it.  I want to change.  It's not easy.

Unless they're really bad, a gambling addict or alcoholic can still be a productive member of society.  Same with an obese person (so long as it doesn't require physical labor), unless they're the kind you see on TV who can't get out of bed due to their weight.

However, alcoholism and gambling addiction (to a certain extent) don't have the obvious, outward-facing physical symptom (obesity) that food abuse does.  My father was an alcoholic for 25 years, but nobody at his work knew about it and it didn't affect his performance at his desk job.  Obesity is a very obvious, outward-facing symptom.

I don't expect to be catered to for my personal failing, but I also don't think it's appropriate to completely ostracize the obese, either.  If you're my doctor, fine, criticize me.  If you're family/friend and you're worried about me, fine, tell me.

If I barely know you and my obesity isn't personally affecting you, then yes, I expect you to kindly shut up.  If you found out I was struggling with gambling, you wouldn't make jokes about blackjack to my face or install a slot machine in the office.

There's a difference between catering to/accepting obesity, and common courtesy towards someone who is struggling to overcome their personal failings.

TRUE,Cenodoxus,points ,11∆,"This isn't a subject that I typically write much about on Reddit, but I'll make an exception because what you wrote genuinely scared me.

**For reference, I'm a woman.** I can't speak for all women -- no one can -- but I will try to shed some light on this from the perspective of any random girl you might have run into at any New Year's Eve party on the planet.

**Context in human relationships is an inescapable element of what's actually going on:** Say you're at an office, and the 60-year old part-time cleaning woman is flirting with the 21-year old son of the boss who's just started an internship there. Probably harmless fun. Now let's change things up and say the 60-year old female boss who's recently divorced is flirting with the new 21-year old male intern who really needs this job and isn't related to anyone there. That's not harmless.

When people talk about trying to change the culture at a ""toxic"" workplace or about ""rape culture"" or anything else, this is usually what they mean. They're trying to make people aware of the social context of their actions and more respectful of what's going through the mind of a person who isn't approaching a relationship from the position of power. *Homo sapiens sapiens* is a primate with an instinctive sense of social dynamics. As with any other primate, you're acutely conscious of power when you're the one who doesn't have it. Civilization and, for that matter, democracy is about redressing this to some extent so that power is more evenly distributed in society (and Reddit is very loud on the subject of when it isn't). Feminism is about making sure that power is less sex-specific than it's historically been.

**So how does this relate to you and the girl at the party?** Let's come down from all this talk of primates and power and high-sounding ideas and examine what happened at this party. You were talking to a ""cute and intelligent"" girl. She ""strongly hinted she didn't want to do anything physical with a guy."" Not long afterwards, you pulled her onto your lap without asking her permission: ""She didn't resist and seemed okay with it, even after I let go."" So you were also holding onto her for a time.

This is where alarm bells went off for me. I don't blame you for not stopping to think that maybe she *wasn't* okay with it just because she didn't say something, or take the more direct route of belting you across the chops, and you're 23 years old and new to this whole game and getting dating advice from the one of the worst places on the planet to get it, but ...

Here it comes ...

*The dreaded context*.

**You are bigger, stronger, and faster than she is. You might forget this or not think about it most of the time, but women are ALWAYS aware of it.** This is the first truth and underlying principle of all male/female interaction. When you know each other, and more particularly when you're in a relationship, it's fun or helpful or even a source of amusement. When you don't know each other, it's a potential danger. Women usually learn this fear in their early teens or when they start developing. I learned it at 14 and that's pretty standard.

Now, there isn't a rapist lurking around every corner. Most streets are safe even in the dark. Most people are good and trustworthy. But not all of them are, and sooner or later the law of averages kicks in and then you find yourself in a situation where vigilance is the only thing standing between you and the dark, scary part of being smaller and slower and weaker than men. If you're lucky or simply observant, life tossed you little signs that say, ""This is dangerous, get out get out GET OUT,"" or ""This person is someone I should not be around."" 

One of the clearest you can get is when you say ""No"" and the guy doesn't care.

If a guy pulls me into his lap even after I've ""strongly hinted"" that I don't want to be touched (and really, is that so much to ask? Is the bar that low?), my immediate reaction is probably going to be surprise and a bit of panic over the incredibly awkward situation I'm now in. Then my brain is finally going to calm down enough to run through the following options:

 - **Option #1: I can try to remove myself:** What if he pulls me back? He's stronger than I am and can do this easily. What if he interprets it as playing hard to get and we get into what he sees a playful wrestling match?
 - **Option #2: I quietly say I don't appreciate being touched:** Well, the night's shot now. You'll trash me to your friends in order to salvage your ego and probably say that I was leading you on. How far is this gossip going to spread and who's going to believe it? I don't know. Great, I get to worry about that now.
 - **Option #3: I can cause a scene:** Now I look like a bitch to everyone who wasn't paying attention and get to feel bad about that. Your friends think all you wanted was to talk to a girl and the crazy bitch called you a creeper. And then I seethe inside; I didn't want to be fucking touched at all and said it!
 - **Option #4: Or I can just sit there and deal with it:** Many, if not most, young women will select this option, and I have to admit it might happen to me too. I would have been too surprised at first to react, and then I would have run through my list of extremely unappealing options, and very unhappily settled on #4. That's not because I actually like #4, but it won't pit me physically against someone who can overcome me easily, and it's the most drama-free option I can take, but I would have resolved inwardly NEVER to be around you again. 

Why?

*Because I said ""No"" to you and it meant nothing*.

Let me repeat that in a form more relevant to what happened at this party:

*She said no and you didn't feel obligated to respect that.*

**So how does this relate to /r/TheRedPill?** Because under the best of circumstances, you're going to wind up ""pulling"" women who are vulnerable to the manipulation that /r/TheRedPill espouses, or women who are too afraid to speak up when something bothers them. And, having experienced success with those ""techniques,"" that is how you will train yourself to approach women in the future. The more mentally and emotionally mature women who don't find unwanted physical contact or ""negging"" charming or roguish will have nothing to do with you. Under the worst of circumstances, you could wind up doing irreparable damage to your reputation and/or dating life by trying this stuff at the wrong place and the wrong time. Often there's a damn thin line between textbook Red Pill efforts and Standard Issue Creepy Guy behavior.

As /u/sevenbitbyte said in [an excellent comment above](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1u9994/starting_to_think_the_red_pill_philosophy_will/cefwlhw), what the /r/TheRedPill is fundamentally missing is a sense of empathy.

**EDIT(2):** Red Pill folks, as much as I appreciate [your obvious concern for my mental health](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1uhqgt/that_rbestof_post/), this isn't about hating men or trying to make their lives even harder. I don't hate men. The problems you describe for men on the dating circuit are very real. I'm trying to tell you why an action that you don't see as sinister might be perceived as such by someone who can't read your mind, and why so many women feel creeped-on and unsafe when someone attempts to use TRP ""strategy"" on them. If you really want to know how it feels to be a target, talk to women and not each other.

There are a lot of women in this thread and others around Reddit who've written about experiences like this. We're trying to tell you something, and honestly, it feels shitty to have people yell, ""Feminism!"" or ""Don't say hello to girls or they'll scream rape!"" and then walk away convinced that we're secretly plotting your downfall. Having a crappy time in the dating world is not a zero-sum situation in which one of the two sexes has amassed so many horrible experiences that the other never has any.

TRUE,ohhimark108,,,"Lot of great questions. Some of these are subject to personal interpretation.

We learn very subtly throughout the series that there are pockets of energy all over the world. Bernard takes Rose to Australia for one of those energy spots. There is a similar pocket of energy under the Lamp Post station in LA, probably another one in Tunisia. In ""316"", Eloise says that all of these energy spots all over the world are linked. The island is the *source* of that electromagnetic energy. On the other side of the equation, Jacob knows MIB is bound to that same electromagnetism, and that MIB will try to ""turn off the light"" to fulfill his goal of escaping the island. If MIB is successful, the light will go out all over the world, and it would probably be a very bad thing judging from what happened to the island after the light went out there.

When Juliet said ""it worked"" she wasn't talking about the nuke. Miles was actually reading her final thoughts as her consciousness transferred over to the ""afterlife."" She was talking about the vending machine Sawyer needed to unplug to get the candy, which is itself a metaphor for the mechanics of unplugging the island. The Incident is left ambiguous. It has never been confirmed whether or not the bomb actually detonated. The afterlife may be a result of it, but who is to say. Really up to personal belief.

This last question is pretty intense. The simplest answer is that the Others were just people. They all ended up on the island somehow, in a crash, or invited, or they made a deal with Jacob, etc. They certainly did feel it was their duty to protect the island, but Jacob never put them up to that. Most of them sided with MIB out of fear. Most of them had probably never seen Jacob, and now he's dead, and this person is offering them an ultimatum. It's a test of faith. The lists were how Jacob would communicate with the Others indirectly without telling them specifically what to do. Jacob and Richard would meet at the cabin, and Richard would bring the lists to the leader to do what they wanted with it. It's likely Ben inserted some of his own lists in there and said they were from Jacob. Jacob didn't not just appear to Ben, he was completely hands off. Jacob's goal was to prove the innate goodness in humanity, but he couldn't do that if he had to direct them. They had to have a choice for it to matter. Jacob couldn't tell Ben what to do because Ben was being tested.",0,1388723860,,0,1388728944,1,ceg25ub,t3_1ua6bk,t1_ceg25ub,t3_1ua6bk,1431776800,46,FALSE,lost,t5_2qhag,46

Do you know who couldn't use the swimming pools and brothels? The inmates? The SS guards could but the inmates could not. 

&gt;even allowed to print their own money. In fact you can always buy some of this money off eBay

Well no they didn't print their own money. They were given ""money"" for internal usage (which was extremely limited) after being forced to sell their property for very low prices. It was also only issued in very few camps and certain ghettos. 

http://motlc.wiesenthal.com/site/pp.asp?c=gvKVLcMVIuG&amp;b=395013

&gt;Keep in mind that the World Jewish Congress declared economic war on Germany in 1933.

Wait are you complaining that Jews were urged to boycott the goods of a country who viewed them as subhuman scum? Are you not at all surprised by this? Nope, you're a piece of shit so you will blame the holocaust on the Jews (not the rampant and obvious anti-semitisim of the Nazis).

&gt;Also, putting people in gas chambers was a myth however the ovens were legitimate. 

What? This is too ridiculous a claim to even debunk.

&gt; The water table at Auschwitz for example was too high for burial thus bodies had to be incinerated.

Never heard this claim before. I don't really get your point. 

&gt;This is still a common practice today yet no one is crying war crimes over it. 

Nobody is crying war crimes about it because burning bodies wasn't the problem, the problem is the murder of 11 million people in camps and millions more by SS death squads. 

&gt;My point is that there's two sides to every story and the US propaganda/education system only provides one when it comes to WWII.

Because there is only one side of the story when it comes to the holocaust. This isn't politics, there isn't a debate about this. There is a single widely accepted fact by historians. That the holocaust was the murder of over 10 million people in death camps by the Nazi regime. 

In summary you are at best an idiot who has not looked up anything. At worst you are racist anti-semitic scum and should really go die in a fire. I hate holocaust deniers more than anything else on the internet, you are a cancer and people like you will be responsible for the murder of millions because of racism if you are not shut down.

First it's Bob, Bob is really tall and has big black eyes, he doesn't play with us, he just stays in the corner, then Mary follows, she's really small like a fairy, she likes to braid my hair every night. Then it's Pete, Pete is always happy, he has a huge grin on his face every night, his friendly smile, I like his positivism. 

When He appears I smile as wide as Pete, He is really nice, He looks around my age, but I think He's older, He says I look like her. I don't know who is she but every time He talks about her, his eyes get brighter, I think He loves her. We play tea and read books. When I get sleepy, Mary tugs me in bed and tells me they'll come back tomorrow night, before I close my eyes He says goodnight. 

My mom always asks me when did I learn to braid my hair so perfectly. I tell her Mary did it but she never believes me I wish she did. I tell my classmates about Bob, Mary, Pete and He, but they always laugh and tell me I'm crazy. I don't have any friends just Bob, Mary, Pete and He. My mom turns the lights off and I wait patiently until they appear but they don't. 

I wait for hours. I hear something outside, maybe they are late to play. I get up and look at the window. There's a man, and he's really scary. I run and hide under my bed. The man says ""Don't be afraid, come outside"" but I don't trust him. He gets angry and tries to open my window. He does, and says ""Don't be afraid, play with me"" I know I don't have to play with him. In the corner I see Bob, I thought they weren't here. Bob looks angry. I think he's jealous of the man that wants to play with me. 

Up in the ceiling I see Pete, but he's not smiling, I have never seen him without a smile before. The man is searching for me, he looks in my closet, behind my toys. Until he looks in my direction. ""I know you're under the bed"" The man says as friendly as possible but he's far from being a friend. Mary appears next to me, she says I have to be quite. The man is about to find me, when He throws my lamp at him. The man curses. 

Mummy would be mad at him for saying those words. Bob jumps at him and the man screams, the man tries to fight with Bob but Pete joins him, smiling like I've never seen before. The man screams in terror trying to fight them. He grabs the sharp pieces of my broken lamp and before I get to see what he's about to do. Mary tells me to look at her, she tells me about how pretty my hair is and how she's going to teach me how to braid it. 

I can only hear her calm voice and the screams of the man. When mummy is in my room, my friends disappear,she yells asking where am I. I tell her I'm under the bed hiding from the man. When I see him, he's all red. I think it's blood. Mummy calls the police. I'm in the living room alone while my mom is talking to them in the kitchen. 

My friends appear in front of me. I tell them thank you for protecting me from the man. Mary tells me they need to protect other child. I get really sad, I don't want them to leave. I can see my friends are sad too. They leave and I'm alone. Why do they think they're evil? They're not.

Trust your gut. Sure, experiment, but if something strikes you the wrong way, nope right the fuck out of that. Drugs, a drink, a driver, a girl, some dude, campus preachers, whatever, just drop the situation.

TRUE,JJatt,asia,Sikh History | Colonial India,"Sweet find. If you are indeed a fan of history I would look into preserving that letter asap. It has some very interesting history connected to it. Simply put, this letter was sent to dissuade Sikh soldiers from joining the Azad Hind Fauj, the Free India Army. And promised them safe return and their old post back if they did. 


Now for some context. World War 2 was a difficult situation for India and Indians. To begin with the population was starting to have enough of Indian Soldiers fighting in foreign wars. In WW1 alone India lost over 70,000 troops. The highest of not only all the British colonies, but any colony or non-European nation that fought in that war. There was also a general ""Awaking"" occurring in many parts of India. The Socialists in Punjab were outlining the atrocities committed by the British, and the humiliation that Indians were subjugated to by a foreign power. This struggle culminated when the crown hung Bhagat Singh. Gandhi's peaceful protests were garnering cross Indian attention. Folks who were not as far extreme to join the ranks of the socialists, but were for freedom, now had a new avenue of political power they can use. As you can see the Indian conscious is rising. 

Now here comes World War 2 and the British begin to recruit heavily. The Sikhs were always at the top of the recruitment list next to the Gurkhas and Muslim Jatts, due to an outdated oriental Martial Race system where the British Mandated the heaviest of recruitment fall from the so called ""Martial Races"" who were seen to be better fit for combat due to their race and culture. These soldiers would be given incentives to join such as higher pay, quicker promotions, and retirement gifts of land and livestock. Young Indian men were desperate for these jobs though, even with their disillusion of the Empire and Crown. Thy had no choice, India was starving.

Not many people know this but the British orchestrated a mass and systematic starvation of the Indian people during World War 2. The biggest one occurring in Bengal where even the most conservative estimates put he death toll at 1.5 million people. The British policy at the time was very clear, they wanted to feed their soldiers above all. When Winston Churchill was asked about this famine he remarked ""The famine was their own fault, for breeding like rabbits."" This is also one of the more conservative things he had said. It went as far as to block countries like the US and Australia from sending aid to India during this era of famine. The reason is unknown, but in Madhusree Mukerjee's  Churchill's Secret War, she outlines that this famine cause the number of recruits to jump up and caused the biggest ""volunteer"" army in world war 2. 


This is where the Azad Hind Fauj comes into play. The Axis powers, mainly Japan, had this policy it set out early on the course of the war. It wanted to promote and strengthen Asia and asians as a people. After Japan joined the Axis powers and started the Pacific Theater it's main goal was to start to occupy European Colonies in the Pacific and Asia. Here they would spread propaganda of wanting to strengthen the occupied countries and fight out European influence, they would make it appear as if Japan was to be this Big Asian Brother who would help the nation achieve freedom, under Japan of course. And it worked. The people were tierd of being subjugated by white men from far away, they rose up and helped the Japanese. All over the Pacific Japanese-Asian led resistance forces were popping up. Now India is a little different here. India had already a history of struggle and Independence movements. There were many freedom leaders already living in exile who had clout. The biggest player being Subash C. Bose. He happened to find his way to germany and actually meet with Hitler. There he had convinced the Nazis to let him and his fellow expat Indians ally with the Axis powers and help create an army. He was granted permission and traveled to Japan via U-Boat to represnt Azad(free) India in the Pacific theater. The Japanese gave him a few islands and parts of captured Brumese India, money, and weapons. Here he began to train his forces of folks who were exiled or left India to fight for freedom, interestingly enough it was one of the only players involved aside from Nazi Germany and the Soviets who allowed women to fill combat roles. But the numbers still weren't good and Bose's army needed more people. 

Here's where the POW's come into play. Japan and Indian forces were heavily involved in the Pacific theater fighting for control of South East Asia. This is where most of the British-Indian troops were sent and where the most Indian POW's were taken. These POW's were given an opportunity by the Axis. They could either die in the POW Camps, or fight for their countries liberation. I assume from this letter they were also told the British would kill/imprison them if they escaped and made it back, but I have no other sources to confirm this. So it's easy to see why the captured POW's would choose to enlist in the Azad Hind Army.

The reason Sikhs were one of the bigger forces to jump ship was due to Punjab being a hotbed of resistance. Many Sikhs had family member who were freedom fighters, or remember the Massacre of Amritsar(where British troops killed Innocent Punjabis at a gathering in cold blood, right next to a holy shrine) pretty well. But this letter has some castist, racial undertones as well. Like I stated earlier the Sikhs were a Martial RAce. So they were more valuable to the British. Sikhs were the ones who held most the officer positions. And it's interesting to see that put into practice in this letter. 


I hope I answered your question and I thank you for sharing this letter. I'd love it if you'd be able to scan it. I'll list some sources below if you'd like some additional reading.

TRUE,ProgramMax,,,"Hello. I'm the guy working on the Android app.
Sorry you're having frustrations with it.

The reason your stream is not in the watch now tab is sort of two-fold. But let me first explain why there are those two tabs:

The ""Watch Now"" tab lists streams that are live which your phone can play.

The ""All Results"" tab then is the list of all live streams, whether your phone can play them or not. That is why clicking it suggests you go to the list of playable streams.

Sorry if that wasn't clear.


Now then, the reason you are unable to watch your stream on your device is because it cannot be played on your device. So the real solution to this problem isn't changing the app...it is changing your stream so it can be played on mobile devices. :)

Remember earlier I said the problem is sort of two-fold? One solution is to make your stream viewable on mobile devices. The other solution is to have enough viewers that you gain our transcodes. We transcode the top X-many streams (that X number changes over time). At different times of the day it becomes easier or harder to pass that X limit. And there are other small details involved. I'm generalizing. But I've seen times of the day where 2 viewers gave people transcodes. If you're at prime time, you'll need many more than 2 viewers.

Anyway, the more immediate solution would be to fix your stream to make it viewable.

You know the Twitch Dashboard page that tells you if your stream is Excellent or Good or whatever the different configuration qualities are? First, make sure you have Excellent. But then, you may be broadcasting at the h264 profile High, which not all mobile devices support. You should instead be broadcasting on Main. If you do that, the latest version of the Android app will play your stream.

I'm not sure how to change it from High to Main on XSplit. I couldn't find the profile setting. I think someone once told me it defaults to Main.

For OBS, go to Settings -&gt; Settings -&gt; Advanced -&gt; x264 Encoding Profile.

The big one that established the paradigm that if you ask for it, you are far more likely to get it than MRAs assert:

Though it is true that women are far more likely to be awarded custody, they are also far more likely to ask for it in the first place. To establish bias, one must show (at the very minimum) that equally qualified fathers who request custody are denied more than half of the time, and here the data prove inconvenient. Courts can't be expected to award what they're not asked to. *It turns out that fathers who ask for custody (and don't give up) are very likely to get either sole or joint custody:*

The following study adds to research that examines child custody cases involving a history of interpersonal violence. This study contributes to past research by providing qualitative accounts of women's experiences with intimate partner violence prior to custody loss, institutional abuse at the hands of the family court, and abuse experienced after custody loss. Data come from a convenience sample of 16 noncustodial mothers from northeastern Ohio. Findings support past research, which finds corruption, denial of due process, and gender bias in the family court system.

According to the results of one study, in nearly every case, and eclipsing virtually all other factors, access of the non-custodial parent (usually the father) was considered paramount to the ""best interests of the child"". This was irrespective of the quality or regularity of his parenting.

One of the biggest complaints I hear from 1% apologists is that increasing minimum wage or expanding programs like Medicare, disability welfare, and general welfare is not feasible. On the contrary, *it is feasible* - but large corporations and wealthy families, like the Waltons, really like having huge sums of cash. It gives them enormous power to invest in *their* interests. They can buy out smaller companies with fresh ideas, they can buy politicians that will vote the way they want them to. With all of that money, even when it's just sitting in vaults or tied up in investments, they can keep up a facade that America *needs them*, that America's fiber and being is tied up in the never-ending race for profit.

Frankly, America's best interests are not at heart. There's no accountability with many large corporations, and even less accountability with rich families. Right now we don't have accountability when we need it most. Groups like the NSA and the TSA have made it their mission to label anyone who would dare try to expose corporate corruption or tax evasion as conspiracy theorists or terrorists.

Usually if a person's native tongue is Spanish, I'd speak to them in Spanish to make them feel comfortable with me, but yet days I feel like speaking English so that they can practice it. F%ck me right?

So I decided I'd order in English. I get to the counter, a Latino man standing behind it with an accent difficult to understand, and I order the same thing I always order at Subway, but this time bacon was just calling my name, so I asked the guy how much it'd cost to add bacon:

Subway man: ""oh ok, one second plea?
Subway man: ""oye Carlos, este pendejo quiere bacon, cuanto cuesta?""  (Translation: ""Carlos, this stupid guy wants bacon, how much is it?)

Yet, he had the audacity to laugh about it too. Little satan on my left shoulder was telling me to tell him off in spanish and run off, but little god was telling me to keep my calm.

Raid 0 has minimal gaming performance improvement though, as Raid 0 really only provides insane performance for applications such as 3D Modeling software and Photoshop.

First generation SSD controllers were known to have some compatibility issues, but I'm fairly certain controller incompatibility is very rare with the new generation of SSDs you have.

I also recommend disconnecting ANY storage devices with a Windows OS, as Windows boot files may be accidentally written to the other storage device. Adding another SSD once you have installed your OS may not auto-format the added SSD. Sometimes you have to do it manually ; Start &gt; Right-click ""Computer"" &gt; ""Manage"" &gt; Click ""Disk Management"" &gt; Find your non-OS SSD and click on it &gt; Click ""Format"". (If that made no sense, here's a [link](http://pcsupport.about.com/od/windows7/ht/format-hard-drive-windows-7.htm).

If you encounter your Win7 freezing during installation, this could be because hot swapping is disabled in your BIOS, and should be set accordingly. Once your OS is installed, disable hot swapping in your BIOS. If you BSOD after allowing hot swapping, make sure your SSD has a dedicated power cable to prevent that from happening.

After you get your OS installed, be sure to check out the [OCZ Toolbox](http://ocz.com/consumer/download/firmware) to get the latest firmware installed for your 128GB HDD, TRIM is good for prolonging SSD stability over time, as well as the [Samsung 840 Evo Page](http://www.samsung.com/global/business/semiconductor/samsungssd/downloads.html).

TRUE,Das_Mime,,,"Tolkien is unquestionably the most influential figure in high fantasy, and I think it is not unreasonable to say that he and C.S. Lewis were the originators of the subgenre. The Chronicles of Narnia and The Lord of the Rings were both published during the mid-1950s. Earlier in their respective literary careers, Hobbit was published in 1937 and Perelandra in 1938, the former was not yet the fully-developed high fantasy of Lord of the Rings and the latter would be better described as science fiction. Tolkien and Lewis were good friends, of course, and often discussed their writings with each other.

The roots of Tolkien's works lie primarily in medieval writings, especially Anglo-Saxon poetry and Norse epics like Beowulf and the [Volsung Saga](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C3%B6lsunga_saga). Influences from farther afield, including the Finnish national epic the [*Kalevala*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalevala), show up from time to time in his writings as well. Tolkien was, of course, a professor of Anglo-Saxon (and later of English language &amp; literature) at Oxford, and was interested in poetry and languages since at least his late teenage years. In addition to being one of the all-time best selling authors in human history, he was an accomplished linguist, literary critic, and translator. The Book of Jonah in the Jerusalem Bible was translated by Tolkien, he made a complete translation of Beowulf as well as a highly influential lecture on it entitled [*Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics*](http://www.english.uga.edu/~jdmevans/Personal/JRRT1936.pdf), he did etymologies of Germanic W words for the Oxford English Dictionary, he wrote a vocabulary of Middle English, and he published translations of three Middle English poems: [*Sir Gawain and the Green Knight*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Gawain_and_the_Green_Knight), [*Pearl*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_(poem\)), and [*Sir Orfeo*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Orfeo). One particularly interesting aspect of Tolkien's writings, from a meta-literary perspective is that they are framed as a collection of writings which he discovered and translated from Elvish (Silmarillion and related works) and the Common Tongue of Middle Earth (the Red Book of Westmarch, written by Bilbo and Frodo-- the former of whom translated some Elvish source material for use in the book). Truly an irrepressible enthusiasm for philology. Also, if you read Lord of the Rings out loud to yourself, you will find many examples where Tolkien wrote sentences that pretty much could have been lines of [alliterative verse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliterative_verse), the style of Old and Middle English that many poems were written in, including Sir Gawain &amp; the Green Knight, Pearl, and Sir Orfeo.

Tolkien believed the world suffered from disenchantment: that along with the modernization of the Industrial and Victorian eras had come a reduced sense of wonder at the world, and a diminished willingness to believe in the fantastic and the terrible. In his essay, [*On Fairy-Stories*](http://public.callutheran.edu/~brint/Arts/Tolkien.pdf) (seriously, read it, it's great), he explained his views on faery-stories and the importance of fantasy and mythology. He felt that they had been tamed, that the connotation of ""fairy"" (he often used the spelling ""Faery"" or ""Faerie""--the spelling was important to him, as a discriminating philologist) had become domesticated and defanged, something you would meet in your garden rather than a dark forest, something adorable rather than something which should make you tremble. He felt that such stories described the world on a spiritual plane in a way that mundane stories about the real world could not.

While at secondary school in the early 1910s, Tolkien and his three closest friends (Rob Gilson, G.B. Smith, and Christopher Wiseman) formed a private club they called the Tea Club and Barrovian Society, or TCBS for short. They talked about many things, including philology and poetry, which they also wrote and read for each other. After graduating from the boarding school, they remained in contact and visited each other. All of them considered the TCBS to be the center of their intellectual lives. It was during this period and his subsequent university education at Oxford that the seeds of his world began to grow. In 1914, he wrote a poem called *The Voyage of Eärendel the Evening Star* (published in the Book of Lost Tales 2), which later evolved into the culminating episode of the *Quenta Silmarillion*. It was based on a line of Anglo-Saxon poetry by [Cynewulf](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynewulf). Tolkien later wrote that the name Earendil struck him as one that he could write stories about.

His influence on fantasy is profound-- anything which has Orcs in it owes him for that invention, and anything with Elves or Dwarves (although both spellings exist prior to Tolkien, he is largely responsible for the thorough dominance of Dwarves and Dwarven rather than dwarfs and dwarfish) very probably owes him as well, since neither of those mythical beings had yet taken the well-defined shape that is present in Tolkien. Elves and Dwarves were ideas present in Norse/Germanic mythology, but their physical descriptions were generally quite vague or indeterminate, and ""elfs"" in particular could denote a wide variety of concepts of mythological beings, from frolicsome gnomes (which one can see in The Hobbit as well as some of Tolkien's earlier writing) to wicked spirits which are responsible for causing illnesses (a view represented in late medieval Britain). To [Snorri Sturluson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snorri_Sturluson), the medieval Icelandic writer, dwarfs were dark-elves and light elves were what we might think of. In many cases both dwarfs and elves were thought of as simply beings which populated the unknown world on the periphery of human realms, hiding in mountain caves or deep forests, sometimes practically as animistic spirits, and rarely as the magnificent, ancient civilizations that Tolkien envisioned. Any time you see a representation of invariably bearded dwarves (which, let's be honest, is any time you see dwarves), you're seeing Tolkien's influence. Elves being the noble, cultured, ancient elder race is also attributable to Tolkien-- even in situations like the game Dragon Age, which another poster mentioned, where elves are a marginalized, formerly enslaved people, they were once much more powerful than humans. That game tries to buck a lot of standard high fantasy tropes (drawing on G.R.R. Martin's work in part), but the key point is that it still existed within a context where it doesn't even make sense to the player to use the word ""elves"" if they're not going to be a noble ancient race. Authors like Rothfuss and Martin have specifically said that they're trying to write something in high fantasy that *isn't* a rehash of Tolkien. I'm deeply sorry for the 20-year-rule violations, but the magnitude of Tolkien's influence is shown by the fact that until the last 20 years or so there were not many fantasy authors making a serious effort to do something wholly apart from Tolkien. Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series had the first installment published in 1990 and was still clearly laden with Tolkien.

After graduating from Oxford in 1915, Tolkien proposed to Edith Mary Bratt, married her in early 1916, and in the summer of 1916 shipped off to serve as a signals officer in the Great War that was then raging on the mainland-- a parting which caused both of them great distress, but it was just not very socially acceptable for a young, able-bodied man to refuse to serve in the war. He wrote the poem *Kortirion Among the Trees* while in a training camp in Britain in 1915-- Kortirion would later become the Elvish city on the isle of Tirion lying off the coast of Valinor. Besides disease and hostile shells, one of the chief dangers of the trenches was boredom. Tolkien's imagination had all the time it desired, and though it was nearly impossible to do any serious writing in the trenches, Tolkien nonetheless jotted down many an idea, which he would often expand upon during his time back from the trenches. ""You might scribble something on the back of an envelope and shove it in your back pocket, but that's all. You couldn't write.. you'd be crouching down among flies and filth."" It was during this period that he first began to dream up the two languages that would become the Elvish languages [Quenya](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quenya) (which he worked on first) and [Sindarin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sindarin) (which came later, in 1917, as a derivative of Quenya). Earlier in his life he had played with inventing languages, but never so thoroughly (nor with such a grasp of linguistic change) as during the period immediately after WWI. His history of Arda (the world which includes Middle-Earth) began in part as an explanation of the historical migrations of the Elves that led to the linguistic relationship between Quenya and Sindarin. The other three members of the TCBS were aleady serving in WWI by the time Tolkien joined, and they stayed in correspondence with each other regularly, writing poetry to fill their time. Rob Gilson died in the first days of the Somme offensive, which weighed heavily on the surviving three. Also at the Somme, Tolkien witnessed the advent of the tank, which made a great impression upon him, serving as inspiration for the description of Balrogs and dragons overrunning the walls of the Elvish city of Gondolin. He began writing *The Fall of Gondolin*, the first prose story about Middle-Earth in 1917 on the back of some military sheet music. The poems he had written prior to that point tended to become incorporated into the legendarium later on, but did not begin as poems about this other world.

TRUE,The_Year_of_Glad,,,"I think I've mentioned this in a similar thread in the past, but I'm going to go with the Bath School disaster. It happened in Michigan in 1927, and to this day it's still the deadliest mass killing in an American school.

The story starts with a 54-year-old farmer named Andrew Kehoe. Kehoe was by all accounts a frugal (some would say stingy) man, and even though he wasn't well-liked by his neighbors, his reputation for thrift allowed him to be elected as treasurer of the Bath County school board, and for a brief time as the township's clerk as well. He lost a 1926 election for the clerk position, however, after running on a campaign that emphasized low property taxes, and at that point he seems to have decided that he would perform an act of revenge against the citizens who had made it possible for the government to take away his hard-earned money.

Starting that August, he gradually purchased several hundred pounds of both dynamite and a military surplus explosive called pyrotol, buying small quantities at numerous stores in the surrounding area in order to avoid suspicion. Under the guise of performing electrical work for the school district, he concealed these explosives inside the brick schoolhouse that held all of the district's children. His preparations were so involved that he entirely stopped working on his farm, and paying his mortgage. That December, he also purchased a rifle.

In May of 1927, Kehoe put his plan into action. He killed his wife, who was terminally ill with tuberculosis and had just been discharged from the hospital, and concealed her body inside a wheelbarrow in his farm's chicken coop, then surrounded it with all of his money and other earthly valuables, in order that they could be destroyed together. He then set about systematically sabotaging everything on his farm: cutting the wire on all his fences to render it unusable, killing the trees that shaded it, slicing through all of his grape vines at the root and then wiring the stems back into place so that nothing would seem amiss to a casual observer, and placing massive firebombs inside every structure on the farm. He also used wire restraints to hobble the legs of his two horses inside his barn, to prevent them from escaping from it once the bombs went off, and filled his truck with large quantities of explosives and metal shrapnel. Finally, he started a fire inside his home, and when the volunteer fire brigade arrived, he rode off and told them that they should leave, as they were his friends and they would soon be needed at the school.

At 8:45 that morning, fifteen minutes after the start of classes, an alarm clock that Kehoe had rigged as a detonator triggered the explosives he had concealed inside the north wing of the schoolhouse. A similar device in the south wing failed to activate, but the result of the one successful explosion was more than bad enough. In an instant, the entire north wing of the schoolhouse lifted several feet into the air, and community members miles away were jostled by the shockwave. Burning children were thrown through the windows of their classrooms, and the roof collapsed on top of those still inside. A local resident named Monte Ellsworth who arrived at the scene shortly thereafter described it thus: ""There was a pile of children of about five or six under the roof and some of them had arms sticking out, some had legs, and some just their heads sticking out. They were unrecognizable because they were covered with dust, plaster, and blood. There were not enough of us to move the roof.""

The efforts of more than a hundred frantic men were not enough to lift the roof off of the children, so Ellsworth volunteered to go home to his farm and get a thick rope that could be used to drag it off of them. On his way there, he passed his neighbor Kehoe on road. Kehoe favored him with a big smile and a cheerful wave.

When Kehoe arrived at the scene, he beckoned the school superintendent (whom he hated) over to his carriage. Witnesses saw the two struggling over Kehoe's gun, and then Kehoe fired a shot that triggered the bomb inside his carriage, spraying shrapnel into the crowd of rescuers and instantly killing both himself and his rival.

Eventually, the townspeople were able to clear enough of the wreckage to remove and treat all of the children who were still alive. They also discovered the second timer, and *the more than 500 pounds of explosives* that it was meant to detonate. You can see a picture of them [here](http://i.imgur.com/9zFP8NE.jpg).

In total, Kehoe killed 43 people that day: his wife, the superintendent, four bystanders who were too close to the truck bomb (including an eight-year-old boy who had escaped from the first explosion), and 38 people who had been inside the school, all but two of whom were children between the ages of seven and fourteen. 58 others were seriously injured. Kehoe's body was claimed by his sister, and secretly buried in an unmarked grave. The only explanation he left behind was a sign wired to a fence post at his farm - it read, ""Criminals are made, not born.""

Whenever I think about the Bath School disaster, I'm always taken aback by Kehoe's behavior. It's one thing to just snap in anger - while that's terrible, it's at least something you can understand on one level or another. But for more than half a year, Kehoe lived among these people, made small talk with them, and tipped his hat in the street, knowing that soon he would do his best to take all their children from them in one terrible morning of blood and fire. And as if that weren't enough, the sheer spite on display in every detail of his actions is just breathtaking. He went well out of his way to ensure that nothing he left behind would be of any use to anyone from that point forward. The horses didn't tax his land, but because someone might ride them after he was gone, they had to die. The vines didn't hurt his pride, but because they might nourish someone after he was gone, they had to die. He methodically sowed everything in his life with salt, and even his own death ensured that the survivors would gain no understanding or closure from his passing.",0,1388751170,,0,FALSE,2,ceg908u,t3_1uac3m,t1_ceg908u,t3_1uac3m,1431780123,1733,FALSE,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,1733

TRUE,[deleted],,,"That bomber pilot went crazy, utterly insane. He managed to overpower his co-pilot and steer the plane North, where he intentionally crashed it into the British RAF base in Gibraltar... The Man himself later explained to me that that pilot had been suffering from a brain tumor which, at that moment, influenced that decision.

 The plane was carrying nuclear material, which was spread in the manner of a dirty bomb detonation when the plane's fuel tanks exploded and ignited a large gasoline storage tank in the base, producing a sizeable explosion. This was witnessed by the captain of a United States Forrest-Sherman-Class Destroyer which was headed out of the Mediterranian Sea at the time. Due to the distance, he could not properly ascertain the size of the explosion, but picked up the radiation of the resulting cloud of radioactive material on the ship's Geiger counter, thus making the fatal mistake of confusing the explosion for a nuclear detonation. He seems to have panicked at that point because in his message to Washington, he kept rambling about a Soviet nuclear pre-emptive strike on European military installations along the coast of the mediterranian sea. A lot of people reacted in a very rash manner in the next few hours... Long short story, after the United States started their entire strategic bomber fleet and Russian intelligence got conflicting news of a large-scale exchange between British and Russian forces in the mediterranian (which was entirely fictional and originated from an agent who was at the time suffering from delusions), World War III happened. Half of the human race did not survive the next decade. 

That was the time when The Man appeared. He didn't call himself The Man, but that's what I remember, him being the first Man I had seen in a long time - damn if I can remember what he called himself... He was, that we are quite sure of, not a human being, although he physically resembled one. He talked to me personally at the time (it was 1969), trying to find out what happened to the planet. I distinctly remember him saying that 1969 was a fixed point in time that was about to be altered: A human being had to set foot on the moon on July 20, which was, at the time, impossible because we had effectively bombed ourselves back into the stone ages. The Man implied that it was possible for him to take a human being there, if neccessary, but that that was not how it was supposed to happen. He said that a particular video tape of the moon landing was what was important, one that was longer than it was supposed to be... I can not claim to understand half of it. 

The Man also said that the crash of the B-47 was not a fixed point and could be altered. I would have taken him for just another nutjob then - the human race had not exactly retained its sanity after the war was over. Of course, it was never really over, but the last atomic bomb had been detonated almost eight years ago and there were about a thousand groups claiming to be the United States or the Soviet Union, fighting each other with old rifles, the occasional mortar or landmine, sticks, stones and their bruised fists. 

I would have thought The Man was a madman - which was a thing he called himself, by the way - if not for his clothing. In a charred wasteland of endless war, he strolled into my little safehouse in a perfectly new, clean three-piece suit. Now, you can't know what the world was like after the bombs had fallen, but let me tell you: When I saw him entering, I truly thought the suit was a miracle. There was nothing, could be nothing as clean and undamaged in the entire world. 

I don't know why I remember it all - because The Man went back. He told me he'd fix things and then he walked out again. There was a noise, then he was gone. Then there was confusion, I lost my consciousness, then I was back in my bed again and the year was 1956, the day after the war had started. Except it hadn't. I called friends and acquaintances everywhere, asked about the bombs, about the Russians and finally about the plane. It turned out that it had disappeared without a trace... They later locked me in a mental ward for a few weeks after I kept telling them about World War III, that was when I learned to shut my mouth. Hell, I stopped believing it myself at some point, started thinking they were right, that I was a right down regular nutcase. 

Except, of course, The Man came back. He looked differently, dressed differently, different face, different hair, different everything, looking younger than before - but it was him alright, and he knew me. Must have been about this time last year, I guess... We had some tea then. Now I know I've always been right, that the War was real and The Man was real, and I'm too old for them to lock me into a madhouse again. They'll just say I'm going a bit senile, so it's alright. I didn't imagine that second visit, either - he left me his number. I call him from time to time.

TRUE,Bernardito,,,"This is actually not true. It has been proven false since then.

The story never happened. It's complete fiction.

But Bernardito, wasn't it included in the Guinness Book of World Records? Doesn't Wikipedia confirm as true?

Here we get to the interesting part. 

First, the truth: February 1945. It's the final stages of William Slim's brilliant Burma campaign and the British have trapped a Japanese force counting around a thousand men in the islands of Ramree. Instead of surrendering, the Japanese commander chose to take his men across an unblocked route through ten miles of mangrove swamps. Many were already in a bad state entering the swamp. Malaria was rampant. As one can imagine, swamps are not pleasant places. They are filled not only with deadly insects and snakes but are truly a nightmare to get through. Out of 900 troops that went into the swamp, 500 made it out. 

The myth: The above story except that by the end 20 troops were captured by the British, the rest were all killed by saltwater crocodiles. This is a 'reported account' from this encounter: *""That night was the most horrible that any member of the ML crews ever experienced. The scattered rifle shots in the pitch black swamp punctured by the screams of wounded men crushed in the jaws of huge reptiles, and the blurred worrying sound of spinning crocodiles made a cacophony of hell that has rarely been duplicated on earth. At dawn the vultures arrived to clean up what the crocodiles had left... Of about 1,000 Japanese soldiers that entered the swamps of Ramree, only about twenty were left alive.""*

Why is this a sensationalist myth?

The observer of this is according to most accounts a certain [Bruce Wright](http://books.google.se/books/about/Wildlife_Sketches_Near_and_Far.html?id=Kb9XmQEACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y) who for some reason was in this swamp where this is said to have taken place, sitting in a motor launch and witnessing this. Yet only Wright's *Wildlife Sketches Near and Far* exists as the single account for this to have happened.

There is no other single source that can verify this event to have happened and the actual survivors themselves that came out of the swamp is enough to disprove this myth. There is no mention of it in official British records and W.O.G. Potts did his own research into this with an incredibly detail investigation in which he interviewed a broad range of people which included Ramree islanders, survivors and soldiers. No one acknowledged that an incident like this had taken place.

Lastly, historian Frank McLynn has this to say in his book *The Burma Campaign*: 

*Most of all, there is a single zoological problem. If 'thousands of crocodiles' were involved in the massacre, as in the urban (jungle) myth, how had these ravening monsters survived before and how were they to survive later? The ecosystem of a mangrove swamp, with a exiguous mammal life, simply would not have permitted the existence of so many saurians before the coming of the Japanese (animals are not exempt from the laws of overpopulation and starvation).*

The Wikipedia writer is overly critical about Frank McLynn in the article, for whatever reason that might be. While McLynn did indeed doubt the existence of Mr. Wright but as pointed out in the *Talk* section of the page in question, there is no evidence that the Wright who wrote the book which had the only account of the incident and the Wright which the Wikipedia page uses as a source (a dubious one at that) is the same person. Secondly, the Wikipedia page makes McLynn seem like someone making claims out of thin air which is ridiculous. He's using scholarly sources to back up his claim and is definitely not the only author doubting this story. (Just see Platt SG, Ko WK, Kalyar Myo M, Khaing LL, Rainwater T. *Man eating by estuarine crocodiles: the Ramree Island massacre revisited.* Herp Bull. 2001;75:15–18)",0,1388753819,,0,FALSE,1,ceg9g0q,t3_1uac3m,t1_ceg9g0q,t1_ceg75v6,1431780332,768,FALSE,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,768
TRUE,bigjo66,,,"As someone with a biology degree, and an interest in Cryptozoology, I place myself as hopeful, but not optimistic, about a great many claims in this field.

With things like Bigfoot, there are a great many stories, and interesting snippets of evidence, but nothing conclusive, imho. My main reasons for leaning towards not (yet) believing in Bigfoot, and other cryptids can be boiled down to these:

- No Body. Clearly a corpse of a cryptid would be irrefutable evidence that it exists. Were they to exist in numbers large enough to sustain a viable population, living in North America alongside humans for thousands of years, the fact that we don't yet have a body, or any bones etc is pretty damning. Absence of evidence isn't always evidence of absence, but when we know that there logically MUST be bodies if these creatures do exist, the fact that we currently have absolutely nothing in this regard is significant.

- Where is the fossil record? So there is another primate living in North America, or some other creature that's unknown living somewhere else. Well it must have evolved from something, and even if we don't have a live one or dead body, we would expect to find some kind of fossil trace that might hint at what a modern version could look like. For a primate the size of Bigfoot to exist, something that's quite possibly the largest primate to ever have lived (if it's real), then the fact there isn't any fossil evidence indicating this is likely is a major problem.

- Witness reliability. In general, humans actually aren't very good witnesses. People's memories are malleable, and in a culture where 'bigfoot' is a very popular, or at least well-known concept, the fact that many people claim to have seen it is unsurprising. I don't believe in a lot of things. Ghosts, Angels, God, etc. The fact that there are a lot of people alive today and historically who claim to be witnesses of them simply doesn't sway me. Even if people are telling the absolute truth as they remember it, that doesn't mean their account is accurate, or correct. I'm sure that everyone can think of something they don't believe happened/exists that has a great many convinced witnesses for.

I would dearly love for science to make such a massive discovery such as a live Bigfoot, or any one of the other cryptids that are often mentioned, but at the moment I just really don't think there is anywhere near enough evidence to be satisfied.

TRUE,thedevilyousay,,,"It's all about how you think. What helped me is to think of what dudes were doing just a few generations ago. See, around that time, the sweet ass Germans were just getting some *lebensraum* - space to live. After two decades of living in economic and geographic strangulation, they finally took a stand. The world has always been shitbaked of a strong german people. This is not a new struggle for them, because since Roman times, when they were just a smattering of tribes who cooked pigs feet over dung fires, fuckers have been trying to take their shit and tax their balls off. They don't take too kindly to that crap. They'd been fucking with shit since Arminius lured those Roman milk drinkers into the [Teutoburg Forest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Teutoburg_Forest). Just a bunch of barbarians, eh? Yeah, they laughed that day, as they dined on bowls of hot eagle stew. Still, the Romans kept pushing and pushing, slaughtering their kids and burning their nice ass farms. Eventually, after trying to conquer past the Rhine for like the millionth time, they finally hung up their plumes and gave up. The people had some space to live. That is, until the ""allies"" took that away in 1918. 

The germans, who were no strangers to not fucking around, were just looking for some sweet farmland to grow some cabbages, but Stalin and Churchill thought they liked them better under the yoke. So they recruited like 30 million guys in green to put the gerries back into slavery. They had giant fucking boats with guns the size of city buses, and they shot up all their shit. They had eleventy million tanks, machine guns, airplanes, and they had one goal: to blow their nuts off, choke the economy, and to dress the germans in nice frilly aprons so they could cook little fancy cakes like the spineless, neutered bitches they thought they should be. Fuck that noise. 

They got word that there were like a million bitches with machine guns landing on their new beach to fuck shit up. They just got this fucking beach for fuck's sake, ain't no way they're giving it up. They knew it could be the end, as everyone in the world was triple tag-teaming up to put them down like cattle in a PETA commercial. The boys on the beach showed their mates black and white pictures of their girlfriends, kissed their crosses, spit into the wind, and said, ""Do your worst."" 

And boy, did they ever. The yankee boats shot fucking flaming city buses over all their shit, while legion upon legion of bloodthirsty yanks stormed up the beach, shooting machine guns and lobbing grenades directly at their nuts. They held the line as planes dropped bombs on their brothers, who popped like water balloons filled with blood. Yet, they held that fucking line. Would it have been easier to just give up? Perhaps they should have just slept in and let them have the stupid beach. Maybe they could head back to Berlin for some sausage? Maybe go into marketing? Yeah, that would have been easy. Maybe they should sit quietly in the barren little playpen the world wanted them in, while everyone else got fat off of their land? Is that what Arminius would have done? I think you know the answer. 

Outnumbered and out-gunned, they held that line it until it finally broke, and tens of thousands of Marlborough-smoking fuckeaters enveloped them and started to split their skulls open with rifle butts and bayonets. They held that line while the so-called allies fired at them until they were biologically turned inside out. Their livers and brains littered the land like confetti. They held that line until their life's blood seeped out into the earth - the same earth they just wanted to live on 

That's what they did.

Oh! and don't rub one out, even if you want to -- if you wait the full week, it'll - uh  - you know - shoot further, so....

Oh, and women -- can you just stay at home for bit with the kid - make sure everything is cool? Church is important, but if we don't get the fucking kid past 6 months, your pregnancy was for nothing. 9 months down the drain -- so it's cool if you want to skip a few churchies.

&gt;* After researching the original graph, I found that the source of the ""drug addiction rates"" (as seen [HERE](http://www.oas.samhsa.gov/NSDUH/2k10NSDUH/2k10Results.htm#Ch7). Was pretty much made up on the spot, as nowhere in that document does it discuss ""addiction rates"", nor could such a statistic be accurately measured. 

&gt;* I also noticed that the ""spending"" was not only in **nominal** dollars (not real dollars, which account for inflation) but it also did not account for the massive increase in US population over the past 40 years (from around 205million to 310 million).

&gt;* So I remade the graph, using the same style, to accurately show you guys a less bias, more sensible view of the U.S. drug enforcement spending. (and I cite my sources)

&gt;* The spending rates have been adjusted to be per capita (using data from the US census), and in 2010 dollars (using the bls.gov inflation calculator). That is, the number is the amount of money spent per citizen, in 2010 dollars. 

&gt;* The drug usage rates, are taken directly from the US department of health, and they show the percentage usage rate of ""illegal"" drugs in the country. As the main purpose of the ""war on drugs"" is to reduce the usage rates of illegal drugs, this gives a good picture on how it has been progressing. It is also important to note that the large increase during the late 80s was mainly to counteract the surge of crack usage in cities.

&gt;* Rates prior to 1979 were hard to find and not entirely accurate (the few sources I did find stated that usage rates were in the 20% area for the 1960s-70s, but I could not find conclusive data), hence the dotted line.

While living in Central Florida from 2001 through 2008 I saw Dawn, and other trainers who were interviewed in the movie, perform shows on a regular basis. I was there for the opening day of ""Believe"" and saw Dawn perform this show on several occasions. I witnessed Tilikum in action in several shows and I remember taking notice of the scars on his body. The simple fact is that SeaWorld executives knowingly bought a psychologically traumatized animal with a violent past and they continue to use him in shows to this day for two reasons:

A. Tilikum is their largest whale.

and 

B. He is a male who is a sexually mature breeder.



SeaWorld executives are responsible for lying to their employees about Tilikum's past for financial gain. I am not against keeping and training Orcas in captivity. I am not against the research and conservation efforts that are certainly a benefit of SeaWorld's existence. 

I am against crude capture of wild young orcas. I am against the purchase of Tilikum and his continued use for shows. I am against allowing Tilikum to be kept in an enclosure with other abusive females or kept in solitary confinement as a form of protection from said females. 

SeaWorld executives need to understand that Orca's are deeply social and psychological animals. There are consequences to improper psychological health when caring for an Orca. Tilikum has been through too much and has shown violent tendencies for too long. He cannot continue to live the theme park life.

TRUE,miczajkj,,,"There are a few differences in the use of *Qbits* (quantum bits) compared with classical bits:  

- the room you work in does not have to be 2 dimensional (you are not restricted to 0 and 1). This is not that big of an advantage and indeed you could also do a similar thing in classical computing. I just wanted to point that out. (For simplicity we still often look for 2 dimensional quantum systems.)  

- Quantum systems can be in superposition states. While classical bits are either 0 or 1 quantum mechanics works entirely different: every system exhibits vector structures. That means, that you have two basis vectors |0&gt; and |1&gt; (we may also call them (1, 0) and (0, 1) or up and down or however you like; don't be afraid by the notation: those brackets are just a neat way of talking about quantum states) but every combination of those vectors is also a possible state (because a constant doesn't change the physical state we choose to normalize them to an absolute value of one, so we can classify all possible states of one Qbit as (a, b) (or equivalent a|0&gt;+b|1&gt;) with the restraint |a|²+|b|² = 1.)   
We can interprete that as a state, that has the probability of |a|² to be measured as |0&gt; and the probability of |b|² to be measured as |1&gt;.

- two Qbits can be [entangled](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_entanglement). That means, that you can't demount the two-Qbit-system in two non-interacting one-Qbit-systems. 

A little more math to the last point: 
The two Qbit system can be described by four basis-vectors:  
|00&gt; (both Qbits in the state |0&gt;)  
|11&gt; (both Qbits in the state |1&gt;)  
|01&gt;, |10&gt;  (one of the Qbits in |1&gt;, the other in |0&gt;)
so every possible state can be expressed by  
|psi&gt; = a|00&gt; + b|01&gt; + c|10&gt; + d|11&gt;  
with |a|²+|b|²+|c|²+|d|² = 1. 
We stated before, that every one-Qbit-state can be written as a|0&gt;+b|1&gt; does that mean, that every two-Qbit-state can be demounted to the following product  
|psi&gt; = (a|0&gt;+b|1&gt;)(c|0&gt;+d|1&gt;)?  
(here the a,b,c,d are not the same as before, evidently.)

The answer is: no, this is not possible for every state. Take for example the (normalized) state  
|psi&gt; = 1/sqrt(2) (|01&gt;+|10&gt;)  
It can not be written as a product state - we therefore call it entangled. In fact, you can easily see, that the outcome of the two Qbits is anti-correlated: if you measure one to be 1, then the other one must be 0. 


Now the time-development of those states can be controlled by so called quantum gates and you can do that very properly. Therefore you can indeed calculate many things at once (by using the superposition principle) and you can kind of communicate over arbitrary distances (via entanglement, while you have to be very careful here: it is no real kind of communication, as an instant information-transfer would violate special relativity. But there is indeed the possibility of [*quantum teleportation*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_teleportation) where you can instantly transport a physical state over an arbitrary distance and [*dense coding*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superdense_coding) where you send two bits of information with transferring only one Qbit, thanks to entanglement.)

Controllers within the directive are specific for the directive. They don't depend on any outside factors, so the directive always has that functionality regardless of the page it's on. If you pass in a function to the directive, its behavior can change depending on the context you're using it.

If you have *phone* directive, you always want the call to go through once you've dialed, but how you dial depends on what time period you're in. 

So 100 years ago or whatever, you've got a controller 

    OldController($scope) {
        $scope.dial = function() {
            // old rotary phone or something.
            // so you've got to do a lot of spinning.
        };

        $scope.dial = function() {
            // cellphone
            // we just hit speed dial
    };

So if your directive takes in the dial function from your controller, you can reuse it for any period of phones. 

Maybe you always want to print the phone number before you call, so you're saying like ""Now calling {{number}}!"" That can be a function ON the directive.

**Explanation**  
I've seen this before. What it is, when someone opens an attachment Outlook downloads it to a temporary folder. If you are in an enterprise environment, a lot of the attachments are going to be scan.pdf, photo.jpg, doc1.docx, etc. very generic names. Typically Outlook will clear out the temp folder if done correctly (typically when outlook closes). However, if for what ever reason Outlook isn't shut down properly it doesn't clean the folder. So this leaves these files in the temp folder. So the next time they open an attachment it now becomes scan(1).pdf, photo(1).jpg, doc1(1).docx, etc. Here is where the problem lies, Outlook can only create up to 99 copies of the same file. So most likley that is why you can't create a file. Clearing out that folder, should fix the problem.

Basically you want to actively take part in efforts that increase your strength relative to your vassals by either increasing your income, levies, or both by increasing your demesne size or by decreasing theirs. 

First, no kingdom titles should exist in your Empire aside from the ones that take only one Duchy to create like Castille and Brittany. All else being the same, Kings always seem more likely to join a faction than a Duke. This isn't the only reason, see below. You should not, I repeat NOT, ever need to bribe or scheme away faction members (or really give any one vassal any particular extra consideration), and with Kings that is sometimes your only option.

Ye shall always rock yon Elective succession with your primary title always being a single title in that tier, meaning no Emperor of This and That, or no being King of Italy and Burgundy. Ye shall however, hold all of these titles personally once they become titular for the added prestige.

Ye shall hand out all Duchy titles to members of your dynasty if you are not Muslim. Dynasty members automatically become allies, so even your minor vassals will have a large network of alliances with which to conquer outside of your territory and expand your realm. This happens without the added dangers of creating stronger vassals aka Kings. This doesn't work for Muslims because it will create a decadence spiral.

Because all Dukes in your realm are dynasty members, and only Dukes and children of the King or Emperor are eligible to be elected, and because you have one primary title with a single elective succession, no matter who wins the next election the player character will continue to be the highest title holder (King or Emperor) in the realm, and maintain his entire Demesne continuously.

Ye shall not worry anymore about who has claims to what. Pretenders to an imperial title are a joke when they only hold a single Duchy title vs your Imperial title with 10k+ retinues. Once your dynasty is big enough, distant relatives, denoted by the small blood drop on their portrait, should be your first choice when landing new conquests.

Ye shall only build Skirmish retinues and never the oft overestimated Cataphract, and certainly not the Heavy Cavalry retinue. These following two choices, although stronger in combat, neglect the primary benefit of retinues that all min/maxers use. This benefit is that your retinues, mercs, and levies all added up determines the current relative faction strength. Adding a Skirmish retinue adds 500 troops for 600 retinue cap usage, vs the same 500 troops for 1200 retinue cap usage with Heavy Cavalry. This will almost single handed prevent factions from becoming ""dangerous"". You can't lose wars you never have to fight. 

Building policy should focus on income improvement to the max possible through current tech first, and then militia training grounds then the other level 1 improvements first. This will increase your levy size as fast as possible and further reduce the possibility of a faction revolt.

Ye shall raise feudal taxes to low, and decrease feudal levies to minimum, creating several hundred gold in income per year for large empires. Your massive horde of Skirmish retinues and personal levies are more than enough to fight off foreign invaders at the Empire level.

Ye shall dump all military tech points into military organization to increase your retinue size, all cultural tech points into legalism to increase your desmesne and therefore levy size and to DECREASE the ever deadly short reign opinion penalty suffered from vassals, and all economy tech points into Castle Infrastructure once you have access to walls level 2 to increase your personal income and therefore indirectly your levy size through improvements.

Ye shall not land merchant republics outside of your de jure territory, unless you want a permanent independence faction member. You should make every effort to ensure your dynasty is the controlling patrician family.

Ye shall educate yon heir to be a high level diplo ruler for better relations, or stewardship ruler for greater demense and therefore levy size. Ye shall educate him by yourself even if you do not have the highest education traits because passing on traits like patient, charitable, and brave are far more important at +10 relations each than an additional +3-9 diplomacy or stewardship. All vassals shall be of the same religion and culture.

Ye shall educate the heirs of your strongest vassals, and send your children to be educated by your strongest vassals for opinion boosts all around.

Feasts and in particular hiring Mercs can be used as good last minute efforts to prevent a faction revolt from firing.

Finally, and most importantly, the Crown Authority of your highest title shall NEVER EVEN FOR A SINGLE DAY rise above Medium. After 1 day of High CA, most of the Dukes in your realm will switch away from Gavelkind succession to Primogeniture succession. Now instead of your Super Duke vassals naturally breaking apart on death when their 2 sons share their titles, all titles will pass to the oldest son, and the Super Dukedom continues.  This is another reason not to create Kingdoms, they also do not break up on death.

It may be worth abandoning an old empire title if you get the opportunity to usurp the Byzantine empire. It gives you access to Imperial Administration which gives tyranny free revocation of Duchies.  I believe you also get the opportunity to reform the empire and gain access to the imperial reconquest CB.

This all adds up to laws that constantly keep vassals weak and make you strong. Have fun, as I said, I go several hundred years without a faction using these techniques let alone having a faction revolt fire.


Edit: Religion Specific

Catholics should use free investiture for the + relations to vassals who own temple vassals.

Catholic Emperors (and Orthodox) should keep a vassalized pope in their pockets for guarantee excommunication of non dynasty member vassals for titles that slip out of your family's hold. Imprison/release constantly until a revolt happens to revoke titles infamy free.

Catholics and Orthodox may use Gavelkind at the large income producing stage of expanded empires. This will increase your demesne limit by +2 or +3 at that point. Extraneous heirs can be landed with newly built or holy warred temples to safeguard succession.

Zoroastrians should pursue the Saoshyant trait and ""divine"" marriages for more relations bonuses with vassals.

Unreformed pagans should marry old wives and then keep a barren wife for the stat bonus, but child rearing should be done with concubines, which can be discarded after a male heir is generated, also to protect the succession.  There are times when ""the ultimate solution"" for dealing with extra sons is justifed, meaning it is worth it to eat the penalty to imprison and execute sons sometimes.

Norse should spam raiding until the Viking trait is gained for more relations with vassals. I do not believe it is necessary to personally lead the troops.

Muslims should go on Hajj and observe Ramadan whenever possible to keep decadence down. You should also choose the Islam branch that helps reduce decadence. Male dynasty members should be assigned spots on the council to keep them from generating decadence, or imprisoned and executed if not.  Ruler design or chose a family that has the Sayyid trait for more relations.

Slavic, Romuva, Suomenskuo, and West African Pagans, and Jewish don't really have any bonuses useful for this purpose.

Which Argos already is and as they have way more than 150 stores in the Uk there is no point going after a share of their market.

When people buy jewellery,  they are investing in something or buying a present,  creating a memory. They want it to feel special and unique,  but also classic and timeless.  Your site should reflect this.

Even if people are looking for a good deal, they don't want to feel as though the goods are inferior or bad quality. The jewellery on this site looks good enough,  but there are some ways you could enhance it's appeal. I would suggest if you had the time, the resources and the budget,  a photoshoot displaying excellently lit, styled stills of the jewellery or even models wearing them would look good on a carousel across the top below the nav bar. Provide some context for the items, so people can visualise what it would be like to own them, themselves more clearly.

In terms of what you have so far the nav bar and logo are fine, but all of the boxes that form the main body are not working. They remind me of ads in the back of a newspaper. The red and white do not signal quality. They scream budget. I would stick to classic muted colours like white, grey / silver and an accent like teal or the paler maroon in the nav bar. Choose a classic serif font, to signal history and longevity.

I didn't see her again till I was 12. She picked me up, brought me to her boyfriends house. I remember it very vividly. 

She gave me a bowl of ice cream and told me that Bill was not my biological father and she was sorry that she left me with him and my younger brother(Bills biological son) in that house for so many years. My mother served in the Army in the late 80's, where she was taken advantage of after she consumed alcohol by soldiers at a party. 

I learned this some years later in middle school and high school. I took it very rough. I was very angry blamed her for many years for the childhood I missed out on. The feelings have changed over the years. When I was in school I was angry and saddened. Seeing fathers everywhere, At football games, groceries stores, fairs ect. I wanted to be that kid on top of dads shoulders, I wanted to be that son who was being taught things and cheered for at events. But now, after I put myself through collage, I just am happy for the person I made myself become. Now I wonder biologically what the other half of me is, is there a disease that runs in my family that I dont know about? Its really hard to this day when things tell me to put down my biological father, for schools, for joining the Navy, for the government, I just have to put John Doe.

 I no longer have hate in my heart for my mother, I just believe that it was brought about the wrong way, especially with the abandonment. I had a rough childhood, But I will be ready when the day comes to raise my children. I cannot wait for the day, so I can be that dad holding my child on top of my shoulders.

TRUE,TrowAvayYo,,,"I made a throwaway account to answer this question.

I was born near Sarajevo, Bosnia, in 1994. My mother was not religious, but ethnically Bosniak (Muslim). She was imprisoned in a former school that had been converted into a sort of rape camp. She became pregnant quickly and was intentionally held there for almost 7 months so it would be too late to get an abortion. They teased her saying now she will have a Serb baby. When she was let out, she tried to find a doctor who would provide an abortion, but none would because it would likely have killed her. She tried to do that herself too, but her parents caught her.

Growing up, I was raised by my grandparents. They moved to the United States, and I was always told that my parents died in the war, that my father was a soldier and my mother was killed when a shell hit her house. I only learned about 4-5 years ago what really happened, and that my mother is still alive and lives in Austria now. But she wants nothing to do with me, and she has completely cut my grandparents out of her life because I'm with them.

I don't find it hard to deal with. It is far removed from my life. Perhaps if we were still living in Europe, it would be different. I feel good knowing I'm still related to my family, that they are my real grandparents. I would like a chance to meet my mother and to try to show her that I'm a real person, and a good person. But I don't think it will happen.

At this point the best the United States can hope for is to support an Afghan government that can keep the country together after 2014 and convince the Taliban that it cannot win the war in any conceivable time frame. In my view, this will require the election of an Afghan president with some real leadership abilities, unlike Hamid Karzai. With good leadership and support from the United States and our NATO allies, anything is possible.

He stopped paying his rent and bills and my mother told him he'd have to move out if he couldn't get it together. He moved out, his mother helped him and some nasty words were said, and a week later he raped my mother. Now, the story gets a little hazy here: my mother claims she didn't have enough money for an abortion so she went through with the pregnancy. My birth father's mother claims that she offered to pay for the abortion but my mother refused. My birth father wanted the abortion to happen but he too didn't have any money. I have no clue which story is true but in hindsight all of them wanted to have the abortion. Really makes me feel great! (Despite all this, I am pro-choice. I just think it's a little bit mean to rub it in someone's face that you didn't want them to be born....the fetus is grown up and has feelings now, guys, and you're hurting them!).

17 years of dealing with an alcoholic mother (child abuse and neglect galore) I finally got out to live on my own. My mother would repeatedly beat me (hit me with her fists, throw me down stairs, close doors on me, etc) when I was a kid and I was in constant fear of her. She would also mentally abuse me. You know how some kids are raised ""brainwashed"" into religious cults? It was kind of like that for me but instead of religion, I was brainwashed into believing I'm a worthless piece of trash and will never amount to anything. Something my mother to this day tells me is ""You're not a product of love and therefore will never be loved."" Up until recently, that was true. I don't have many family members, never really had any super close friends, and didn't have a boyfriend or anything. To this day I'm still trying to learn what it feels like to be loved and it's very hard for me to accept the fact that it's possible for someone to love me or care about me.

I found out about how I was conceived at a very young age, I believe I was a toddler when my mother told me (I had asked questions about why I didn't have a daddy and she told me my good for nothing father was a rapist which made me a ""god damned bastard rape baby""). I didn't really understand the extent of the situation until I was older. My father wasn't in jail for more than a couple of years and my mother granted him visitation rights yet I didn't meet him until I was ~7 years old. It was really hard to be around him because he was a stranger and yet related to me and his brain injury made it hard to get through to him as well. He died in 2009 from a grand mal seizure. I've been in contact with his mother since I was about 11 years old, she has the point of view that pretty much my whole life is just a really big shame (""It's such a shame you were born"").

For anyone who's curious: I am now 23 and live alone with two cats, have a boyfriend, work at an esteemed institute of higher education, am almost finished getting my BA in communication and media, and consider myself to be pretty content with how things are. I suffer from anxiety, PTSD, and depression as a result of my childhood but am being treated and hopefully will be able to continue fighting off my demons.

The pain caused him to fire his weapon and miss the new leader but ended up killing his son. We had to escape but your husband was unable to run. Ultimately i had to leave him there. I'm sorry.

TRUE,employeeno5,,,"If you're going to invoke Ellsberg and the Pentagon Papers to suggest a lack of integrity on Snowden's part, then it should be noted that Daniel Ellsberg has stated that he supports Snowden in both his decision to leak the information, and his decision to flee, saying that if he were leaking the Pentagon papers today he would also consider fleeing. 

It is because the political and social climates towards this kind of action, and how we deal with whistleblowers on a legal level, have changed dramatically for the worse. This is not at all the country Pentagon Papers were leaked in. In that sense it speaks volumes about how much more our civil liberties, insistence on due process of law, and general attitudes about civic virtue and speaking truth to power have eroded since the Pentagon Papers, not Snowden's nor Ellsberg's character or specific methods. 

There are arguments to make against Snowden, but so much of the focus (in both media and official government talking-points) has been on making assumptions about his character/motives. I think that is embarrassing and lazy. It serves only to provide a more simple narrative, and distract from the very difficult issues of the substance of his leaks, and how such a leak should be dealt with.

TRUE,Jig813,,,"I recently designed a jewelry website (www.feltnoir.com), so I feel like I may be able to be of some assistance.

First things first, let's think about what you're selling here. Jewelry is a fairly high ticket item, so the site doesn't need to just be easy to use, it has got to instill a certain trust in your brand and convey a more sophisticated (not the most descriptive word, I know) vibe.

Generally, design elements that will help you achieve these aims will be simple, toned down colors, subtle typography and plenty of negative space (alexandani.com is a good reference). The fhinds site is rather busy and uses bright colors and loud typography. This isn't bad in itself--but good design is appropriate design.

Any issue I may have taken to the actual graphic elements used is fixable though, because I think the framework of the site is pretty nice. It's nothing special, but I think it's pretty logical and wouldn't need to be changed all that much to be usable.

Take this with a grain of salt (I know how hard this is, I just did it, and I know my design is far from perfect) but my advice would be to completely reboot the aesthetic of the site. Focus on toning down your color and typography choices and letting the pieces of jewelry speak for themselves by giving them breathing room. Lot's of negative space, simple sans serif type, and a subdued color palette will probably go a long way here.

Let me reiterate, this is by no means a bad site; however, I think you could improve it dramatically by making these changes.

TRUE,scoder,,,"I'm assuming you have a brother in a similar situation. If not and you're just curious, hopefully this helps someone else.

I used to be a horrible person, brother, and son/nephew (grew up with an aunt and uncle since the time I was 5 because my parents were addicts). I started drinking and doing drugs at 13, which made me an even worse person. By the time I was 22, I was kicked out for my heroin addiction and awful temper.  

I wound up in a homeless shelter and still attempted to dupe my family into taking me back, telling them I was a changed man after just one week. I had talked my aunt into allowing me back if I went to AA meetings, but once I got off the phone with her, I began having a change of heart. 

For the first time in my life, I tried not to blame the world for the shitty hand I was dealt as a child and looked at the things I had done wrong. I imagined the new types of hell I'd eventually cause if I moved back to my family's house and kept getting high. To be honest, I was incredibly tired of being addicted to drugs and crime, and being an overall shitty person who lied about everything. People may see that as living a life of ""not giving a fuck"", but it's emotionally and mentally taxing as long as you're not a complete sociopath. I wore a different mask to everyone, which made it difficult to differentiate between my opposite personalities. I constantly had to remember which stories I told which person in my life, and near the end, I had started to lose control of the manipulation.

Long story short, I didn't know who I was or what I wanted, I just knew that I was hurting a lot. So I made two more phone calls, one being to my aunt to tell her not to pick me up from the shelter, and the other to a rehab. 

That's when I truly began to pick myself apart and look at my own flaws. I no longer wanted to blame the world for my addiction or shitty personality, I wanted to start over with my life and become someone people and myself could understand and like. I went to rehab and paid attention on how to fix my life, how not to feel pressured by triggers, and how to make amends with the hundred or so people I had hurt in my life. At the end of rehab, I again found myself at the crossroads to go back to my aunt and uncle's house. I realized that my journey of reconstruction wasn't over, and I'd need more assistance in staying drug and crime free. So I went to a halfway house for three months, then moved into a sober house for about 8 months where I got a job and learned to live with constant temptation (sober houses in NY are filled with drug addicts just taking advantage of DSS). 

After that initial year, though, I felt that I was ready to move on from sober living. I was the brother/son/nephew that my family needed, I was clean, and I had reentered society without a single problem. It was time to either move back to my family in NJ or go somewhere else. So I decided that NJ wasn't really what I wanted to go back to and decided on Denver, where I've built up an awesome life over the past year. My family and I, although 1800 miles apart, have the best relationship we've ever had. Besides not being dead, it is the thing I'm most grateful for today.

Sorry for the long story, but people can change. Your brother will continue to do the things he does until he hits a breaking point. Either he gets really tired of how he's living, he becomes dirt broke or homeless, or is forced into jail/rehab. None of those things guarantee that he will find a better path, but the rock bottom feeling is the only way I've seen people get better. Without it, they cling to the ideas that their lifestyle is somewhat manageable or fixable. 

As someone who has been through it all, my best advice is to cut him off. Your entire family should kick him out, cut him off financially, and try to accelerate the process to rock bottom. Although it can risk complete estrangement, it has the possibility of saving his life.

They thought it would be a good first step towards independence, because the staff were only there to help them with transportation, medical supervision etc. my grandparents had high hopes that my mom would be able to live on her own one day.

A few months into her stay, she was raped by a male staff member. She did the right thing, called my gram in secret an hour or so after it happened. Gram called the cops, and got her to the ER. She was too shaken up to comply with the rape kit administration. 

Luckily, the cops didn't tell that to my father. His dumb ass admitted to it almost instantly because he figured they had DNA on him. He was in prison for probably, seven years? Seems low, but that's not a bad term served given how few years most rapists serve. He had the gall to write me a year ago, and asked to meet me and asked if I wanted to meet my half siblings. I took great pleasure in writing only the letters ""LOL"" on a piece of paper and mailing it back to him. Never heard from him again.

The authority to 'fast track' negotiate is specifically granted by Congress.

&gt;Fast-track negotiating authority is granted to the President by Congress.

Even after the deal has been negotiated it still must be approved by Congress.

&gt;Congress can approve or disapprove but cannot amend or filibuster.

And as you can see this is negotiating power that has been periodically granted to President's, by Congress, since the 1970's

&gt;was in effect pursuant to the Trade Act of 1974 from 1975 to 1994 and was restored in 2002 by the Trade Act of 2002. It expired for new agreements at midnight on July 1, 2007.

The point of fast track is to allow the President, any President, to negotiate deals in good faith without having to worry about politicized amendments or filibusters threatening the negotiations and impacting the United States ability to negotiate future deals.

Like any law Congress, the legislative branch, still must vote on the deal. The President still must work a deal that will gain a majority of votes in Congress, just like any law. There is no circumventing of the constitution.

And as far as the constitution and Presidential powers regarding Treaty Negotiation maybe you should give it a read.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_Clause

&gt;[The President] shall have Power, by and with Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators present concur...

In addition ...

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_Clause#Scope_of_presidential_powers

&gt;A sole-executive agreement can only be negotiated and entered into through the president's authority (1) in foreign policy, (2) as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, (3) from a prior act of Congress, or (4) from a prior treaty.[1] Agreements beyond these competencies must have the approval of Congress (for congressional-executive agreements) or the Senate (for treaties).

The President is simply acting as Congress's negotiating agent and is the 'sole author' of the legislation however, the deal cannot become law until approved by Congress. This executive power has been upheld by the SCOTUS going back to 1892

&gt;Although the nondelegation doctrine prevents Congress from delegating its legislative authority to the executive branch, Congress has allowed the executive to act as Congress's ""agent"" in trade negotiations, such as by setting tariffs, and, in the case of Trade Promotion Authority, by solely authoring the implementing legislation for trade agreements. The constitutionality of this delegation was upheld by the Supreme Court in Field v. Clark (1892).

'Sole Authorship' is no different than any bill written by someone outside of Congress, submitted, voted on, and if approved then sent to the President's desk for signature.

Yes fast track reduces the requirement from 2/3rds to a simple majority. As far as the rest of the points I will simple point you here ...

http://clinton2.nara.gov/Initiatives/FastTrack/work.html

&gt;In exchange for the expedited considerations of implementing legislation, Congress retains a central role before and during the negotiating processes and retains an equally important role in determining how to implement trade agreements. Requests for fast track have always included extensive notification and consultation requirements for the President with Congress and with private sector advisory committees. In every trade agreement negotiated under fast track, Congress has been an active participant in identifying negotiating objectives, monitoring the actual negotiations, and drafting implementation legislation.

.

&gt;Once the negotiations have been concluded and the President has signed it, the Congress and the Administration begin a period of extensive discussions on drafting legislation. This process, reflecting the growing complexity of trade agreements, has involved an increasing number of committees of jurisdiction and interested Congressional members. The President is required to spell out precisely how he intends to use his existing regulatory authority in implementing the agreement. Congress retains the right to vote down an agreement if, after consultation, it still finds the package unacceptable.

.

&gt;Additional Congressional prerogatives include special procedures for revoking fast track if the President fails to meet the consultation requirements. Where fast track authority has been granted with the possibility of an extension, either House retains the right to disapprove an extension provided either the House Ways or Means Committee or the Senate Finance Committee have reported out &amp;extension disapproval resolution.an Congress must be given advance notice of the President

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_track_%28trade%29#Procedure

&gt;If the President transmits a fast track trade agreement to Congress, then the majority leaders of the House and Senate or their designees must introduce the implementing bill submitted by the President on the first day on which their House is in session. (19 U.S.C. § 2191(c)(1).) Senators and Representatives may not amend the President’s bill, either in committee or in the Senate or House. (19 U.S.C. § 2191(d).) The committees to which the bill has been referred have 45 days after its introduction to report the bill, or be automatically discharged, and each House must vote within 15 days after the bill is reported or discharged. (19 U.S.C. § 2191(e)(1).)

&gt;In the likely case that the bill is a revenue bill (as tariffs are revenues), the bill must originate in the House (see U.S. Const., art I, sec. 7), and after the Senate received the House-passed bill, the Finance Committee would have another 15 days to report the bill or be discharged, and then the Senate would have another 15 days to pass the bill. (19 U.S.C. § 2191(e)(2).) On the House and Senate floors, each Body can debate the bill for no more than 20 hours, and thus Senators cannot filibuster the bill and it will pass with a simple majority vote. (19 U.S.C. § 2191(f)-(g).) Thus the entire Congressional consideration could take no longer than 90 days.

As you can see, Congress, and the relevant committees, still help craft, review, and approve the legislation.

With respect to criminal cases, no, there are none I regret winning and no one I worked with did either (admittedly, none of us handled anything as serious as a rape or murder - but the same logic would apply to those).

You don't regret winning a case, even when your client is completely, utterly guilty, because you represent them (i) for their own sake and (ii) to preserve the legal system.  Without defense attorneys to force prosecutors and police to prove their case, there would be no check on police/prosecutors arresting and convicting anyone they chose.  By representing guilty people you force the police to only arrest and the prosecutors to only prosecute at least nominally guilty people.  

The benefit of a vigorous defense, even of the guilty, is that it prevents arrests and prosecutions.

All of this is in addition to the moral imperative to defend the individual.  The byzantine workings of our court system prevent untrained people from defending themselves adequately, and the lawyers job is to 'sub' for that training by representing the person the way they would represent them self if they could.  

I believe it would be a far, far worse world where lawyers didn't represent the guilty.

TRUE,jabonko,,,"I ask them for clarification.  ""What exactly about libraries is it you are saying is obsolete?""  This usually helps them think about the issue a bit more and sets up a more constructive discussion by ""unpacking"" the word ""library.""

Are they talking about public libraries? Academic? special libraries? Business information repositories? Archives?  Sometimes these get lumped in with ""libraries"" and may change the nature of the discussion.

I work in an academic library, so when someone says that **Google will make libraries or librarians obsolete** I usually give them an example from a student I just helped.

For example: Johnny Student asked for information on the impact of anti-bullying initiatives in high schools.  On Google we'll find plenty of news stories - but would your professor let you write a paper based just on CNN or FOX news reports? probably not.  On Google you may find *citations* for scholarly articles on the topic, but are they going to be available for free? very unlikely.  Are you going to tell Johnny Student, with his student loans, tuition bills, and student-sized budget that he'll need to pay upwards of $40 per article he wants to read?

On top of that, I will add in that librarians play a *crucial* role in helping people figuring HOW to search and WHERE to search.  We also help people figure out how to interpret the results they get (slow reading v fast reading).  Often, I view my job as expectation management, because I often have to tell people that the information they *want* may not exist but the information they *need* can be found by [insert instructions].

When someone argues that **public libraries are obsolete** I ask them about their internet connection and access to computers.  Most of my friends are from a similar socioeconomic background to myself, so they've got internet and computers in their pockets (smart phones).  So I talk about the Digital Divide a bit, about how libraries helped thousands of job-hunters during the Great Recession of a few years ago, how they *still* help job-hunters today.

Another point I make about public libraries is that these are a **public space, a community place.**  I will highlight some of the events the local public libraries have: story time for kids, guest speakers (authors, experts, etc.), classes to teach people how to use computers, etc.

If someone says that **libraries are only for old people**, I will counter with information about the effectiveness of video game rentals in libraries, of having video game events in libraries, of creating ""maker spaces"" (as OP mentioned 3D printers), of creating after-school hangout spaces, of creating Safe Havens for individuals experiencing persecution (a fellow library school classmate set up an LGBT-friendly hangout space as a project), of promoting literacy in youth, etc.

Occasionally I will even mention the lobbying and activist type actions of librarians, library communities and the ALA.  Promoting awareness of banned books and censorship is *huge* when we consider how easily the internet can be taken away (consider the Arab Spring in which Egypt tried to limit internet access).  Consider that after the events of September 11, 2001, that libraries across the country *changed their policies on patron information collection in order to protect the privacy and civil liberties of the patrons they served*.

**Libraries will change, and may even change names, but they will never be obsolete**

Rapists are *integrated* into society and *know their victims*. This guy, mister wonderful (who is actually a rapist) could be the example that helps 20 people understand what rapists really are, how they really operate. These people are going around thinking that they don't know any rapists... *but they do*, and it would be better if they were aware of how well rapists can hide. 

Disclosure is highly personal and no victim should ever be pressured to disclose. But every single disclosure gets us closer to a society that has the skills to identify the traits of potential rapists *before* they actually rape anyone. So we shouldn't discount the benefit of disclosing rapists even after they die.

TRUE,paper_liger,,,"What sprang to mind when I read your question was the movie Full Metal Jacket. I remember clearly watching it in college and being just horrified by the verbal and physical abuse. I couldn't understand what would compel someone to take that and keep going. I'd heard the director had the cooperation of the military to produce it and couldn't believe that they'd let him get away with such a burning diatribe against military service. A couple years later after the death of my parents and bunch of other personal upheavals I ended up quitting art school and joining the Army for no reason in particular other than that it was some species of forward motion. So it goes. 

At the end of basic training (just a few days before 9/11 in fact) we all watched the same movie in our barracks while we cleaned firearms. It was a treat from the drill sergeants. Of course no one puts their hands on you in the modern military like they do in the film and the mental issues Pvt Pyle suffered through are still disturbing but most of the other stuff rang true. The difference was that now it came across as mostly just hilarious. The movie hadn't changed. I had. My perspective had expanded and would never shrink back to it's former size. 

After lengthy training I went to Iraq for the first time in the earliest days of the war. You can't explain combat, only experience it. It's literally awesome and awful. You are in awe of how fragile and at the same time how indestructible a human body can be and how strong men sometimes become weak and weak men show that their will is all the strength that they need. War I found is huge stretches of intense boredom punctuated by moments of sheer insanity. 

The physical and mental challenges are on a completely different level from most experiences in modern life. Arabic language school for me was like a finals week in college except stretched out over 63 weeks, plus drill sergeants and waking up at 530 every morning to go run several miles. There's a reason there is about a 60-70 percent fail out rate. And deployments were harder than that.

It's not a secret club, it's a vast gulf of experience between me and you. It doesn't make me better, but it does make me broader. There are plenty of shitbags in the military yes, but the more tests and trials you have to get through to be were you are the less shitbags manage to hang on. When you finally reach a place like I did where everyone had to pass basic training, then language training, then all sorts of other crazy training, plus jumping out of airplanes and chasing bad guys through the filthy streets and deserts on the other side of the planet the only shitbags left are highly functional shitbags. 

I have more in common with those people than I ever will have with you. I know what it means to go to war with someone at your side and trust your life to their reflexes and their diligence. It's similar to the way that growing up in deep poverty put a gulf of experiential difference between me and the average kid in America who'd never once gone to bed hungry or cold. I can describe war and poverty, but I can't make you feel it. That doesn't mean that I don't have civilian friends or friends from middle class backgrounds, just that I tend not to try to tell them about things that they have no frame of reference to appreciate. 

Not every person in the military did the dangerous things I did either. I have about as much in common with the typical REMF as I do with you. But we few, we struggle to relate to people who haven't suffered and burned in that fire. The things we experienced turn down the volume on the rest of life in a way.

I got out after five deployments when I found out my wife was pregnant and ended up being a stay at home dad. I have close friends who stayed in and are raising wonderful well loved kids despite constant deployments. The generalizations that OP is flinging around seem to be painted on with an awfully broad brush to me but I understand why they would think that way. 

The kind of father I am (and I consider myself a good one) is both informed and deformed by every choice I've made in life. My daughter has a better father because of the rough edges I had knocked off by war, but I realize that not everyone makes it out unscathed. But welcome to life. There are just as many neglected kids out there in the civilian world, it's just that their parents aren't so easily packaged into one neat box with such a convenient handle. Otherwise I suspect OP would be making an inane meme about them instead. ",0,1388771701,,0,1388776131,1,cegfdfq,t3_1ub640,t1_cegfdfq,t1_cegd1zp,1431783188,250,FALSE,AdviceAnimals,t5_2s7tt,250

TRUE,[deleted],,,"&gt; * ""God"" is Omnipotent &amp; Omniscient 

&gt; * God clearly puts great value in Free Will, 

Right off the bat, these two things negate each other. If an omniscient creator exists, Free Will is impossible, since nothing could ever happen differently from how he knew they would before even creating them, once they are created. If God chooses to create a universe where he knows I will become a sailor instead of creating a universe where he knows I will become a painter, it would be logically impossible for me to choose to become a painter after I am created. I could only do what he set the universe in motion knowing I'd do. Free Will is absolutely impossible when an omniscient being chooses what gets created, the life paths of which he has predetermined before even creating them.

But I'll continue anyway:

&gt;IF god were to let People who were just really good people but still had some evil in them, into heaven, He would either have to Negate the principle of free will and/or consequences, OR he would need to allow evil into heaven both of which he would refuse to do.

How would it violate free will? People could still freely choose to be generally good, then get into heaven. How would it negate consequences? Why can't God punish them for sins in Heaven? Why can't Heaven have a jail where people put in their deserved time like we do on Earth, then go free? And is there no free will in Heaven? Can people do evil when they're there, and if not, how are we not robots there?

&gt;In all honesty the whole Perfect human sacrifice for the atonement (removal of your sins) is kind of a cheap trick god made in order to let people into heaven without breaking either of those two rules. As long as you recognize that your not getting into heaven for free.

But I *am* getting into heaven for free. I did nothing during that ""sacrifice."" It is *given* to me, for free. I am not punished for my sins, because *somebody else was punished for me.* How is that justice? How does that follow any law of consequences?

&gt;God just kinda cheated and sacrificed something that no evil will ever be able to equate to.

Then why does evil keep us out of Heaven? Why isn't everyone saved regardless of their beliefs, regardless of their evil deeds, if no badness could ever overpower the ""sacrifice""?

&gt;If i mess up in my relationship in order to reestablish a balance i need to acknowledge that i messed up, and that messing up has consequences. then my spouse says, as long as you know what you did, ill take care of the consequences.

No, to be accurate to the God analogy, your spouse would want somebody else who is not you to be punished for what you did first.

* The *deuterocanon* - books (and sections of books) that are considered canon by Catholics and Orthodox, but not by Protestants. This would include 1 and 2 Maccabees, Tobit, the last few chapters of Daniel and Esther and a few others. 

If you've attended a few Catholic weddings or funerals, you might have heard readings from Tobit. For my money, it's the most novel-like book in the Old Testament. Great story. Has an angel in disguise in it, and a demon that's slaying all of a bride's new grooms on their wedding night. 

* *Enoch* - a book that's quoted in the New Testament, referenced in Genesis, but not part of the Catholic or Orthodox canon... *except* in Ethiopia's Coptic Orthodox Church. 

One of the interesting things about the Dead Sea Scrolls is that a copy of Enoch was found alongside canonical books, indicating that the community there (probably) held it in the same regard.

Enoch is slightly troubling to Christian theology because it tells the story of a man who is translated to Heaven (which kinda seems like Christ's turf). It also goes into details about the reasons for the Flood - a group of angels (Watchers) who wedded human women and fathered a race of giants (Nephilim). YHWH didn't like that, so washed the Earth clean. 

Note: just like there are a couple of books of Kings, Chronicles, and Maccabees, there are also a [couple of books of Enoch](http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/divinity/rt/otp/guestlectures/vanderkam/). 1 Enoch is divided into sections (also called ""books"" - the Book of Watchers, the Book of Parables and so on).

Zen is about approaching anything and everything with a specific point-of-view.  If you are really serious about your inquiry, a good place to start will be to start with Three Marks of Existence - Impermanence, Depend Origination/Emptiness and Un-satisfactoriness and apply it to anything and everything (including your own post).  Another way of looking at it is this - If everthing is Impermanent and Dependent on Other Things, Grasping or Clinging to something - an idea, a thing, a teaching, a goal, a story, a metahpor - as though it is Permanent is plain stupidity.  Grasping and Clinging are not-Zen.  Letting-go and Holding lightly are Zen.


1. The responses you get will be Un-satisfactory (no matter how you or the responder is earnest)
2. Goals are not fixed.  They keep changing (Impermanent) and depends for their very existence on Causes and Condtions. 
3. Grasping is futile because of (2) and will lead to (1).

Goals change temporally and spatially. Bachelors in Arts after 3 years or Kicking the ball right in to the Net past so many yards.  They are goals and they are also non-goals.  (You get the idea) So it is foolish to look for ""The"" Goal.  There is no such thing.  You are searching for something that doesn't exist.  If something keeps on changing and you want to Grasp it, then that leads to Un-Satisfactoriness and Suffering.  If things keep changing and you are still in 1900s then that lead to Delusion.

Goals depend on ""Causes and Conditions"".  For example, fighting against Apartheid in China is an absurd goal.  The Causes and Conditions for apartheid simply don't exist in China.  i.e., the Goal is itself dependent upon Causes-and-Condtions.

-----

When you understand three marks of existence and put it in to practice you will have a Zen experience every moment of your life.  

1. You will jump right in the stream (Learn the hard way)
2. Go with the flow (This is liberating for you See-For-Yourself the circumstances and adapt to it)
3. Don't grasp but let go of things (You are flexible)
4. Start working with your mind  (Minds move mountains)
5. Stop asking questions and see for yourself (No fixed answers and it cannot be given to you but figured out by you)

Here are some stories I picked for you that illustrate the above bulleted list.

From http://users.rider.edu/~suler/zenstory/noquestions.html

Upon meeting a Zen master at a social event, a psychiatrist decided to ask him a question that had been on his mind. ""Exactly how do you help people?"" he inquired.

A Taoist story tells of an old man who accidentally fell into the river rapids leading to a high and dangerous waterfall. Onlookers feared for his life. Miraculously, he came out alive and unharmed downstream at the bottom of the falls. People asked him how he managed to survive. ""I accommodated myself to the water, not the water to me. Without thinking, I allowed myself to be shaped by it. Plunging into the swirl, I came out with the swirl. This is how I survived.""

Some versions describe Confucius as witnessing this event. Also, in some versions, the old man explains how he has been jumping into the waterfall like this since he was a small boy.

After winning several archery contests, the young and rather boastful champion challenged a Zen master who was renowned for his skill as an archer. The young man demonstrated remarkable technical proficiency when he hit a distant bull's eye on his first try, and then split that arrow with his second shot. ""There,"" he said to the old man, ""see if you can match that!"" Undisturbed, the master did not draw his bow, but rather motioned for the young archer to follow him up the mountain. Curious about the old fellow's intentions, the champion followed him high into the mountain until they reached a deep chasm spanned by a rather flimsy and shaky log. Calmly stepping out onto the middle of the unsteady and certainly perilous bridge, the old master picked a far away tree as a target, drew his bow, and fired a clean, direct hit. ""Now it is your turn,"" he said as he gracefully stepped back onto the safe ground. Staring with terror into the seemingly bottomless and beckoning abyss, the young man could not force himself to step out onto the log, no less shoot at a target. ""You have much skill with your bow,"" the master said, sensing his challenger's predicament, ""but you have little skill with the mind that lets loose the shot.""

Two traveling monks reached a river where they met a young woman. Wary of the current, she asked if they could carry her across. One of the monks hesitated, but the other quickly picked her up onto his shoulders, transported her across the water, and put her down on the other bank. She thanked him and departed.

As the monks continued on their way, the one was brooding and preoccupied. Unable to hold his silence, he spoke out. ""Brother, our spiritual training teaches us to avoid any contact with women, but you picked that one up on your shoulders and carried her!""

""Brother,"" the second monk replied, ""I set her down on the other side, while you are still carrying her.""

Some versions of this story describe the monk as carrying the woman across a mud puddle.

The son of a master thief asked his father to teach him the secrets of the trade. The old thief agreed and that night took his son to burglarize a large house. While the family was asleep, he silently led his young apprentice into a room that contained a clothes closet. The father told his son to go into the closet to pick out some clothes. When he did, his father quickly shut the door and locked him in. Then he went back outside, knocked loudly on the front door, thereby waking the family, and quickly slipped away before anyone saw him. Hours later, his son returned home, bedraggled and exhausted. ""Father,"" he cried angrily, ""Why did you lock me in that closet? If I hadn't been made desperate by my fear of getting caught, I never would have escaped. It took all my ingenuity to get out!"" The old thief smiled. ""Son, you have had your first lesson in the art of burglary.""

I play a lot of Medusa, couple things:  
1. Assess your enemy lineup before considering Medusa. If there's a mana burning hero, chances are you don't want to pick Medusa, because her effectiveness is reduced. This is especially true against Nyx, because his entire skillset and window of opportunity antagonises Medusa.  
2. Do *not* rush a high-cost item without seeing what's going on or I will find you and punch you in the throat. This also applies to getting stats. Only get a Midas if you've missed, *maximum*, 8 last hits (two waves.) Remember the trifecta of early-game sustain: Wand, Boots, Drum. I love Drum on Medusa because she uses every stat and I swear to god it's so cost effective I might cry. If you're feeling unsafe and Timbersaw keeps gouging out your eyes with his sawblades (or another nuker is giving you gyp) I'd recommend brown boots &gt; band of giant strength &gt; bracer (interchangeable with BoGS) &gt; finishing treads &gt; finishing drum. If the game is going active **and you're on the recieving end** I will always recommend Treads over anything else, not only because of the tankiness from the +8 strength, but also because you switch treads to INT, throw snake at the ranged creep when enemies are close to it, switch treads back while snake is travelling - boom, free mana. Using this method you can also replenish your mana with lvl 2+ snake by finding either of the two Satyr camps. Phase if you're the aggressor, Arcanes if you're doing that weird bloodstone build that I really don't like but that I have 100% win-rate with over 10 games.  
3. **This point is the most important;** have vision. The enemy team will have what I call Meepo-Medusa Mania because these are the only two carries where the enemy team actively tries to shut you down. As such, if you're solo and a support isn't warding your jungle *AND* further up your lane, you buy the wards yourself. Do not complain about it, just do it. Don't overextend at all, tp to farm lanes, always have a TP. It's cliché, I know, but I say it for Medusa because most of your gold will be unreliable gold (unless you've been munching heroes with my patended build or have a Midas) and so you lose more when you die. It also helps to have a mid that creates space.

Whew, I hope that helped.

She took a deep breath of the refreshing salt air and smiled; the palace was nice enough, but there was little that could compare to that fresh scent of the ocean. It helped to take her mind off the stresses of state, if only for a little while. She allowed herself this brief mental respite, listening to the distant, plaintive call of the gulls.             
               
She glanced back at her retinue, following dutifully at a distance; her military adviser, her economic adviser, and the one responsible for her visit to the shores - her foreign adviser. Word had reached them of a shipwreck, discovered by one of her dromons and flying colors unknown to her lands. She had immediately set out to meet this person, against the advice of her military adviser - England's border was terribly close, and things had been strained since their last trade agreement had fallen through.            
              
Nevertheless, here she stood, watching as dutiful soldiers carried a ragged, gaunt figure to the shore. His skin and hair were fair, and his eyes blue, albeit a dull blue that perhaps once might have been handsome. Now, they only bespoke suffering.           
                 
""What is your name, good stranger?"" she asks, the man dropped to his knees on the shoreline, ""I am Theodora of Byzantium.""         
             
The man stares into the sand for a moment, and Theodora must strain to hear his words, ""Mit hjem er tabt. Hvor er jeg?""         
                 
Theodora's brow furrows; she was well versed in the languages of the continent from all her political dealings, but this was a language unlike any she'd heard before. Still, there was something about him...          
             
""Bring him,"" Theodora commanded the guards, ""We shall learn what he knows in time.""

Erik stood by the settee, his plate of fruit proffered to Theodora as she sat, reading through the economic reports of her empire. They were good, and only promised to be better with the upcoming banking system her money counters had developed. At the sound of footsteps, she looked up to see her foreign adviser walking quickly towards her seat.           
               
""My empress,"" she began, ""A caravel has just landed near Antioch. They appear to be an envoy from across the sea. The diplomat with them appears to have learned rudimentary Greek from trading with the city-states. He says they come on behalf of one named Pocatello...""          
             
Suddenly, a loud clatter interrupts causes the two to jump. Erik, white as a sheet, appears stricken. For a moment he remains transfixed before realizing his mistake, which caused color to rush back and turn his face bright red. Hurriedly he begins to clean up the mess he has made, muttering profuse apologies in his gutteral Greek that Theodora has come to enjoy...among other things.           
                
Returning to the issue at hand, Theodora turned to her adviser. ""Let them know I will receive them and begin introductions this evening.""        
              
With a bow, the adviser was gone. Theodora turned her eyes on Erik's svelt figure as he bent to collect the grapes that had scattered haphazardly about the throne room. She allowed herself a chuckle.            
                
""Erik, how can you be so clumsy with a plate when you are otherwise so dextrous? Did something the adviser said unnerve you?"" She looked closer and saw that he was shaking.            
                 
A long moment passed before Erik turned his blue eyes to meet the hazel of the Empress. ""Pocatello...my home..."" he muttered.            
                
Theodora wasn't laughing anymore. What happened to Harald's country was no concern of hers; she had never known them. But if this Pocatello was somehow involved in what happened...

#protip: lightly flood the surface and allow all the oil to absorb. repeat until the oil no longer absorbs into the surface. pour a bit of oil onto the board and spread it with clean, new sandpaper. 220-400 grit is best. add oil if the paper bogs and is hard to move. keep sanding while wet with mineral oil until the board is silky smooth. wipe with a paper towel and allow to dry. 



EDIT: [Added from a below post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/1uc47l/how_can_you_tell_if_mineral_oil_is_food_grade_i/cegwzbe)





wooden cutting boards die one of three deaths:

physical damage from cutting and chopping. this basically doesn't happen unless you're using a fireaxe on a half inch board. maybe if you're double-cleavering chinese style for 12 hours a day for a few years. 

warping and splitting. this is the most common cause of death. untreated wood, regardless of how thick it is and whether it's end-grain or not, absorbs moisture very quickly. in fact, end-grain wood absorbs moisture much more quickly. it expands when it gets wet and contracts as it dries. it dries unevenly (outside first) and this causes stress-fractures, warping, bowing, and cracking. every crack is more surface area for bacteria to multiply. this is a serious concern when regularly used for preparing meats, poultry, and fish. 

contamination. this isn't very common as you probably won't put anything on a board that you wouldn't eat, but untreated boards very easily pick up tastes and smells. food oils go rancid eventually, so getting some bacon grease on a cutting board will cause a funky smell and taste eventually. it may even make you sick. 

regularly oiling and sanding your boards addresses all of these problems to varying degrees. an oiled board is denser and stands up to abuse better than an untreated board. it heals minor cuts and, with maintenance, even moderately large cuts seal or fill. 

a well oiled board is much more resistant to moisture. boards treated as i mentioned above can be washed with soap and water as well as scrubbed with scotchbrite pads. bleach and other harsh chemicals should not be used. soap and scrubbing removes oil, so the more often you wash your boards, the more often you will need to treat them. non-meat boards can be effectively washed by lightly rinsing them or just wiping with a damp paper towel. meat boards should be washed in warm soapy water, rinsed, dried, and left to fully dry on a rack or leaned against a counter in a way that allows for maximum airflow. if the whole board is oiled and maintained it will pick up almost no moisture. 

a well oiled board will also not pick up flavors and odors nearly as readily as an untreated board. if you prep something that is very strongly flavored, like habaneros or a ripe cheese, just wash the board with soap and water. 

flooding the surface and reapplying until the wood will not accept any more is a standard technique for applying drying oils such as boiled linseed oil or tung oil. mineral oil applied the same way, but it does not dry. at least not noticeably on the timescale of a cutting board. the board will need to be reoiled because of use and abuse way before the oil dries. 

when initially oiling a board it's advisable to keep flooding it until it no longer absorbs oil, even after sitting for 24 hours. this ensures that the oil has penetrated as deeply as possible. 

sanding is not crucial but advantageous. it's aesthetically pleasing. it looks better and it feels better when you pass your hand across it. more importantly there are functional advantages. a smoother board has less surface area and is therefore less susceptible to bacterial growth. it's also less abrasive with fewer asperities and therefore more easily cleaned with less scrubbing. regularly reseasoning the board by flooding it with oil and sanding will also remove and seal small cuts and nicks with a mixture of wood and oil. 

you can tell a board needs to be reoiled if parts of it are lighter than others or it no longer looks a ""dull wet."" that is to say the way wood looks when it has absorbed moisture but is not shiny. assuming that you fully saturated the board in the first place, applying a touchup coat is as simple as putting on a dollop of mineral oil in the center and spreading it around with sandpaper. if the sandpaper gets bogged or is hard to move, add more oil. once the board is as smooth as you want, stop sanding and let the oil absorb for a few hours. come back and gently wipe off with a paper towel.

&gt; At their heart, TRP and the 'seduction' community are about one thing: getting laid.

As a member of the TRP community, please allow me to correct your misunderstanding.

TRP is based on the idea that what we're told about human sexuality, and specifically what sorts of behaviors are attractive to most women, is a lie. That's why the community is called, ""The Red Pill."" It's a reference to The Matrix in which people are living a lie, and taking the pill allows them to see the truth.

[Here's a great example of one such lie](http://freenortherner.wordpress.com/2013/10/18/one-more-condom-in-the-landfill/) - it's a post about a letter to an advice column. The advice that the young man is given is typical of the ""matrix lie"" that we're told all our life. He's basically told to ""just be himself"" - to just keep on keeping on.

TRP is the idea that the advice given by the columnist quoted above is BS. TRP is about the *theory* of human sexuality - it says, ""these sorts of behaviors are attractive; here's why."" The pickup/seduction communities are more about *practical* advice - ""do this, then do this."" Pickup and seduction are about getting laid. But TRP is about sexuality, and therefore TRP can indeed be used to get **and to keep** a girlfriend.

Here are some threads on the topic: [1](http://reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1tem6b/any_other_marriedltr_rp_guys_wanting_open_up/) and [2](http://reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1j9zbh/applying_trp_to_find_ltr_with_quality_women/)

&gt; TRP doesn't teach you how to attract women: it teaches you how to attract a very specific type of woman.

This is correct. We call that very specific type of woman: The Majority of Them

That said, nobody in either TRP or the PUA community will ever claim that there is some magical incantation that works on every girl. However, understanding the true principals of human sexuality absolutely will increase your chances, and it will help you keep the girl that you eventually get.

OP claims that he has had 0% success. You're telling him not to bother trying something because it isn't 100%. You know, no drug has a 100% success rate. It's like you're talking to a sick man and you're telling him not to take that medicine because it's not 100% guaranteed - no, just stay sick and in pain; just keep on suffering. You are really typical of the bad advice that men get all the time which *drives them to TRP*.

&gt; Believe it or not: women are people

Oh sarcasm! Can I give it a try? Believe it or not: men and women *are different*.

The fundamental problem here, and the reason for TRP's existence, is that men are consistently given bad advice by people like you, who offer nothing more helpful than, ""women are people."" Again, you drive people to TRP.

&gt; people don't like being demeaned, insulted, intimidated, or disrespected

This is a straw man of TRP.

&gt; do you really want anything to do with women like that: women who assume every male is a 'beta' milktoast loser until he proves otherwise by acting out?

Another straw man. Women don't assume anything of the kind, nor are they consciously dividing the world into alpha and beta. The truth is, women *feel* attraction to certain types of behaviors because, among our ancestors, those who exhibited the behaviors left more and healthier offspring.

&gt; The only reason shit like TRP gets any traction is that it plays into gender essentialist notions

Ha! I knew it. You're one of those people who thinks gender is a social construct!

You're wrong. I have mountains of scientific studies that prove you're wrong. Hell, you can cut open people's brains and see the differences! You can also take biological women, raised since birth as women, majored in feminist studies so that totally understand the issues *and they even agree with you* and you can change just one thing - you can administer testosterone, and they'll start acting like stereotypical males. Check out [act 2 of this episode of This American Life](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/220/testosterone) - it's all the proof that anyone will ever need that you're wrong.

The reason you believe this treacle about gender being a social construct is that it plays into a particular political philosophy that just happens to be popular right now. But because you believe it, you give men like OP really bad advice and you condemn him to a life of frustration and loneliness - *and you don't even care* - he's just a pawn in your bigoted social experiment.

&gt; This is the fundamental irony of TRP and all of the 'seduction' community': by putting up with girls that need to be 'neg'ed' and pursued aggressively to form attraction you're still playing their game. TRPers and PUAs deride 'beta' males who bend over backwards for women, but they're doing exactly the same thing.

There's a couple of straw man here. First, nobody talks about negging anymore because it became a red herring. It was never about insulting women. I'll explain more if anybody cares.

Secondly, what TRP derides are men who allow themselves to be taken advantage of. They're stupid.

When you learn the truth about human sexuality, you aren't ""still playing their game"" because it's not ""women's game"" - it's the game of our species. It's our mating dance, and both sexes have their own steps.

Once again, you're talking to a guy who is frustrated because he's been lied to about the mating dance, and you're suggesting that he not try to learn its steps. You have no empathy for this guy at all.

&gt; They're spending endless hours learning routines and tactics

Again, PUA is about routines and tactics. TRP is about the underlying theory.

&gt; that have roughly the same success rate as being a decent fucking person. 

Which logical fallacy is this? I always forget. You assume here that the two choices are, (1) TRP or (2) being a decent fucking person. ""Pick one because you can't be both!""

I reject your artificial binary. I proclaim that I am a decent person. I am always kind, considerate, and friendly.

&gt; Women are wise to this shit. The Game came out, like, 10 years ago. My wife knows all about 'negging' and 'demonstrating value' and 'closing' from Jezebel and Feministing.

Uh huh. Well, allow me to let you in on a little secret: the day that Jezebel of Feministing start publishing articles advising women to head down to the library and gather up the meek, studious men that will respect them and value them, TRP will disappear from the face of the Earth. \*poof\* gone. You guys win.

Instead, women bloggers (sorry, I don't have an example handy from jezebel) publish [advice like this](http://www.xojane.com/sex/9-dudes-to-do-before-you-die-i-mean-get-married) and as I keep telling you, guys like OP see that and they recognize on their own what's up. They see this pattern long before they stumble on TRP.

You're wife knows all about game, huh? But she's still attracted to very specific things unless she's an outlier. Plenty of women are ""wise to this shit"" and yet still say things like, ""ugh, I can't believe that creep tried game on me last night - BTW, I went home with those two hot bartenders! #crazynight #walkofshame #raisehell""

Remember [this blog that I linked to above](http://freenortherner.wordpress.com/2013/10/18/one-more-condom-in-the-landfill/)? Please read it. That's *why* TRP exists. Your jezebel and feministing and similar sites are telling women to go for a tiny minority of guys. OP is left out in the cold and being given the advice in that blog.

That's the issue you have to solve if you don't want people going to TRP.

&gt; you'll meet a person in the course of regular life that will mean so much more than hundreds of random hook-ups ever could. 

That is true. I mean, it's bad advice, but it's totally true.

OP, if you keep doing what you're doing, then you will ""in the course of regular life"" get a girl. You'll be about 35 - she may be a year or two older, and she'll see you not as a great catch but as a fallback option. She will reminisce about the hot guys she dated before you and the amazing experiences that she had - and she will never love you the same way. And I say this not as a criticism of her. It'll be your fault, because you are and always will be boring. You will never inspire the kind of raw animal lust that you fantasize about. You will waste your life and you'll always feel that something is missing.

**#7: How do I calculate my gain or loss?** *
Gain or loss is calculated first on each bitcoin transaction, then on an aggregate basis by combining all your gains and losses to produce a net figure.  Your tax preparation software will automatically perform these calculations, so the actual mechanics aren't really necessary for you to understand.  However, you'll have to know the basics in order to enter the correct information into the software. 

Basically, gain or loss is computed by taking the sales price of each bitcoin and subtracting its cost.  The technical terms are “amount realized” and “basis.”  Although simple in concept, determining amount realized and basis can be quite complex, as we’ll see below.  
 

*Edit:  A good tool for calculating your gain or loss in bitcoin transactions is available for free at www.bitcointaxes.info.*   


**#8: What is my Basis?**  

Generally, basis is equal to cost.  So, if you purchase 1 BTC for $500, then your basis is $500.  You can also add to this amount any acquisition costs like broker commissions or wire transfer fees.   So, let's assume a 1% fee and a $5 wire transfer fee.  This would mean your basis is $500 + $5 + $5 = $510.00.  If you later sell that bitcoin for $900, your gain would be [$900] - [$510] = [$390]. 


**#9: How do I determine my basis in each bitcoin?** *

If you’ve acquired bitcoins at different times and at different prices, determining basis can be quite complex.  This is because bitcoins are fungible.  Once a bitcoin is purchased, it becomes indistinguishable from the other bitcoins stored in the same wallet or account.  In a subsequent sale or exchange, there is no way to trace the cost or acquisition date of the bitcoin being transferred out.  
 
Contrary to what you might have heard, it is not acceptable to arbitrarily choose the bitcoin with the highest cost or most preferable tax impact.  The IRS requires you to use a system with rules that will produce a reasonable and consistent result.   The default system (and the one generally preferred by the IRS) is to assume that your bitcoins are sold in the order they were acquired.  Thus, the first bitcoin you purchase is assumed to be first bitcoin you sell.  This is called the FIFO method (""First in, First Out"").   

There are some other methods available, such as LIFO (""Last In, First Out"") and Average Cost Basis, but it’s not clear if bitcoins are eligible for these alternatives.   So, I would caution against using any system other than FIFO without guidance from a tax advisor or instructions from the IRS.  ~~Note: If bitcoins are classified as a foreign currency, then it becomes possible to use any method you want, as long as the chosen method is reasonable, you use it year-to-year, and it does not always give you the bitcoin with the highest cost available.  As discussed below, it is still uncertain whether bitcoins can qualify as a foreign currency, so again I must urge caution in deciding to take this position.~~ *Edit:  IRS Notice 2014-21 clarified that bitcoins are not a foreign currency for income tax purposes.*
 
I'll note that it's theoretically possible to avoid this problem altogether if you keep each and every bitcoin purchase in separate wallets or accounts.  This would allow you to trace the actual cost of each bitcoin you later sell or exchange, alleviating the need for the FIFO (or alternative) method.        
 
Either way, determining cost will require some detailed record keeping.  I will discuss record keeping in more detail below, but remember that the burden to prove basis is on you.  The IRS will not give you the benefit of the doubt here.  If you cannot prove the cost of each bitcoin, they will assume it was $0.  Obviously you don't want that to happen, so keep good records of your bitcoin purchases. 


**#10: What if I mined my bitcoins, what is my basis then?**
 
IRS Notice 2014-21 clarifies the treatment for bitcoin miners.  Specifically, miners must recognize income for each bitcoin mined during the taxable year.  The amount of income is equal to the market price of bitcoin on the day it is awarded on the blockchain.  This also becomes the miner's basis in the bitcoin going forward and will be used to calculate gain/loss in the future when the bitcoin is sold.  

For example, assume you mine 1 bitcoin in 2013.  On the day it was mined, the market price of bitcoin was $1,000.  You have $1,000 of taxable income in 2013.  Going forward, your basis in the bitcoin is $1,000.  If you later sell the bitcoin for $1,200, you have a taxable gain of $1,200 - $1,000 = $200.  See below for the character of this gain. 

You mining expenses, such as electricity, would not be included into basis.  Instead, they would be deductible in the taxable year as an expense.  Miners will need to determine if their mining activity rises to the level of a trade or business, which is a highly factual determination. 

~~This is a very difficult question to answer with any degree of certainty.  The problem is that bitcoin mining is a completely unique activity that yields an even more unique  product.   To reach an answer, one must resolve some difficult tax issues.  Namely, what is bitcoin mining and how do we classify the bitcoins it produces?~~  

~~Unfortunately, addressing these two issues would be a lengthy and detailed post in itself, so I cannot fully address them here.   Suffice it to say that bitcoin miners will need a very competent tax advisor to make sure their gains are properly reported.~~

~~Not to leave you without any guidance whatsoever, the answer will most likely depend on the size and scope of your mining activity.  Large scale miners should probably treat themselves as a manufacturing business, and the bitcoins they produce as inventory held for sale to customers.  Such bitcoin miners would not determine their gains in the same manner as normal investors.  They would compute income at the end of the year by figuring their  total sales and then subtracting ""cost of goods sold.""  The latter would take into account the cost of producing bitcoins, such as electricity.  Other expenses, like depreciation on the mining rig, would presumably be deductible as an ordinary business expenses.  Obviously this implicates some complex accounting rules that are far beyond this post.  A tax advisor with some knowledge of these rules would be needed to accurately determine your tax liability.~~  
 
~~Smaller mining operations  can probably get away with treating their mining as an ""activity for the production of income,"" as opposed to a manufacturing business.  In such a case, they would follow the same rules for determining gain or loss as normal investors.  I suspect their basis in this case would be determined by allocating their mining costs on a pro rata basis, assuming they can reasonably track and allocate such expenses (like electricity).   The safest and most conservative approach, on the other hand, would be to use a basis of zero.   Depreciation and other indirect expenses would likely be deductible as an itemized expense, similar to a general investor (see below).~~  

~~I must emphasize that neither of these treatments is a perfect fit.  I expect different tax advisors to reach different conclusions on the correct treatment.  The goal in any case is to use the best method of matching income to expenses, whatever that is.  Presumably the IRS will respect your chosen method as long as you can convincingly argue that it is the best at accomplishing this goal.~~    
 

**#11: What if I received my bitcoins as payment, what is my basis then?** 

If you sell goods or services and accept bitcoin as payment, your basis in those bitcoins is equal their fair market value at the time they were received.  Generally, this is determined by reference to the average market price on that day.  Thus, if you wrote a software program for someone and received 1 BTC as payment on November 1st, your basis in those bitcoins is equal to the average price of 1 BTC on that day.  

The choice of which exchange to use for this purpose (e.g. Mt. Gox, Bitstamp, etc.) is up to you.  Whichever exchange you choose,  you should have a reasonable explanation for your choice.  You should also stick with that choice when computing your gains in the future.    Arbitrarily picking exchange prices that best suit your tax interests will not be acceptable to the IRS in a subsequent audit. 

**#12: What if I received my bitcoins as a gift, what is my basis then?** *
It depends.  Generally, you inherit the basis of anything given to you as a gift.  This means you would take the same basis as the friend who gave you the bitcoins.  However, an important exception applies if the friend’s basis was more than the market value of the bitcoins at the time of the gift (i.e. the bitcoins had a built in loss).

In that case, you would wait to determine your basis until you sell or exchange the gifted bitcoins in the future.   When the time comes, you would use the following rules: 

* First, calculate your gain/loss using your friend’s basis.  

* If this results in a gain, then the default rule applies and nothing changes.     

* If this results in a loss, however, then you do not inherit your friend’s basis.  Instead, you must use the market value of the bitcoins on the date of the gift and recalculate your gains/loss.   

* After recalculating, you must check if you still have a loss.  If yes, then proceed with using the market value as your basis.  However, if the recalculation results in a gain, then the tax law says to ignore the gain and report nothing.  To be clear, you have no gain or loss in this situation.  

Now that last point might confuse many readers, so here is an example to demonstrate.   Assume you received bitcoins worth $750 at the time of the gift.  Your friend’s basis was $1000.  This triggers the exception discussed above and you have to wait until you sell the bitcoins in the future to determine your basis.  Consider three alternative sale prices: 

* Sale Price = $1200.  Using your friend’s basis of $1000, this creates a gain of $200.  Therefore, you inherit your friend’s basis and have a realized gain of $200.  No problem.  

* Sales Price = $600.  Using your friend’s basis of $1000, this creates a loss of $400.  Therefore, you cannot inherit your friend’s basis.   Instead, you must use the value of the bitcoins on the date of the gift, which was $750.  Therefore, you have a loss of $150.  No Problem.  

* Sales Price of $900.  Using your friend’s basis of $1000, this creates a loss of $100.  Therefore, you cannot use your friend’s basis.  Instead, you must recalculate your gain/loss using the value of bitcoin on the date of the gift.  Now you have a gain of $150.  Therefore, you disregard the sale and have no gain or loss to report.  

This is a perplexing tax treatment.  It might help to think of this rule as preventing your friend from shifting bitcoin losses to your tax return.  This is why you get to inherit his basis only if it would create a gain on the subsequent sale.  If not, then the amount of his loss is extinguished and you get to recognize only the amount of loss that accrued after the gift occurred.  This also explains why you would have no gain or loss if the market price of bitcoin has increased since the time of the gift but is still less than your friend’s original basis.    

In any case, when receiving bitcoins as a gift, make sure to ask the person what his or her basis was in the bitcoin, as well as their acquisition date (which you always inherit).   Lastly, write down the date of the gift and the market price of bitcoins on that day.  

~~#12:~~ **#13: How do I determine  Amount Realized (i.e. Sales Price)?** 

This depends on the transaction and if you sold bitcoins for cash or exchanged them for goods/services.  

In the case of a sale, amount realized is equal to sales price, less any selling costs you incur in the transaction (like commissions or wire transfer fees).  So, if you sell a bitcoin for $900 and incur a 1% transaction fee, your amount realized is $900 - $9 = $891.00.  

If you exchanged bitcoins for goods or services (instead of selling them), then amount realized is more complicated.  This is essentially a barter transaction, where the default rule is to use the fair market value of the goods or services received in the exchange.  For example, if you purchased a laptop on November 29th with bitcoins, your amount realized would be equal to the Fair Market Value of the laptop on that date.  The easiest way to determine Fair Market Value is by reference to the sales price, although an alternative method can be used if yields a more accurate value.  

Presumably, the sales price of most goods or services will be denominated in dollars (even though payment is made in bitcoin).  Thus, if the laptop's price was $1,500, you can safely assume that it's FMV was also $1,500. If the sales price is denominated in bitcoin (instead of dollars), you'll have to convert it into dollars using the average exchange price on that day.  As mentioned above, the choice of which exchange to use for this purpose (e.g. Mt. Gox, Bitstamp, etc.) is up to you.  The most conservative option would be to use the price from the exchange that you purchased the bitcoin in the first place.  Whichever exchange you choose,  you should have a reasonable explanation for your choice.  You should also stick with that choice when computing your gains in the future.    Arbitrarily picking exchange prices that best suit your tax interests will not be acceptable to the IRS in a subsequent audit. 


**TL; DR:** Gain is determined by subtracting basis from amount realized.  Basis is generally equal to cost, but special rules must be followed (such as FIFO) if your bitcoins are mixed together.  Amount realized is generally equal to sales price.  If goods or property were received instead of cash, then amount realized is equal to the FMV of the property received.

Suprisingly, the most troubling aspect is the shock, the defeated expectations - the realization of another shitty thing to worry about, the need to rethink your outlook - which will be a less optimistic one the more you know. It's like getting ensurance/warranty for something and finding out it's useless - you just have to be more selective.

It's actually in society's best interest for men to be blissfully unaware of how women actually conduct themselves. This way men can work and be  productive members of society without all those extra sources of stress. Women embraced it since a good image is crucial to their social succes.

The thing is most RP theory is nothing new and revolutionary, these things were known hundreds of years ago, just read some philosophy. The only thing that changed in the last couple of decades is the social discourse, in the last 50 or so years postmodernist blowhards have been endlessly pushing down society's throats that women are special bastions of all that's good and fair in the world and men are dumb animals that need to be less *themselves*.

**That's why the answer is nothing new either. All the naive bullshit has done is to shift your mentality from individuality and self-validation, to woman-centric view and dependent on outside validation (women - through sex).**

**As long as the most important parts of your life aren't centered around women (and their loyalty), then the damage will be minimal - if it goes bad.**

**If possible, don't get married, don't cohabitate, build a vast social circle, with a couple of really close friends (the type that you can really depend on), have fulfilling hobbies/interest and a dream in life (not just professionally). Attain wealth and power if you can (but don't consume every second of your life trying)**

If you really want a LTR/marriage situation, learn to pick up on red flags...even pink flags, small things get more annoying after 10 years together. Read a lot of material on psychology and behavioural science, learn to be an excellent judge of character. 

**Test potential mates, it's not manipulative to find out who you're spending the rest of your days with - ignore the shaming caused by this - low quality women hate being vetted, it makes them doubt their (over-inflated ) worth. If a woman gets angry for something she does herself (testing you) she's not LTR material.**

**Tests:**

* **Sympathy tests** - great for avoiding alpha fucks beta bux - women generally lack (beyond superficial levels) the ability to  care for anything that does not affect themselves (or their children). So fake a personal issue that affects you (and not at all her) deeply, see if her instinct is to support you and care for you. If she shows indifference/repulsion/pretends to care - either means your value in her eyes is not high enough - in which case hypergamy will be ruthless to you, or she lacks the ability to pair bond (bad at LTRs)

* **Loyalty tests** - she mentioned/showed signs that she considers someone you know attractive ? Have him hit on her (or any equivalents), see how she reacts - does she shut him down? does she respond in a non-decisive way ? does she tell you about it?. A woman who clearly respects her man is a woman with a higher ability to control her hypergamy.

* **Compliance tests** - make a couple of irrational demands (not illegal) with conviction, making sure she understands how important those requests (you made of her) are to you. She asks why, you tell her **""because it's important to me""**. The more argumentative a woman is over big things, the higher chance of her being argumentative/combative over the small things once that ""harder to leave"" contract is signed (marriage). Any woman worth spending your life with will gladly submit/self-sacrifice a bit to show her commitment to you.

* **Hypergamy tests** - purposefully act like a beta for a couple of weeks, be indecisive, follow her around the house, ask for her approval/validation, be emotional and reactive, supplicate and pedestilize her - flowers and gifts and all that jazz. A quality woman will tell you (first in a covert way then in an over way) that your behaviour is a turn-off, and she'll give you time to bounce back before reacting accordingly to your new self. If the sex stops suddenly and she gets cold/distant, that woman's attraction (and respect) for your is fragile - most likely the type of woman who will never stop shit testing you - very hypergamous types.

**Also look for good habits, like having a healthy lifestyle (diet and exercise), a great relationship with her father (in general with her family), low prevalence of sex outside of relationships  -&gt; higher chance to pair bond.**

**Red Flags - character**

* any signs of a  disorder - eating/[personality disorders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality_disorder) - learn to recognize them.

* arrogant

* argumentative - it's gets old real fast.

* bitchyness - it's not cute, and it does not mean she's just opinionated.

* feminist

* ""sex positive"" - rebranding of the word slut

* victim (abuse)  - you don't need all that trauma hanging over your happyness - pick a happy and balanced partner.

**Red Flags - past**

* party girl 

* relationships with criminals  - she's heavily into bad boys, and you'll never be as bad without breaking some laws.

* single mom - just common sense - why sign up for extra baggage and beta bux.

* split-roasted/gangbanged - she's just not the ""brunch with hubby"" type.

* unfeminine/large tatoos - sign of a past that includes the above


**Red flags - behaviour**

* excessive attention seeking - especially male attention

* excessive social network use - sign of the above

* emotional eating - chances of getting fat come wall.

* keeps in touch with exes - hypergamous 

* keeps orbiters beyond 6 months into the relationship - hypergamous + lack of respect.

* uses sex as a reward/currency - deems you low value (or just beta bux)

* tries to guilt you into spending less time/cutting ties with your friends - classic cunt.

* nagging - it can only get worse once married

* overly eager to give you sex  - if you get a weird vibe, like she's trying fake a ultra high sex drive - standard beta bait for marriage - pretty much any time she seems to have sex with your for anything other than sex/intimacy it's a bad sign.

**Red Flags - social circle** 

* party girls / ex party girls - needs no explanation

* divorced women - there was a study posted around here - in short- divorced women praise other women who get divorced (self-validation ahoy)

* mostly male friends (withhout having male interests/profession) - hypergamy/need for male attention.

* lack of female friends - women can spot a bad seed - and shun it.

* radical feminists/social justice types - if she's attractive this won't be the case, but if it is, she's probably some sort of crazy/messed up.

The scene with the low level Irish guys in the warehouse... In the scene Archer (aside from the homicidal tendencies) has exactly the same outlook and humour that my friend had (""I'm going to do everything in my power to beat this thing,"" that kind of attitude).

TRUE,hurrrppp,,,"Got herpes 3.5 years ago from my ex-bf at the start of our relationship. Hadn't slept with anyone for a year prior and had gotten the blood test during that time and was negative for hsv-2 then. So I definitely know the source. 

We always had used condoms. One night, we had really passionate sex that involved a lot of grinding. Started feeling off down there and noticed a lot of clear, odorless discharge over the next week. Things became really painful and it hurt to pee. 

Went to the doctor who took one look and confirmed Yep, herpes. I'm lucky to have had a compassionate nurse practitioner who was kind about it, I've since met others whose doctor treated them coldly and slut-shamed them for being there.

Peeing, shitting, walking around, sitting down, and pretty much everything else were very painful for the next 3 weeks even though I immediately started talking antivirals (which control the symptoms but obviously don't cure the virus). Bumps didn't look nearly as bad as they felt. I continue to get fairly frequent, painful outbreaks to this day and stress is a big trigger. 

My boyfriend had always been asymptomatic and had no idea he had it. He got the blood test after my outbreak and it came back positive. Run-of-The-mill tests do not look for herpes by the way.

We were together until about 6 months ago. Dating with it has sucked. I've always been honest about having it because there is no other way. I did get rejected for it by someone I really liked. 

After a bit, I realized that I only wanted to date others with herpes anyway because I am very paranoid about giving it to someone. Have tried a herpes dating website with little success so far. Sort of giving up on dating for now. 

It's weird, I'm an attractive young woman and it's kind of a mindfuck when guys are into me and I know there's a good chance that they will do a complete 180 if I tell them. Casual stuff is off the table. 

I always remind myself that people have worse problems, though. And at least I can afford the medication, heard shitty stories about people who cannot. 

TL; DR got it from an ex-boyfriend, was pretty bad though the worst part is the stigma and not the physical pain. Haven't given it to anyone else.

TRUE,Plaptor,,,"I was a child of rape, but not by my father's fault.

My dad married my mom in the late 80s, and she already had two children, to which she was already abusive to. My dad also suffered from the abuse, mostly emotional, but it would get physical, as well, with all of us. She held me up against a wall by my throat in third grade because I forgot my math homework once. I remember growing up she had shoved my dad, and he pushed her away in self defense (my dad is/was a BIG guy, and former military; I believe he only let the abuse continue because she broke his spirit) and she fell against a wall, ""hurting her elbow"" and whined she would call the police on him. He ended up turning himself in, and nothing happened as a result. Both my half siblings had ran away from home before I was five, so I grew up mostly as an only-child. Once, when she was with her first husband (who was an alcoholic), she had called her sister/brother in law, broke a wine glass in the background and told them that he was beating her. When they went to help her, they discovered she had actually poorly put fireplace soot on her face to look like a bruise, and that her husband was passed out in the bathroom by himself for the last several hours. He had never touched her.

My mom would kick my dad out of the house for a few weeks only to beg him to come back. When he was gone, she would take the credit card (in his name) and purposefully buy everything she could to rack up his debt. He finally stopped moving back in when I was about 14, where he stayed at a family members', and I could still talk to him. Although, everytime I did, mom would hound me about what happened and what he said and if I would spy on him for her.

That day, at 14, I sat in his lap crying when he said he wouldn't be back in the house for a long time. He grabbed my hand and compared it to is. We both have very square palms, and he pointed it out. It was how he knew I resembled him. It was the first time, and the last, I ever saw him cry. I remember this very vividly. He kissed my forehead and said, ""The only reason I ever stuck around was because of you."" There were a lot of tears, and I still get a bit dewy eyed. Both my dad and I are very reserved and emotionally silent people, and we rarely, if at all, talk about how we feel/have felt. It's hard for us to do. So the day he said that was a very deep and profound moment in our relationship. If we ever have a ""moment,"" he will still grab my hand and look at it and compare it to his.

I didn't understand how far the abuse went with him until I was older. Mom had told me several times in my lifetime (almost became habitual) that I was worth nothing, I was a flake, I shouldn't have finished high school, et cetera. She told me my only purpose to having me was to keep dad around, multiple times. She used to lock me in my room so that I wouldn't hear/witness her berating him (she wanted HIM to be the bad guy, always), but I always could. She would say things like ""You don't have a sack"" or things like, ""your dick never did work, never will, because you're useless, you aren't a man,"" et cetera. Upon maturing, and talking to my dad's current girlfriend (who is also a former therapist, but they were NOT patient/doctor) that my mom forced my dad into sex to become pregnant with me, which she knew would keep him around (as he was trying to leave her) and it worked.

The divorce was finalized early in 2013, after I turned 21, and after years of my mom refusing to sign papers or changing her mind. He is stuck with the debt that she piled up. I live with him and his girlfriend. Because of the abuse he had, he doesn't sleep in the same room as her. After talking to her, I learned they've never even had sex, even though they've been living together for a year and a half and dating for two. She moved from Indiana to Oklahoma to be with him. It's mostly companionship that they share. But he loves her. I know he does. I see it in his eyes, and I've never seen him love someone before.

Growing up that way has also shaped how I make relationships with people - I fear marriage, conception, and the entire idea of settling down with anyone feels threatening and scary. I was always happiest when I was single, though that has recently begun to change.

I always had a really great relationship with my dad. He was there where mom wasn't - when I expressed interest in softball, he took time off work to take coaching classes and helped me to competative. Mom showed up to one game and before it started she asked if she could go home. He ALWAYS showed interest in what I loved. I remember that when I got super into pokemon, he poured money into the cards and would play with me. He even took me to the Top Deck nearby, where if you win games you got stamps towards a badge, and he would always put his stamps in my book (I wasn't very good, so I lost a lot :P). He did this with everything - magic, dnd, sports, books, video games. He was really the only reason I got to where I am today. I only figured it out within the last couple months what had really happened. 

At 17 I moved in with dad. I graduated HS with a high GPA, got a full scholarship (but didn't finish college - I found a full time job I am happy with), I had some writings published in a local magazine during highschool, I got offered a lot of money for some artwork, I got promoted at my job a few times stupidly fast, and I'm saving up for an appartment with my boyfriend, who is awesome. And yeah, we'll be having seperate rooms, but that's because I like to have my space, and he does to. I'm not closed off sexually, like my dad, so our sex life is awesome; half my blog is about sex. But I still have some of his habits. 

So fuck you mom. I grew up and got awesome and I like awesome things, and dad's happy and is still awesome, and has an awesome girlfriend that calls me Sweet Pea or Mouse, and she got me an eeyore feetie pajama suit that I wear ALL THE TIME 'CAUSE FUCKIN AWESOME, and she got me a leather bound Sherlock Holmes set for christmas, BECAUSE SHE KNOWS IT'S MY FAVORITE BOOK, and you're still a loser, and none of your kids or grand kids like to talk to you because you literally ruin everything you touch, and you don't give a shit about anything but yourself. GLHF

**TLDR: Mom raped my father, who stayed around for twenty years to ensure I had a happy life. Dad's awesome with an awesome girlfriend. I love him.**

TRUE,heybrochillout,,,"To be honest, the problem with TRP is the angry young men, who feel betrayed by the world. When you have lots of angry young men around one place shit tends to go down. To simplify it a bit, the whole philosophy is just being a man in the traditional sense. Having a character. Being confident and independent man. It's really nothing revolutionary.

Except it is for these guys. Most of the guys there are the bit socially awkward nice guys who wrote a poem to the pretty girl from your highschool class. They haven't been succesful. I'm not saying that writing poems never works, but it sure as fuck doesn't work for the guys at TRP. 

They are the guys who always asked the girl what does she want to do, what does she want to eat, always asking without ever catching on that they didn't care that much, as long as it was with them. Being bombarded with questions gets old really fucking quick, and then their relations ended in various ways. And then there comes the broken hearts and questioning oneself why did they get dumped? He was so good for her!

They are the guys who tried to attract the girl they had a crush on for years by being nice and good friend. They didn't see that they were forming a good friendship while her romantical interests were aimed at other guys basically the whole time. It's not like she or their friends hadn't probably catched on, but she simply didn't want to ruin a good friendship and drive away a nice guy she wasn't interested at. And as a bonus it's pretty nice to have a minion who does whatever you say. ""We should just be friends, I don't want to ruin our friendship!"" She would say after he finally gathered the courage to confess his obvious feelings.

And then the nice guys get angry at the world. They deserve to get the girls they borderline stalked for years. They should bath in pussy because they're so great guys. I mean they were told to be like that. In the stories they heard as a child the good guy got the princess. In the tv the good guy won. In the movies the good guy got the girl. And then they catch on that those were mere fantasies of the good guys writing the stories.

Somehow they end up finding the red pill. Finally something seems to be in line with their own experiences. ""Holy shit!"" they go, I want to know more! They bleed their hearts out and tell all their worst stories about women, and the likeminded reply with their own. People who don't agree with their opinions get banned and posts deleted, the ones that don't end up downvoted by the hivemind. An echo chamber forms where likeminded people are chanting their own beliefs louder and louder, and as a result it confirms their beliefs more and more. They get immersed in their own TRP world, read more and then contribute with their new views. It's a vicious circle.


The problem isn't about the base philosophy of being a man and having some fucking character to yourself. The problem is that some of those guys are fucking obnoxious. They go and replace ""nice"" with ""arrogant"" and have some minor success with that, and then they believe they have cracked the fucking code.

Edit again: Someone below posted some good advice which was let go of your stuff if it's too dangerous to get it back. Your and maybe your children's safety is more important. Dealing with a pet in these times is particularly difficult. Try to find someone willing to take it in because some abusers will kill pets or use threats to a pet's safety to lure you back.

The comment above is well written and internally coherent, which makes it persuasive in a debate. It is also almost pure bullshit. To keep this from becoming too long, I'll stick to one example. 

&gt;Hell, you can cut open people's brains and see the differences!

In reality, there are statistically detectable differences between male and female brains. Same holds for psychology. But ""statistically"" is the operative word. And correlation levels are... poor. I'll use a little bit of math. If you aren't fond of maths, don't worry - it's very little indeed, and easy to understand if you go along with it. 

Let's say that ""studies show"" that an ""average"" woman is different from an ""average"" man in characteristics X, Y, Z. More precisely, a woman is 12% more likely to be X, 15% more likely to be Y, and 28% more likely to be Z. 

TheRedPill approach is based on this kind of correlation - ""women are XYZ, men are not."" And they will pull up studies that show such, and they will then insist that their views are ""scientific."" 

However, what happens when you meet an actual woman? Multiply the probabilities: 0.12 x 0.15 x 0.28 = 0.005. This tells you that the woman you just met has about 0.5% chance (five in a thousand) of actually being ""more XYZ"" than the average man.  

Then ask yourself: how do you compare to that average man? ""Women are more emotional?"" Even if the average woman is more emotional than the average man (and that is debatable), have you ever objectively measured your ""emotionality"" (however you define that word)? Yes, you think you are super rational - but that is what we call ""self-reported evidence,"" one of the weakest kinds of evidence there is. 

Let's do a few objective tests and see how you hold up! And then, after an objective measurement, it may turn out that your actual level of emotionality is higher than than that of an average woman. It might be lower. But how good was the test? Did the woman take the same one? And all of this will tell you absolutely nothing about how you compare in emotionality (or anything else) with one *particular* woman you've just met. Unless you make her take the test.

And this holds even before you enter into the questions of how the studies were done, whether conclusions of a particular study are really valid, and whether the correlation estimate actually holds water. Which weakens the whole thing further. 

***

Hell. Let's end this with some actual advice. 

In reality, ""women"" as a category are so diverse that you can't derive any conclusions whatsoever. Which then brings us to the question of how TRP works, in the extent that it does?

By producing confidence. 

This helps in two ways. First, confidence is attractive (this is *not* a female characteristic; men are more likely to be your friends and to think highly of you if you have a healthy level of self-confidence). Second, you miss 100% of shots you don't try. If you are more confident, you try more often, and sooner or later you succeed. 

You *can* do this with a system such as TRP. If you really believe in it, then you believe you have figured ""them"" out, and that gives you confidence. And you go out and try. And if it works, you chalk that success up to TRP. This is how most of PUAs and TRPers get to where they are.

But, as you can see from bitterness that fairly drips from the comments in TRP, this has side-effects. Basing your philosophy on the ""fact"" that the majority of women are a certain way, you end up selecting a certain subset of women. Which tends to be... let's say, not the most desirable one, at least not to most people. If you base your approach on the idea that women are bitchy, insecure and neurotic, guess what kind of woman you'll end up with? It's a self-fulfilling prophecy. 

Instead, consider this: a woman is as attracted to you as you would be to a female version of yourself. If you are (for example) average looking, horribly awkward, and uncomfortable in large groups - look around. See that average looking, horribly awkward girl looking uncomfortable in a large group? There is no reason you should expect any girl to be more attracted to you then you are to that girl. 

Figure out what are your good traits and what are the bad ones; put the good ones to the forefront, and start working on the bad ones. And then bootstrap yourself some confidence without relying on bullshit like TRP. Start with small things, work up, one step at a time. Don't punish yourself for failures, just keep going forward and keep trying. 

It is the same approach that applies to a vast majority of things in life. There are no real shortcuts. You want that degree, you have to work your way through college. You want to be fit, you have to put in the time in the gym. You want to learn a language, you have to practice it. And if you want a worthwhile woman, you need to become a worthwhile man, and keep working on attracting what you desire.

If you're downtown Sparks the 7-11 on Victorian is ran by a beer geek and has an impressive stock for a gas station



For taps- Total Wine has a growler station with ten different beers and sell growlers for a decent price. I picked up a 32 oz of Black Butte XXV for $8.50 this afternoon! Craft Wine and Beer also has three taps and also do growler fills in addition to having a bar. The craft bar scene is pretty much concentrated to downtown- St. James Infirmary has decent selection, as does Public House, and I believe Waterfall has 20 taps. Ole Bridge Pub also has a few taps and a bottle list There's also Sierra taphouse which has all Sierra Nevada beers on tap and a decent bottle selection. The other bar I'd recommend is Chapel which is uptown a few miles, but they have good selection and Wookie Jack as of Wednesday. The last place here off the top of my head that's good for beer is the 775 Gastropub in the Meadowwood Mall. Good tap selection, but ridiculous mark up on the bottles. I don't think any of the bars will do growler fills


The local breweries here aren't too bad. There's Great Basin in Sparks with a Reno location, Brazier St. James which is near downtown, Silverpeak which is downtown, and BrewBrothers which is downtown in one of the casinos. Of all these Great Basin is probably your best bet, all their darker beers are pretty good and do growler fills of all but their really limited stuff.

TRUE,Khayembii,,,"I'm not ever over at TRP.  I don't subscribe to it and I've seen some seriously misogynistic shit come out of there.  So I am in no way defending TRP.  However, I think it's unfair to characterize ""the seduction community"" in a single manner as if it's a monolithic entity.  That's just not the case.  For example, there is a (largely dead nowadays) section that focuses on - literally - what to say to a women, and finding great quotes to copypasta.  This started in the 90's before you could just look that shit up on the internet, and was probably the infancy of ""the seduction community"".

Then there's a section that focuses on just getting laid, and is misogynistic and puts forward a very aggressive and (to smart women) demeaning style of seduction that you're talking about.

And then there's a section that focuses a lot on inner game and identifying men's relationship with women as a facet of their overall experience, and connects this relationship with being a great man (person) generally.

So anyways, the idea of talking about ""negging"" and all the slang that is used is actually a way of deconstructing the way that people communicate with one another.  It's not demeaning inherently to analyze how flirting works.  And these different sections will have different ideas of what ""negging"" means just like different groups of guys will have different ideas on how to flirt.  None of them are absolutely right or wrong, it just depends on who's in the conversation.

I hate when people say that seduction is about ""manipulating"" women.  That's just so unbelievably wrong.  Women, for the most part, are from puberty bombarded with sexual advances in all forms.  They have guys coming at them, and because of it they learn very quickly how to deal with the opposite sex - for the most part - when it comes to flirting, how to tell a guy you're not interested, how to talk to guys when you're attracted to them, etc.  They have to learn this stuff in order to navigate daily social interactions.

Guys don't get that.  They don't have the experience of being bombarded with female advances.  Most guys consider it a memorable event when an attractive girl starts blatantly flirting with him.  The only way we learn to deal with women is by going out and actually pursuing them.  And every single guy on the street holds some level of fear, some level of insecurity, about doing this.  The fear/uncomfortability holds a lot of men back from interacting with women in a sexual way, and because of this they simply don't know how to flirt with women, or tell them they're attracted to them.  They're completely oblivious to social cues that women make in this regard, which is why so often men are painted as simplistic, straight-forward and unable to understand subtlety.

But that's not true at all.  They see the cues clearly for the most part, but they just don't know what they mean and even if they do, they don't know how to respond.  The only method of learning at their disposal is trial-and-error, and that requires trying in the first place!

I was one of these guys.  I was shy, nervous around attractive women, didn't think they were interested in me, missed obvious cues, etc.  Seduction helped me because it was basically like a blueprint on how to interact with women you're attracted to.  Not in the sense of ""if she does this you say that"" but in the sense of ""here's how flirting works"" and ""if she does this she might be interested in you, push her a little bit and see how she responds"" and ""ribbing a girl a little (negging) is a great way to start banter which is a good way of flirting, but make sure she knows you're doing it because you're interested in her and not just doing it to be funny"".  This isn't ""manipulating"" women or the interaction, it's *learning how to interact with women in the first place*.

(BTW, as I said before, I'm not defending seduction in general but just what I found useful about it)

As I read more into it, I got really attracted to the inner game stuff that Pook and RSD were putting out, particularly Pook's book and RSD's *Blueprint Decoded*.  I don't remember what was in it specifically, but I do remember that they were about how to gain confidence in your life, how to feel powerful and good about yourself, how to learn to be happy by yourself, how to not depend on getting girls for happiness (or let failure with girls make you unhappy), etc.  This is really powerful stuff that's been talked about for centuries, just packaged to guys that want to learn to interact with women without feeling extremely nervous/awkward or fearing that they'll be labeled a creep.

Gender Swapped Haganai:  Lots of physical violence and testosterone and less fly swatters.


Now here's an interesting one.  

Gender Swapped Ranma 1/2

Now the easy answer is that nothing happens since Ranma embodies both genders.  But remember that girl type Ranma is still boy type on the inside.  So now we have to start over and take the exact same concept except Ranma is a girl from the outset and is a girl on the inside of her boy appearance.  Ranma would still likely have much of the same personality traits as before but is more sensitive to a lack of femininity.  In essence she would be teased as the new ""uncute"" girl and her circumstance as 1/2 boy doesn't help.  In many parts, the female ranma will take on many parts from the female Akane, now no longer.

The big change would from the supporting characters.  The 3 Tendo girls would do a reversal in their roles.  Akane who as a girl struggles with her lack of femininity would have to be completely different.  He would be a boy who is good at cooking but is terrible at sports and martial arts.  He would struggle with his masculinity.  Nabiki would stay the same conniving middle child.  Kasumi would be the most physically strong of the group.  Champion martial artist and takes no nonsense from anyone personality.  He is also the one that leaves the house the most.  

Ranma's suitors are almost entirely different as well.  The easy part would be to deal with the Kuno's.  Simply switch up the ages between Kuno and Kodachi.  The biggest change would be to focus less on love interest and focus more as them being martial arts rivals.  All of which have lost to Ranma as a boy type and demand rematches.  Ranma's rivals would be her best friends and her worst enemies.  Pretty much nothing changes on that regard.  Female Ryoga would pretty much be the same.  Female Mousse would likely be a lot more of a clutz as the glasses girl.  Kodachi would fill the role as the new main Kuno.

Now the hardest part would be to create the female Happousai.  The lecher role is traditionally reserved for a male role and Happoussai is king of anime lechers.  Female lecher doesn't work as well.  What could possibly work is that Happy does a role reversal with Cologne.  Making the patriarch of Chinese Martial Arts nothing more than the world's greatest perv.  The matriarch of the Anything-Goes Martial Arts is an old lady who knows of a technique or two to teach.  This would of course make the Anything Goes School a bit less of a source for comedy unless every technique is always ridiculous in concept but more than what they seem.

But basically the formula seems for a gender swapped Ranma is to role reverse or trade traits between existing character.  Despite having the same set of character traits floating around, you might have a show that's pretty different in terms of tone.",0,1388806369,,0,1388808247,1,cegugfj,t3_1ucyhe,t1_cegugfj,t3_1ucyhe,1431790492,16,FALSE,anime,t5_2qh22,16

TRUE,phreakmonkey,,,"Disclaimer:  I'm an armchair aviation enthusiast (and pilot), but I'm not an aeronautical engineer.  Though I used to work for one!  So some of my information may be oversimplified or inaccurate.  
  
In my experience your crash was caused by two compounding factors:  
- It is very hard to gauge your rate of descent in vertical descents.  
- A multirotor is less stable in vertical descents because it is descending through its own prop-wash.  
  
""Prop wash"" is the term for the turbulent air created on the ""back"" side of a spinning rotor.  There are a few good ways to get an idea of how much turbulence is created by your props.  One of my favorites is to *carefully* fly the quad above yourself and feel the massive downdraft coming off of it.  (Disclaimer:  If you crash into your own head, you shouldn't have done that.)  Another is to fly over leaves, or smoke, or dust and see the disruption the air causes.  
  
Think of it this way- Newtonian physics says that in order to hover, your multirotor needs to be constantly pushing downward on the air with a force equal to its weight.  If your quad weights three pounds, that's a lot of air.  
  
In addition to the shear quantity of air being moved is the fact that it also creates turbulence in the process.  The propeller is a spinning airfoil.  As such, the tip of each blade is generating ""trailing vortices"" as it produces lift.(Google ""wingtip vorticies"" to read more about these.)  In addition to this, the rapidly moving air generates its own vortices where it meets the (relatively) still air around it.  
  
So, all this air movement creates a lot of ""rough"", turbulent conditions below your multirotor.  When you descend vertically, you're descending into this turbulent air, which your copter then has to try to compensate for to stay level.  
  
It's likely that flying level in this turbulent air requires more power, and as such more throttle, so it's likely that your vertical speed is actually going to increase initially as you descend into it from the relatively stable air above.  Add to this the fact that you have to fight both your descent rate and the turbulence in order to reduce your vertical speed, and you can see that it's possible to get into a situation where trying to reduce a fast descent can actually cause your flight controller to run out of ""control authority"" with which to make corrections against the turbulence.  
  
There are two basic ways to prevent this:  
  
1: Control your descent rate and don't let it get so high that it takes more than 75% throttle to stop it.   That leaves 25% of your power available for the flight controller to make level corrections.  Whether that is adequate depends on a lot of factors, including the size and weight of your copter and the size / effectiveness of the motor/prop combination you have.  
  
2: Don't descend vertically.  As others have suggested, descending while moving in any direction means you're effectively leaving your down-draft behind you and descending into smooth, stable air.  This prevents the exacerbation of loss of power and control authority caused by your own prop-wash.  
  
This is probably a good time to mention thrust-to-weight ratio.  If your copter has at least a 2:1 thrust-to-weight ratio then you can likely arrest any descent.   The higher the ratio, the easier it will be to stop a rapid descent in a short period.  Also, the more control authority your FC will have with which to fight turbulence.  
  
As your T:W ratio gets below 2:1, you start entering a situation where full power won't actually stop a descent above a certain speed within the amount of altitude you have.  At 1.2:1 it takes almost all of your power to hover, all of it to climb (leaving nothing for turbulence) and your ability to arrest a descent is nearly gone.  
  
It's fun to experiment with this phenomenon with micro-quads.  Add heavier and heavier weight to them and then see how carefully you have to descend before you lose control and it plummets back to the earth.  ;)  ",0,1388808403,,0,FALSE,1,cegv8pa,t3_1ud0be,t1_cegv8pa,t3_1ud0be,1431790858,15,FALSE,Multicopter,t5_2u9hy,15

TRUE,Blitzwire,,,"Logic games is really funny, because many of us just suck balls at them until one day we suddenly get it. Now, I'm not sure what resources you used to study, and a 155 in a month's worth of time is remarkably good in my opinion (depending on where your baseline falls anyways). Here are some tips I hope you'll find helpful:

* Isolate errors - are you consistently missing one type of question but acing the others? For instance, are you nailing the order questions but miserably failing the grouping questions? If so, you might want to orient your study strategy around getting specific question types down instead of doing broad studying.

* Using a guide - have you tried the Powerscore logic bible? It was a godsend for me when I was studying last May. Basically going through that got me from a -13 down to a -0 over the course of 3 weeks; and thats a -0 pretty consistently, with a -1 when I get sloppy and I always had at least 15min of free time after the practice sections

* Question review - try using LsatQA.com as a resource to troubleshoot your practice exams. They have very good analytics to break down where you need to focus your studying.

* Having a consistent strategy - this really comes down to diagramming. Whatever resource you use is going to have a certain way for you to diagram the sets, but you will find some ways counterintuitive and your mind really wanting to use a different form of diagrams. That's okay, embrace it! Work with your mind, not against it. That being said, be consistent. Don't flop between one diagram style and another, find what's good for you and stick with it. 

* Focus on conditional logic - this is really where Powerscore shines (albeit not for me personally since I took an intro to logic course at uni) but historically many of us stumble here. Mastering conditional logic not only helps you with 50% of the games (simple and complex grouping questions) but also translates well into other sections, especially logical reasoning.

TRUE,DashingLeech,,11Δ,"OK, I understand what you are trying to say but I think you've oversimplified to two extremes and missed the correct answer. You've extremized TRP, and PUAs in general, as merely a seduction community interested in getting casually laid and that is it. That is just flat out wrong. You also imply that following TRP or PUA approach is mutually exclusive from being ""kind, empathetic, and genuine"". This too is wrong. Many of your statements are very wrong, particularly about women as well.

I had always been the kind of guy to believe that *just* being a good person and treating women nicely was enough to attract them. I had a horrible time with women. When I got a girlfriend who stuck with me for awhile I clung to her, proposed, married her, and had a horrible 9 year marriage, the whole time trying harder and harder to please her. She ended up cheating on me with my best friend. I left her shortly after finding out.

I was determined to understand how to attract *quality* women better. I don't mean easy lays; I mean the cream of the crop: smart, attractive, funny, friendly, loving, competent, charming. I read a ton of books on the subject and it was all gimmicks. Nothing actually explained *why* women were different from men and what actually attracts them. Certainly they aren't attracted to men in the same way that men are attracted to women. That was very apparent to me for a long time, and is obvious throughout nature (sexual dimorphism).

Then I read a few *scientific* books on the matter: Sperm Wars (Robin Baker), The Mating Mind (Geoffrey Miller), and Red Queen (Matt Ridley). It all started falling into place. Having read The Selfish Gene and being knowledgeable in system dynamics and game theory, I understood the natural selection pressures that make our attractions different. But this still didn't give me insight into how to attract higher quality women.

When researching more books of the like I found these above books common on reading lists for something called PUAs. (This was 2005. I had no idea what it was.) In particular, these lists seemed related to somebody called David DeAngelo who had an ebook called ""Double Your Dating"". OK, sounded like more of the earlier self-help crap I ran into, but the link to these books I had already read had me intrigued. I got his ebook and loved it, then got his Advanced Dating Series (audio) (and later Mastery Series).

Wow. Everything clicked into place. While the goal was about improved dating, David kept re-focusing everybody back again and again to it being about improving yourself as a man and becoming the type of man who attracted women. Not by being fake, but by *becoming* a better person. Being better includes treating women in ways they actually like and respond to. ""Being yourself"" is an empty yet common statement since we aren't static. We all change and you can change for the better by better understanding how things work, whether philosophy, politics, social well-being, and relationships. And I did just that.

I began to experiment. I became more playful, more teasing, more mysterious. Some were great, some failed miserably, but all were educational. I remember one experiment where I was out with a bunch of friends in a pub as we did every week or two, and I just brought along a candy sucker. I had it in my mouth all evening. I'd take it out to sip beer and talk, then put it back in. I never said a word about it or acted like it was out of the ordinary. I had women coming up to me asking about it, including the cute bartender we saw every week who had never said much to me before. Now we had a great conversation.

I learned sexual banter and witty remarks, and why women actually like this. I also learned signals for when they don't like it. In fact, I learned about hidden signals in general (hair flipping, touching necks, smiles, looks, stances, and so on). I got really good at it.

See, courtship isn't not a job interview with a resume. It is a dance. That means knowing how to lead, follow, and read cues and respond accordingly. And none of these signals can be blatant or obvious or they lose all value as evaluation proxy signals for mating value. That's a key point of sexual selection.

And I read a lot of other PUA material like Mystery, Style (Neil Strauss, author of The Game), and a few others. They were fine but they only touched on the *why* basics and then focused on the gimmick techniques too much with too little about it being part of becoming a better man. I did like Mystery's 9-stage diagramming system as a means to keep it organized in my mind, as I am a visual person with an expertise in system behaviour, so these diagrams are helpful.

Did it get me laid? Sure. But quite the opposite of what the above comment suggests. Because I got better at being an attractive man, I was able to attract *higher quality* women, not lower quality women. When learning to dance you'll only get low quality partners. As you improve in your dance you can move up to the top quality ones.

And I did. Within a year and a half I was dating one of the nicest women I had ever met who also happened to be a model and one of the most gorgeous I had know. Never in my life did I believe that could happen. She took my breath away and we got serious for awhile. After a few months it didn't work out for unrelated reasons, but it was a great time.

Shortly thereafter I met my dream girl. She was gorgeous, friendly, intelligent, charming, funny, and perfect in every way I could imagine. What's better is how we met. We started discussing dating online months before I met her. I talked to her at great length about all of the things in the PUA material. After meeting, I even listened to David DeAngelos material with her and got her to read Mystery's ebook. She agreed with most of what they said. She absolutely loved discussing this material and how it can help men become better at dating.

That was in 2007. A week from today will be our 5th wedding anniversary and we have two young children. I am still deeply in love with her (and vice versa) and she is still my dream girl. And we still like to talk about dating and courtship and this material. (We still refer to things as DLV and DHV - Demonstration of Lower/Higher Value, as per Mystery's system.)

And I still use it with her. When things start seeming a little stale in our marriage, I re-learn some of that material. Things like how women like mystery and surprise, and having the man make the arrangements. (One early epiphany for me was when David D said that women tend to prefer to be in a restaurant they don't like eating food they don't like but the man made the arrangements and surprised her, than to be in her favorite restaurant eating her favorite food but she had to tell him what to do, or worse, to make the arrangements herself.)

So this is why I think the above comment is mostly wrong. I *am* a better person now. I *am* more attractive to women in general and my wife specifically. I increased the quality of woman I attracted, not lowered. I found high-quality girlfriends, not just one-night stands, and a wife. And women, knowing all of this, are not ""laughing their asses off"" at me. In fact, it is a bigger attractor. I feel more confident, I understand more, and perhaps most importantly I can better communicate with, understand, and keep my wife interested and happy. None of this would be possible hand I just kept thinking the same way I used to even though I was kind, empathetic, and a genuine person then. I am still a kind, empathetic, and genuine person.

Does TheRedPill have good info in this respect? I can't tell since I don't subscribe to it. I've looked briefly and it's stated goal of being better men seems appropriate, and there is some good material in there, but of course some cheap, sexist material mixed in and at least occasionally too much ""I'm a better alpha than you"" type competitions. That's why David D had to keep reminding everyone about the importance of the goal of being a better man. (The ""inner game"", as he'd call it, vs the ""outer game"" which is skills.) However, in general, PUA material has plenty of good stuff if you keep the goal in mind and interpret it in that context. I do highly recommend David D, at least the Advance Dating Series and Mastery Series.

This doesn't mean I think the above comment is a complete failure. If your goal is to become a better man with women in general, as I have, then I think the comment is wrong, particularly if you keep that goal in mind as you read and review PUA material.

If your goal is to just get cheap lays, then obviously the above comment fails since the criticisms is actually your goal.

Where the above comment may have value is if your goal is to become a better person and attract higher quality women, but you ignore those aspects of PUA material, focus on the techniques, and apply them in a disingenuous manner. Then they will laugh at you. But the solution is use the material to become a better man. You can be kind, empathetic, and genuine and sill very lousy at attracting women, as many friendzoned men are. You want to be those things *and* be good at the ""dance"" of courtship.

That will mean so much more than being a lonely, but good person, or settling for whatever woman you manage to get by fumbling through bad courtship. I did that for 9 years and it sucked. Learning how to attract quality women is one of the best things you could ever do to improve your life. At our wedding I said in my speech that I wasn't lucky to have found my wife because luck had nothing to do with it. I simply kept my standards as high as possible and it was inevitable that I'd marry the only woman who could meet them. That sounds like line, but I actually meant it seriously.

TRUE,drjgm74,,,"We don't know for sure. There are two main theories.

* Initially *Meyer-Overton* demonstrated that the effectiveness of an anaesthetic agent is proportional to the lipid solubility (measured as the oil:gas partition coefficient). This effect is very prominent and suggested a general effect of anaesthetic agents in a lipid soluble target. The theory is that anaesthetic agents dissolve into the cell lipid membrane and their presence somehow disrupts the cell function. The problem is that there are one or two anaesthetic agents that are not lipid soluble.

* The *receptor* theory. In more modern times it is noted that there are anaesthetic agents that act on specific sites on a ligand-gated ion channel (a cell surface receptor). I think this, that anaesthetic acts on a specific protein receptor ion channel, was first published by Franks and Lieb in Nature in 1994 http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v367/n6464/pdf/367607a0.pdf. The best example is the GABA-A receptor (a cell surface chloride channel) with inhibitory functions in the central nervous system. It has a specific binding site for barbituates (that augments the channel function and makes you sleep). Other anaesthetic agents can modulate the action of the channel. 

* Other anaesthetic agents act specifically at the NMDA receptor (another ligand gated ion channel on the cell surface). Best examples would be ketamine and nitrous oxide.

Currently the protein *receptor* theory is in the lead by a long way, mostly due to research on the GABA-A receptor in the CNS, but work is still ongoing in identifying the other protein receptors that are involved. There are anaesthetic agents that do not have an identified protein receptor binding site. This could be because the site is yet to be identified, or that the drug can act on the receptor, inducing conformational change in the receptor, by some other mechanism that doesn't require the classical *lock and key* drug-receptor interaction.",0,1388812911,,0,1388814447,1,cegwzfo,t3_1ud44g,t1_cegwzfo,t3_1ud44g,1431791680,4,FALSE,askscience,t5_2qm4e,4

We have for various reasons a scale of 12 semitones per octave.  Mathematically, the easiest way to represent every musical note on a 12-semitone scale is to have every note be 2^(1/12) times higher frequency than the last.  This divides an octave into 12 equal intervals, exponentially speaking.  This is called equal temperament.

But the 12-semitone scale is chosen only for its ability to closely approximate the most important intervals, the perfect 5th and perfect 4th, as well as others such as the major 3rd, to within the margin of error where we don't hear too much discordance.

Naturally, our hearing hears the perfect 5th and its inverse the perfect 4th as sounding ""pure"" and these have ratios of 1:1.5 and 1:1.333 respectively, as these match up well with natural harmonics of each other.  These are referred to as ""just"" intervals because they are based on whole ratios.

Having an equal temperament of 12 semitones allows us to use a 7-semitone interval (such as between C and G) to approximate a perfect 5th.  That ratio comes to 2^(7/12) or 1.498:1.  So when we play a perfect 5th on something with equal temperament of 12 semitones we get ""close enough"" to the ""just"" intonation that it sounds okay.  For the major 3rd, which would sound best to us with a 1:1.25 ratio, equal temperament of 12 semitones gets closest at 4 semitones which is 2^(4/12) or 1:1.2599, which is only just within the margin of error of ""just"" intonation that our ears accept before it sounds ""dischordant"".

It turns out 12 equal semitones is the smallest number of equal segments you can split an octave into and get a reasonable approximation of all these important intervals, and in the case of a 12-semitone equal temperament it's the major 3rd that sees the most variance from the perfect tuning to sound best.  There are technical reasons why this is an important interval.

Because of the difference between the way a 12-semitone equal temperament represents intervals and the pure (""just"") intervals, people who tune instruments by listening to intervals (ie, how you would tune a guitar by ear) don't end up with equal temperament, but with the best sounding near-""just"" intervals in whatever key they tuned in.  So an instrument tuned by ear to a particular key may sound better in that key than some other keys.  To get closer to well-tempered requires more complex mathematics, talks of ""syntonic commas"", etc.

Another thing to consider, and this impacts on the original question, is that pianos don't necessarily use equal temperament based tuning.  Due to the stiffness of the strings, their harmonics sound slightly higher in pitch than you'd expect.  Pianos are often tuned using a ""stretched"" tuning where each octave is slightly *higher* than 2:1 as a result.  This is the sort of tuning you'd end up with if you tuned a piano by ear.  It makes octaves and large intervals sound slightly nicer given the unique stiff strings of a piano.

This post contains some simplifications.

TRUE,Journeyman12, points,1∆,"I just finished a fantastic book called *The Battle for God*, by a religious historian named Karen Armstrong, which somewhat addresses your question. (Disclaimer: both her book and my answer focus on Christianity, Judaism and Islam.)

According to Armstrong, premodern peoples had two basic ways of looking at the world: mythos and logos. Logos was the everyday rational way of doing things. We plant this crop at this time and it gives us food; we build a town here because it's a defensible spot; we have a dictatorship because it's the most efficient way to run things and it allows us to defend ourselves. Everyday actions. 

Mythos was how people found meaning in their lives. Religious texts guided your behavior, but people viewed them in a very different sense than they did the rational, practical information that logos gave them. It was a matter of addressing different human needs. Take the Jewish holy text, the Tanakh. It answers the questions of 'Why are we here?' 'What makes us different from other peoples?' and 'How can we behave best to make a good society happen?' It addresses the really, really big questions, like 'What happens after death?' and 'Are we alone in the universe'. It doesn't matter, in that sense, if the answers were empirically right or empirically wrong. They allowed the Jews to maintain a sense of community and a distinct religious tradition despite being splattered all over Africa, the Middle East and Europe as an often-persecuted minority. It also enabled them to find meaning in their lives. Such tiny actions as lighting candles on the Sabbath or spending a few hours in prayer were holy, *are* holy, because they allow/ed us to sanctify a little bit of our lives. They transport us beyond the mundane, to find something deeper than ourselves. Whether you feel this way or not, OP, people generally look for meaning in their lives beyond the chores of just existing. Religion gave premodern people that meaning. They could be devoutly religious and still be rational, intelligent people who made sound decisions, because they treated religion and daily life differently. 

But that doesn't really address your question, right? That was then. We have science now. We know, within a reasonable margin of error, how old the Earth is, how old the Universe is, and where we come from. So why would someone believe the old traditions now, assuming that they're not being indoctrinated, and that they are rational and intelligent?

Armstrong writes about 'the void', which first became a serious problem around the time of the Enlightenment and became reality by the time of the World Wars. Basically, once we killed God (as Nietzsche put it) there was a hole in many peoples' lives. What should I believe in? What does my life mean, if anything? If I don't believe in God, what happens when I die? What do I turn to when life is confusing or hard, or when the world seems to go crazy around me? How do I make my life more than just going through the motions? Again, human beings have a really strong need to have answers to these questions. Not all of us, but most of us need a deeper meaning than everyday life, particularly modern life, gives us. 

This diverges from Armstrong's arguments, but I believe that the popularity of a lot of modern forms of entertainment--novels, movies, TV shows, video games, consumerism, recreational drug and alcohol use, casual sex, sports, and why people get so incredibly into many or all of them--is rooted in the search for meaning. (Note: I enjoy many of those things, and I'm a religious person. I'm not saying that a lack of religion is sucking morality out of society, nor am I saying that people who consume them are going against God or any other kind of fundamentalist rhetoric... but I do think that a lot of people are looking for greater meaning in a lot of different places, and some of them ain't good.) Which brings us back to religion. As it has always been, religion is a way for people to fill the void. Yes, there is a deeper meaning, they say. God tells us to do good works, or to live a good and compassionate life. 

But how can people believe religious teachings when science tells us all the answers? Well, Armstrong's book is full of horrible things that happened when one side of the human approach to the world--logos or mythos--tried encroaching on the other. When mythos presumes upon logos, you generally get tragedies. She makes the point over and over that premodern religious-legal codes, built for agrarian societies, *don't work* in the modern day. Trying to adapt them for a modern lifestyle is one of the hardest jobs there is, and people screw it up and countries bleed for it. But the path of logos isn't clear and unmistakable either. When the rational side of us starts to take over the mystical side--when we adhere to strict rationality and believe only what we can prove, we get the void. Because whether there's something more to this world or not, whether there's a deeper meaning or there isn't, *we want there to be*. We, as humans, *need* there to be. Science can tell you how just about everything happened, but it's bad at telling you why. It's bad at providing that sense of deeper meaning. (Note II: I'm not criticizing science here. I have the deepest respect for the scientific method, the technological advances it has brought us, and the crazy amount of knowledge we've gained because people rely on empirical testing in the realm of logos and have gotten really, really good at it. But like anything human, it has its limits.) It's also bad at disproving things that aren't testable, like whether God exists. I could answer your first question, about why God would single out a certain group, with any number of hypotheticals, and you could marshal any number of counterarguments back at me. When we're talking about an ineffable entity, why even go there? That's why I've chosen to approach your post in this way. 

This is the modern relationship between mythos and logos, or at least, this is how I choose to define it. Logos can tell you everything about the world, but it cannot give you meaning. Mythos can answer the ultimate questions, help you feel like a part of a community and help you live a good life (science can too, kinda), but don't ask it to empirically prove anything. People believe in both at once--or, since I can only really speak for myself on this point, I believe in both at once--because, since they address different facets of the human experience it is possible to hold the two concepts in your head at once and not explode. Because many people still experience a sense of the mystical or the miraculous, whether it's empirically sound or not, and wish to celebrate it or make sense out of it. And because, like premodern people, we both need to make the world work correctly and need to find a deeper meaning. 


**Edit:** A good tl;dr for this might be that it depends entirely on what you mean by 'rational'. If you mean 'applies logos to every aspect of their lives', then I doubt any such person would subscribe to any religious hokum. If you mean 'applies logos to daily life and mythos to their spiritual, religious or otherwise mystical experiences', or 'applies logos to daily life but respects the limits of its power', then you might get something like my answer.

**ASTURIA**

**CAPITAL CITY OF NEW IBERIA**

*Introduction: History and Planetological Information:*

The city of Asturia is located on the planet of New Iberia, a planet in  the comic region known as Upper Centaurus, and orbits the star Kassia, a K7-class orange dwarf star. It has a rotational period of 73.3 hours, an axial tilt of 19.64 degrees, and an orbital period of 153 standard days. It has short, mild seasons, and due to its slow rotation experiences very long periods of both daylight and darkness.

Settled in the late 31st century by Neo-Germanic migrants from Eridani, New Iberia was originally called New Ganymede, in reference to the planet's small, shallow seas and mountainous landscape. The first colony was situated on a large island in the mouth of the León river (originally called der Löwenmaul) and was named Kronenburg, because the three prominent hills looked like the three points of a crown. The colony was mildly prosperous and was mainly an agricultural colony, supplemented by mining the rich iron ores found in the planet's mountains. 

The planet remained largely Neo-Germanic until 3415, when the height of the Françolais Revival led many Françolais planets (a cultural group formed from the fusion of the old-Earth cultures of France and Spain) to band together into the first Françolais Confederacy and expand further into Upper Centaurus. The Françolais-New Ganymede war lasted six weeks and resulted in New Ganymede becoming a possession of the Confederacy. Under Françolais rule, the planet was renamed New Iberia after the Old Earth birthplace of Françolais culture itself. Kronenburg was renamed Asturia, after a prominent Iberian kingdom. The planet remained a strong member of the Confederacy into the 35th Century, providing an enormous wealth of raw mineral resources in exports. When the Confederacy collapsed in 3567 after massive problems due to bureaucracy, New Iberia remained strong, largely due to its role as a banking power and prime location for transit to other stars. When the major powers of Upper Centaurus formed the Antares Federation in 3620 in the aftermath of the Second Crucian War, New Iberia joined the General Charter to retain its autonomy as a financial power, instead of the more centralised Special Charter. To this day, Asturia remains a bustling metropolis, and one of the most prominent centers of banking and commerce throughout the entirety of Centaurus.

**I: Architecture:**

The Greater Asturia Area exists as an expansion to the original settlement of Kronenburg. The city is built upon the several large islands in the León river delta and the surrounding shore areas. The heart of the city is Corona, the eastern section of the island upon which Kronenburg was originally founded. There, gleaming nanocarbon skyscrapers soar hundreds of meters into the air, most of them corporate and manufacturing headquarters. The current Palacia Central, the central government building, is located in the unchanged Zentralhaus, the original Neo-Germanic colonial office. The Palacia sits atop the highest hill in La Corona, the name for the three crown-shaped hills and the city distict of the same name. 

Asturia is divided into seven administrative districts, called cantons: Corona, Isabelle, Estabosca, Nord-Rio, Ribera, Oestmont, and Les Mareas.

 * Corona: The center of Asturia. Tall, modern plasticarbon buildings and spires. Many banks, guilds, and industries have their headquarters here. All the major metro lines run through central Corona, allowing for easy access to the entirety of the city. Takes up the southeastern portion of Isla Corona, the main island of the city. 

 * Ribera: the far-western portion of Isla Corona. Originally a working-class neighborhood, it eventually evolved into a middle-class neighborhood and cultural center of Asturia. Many mid-size flats, lofts and densely-packed with efficiency apartments. 

 * Nord-Rio: The northern portion of Isla Corona, as well as Dinamarca, a smaller island to the northeast. The Isla Corona portion of Nord-Rio is mostly manufacturing, along with high-rise agricultural buildings to supplement the city's food supply. Dinamarca is home to the city's spaceport, a majestic towering building that processes all of the inworld and offworld traffic and goods, and houses the central offices for the Otoridad del Porte.

 * Estabosca: A forested island to the east of Corona, noted as being a white-collar/upper-class neighborhood. Covered in beautiful parks and home to the city's Municipal Gardens and the Villa-Musé, a city-sponsored collection of museums. Most of the buildings on Estabosca are upscale apartments less than ten stories, though a significant portion of the buildings are individual residences. 

 * Isabelle: An island to the north of Estabosca. Currently home to many of the city's working-class neighborhoods. Also known for producing some of the city's most famous artists. Contains la Villa de Sol, a very liberal commune that is the city's LGBT center.

 * Oestmont: Located on the western bank of the Léon river, Oestmont is built on the high cliffs and hills overlooking the city. Many very large apartment buildings dot the landscape. Oestmont is known for being home to many different enclaves of immigrants, especially the city's Proksimi population, an Islamoslavic ethnic group descended from the original settlers of Proxima Centauri. Mostly working/middle class residents. 

 * Las Mareas: Built on the flats and wetlands on the eastern mainland, Las Maresas is Asturia's manufacturing and refining center, and is home to the city's central atomic plant. Also the hub for the city's high-speed rail lines out of the city and to the other settlements of New Iberia. 

In addition to the main islands in the Léon delta, there are many, many smaller island that have earned Asturia the title ""City of Isles"", and due to the city's well-developed network of bridges, Asturia is also called the ""City of Bridges"".

**II: Commerce:**

New Iberia's geographical position in the Antares Federation, and its proximity to many of the major interstellar shipping lanes makes it an ideal trading port. And Asturia, as the planet's capital, receives the lion's share of such trade. The spaceport at Dinamarca processes hundreds of thousands of ships, passengers, and goods shipments daily. The reasonable offworld tariff rates make it so that Asturians have access to a variety of foreign products and goods. 

**Imports:**

Although New Iberia does have a modest agricultural industry, the soil is too nutrient-poor to sustain the entirety of the planet's needs. Most of the planet's domestic agriculture is therefore produced in greenhouses and terraria, but even so almost 60% of New Iberia's agricultural products come from off-world.  Countless tonnes of Antarean wheat, Scorbettian maize, and cattle products from Zuben Prime go through Dinamarca Spaceport daily.

New Iberia, despite being rich in minerals such as titanium, cobalt, iron and copper, is severely lacking in metals such as platinum and gold, as well as heavier radioactive elements like uranium and thorium. As a result, large supplies of these elements are imported and then refined domestically. A large quantity of these materials are refined right in Las Maresas.

Among the planets and cities of the Centauri region, Asturia is one of the heaviest consumers of coffee. The favored blend is Muscovian Red, an incredibly fragrant and strong blend that pairs well with the seafood from the lakes and seas of New Iberia.

**Exports:**

Much of New Iberia's wealth comes from a combination of its power as a banking institution coupled with the large amount of finished-goods manufacturing it does. One of the major corporations on New Iberia, headquartered in Asturia, is Rochelle Dynamics, a manufacturer of groundcars and components for transportation systems. 

In addition, the weapons industry has a strong foothold on New Iberia. Marukh Industries, Bishop-Wycliffe Security Technologies, and the New Terra Armaments Corporation have manufacturing/distribution centers in Asturia. Products such as industrial and combat hardsuits, light/small arms, and weapons systems for combat vehicles are all exported at Dinamarca Spaceport.

TRUE,freshgeardude,,,"""I've even thought about how. Poisons and other drugs won't work on me. And
I've seen pictures of snakes that were shot - some of them live for days, so
that's out too. So, I want you to bring back a sword.

Nate turned away to look back to the dune that Sammy had gone behind. ""I'd
say an axe, but that's somewhat undignified - putting my head on the ground
or a chopping block like that. No, I like a sword. A time-honored way of
going out. A dignified way to die. And, most importantly, it should work,
even on me.

""You willing to do that for me, Jack?"" Nate turned back to look at Jack.

""Yeah, Nate,"" replied Jack solemnly, ""I think I can handle that.""

Nate nodded. ""Good!"" He turned back toward the dune and shouted, ""Sammy!
Jack's about ready to leave!"" Then quietly, ""Thanks, Jack.""

Jack didn't have anything to say to that, so he waited for Sammy to make it
back to the lever, nodded to him, nodded a final time to Nate, and then
headed into the desert with Sammy following.
Over the next several years Sammy and Jack kept in touch with Nate through
e-mail as they went about their adventures. They made a goal of visiting
every country in the world, and did a respectable job of it. Sammy had a
natural gift for languages, as Jack expected he would, and even ended up
acting as a translator for Jack in a few of the countries. Jack managed to
keep the talking rattlesnake hidden, even so, and by the time they were
nearing the end of their tour of countries, Sammy had only been spotted a
few times. While there were several people that had seen enough to startle
them greatly, nobody had enough evidence to prove anything, and while a few
wild rumors and storied followed Jack and Sammy around, nothing ever hit the
newspapers or the public in general.

When they finished the tour of countries, Jack suggested that they try some
undersea diving. They did. And spelunking. They did that too. Sammy finally
drew the line at visiting Antarctica. He'd come to realize that Jack was
stalling. After talking to his Dad about it over e-mail, he figured out that
Jack probably didn't want to have to kill Nate. Nate told Sammy that humans
could be squeamish about killing friends and acquaintances.

So, Sammy eventually put his tail down (as he didn't have a foot) and told
Jack that it was time - he was ready to go back and take up his duties from
his dad. Jack, delayed it a little more by insisting that they go back to
Japan and buy an appropriate sword. He even stretched it a little more by
getting lessons in how to use the sword. But, eventually, he'd learned as
much as he was likely to without dedicating his life to it, and was
definitely competent enough to take the head off of a snake. It was time to
head back and see Nate.

When they got back to the US, Jack got the old RV out of storage where he
and Sammy had left it after their tour of the fifty states, he loaded up
Sammy and the sword, and they headed for the desert.

When they got to the small town that Jack had been trying to find those
years ago when he'd met Nate, Jack was in a funk. He didn't really feel like
walking all of the way out there. Not only that, but he'd forgotten to
figure the travel time correctly, and it was late afternoon. They'd either
have to spend the night in town and walk out tomorrow, or walk in the dark.

As Jack was afraid that if he waited one more night he might lose his
resolve, he decided that he'd go ahead and drive the RV out there. It was
only going to be this once, and Jack would go back and cover the tracks
afterward. They ought to be able to make it out there by nightfall if they
drove, and then they could get it over tonight.

Jack told Sammy to e-mail Nate that they were coming as he drove out of
sight of the town on the road. They then pulled off the road and headed out
into the desert.

Everything went well, until they got to the sand dunes. Jack had been
nursing the RV along the whole time, over the rocks, through the creek beds,
revving the engine the few times they almost got stuck. When they came to
the dunes, Jack didn't really think about it, he just downshifted and headed
up the first one. By the third dune, Jack started to regret that he'd
decided to try driving on the sand. The RV was fishtailling and losing
traction. Jack was having to work it up each dune slowly and was trying to
keep from losing control each time they came over the top and slid down the
other side. Sammy had come up to sit in the passenger seat, coiled up and
laughing at Jack's driving.

As they came over the top of the fourth dune, the biggest one yet, Jack saw
that this was the final dune - the stone, the lever, and somewhere Nate,
waited below. Jack put on the brakes, but he'd gone a little too far. The RV
started slipping down the other side.

Jack tried turning the wheel, but he didn't have enough traction. He pumped
the brakes - no response. They started sliding down the hill, faster and
faster.

Jack felt a shock go through him as he suddenly realized that they were
heading for the lever. He looked down - the RV was directly on course for
it. If Jack didn't do something, the RV would hit it. He was about to end
humanity.

Jack steered more frantically, trying to get traction. It still wasn't
working. The dune was too steep, and the sand too loose. In a split second,
Jack realized that his only chance would be once he hit the stone around the
lever - he should have traction on the stone for just a second before he hit
the lever - he wouldn't have time to stop, but he should be able to steer
away.

Jack took a better grip on the steering wheel and tried to turn the RV a
little bit - every little bit would help. He'd have to time his turn just
right.

The RV got to the bottom of the dune, sliding at an amazing speed in the
sand. Just before they reached the stone Jack looked across it to check that
they were still heading for the lever. They were. But Jack noticed something
else that he hadn't seen from the top of the dune. Nate wasn't wrapped
around the lever. He was off to the side of the lever, but still on the
stone, waiting for them. The problem was, he was waiting on the same side of
the lever that Jack had picked to steer towards to avoid the lever. The RV
was already starting to drift that way a little in its mad rush across the
sand and there was no way that Jack was going to be able to go around the
lever to the other side.

Jack had an instant of realization. He was either going to have to hit the
lever, or run over Nate. He glanced over at Sammy and saw that Sammy
realized the same thing.

Jack took a firmer grip on the steering wheel as the RV ran up on the stone.
Shouting to Sammy as he pulled the steering wheel, ""BETTER NATE THAN LEVER,""
he ran over the snake.

THE END

North Korea is an absolute anomaly in the world.  China may be another communist state, but it is a booming one.  North Korea is hermetic, secretive, and so strange that it borders on insane.  And it is crippled, a state failing behind a veil of Chinese/global support and a rigorous propaganda campaign.

Hitler's dead and his malice exposed.  Mao died ages ago and the party has moved on.  But North Korea has undergone two dramatic changes in leadership (let's remind ourselves that KIS and KJI are revered as gods) and is still kicking.  Most of us (thank god) will never actually live in a society such as North Korea.

They're going to find it fucking creepy to be picked up and placed directly over the genitals of someone they've just met.

 * repeal affordable care act

 * Privatize the FAA and TSA
 * cut federal workforce by 10%

Ron Paul believes it should be legal to not pay taxes if you object to the legitimacy of the law (effectively making taxation completely unenforceable.)

He also believes that ""Separation of Church and State"" isn't outlined in the bill of rights. He has proposed numerous laws to prevent judiciary bodies from ensuring that local and state government do not affect display or language that supports the religious views of one particular group with public monies.

He votes against gay adoption and the equal rights of homosexuals regularly. However, peculiarly, he believes that gay marriage should be permitted, but also states openly that he would have voted for DOMA, and that the ultimate decision should be left to the states, and the venue that is providing the marriage. He says he ultimately believes that marriages should not be defined or registered with the federal government, but you'll notice he sneakily sidesteps this issue by kicking it down to the state level, where his constituents will ensure that the most anti-gay policy will be put in place. He has since 2010 started arguing that marriage is by definition between a man and a woman.

Ron Paul came out in support of ""Don't Ask, Don't tell."".

He is also known to defend sodomy laws for the sake that he believes that the federal government has no place striking down laws regarding sexual conduct, as the constitution doesn't define a statute that states that people have a right to commit sodomy.

Extremely anti-abortion. Violates his ""state rights"" bullshit to hamfist federal bans on abortions. However, government at the federal level, in his own words, ""should not be involved in medical matters, including contraception."". He wants to block planned parenthood and family planning funding, yet has the fucking gall to state ""the federal government has no place legistlating on abortion."" He then went on to vote on bills that banned certain types of abortion at a federal level, and increased punishments for clerical and procedural violations relating to operating abortion clinics.



**TL;DR**: *Again, I could go on, but extrapolate his policy of ""People shouldn't pay taxes"", to ""The federal government should be very, very tiny"", and then take a look at his massive, massive cuts to taxation and total elimination of taxes on the wealthiest sector of our population. His proposals aren't just a little crazy, they are tantamount to economic suicide for this nation, and given that a handful of the states whose policies most closely match his platform take more federal dollars than they actually bring in, his policies will bankrupt the country faster than you can say ""Ron Paul 2016"".*",1,1388826218,,0,FALSE,1,ceh0r31,t3_1ucv05,t1_ceh0r31,t1_ceh091n,1431793580,8,FALSE,news,t5_2qh3l,8

TRUE,Psycon,,,"I'm going to disagree. There's definitely a deeper ideology at work behind Interventionism. First, it is key to understand that US foreign policy is largely self-interested and primarily benefits the elite at the expense of all others. There are many reasons and lies that are told to justify it, and some of the elite even believe these lies themselves, part of this is due to a deliberate policy of distortion and compartmentalization. The conspirators want to keep people from trying to see the big picture and it facilitates what is known as ""plausible deniability"". At the core is always the self-interest of the elite, the rest is just misguided beliefs, political strategizing, and lies, and one of them is...

&gt;The idea is that the USA can eliminate problems before they become big problems.

This is a Neoconservative belief, based on the false and naive notion of American moral superiority and exceptionalism. 

Leo Strauss one of the founders of the US Neoconservative movement was influenced indirectly by the Nazis and the political climate of the post WWII era. Believing that American liberalism and individualism lead to Nihilism through moral erosion and the destruction of shared societal values which eventually would cause the downfall of the US, he decided to combat this by drawing inspirations from the Nazi ideals of a false romanticized cultural heritage, conformity, and blind nationalism, and thus created a modern myth of American superiority and exceptionalism using our own history and old testament Christian ideology as its basis. (The greatest irony of all is the speed with which some in the American Right these days will throw Leo Strauss under the bus and call him a Nazi supporter (he wasn't) despite his absolutely critical role of shaping their ideology.)

And it is this ideology which largely shapes our cultural identity and foreign policy of interventionism. We believe we are justified in nation building through our irrational belief that we are morally and culturally superior. Anytime someone comments or utters some nonsense of American exceptionalism and how this is the greatest country to live in I realize how effective the indoctrination of people like Strauss was. Couple that irrational spirit of superiority with the paranoia and suspicion created by CIA Cold War social engineers like Nash and you have a perfect recipe for controlling and shaping public opinion.

It is through the propagation of those ideals in the media (see: Operation Mockingbird) that the American right have socially conditioned liberals into supporting their agenda. 

Additionally, the US political elite has no interest in supporting any truly democratic governments that do not act as puppets working on behalf of western/US corporate interests. The past centuries worth of history clearly shows this. The CIA and US government has regularly aided radical Islamists and right wing terror groups across the world in order to justify perpetual war to support the MIC and spread US corporate hegemony.

The CIA essentially acts as the intelligence arm of the right wing US corporate elite, an organization which has constantly sought to undermine legitimate democracies and socially control people to turn them against democracy, liberalism, socialism, anarchism, and communism. You can see the results in the deaths and oppression resulting from US foreign policy, military interventions and intelligence operations in: 

Italy, Iran, Albania, Greece, Egypt, Kosovo, Hungary, Turkey, Honduras, El Salvador, Cuba, Haiti, Colombia, Chile, Argentina, Venezuela, Nicaragua, Guatemala, Rhodesia, Congo, Angola, Ghana, Vietnam, Laos, Bahrain, Libya, Syria, Iraq, and many more regions around the world. Keeping in mind that many of these countries were stable governments or democracies prior to US interventionism.

Were not just talking about hundreds or thousands... but roughly ten million people or more over the span of half a century who have been killed directly and indirectly through US covert, overt, economic, and military actions.

US foreign policy is entirely self-interested. It's all driven by the irrational and destructive need for money and power.

Hey guys, 

I also wanted to drop a note outside of the main post but still towards the top (if you upvote it :)).  

I want to tell you that words really can't express how awesome it has been to participate in this community over the past couple of years.

You all have have provided a constant source of valuable feedback that has led to new changes and great deals. To use a recent example, the addition of a ""DRM"" filter on our sale pages was something we implemented as a direct result of /r/gamedeals feedback. 

When I started working here there was a lot of concern around how I'd interact with the community. The biggest piece of feedback I received was that the community was concerned that I'd be more interested in pushing deals down your throats and not really be a contributing member.  

I hope my interactions with all of you has shown that I took that feedback to heart. I consider myself fortunate to be a member of this community and I thank all of you for making it so awesome.  

Lastly, by far the best experience I've had with all of you is having a great place to make my job really fun. Instead of looking at driving traffic towards our deals and announcements objectively I've had the amazing opportunity to make this part of my job personal and enjoyable.  

In 2014 the Amazon Digital Video Games team hopes to bring you new and exciting news ranging from awesome deals to new selection like the recently added Playstation Digital and Bethesda content.

Thanks again for an amazing 2013 and here's to a phenomenal 2014!

~~In the first scene with Trinity in room 303 (where Neo later returns), the exterior of the building is shown.  The sign on the front of the building indicates that it is a theater, but the inside looks more like an apartment building. I think this symbolizes the fact that the lives of those in the matrix are all a show~~

In the same scene with Trinity, as the police bust in they shine their flashlights at her, and she watches the shadows on the wall.  I think this may be a reference to Plato's ""[Cave of Shadows](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_Cave)""

Neo begins the movie in room 101, and ends it in room 303.  I think this may symbolize how he needed Trinity to become The One (3x101=303).

Neo sells the illegal files to a couple named Choi and Dejure.  These are French names, meaning ""choice of the day.""  Neo, of course, makes a really big choice in this scene.

When discussing the code they read to view the matrix, Cypher ironically says to Neo, ""I don't even see the code, all I see is blond, brunette, red head.""  This is just what is wrong with him.  He is regressing to his prior state, and letting the code fool his mind.  Neo, however, goes through the opposite transformation.  At the end of the movie he does not even see the matrix, all he sees is code.

There is a subtle reference to the Architect in the Matrix.  In the interrogation scene with the agents and Neo near the beginning of the movie, for a brief second you can see Neo being watched on a number of monitors which look exactly like those in the Architect's room.

Agent Smith (I think the most interesting character) goes through a really fascinating transformation in the film.  He goes from being an emotionless agent to someone who can hardly control his emotions (he says ""I am going to enjoy watching you die"" something an agent would never say.  he also has many angry outbursts.).  There is, of course, also the great scene with he and Morpheus, in which Smith removes his ear piece (unplugs) and tells Morpheus of all his hopes and dreams.  It is also ironic how he describes humans multiplying like a virus until every natural resource is consumed.  He himself becomes a virus and does exactly this in the next movie.

Morpheus's name comes from the god of dreams in Ovid's Metamorphosis, and Morpheus is responsible for waking Neo up.

When Neo goes to the Oracle for the first time, she tells him that he is not the One.  She says he looks like he is waiting for something.  When he asks what, she responds ""your next life, maybe.""  It is only after he dies that he becomes the One.

Also in this scene with the Oracle, she tells him: ""Being the One is like being in love... you just know it.""  At the climax when he becomes the One, Trinity confesses her love for him.  She KNOWS that she is in love.  And simultaneously, because the Oracle told her she would fall in love with the One, she KNOWS that Neo is the One.

The scene with Neo and his boss in the beginning has a lot of ironies.  His boss tells him ""you have a problem with authority,"" which surely he does, as he rebels against every form of authority in existence in the matrix.

Anyway thats all i can come up with off the top of my head right now. I hope these are as interesting!

Edit: several people asked about my opinions on the second and third films.  I'll copy and paste a comment I left yesterday:
I was really disappointed in the sequels the first time i watched them, but I was able to find a way of enjoying them. I simply watched them completely from Neo's perspective. If you pay attention to what Neo sees and does, it makes a lot of sense what happens at the end and what Neo is going through. It's about him realizing that Morpheus was wrong. He realizes that the real world isn't real. This allows him to stop sentinels with his mind and see without eyes. He realizes that there are many levels of reality coming from some ""source"" (The power of the One reaches all the way back to the source). Neo mistakenly thought the Oracle was talking about the machine mainframe when she mentioned the source. At the end of Revolutions, he loses his last connection to the ""real world"", Trinity, and resigns himself to leaving that world.
Incidentally, Smith also gains power as Neo does (The Oracle says ""[Smith] is [Neo's] opposite... the result of the equation trying to balance""). So, as Neo gains power in the real world (stopping the sentinels with his mind), Smith shortly does as well (corrupting Bane). Neo finally realizes that the only way to kill Smith is to ""kill"" himself, which is exactly what happens at the climax of Revolutions. This makes it ironic what Smith says as he dies: ""No, no no. Its not fair."" But that's the point, it's PERFECTLY fair. Of course, as I said above, Neo merely ascends another level rather than just dying. This begs the question though: If Neo is still alive, is Smith?
To be honest, though.... Reloaded was acceptable at best and Revolutions was complete SHIT. Revolutions was literally a continuous fight scene. Every time I watch it, it seems worse. Really depressing. Makes me wish they had left it without a sequel.

A number of people pointed out that I was WRONG about the building in the beginning being a theater.  It is, in fact, ""heart of the city hotel.""  Sorry, I don't know what made me think that.  Perhaps its just that the sign looks kind of like that of an old theater.

In the third and final chapter of Danish filmmaker Nicolas Winding Refn's acclaimed Pusher trilogy, the focus shifts from disgraced gangster's son Tonny to feared Serbian crime lord Milo. First seen in the original film as a vicious underworld heavy with a thirst for blood and a sadistic mean streak, Milo's violent professional life couldn't stand in starker contrast to his henpecked home life. From catering to the constant demands of his spoiled daughter, Milena, to watching over his shiftless henchmen and cooking his helpers some questionably prepared samosas, Milo's notorious street reputation can't hold a candle to his reputation for being quite a softie around the house. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi

There's really no such thing as ""white privilege."" What there *is* is discrimination against blacks and some other minorities--and disadvantages for them.  


Look, to say that x is privileged is to say that x is getting some illicit advantage. So consider, for example, getting hassled by the cops. Whites typically get hassled by the cops less. Is this an illicit advantage? No, it is not. Rather, it is a basic right that everyone deserves.   

Furthermore, if the problem is ""privilege,"" then the problem can be eliminated by eliminating the privilege. So, for the example above, the problem could be solved by the cops hassling more white people. Obviously, that is insane. The problem can only be solved by decreasing the amount of time that blacks are hassled by the cops. Again, the problem isn't ""privilege,"" it's *discrimination* (and illicit disadvantage).  


Also, as a kind of speculative post-script: there has never been any need for the concept ""privilege"" in any of these discussions. Everything we need to talk about can be talked about *more accurately* by the concept *discrimination*. SJWs like the term 'privilege' because it changes the focus of the discussion away from the struggles of the disadvantaged...and onto the groups SJWs love to shriek at and froth about--whites, males, etc. They are less interested in the real struggles of disadvantaged people, and more interested in promoting the suggestion that whites, males, etc. are getting things they don't deserve.   

But if you want to speak of the problem accurately, you need to use the concept *discrimination*, not the concept *privilege.* Furthermore, the former concept has been the concept on which all real, relevant, positive change has been effected (in the States, anyway). When I, for example, hear people talk about discrimination against some group, I'm all ears and eager to help.

TRUE,tomomcat,,delta,"Haha, ok. This is getting a bit complicated. It is definitely do-able though. Can I ask why you want to do it in the first place? Is it just to avoid using their software for control?

The first thing you need to do is configure the motors to accept step &amp; direction input so they can pretend to be stepper motors. In his first response to you, Jeff is saying (I think) that you don't need all of the cables and stuff mentioned in sd_cnc.pdf because you can use the snabhub as a USB-&gt;serial adapter. So, if you plug all the motors into the snaphub as usual and connect the snaphub to your computer via USB you should be able to start at section 4 of sd_cnc.pdf (note the part where it says you should mechanically disconnect the motors from the printer at this point). This consists of running NMCTest.exe to connect to the motors, find sensible values for the step gain and to tell the motors to accept step &amp; dir inputs. You will only have to do this once.

Once you have done ALL of section 4 you get to the part where you need to rewire stuff. Now you need to look at the table at the start of section 5 and find which wires within the cat5 cable correspond to the step, dir, enable and gnd pins on the pic-servo sc board. 

~~Begin by carefully cutting around the cat5 cable at the end furthest from the motors - just through the sleeve. You need to remove a section of the insulation. Once you've done that find the wires you previously identified as step, dir, enable and gnd within the bundle. Cut through them next to the connector and unwind them so they are free. The free wires will go into the RAMPS board and control the motor, all of the other wires left in the bundle will go into the snaphub through the connector and provide power. Keep a set of spare unaltered cables so that you can reconfigure the motors if needed. If cutting through the sleeve like this is too difficult you could buy a cheap crimp tool and some connectors - just be careful to get the wires in the right order in the connector.~~ **See below.**

You can see here (http://www.pololu.com/product/1182) where the pololu driver get its step, dir, enable and gnd connections. Find the header sockets on the RAMPS board which would provide these (based on where each pololu driver would sit on top of the board) and connect the wires in the right order. This part is important, as you could potentially break your motor if you get it wrong. The only obvious way this might happen is if you connected something up to Vmot by accident, so don't do that. I think most other mistakes would just result in nothing happening, but be careful anyway.

At this point you should be good to go... Your steps/mm will probably be a crazy value depending on what you chose as a step gain earlier, but apart from that everything should work. In theory.

Let me know if you're confused about anything!

TRUE,theultimatehero2,,,"I have never posted on r/books as I have no authority to critique books or slug it out with all of you well versed book worms. As an EXTREMELY casual reader, let me explain my perspective.

I read Looking for Alaska about 4 years ago. It was actually the start of my interest in reading novels again after I had graduated High School and celebrated that I no longer had to read books for English class. LFA resonated with me. Particularly it was astoundingly easy to relate to. It feeds an easy reading story of a character that is profoundly LIKE ME. Maybe not exactly like me, but similar to how I picture myself and my place in the world. 

As it was a kind of launching point for me it lead me to learn the importance of immersing myself into a book. By seeing myself in the role of the main character it really felt like my story. Sure it follows the same blueprint: Too smart for his own good, unobtainable love interest etc. His novels are heinously popular not only because he has 'Internet Fame', but because many of his readers come from a similar background to his. The characters and stories are what we want to think of our own story to be. 

This thread disappointed me a bit. Not that everyone should love John Green, but because everyone hopped on the hate wagon and lit their torches. This is the kind of book that gets young people like myself (4 years ago) interested in reading. It's not about complex, perfectly reasonable and realistic story lines. It is however about showing the reader there are reasons beyond passing classes to read a book, you might even find you learn something about yourself along the way. 

Edit: This post got a bit more response than I expected so let me respond here:

The comments in this thread have changed significantly since I first saw it. There were numerous people posting early on with very little reasoning just to 'hate' on John Green. That was disappointing to me. As it seems now those posts have been pushed downward and much more well reasoned posts have been brought up, which is of course, good :)

Another thing to point out, I realize this book is not for everyone. That's what I mean when I say ""his readers come from a similar background"". People that like his book are probably normal, everyday, geeky people. The same people like to think they resemble his characters: extremely charming, lovestruck, witty and bound for 'happy ever after' blah blah blah. That's why it is accessible, some people like to cheer for who they *wish* they were, not who they really are. No not everyone feels this way or sees themselves in his characters.

Matthew 6:25: “Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothes?""

But this also addresses the other sins of the old covenant as being impossible to uphold.  The entire sermon on the mount was focused on telling people, ""It's impossible for you to live sin free.  That even thinking lustful thoughts is having sinned like adultery.  That even being angry is to sin, not just murder.""  The entire beginning of the sermon was dedicated to basically telling everyone, you're shit out of luck if you try and get into heaven by living sin free.

In the sermon he also emphasizes how to live a life seeking a relationship with Christ (living in the image of the father) and how through this you can seek to enter the kingdom of heaven.  This was the premise of the new covenant.  That Christ died for your sins because it was impossible to live a sin-free life/salvation under the old covenant.  To seek salvation through Christ you must pursue a life in his image where you:

* turn your cheeks rather than retaliate,

TRUE,protestor, points,4∆,"Current top level comments here are not trying to change OP's view. And more importantly, are misrepresenting the stance of [enthusiastic consent](http://www.doctornerdlove.com/2013/03/enthusiastic-consent/) (you can find a lot about it at Google, [here](http://persephonemagazine.com/2012/05/why-do-people-hate-the-concept-of-enthusiastic-consent/) and [here](http://www.ourbodiesourselves.org/book/excerpt.asp?id=19) are another texts). This view was popularized by the book [Yes means Yes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes_Means_Yes). In my understanding, OP is against the idea of enthusiastic consent, or perhaps support it but think it doesn't apply in his case.

Can you clarify, OP?

Anyway, the point of enthusiastic consent is that your sexual partner should be interested into sex, and not just let you have sex (or merely ""agreed""). Quoting that first link:

&gt; The idea of enthusiastic consent is all about making sure that your partner is genuinely into having sex… that you are getting clear and unambiguous signals that he or she wants to fuck. It’s the difference between “Dear God I want to fuck you right now” and “Yeah… I guess, whatever” when they really mean “no”.

In your case, you were doing other activities but was generally attracted to her, and eventually was convinced into sex. Your experience wasn't damaging, I suppose. But consider that some people may be vulnerable due to various circumstances and have trouble to properly deny sex. For example, emotionally vulnerable people may have trouble denying the sexual advances of their SOs, for example. In those cases, the lack of resistance may not mean that the person didn't suffer an aggression.

Your exact experience wasn't rape, in your own words. But we could perhaps insert a few elements that would perhaps not change the overall picture, but could make the experience increasingly more coercive, to the point that some might consider it rape. For example:

TRUE,MagicNoodle,,,"Mr. Leroux, could it be you? We met one foggy night during the war. It was near 5 o'clock as I awaited the train to Pantin. The train was late, as many were, due to the constant fear of air raids. As I stood there, staring into the cold void of the thick, foggy air, a man slowly walked into the station. He wore a long overcoat, a fine bowler hat, and his musky cologne carried in the breeze. It smelled of leather and elderberries. As he walked closer, he raised the brim of his hat. His deep blue eyes seems to be lost in the cold void that night, but just as the light of the nearby lantern met his face, our eyes locked with the power of a thousand suns. Who was I to reach into the nothingness and find such beauty. He walked right up to me as my body seemed to crumble within his eyes. He embraced me by the small of my back, dipped my slightly and kissed me. My world was shattered. It felt liked the frigid lifelessness of a stray dog's tongue--hanging lifless out of its mouth. It was as if the pup's tongue just sat there on my face as my eyes broke away and looked around--looked around for some sort of meaning of all this. By this point, the train arrived, and only then, did he pull away and board the train. I stood there in disbelief, unable to move. The doors eventually closed and the train slowly steamed into the foggy abyss. That was the last I saw of Mr. Leroux. Is it you, Mr. Leroux?

On the one hand you have a perfectly formed F#m9, with a 3rd, and 7th, simple as can be chord name that accounts for all the notes present.

Bear in mind, even though you ignore the 5th in the chord name if it's omitted, you can't do that for the 3rd, so if you want to call it Amaj7/F# you have to account for the missing 3rd, so Amaj7(no3rd)/F# is the correct chord name if you choose to go that way.

So, on the other hand you have an F#m9, a simple root position m9 vs a 3rd-less maj7 with a 6th/13th in the bass.

Working on the ""simpler is better"" basis it would be better to call this F#m9, simple, everyone can pull one out from the top of their head.

A situation where you might want to use the Amaj7(no3rd)/F# over F#m9 is if, say, the song starts with an Amaj7(no3rd) and the bass moves down to F#, so you would use this to show that only the bass is moving and the Amaj7 continues over it.

It depends on context but, like  said before, simpler is usually better.

No. They are gestalt entities, unified figments of the imaginations of tens of thousands of loyal cereal company employees, shaped and moulded by shamans on retainer, reinforced by the idle adoration of myriad children. The mind of a child holds prodigious power that is rarely tapped.

Where you have it backwards is that these mascots' service is not in promoting cereal. In fact, it is cereal that promotes the mascot. Breakfast companies compete with one another for childrens' attention by filling their products with ever more sugar, chemicals of addiction, and other gimmicks and novelties like shapes, colours, textures, and prizes. These are mere tools to convey the image on the box to the breakfast table, to fixate each child's attention on the tulpa - the thoughtform, the gestalt entity, the genius loci of the infosphere - to empower them with the latent energy of attention for fifteen minutes per morning.

For you see, the mascots do battle on humanity's behalf against enemies too terrible to comprehend. Creatures from dark places. Slithering things that crawl through the cracks of human intellect. Entities born of dark emotions, of fear, loathing, and hatred. Demons that cannot be known, for their recognition drives men to madness. Why do you think cereal mascots take the forms they do? Fierce tiger, king of beasts. Agile, quick-witted monkey. The vampire, immortal lord of the night. Vernal avatar, the rabbit, father of a thousand. These creatures are **warriors**, embodying strength and cunning.

At the same time it's disappointing for them to put out the misinformation that female bisexuality is, ""Not as much of a problem,"" because, ""Men find it sexy."" 

Firstly since ~75% of bisexual women have experienced violence and *bisexual women are at the greatest risk of violence of all people of all sexual orientations* ([""This makes bisexual women the number one target of sexual and domestic violence in the world, followed by bisexual men \(47.4%\), then lesbian women, heterosexual women, gay men and heterosexual men.""](http://www.gender-focus.com/2013/12/21/violence-against-bisexual-people/)), that is a wrong piece of information to put out there. 

In a world where women are at an increased risk of intimate partner violence to begin with and where bisexuals are at an even greater risk of violence, especially with the complications of trying to balance the emotional needs of male and female lovers and queer and non queer lovers and communities and the potential for strong hurt feelings in lovers when the bisexual doesn't manage to be socially skilled and salve everyone's hurt feelings, that is damaging information to put out there. It is not accurate to say that bisexuality, true bisexuality is all good with straight male lovers because in reality it puts bisexual women at vastly increased risk for intimate partner violence. 

I would be willing to hazard a guess that a large proportion of the intimate partner violence that bisexual women experience comes from straight men who got into the relationship thinking that bisexual women's feelings for women were something that was merely there for their titillation, and something that was there to cater to their sexual needs. When the bisexual woman then has feelings for women which conflict with meeting the straight man's sexual needs or she loves her more than him and expresses her bisexuality in a way that doesn't revolve around him, this is a very painful situation that he is completely unprepared for. It's like the pain of a breakup + the pain of a woman who is expressing her sexuality in a way that doesn't revolve around men's needs. 

For the NYT to put across this view that straight men are all good with bisexual women's sexual orientation when bisexual women are the group MOST LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE VIOLENCE FROM STRAIGHT MEN is unfair to bisexual women. The more that men read articles essentially erasing female bisexuality, the farther away they will be from accepting it and the more violence bisexual women will face because their straight lovers cannot accept who they are. 

This perspective is also invalidating of the sincerity and depth of bisexual women's feelings for women, it suggests that female bisexuals don't actually care deeply about women or have ownership of our feelings, it's just something cute for our male sexual interests. 

No no no, these are *my feelings*, they not for men's titillation, they are my feelings.

TRUE,blauman,,,"I've researched &amp; thought about empathy a lot because I've been victim of un-empathy.

Empathy occurs when you understand others hurt *(taken from Jeremy Rifkin [a very reputable person who's a political advisor for the EU] when he says [""If you think about the times that we empathise with each other... it's always because we've felt their struggle""](http://youtu.be/l7AWnfFRc7g?t=4m20s))*. 
Ultimately, if you don't understand how hurtful things are to others, you will not empathise, and you will act in a 'immoral way'.

An example I like to use to illustrate lack of empathy &amp; the power of empathy is how one of the worst ""crimes"" in history, the Atlantic Slave Trade was allowed to happen &amp; how it was addressed by understanding of the pain it causes. 

The Atlantic Slave Trade was one of the biggest immmoral events in history and wasn't even defined as a ""crime"" at one point... *(which is also why I think pointing out why things are wrong, doesn't stop people from doing it. I.e. The law defining what things are wrong in society, doesn't stop people from breaking it. So spending billions on the [""politics of punishment""](http://youtu.be/c2tOp7OxyQ8?t=21m48s) is not the way forward in addressing immoral behaviour in society; which is what Bryan Stevenson implies [- an extremely reputable human rights lawyer who spends his life trying to address the issue of punishment, and who knows more about it than most of us.](http://www.ted.com/talks/bryan_stevenson_we_need_to_talk_about_an_injustice.html))*

It wasn't defined as a ""crime"" despite it being based on the thinking that black people are inferior &amp; can be used as slaves, making it ok for [Americans, the British &amp; Europeans to raid Africa of ~10million people.](http://abolition.e2bn.org/slavery_45.html) Where's the *basic* human empathy worldwide!?

It was addressed by educating people on how it really hurt others, instilling empathy. [I.e. William Wilberforce publicised evidence to the public that Slave Trade really hurt people, which lead to British parliament taking action to abolish it due to public pressure.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_slave_trade#End_of_the_Atlantic_slave_trade)

Because one of the most immoral ""crimes"" in history was addressed by instilling empathy, I think to change people's behaviour, we shouldn't be so focussed on ridiculing, name-calling &amp; expressing our disapproval; it likely segregates and makes people set up/reside further in their mini community like /r/TheRedPill , or stormfront, making it ok for them to continue having those unempathetic opinions. We should focus primarily on educating people on understanding how things hurt people - to instil empathy.

Every individual has the neural ability to change what they think about something. What you think/feel about something isn't ingrained for life, we all have brains that display neuroplasticity, allowing us to change &amp; learn. Some evidence on why empathy is very real to all humans &amp; how it changes the brain are: [here](http://youtu.be/BG46IwVfSu8), [here](http://youtu.be/l7AWnfFRc7g), and [here (this guy won a Marie Curie Award for such studies)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Keysers)

TRUE,[deleted],,,"I'm a feminist, but I believe that there are problems with the language that you're using.  Speaking of privilege seeks only to promote guilt in a wide spectrum of human beings who share only in anatomical traits.  To say that all white heterosexual men enjoy privilege casts as negative the very things that should be promoted to be enjoyed by all people.

That language neglects that some of us are poor, suffer neurological and physical conditions, come from a wide array of family backgrounds, have different social statuses based on resources, criminal, and educational records, and exhibit personalities as diverse as all of humanity.  The color of one's skin, what lies between one's legs, and whether one prefers different, matching, or no genitalia in a partner or lack thereof have nothing to do with whether we are deserving of respect and moral equality.

That language singles out white, male heterosexuals for different treatment from others based on nothing more than biology and anatomy.  That IS sexist, racist, and heterophobic.  You don't realize it, but you're perpetuating exactly the perception that you claim does not exist.

Rather than attack a basic level of decency and respect by singling out one group to hate based on their apparent receipt of such, it should be promoted that this imaginary notion of privilege be extended to all people as a benchmark of the exact goal that we seek to reach.  Anything else only uses biological markers to single out one group of people to blame for all the world's problems.  That is exactly the opposite of what feminism should be about.

Though, there are many factors that you need to consider, such as frequency and how sensitive the rest of your circuit is to noise. Also, you may be able to mitigate some of these problem through your design. For example, add in some additional EMI filters. 

Another trick for reducing EMI is to use paralell ground and power planes. This creates a capacitance that is good for shunting high frequency noise, it's called the ""image-plane effect"". When the ground and power are not close they can act as antennas, and this is when you have problems.

TRUE,tomrhod,points,6∆,"Just a note OP, I can't access your medscape article, it appears to be behind a paywall, so that makes it difficult to respond to it.

But having looked into the schizophrenia thing with a lot of sincerity myself, and being a long-term daily user for various reasons (some medical, some not), I can give my perspective.

Firstly, if schizophrenia was correlated to marijuana usage, you would see higher rates of schizophrenia in areas of the world with greater usage of weed, but that hasn't happened. Schizophrenia is a genetic condition, not one brought on by marijuana. For some people, marijuana usage can be a triggering incident to activate latent schizophrenia, and in fact there are many triggering events in life, usually brought on simply by stress (see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causes_of_schizophrenia)). [For instance](http://healthland.time.com/2011/02/07/marijuana-linked-with-earlier-onset-of-schizophrenia-in-research-review/):

&gt; ...none of the data linking marijuana use and psychosis can prove causality or sufficiently explain why rates of schizophrenia have remained stable or even declined since the 1950s, while marijuana use has increased exponentially. Unlike rates of cigarette smoking and lung cancer, which rise in tandem, marijuana smoking rates in the population do not correlate with higher rates of schizophrenia.

So you can't ""catch"" schizophrenia from marijuana usage (although again, [everything is debatable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causes_of_schizophrenia#Cannabis), and use should be avoided before brain development is closer to completed around 18/19), but it can trigger an earlier onset in susceptible individuals. Being aware of family members with it and how that might affect you is an important part of being a responsible adult that can make choices for themselves about risk vs reward. Since schizophrenia affects, at most, 1% of the population, 99% of people won't have to deal with anything like that.

As for ""schizophrenic symptoms,"" that sounds a little vague to me. As I said, I couldn't access the article, but if they define it as I imagine they did, then technically they're correct. Marijuana usage can cause certain symptoms that correlate with schizophrenia -- vivid internal hallucinations, minor visual distortions (wavy fields, etc), auditory hallucinations (brief, inexact, but still), confusion, negative thought loops that seem to spiral out of control and leave you anxious, etc. Yes, those are all things that people with schizophrenia experience as well, but that's not necessarily meaningful as we could apply the same thing to many types of legal drugs, too. Every drug has side effects, but with the recreational ones, every side effect seems to be magnified because of its prominence as a DRUG and not merely a ""pharmaceutical"" drug.

As for physical health, people can ingest or vape marijuana instead of smoking it. In fact, I found that smoking it was the worst part of the experience, and often left me hacking up things after a long time of usage (plus it was a much harsher experience overall). Vaporizing removes the need to burn it, and thus you get more out of it, there's no potential harm from smoke (as there is none), and the high is much smoother. This assumes a good vaporizer (like the Volcano) and not a crap one as is so often seen.

But I have never seen a study linking long term marijuana usage with increased rates of cancer either, whether smoking or not. There has even been research on THC -- the main active compound in marijuana -- and it's anticarcinogenic properties, but research is ongoing and inconclusive at the moment.

Mental is something else that's difficult to define. It obviously caused issues for you, but I can tell you I went through a similar period. It wasn't so much the weed doing it as it was something happening in my life that it exacerbated. Without being able to deal with that stress, the marijuana turned against me and shined a light on my anxieties and fears in a much more pointed way. This is often the case, in my anecdotal experience, with people having similar issues.

Nonetheless, two anecdotes don't make data. But I think you can see that, much like any drug, it affects people differently, and potentially harmful effects can be mitigated or eliminated entirely with proper research into it, into one's own family medical history, and with a keen eye towards listening to one's own body. If you don't like what's happening when using it long term, then you stop. And you did! That's how it's supposed to work.

I mean marijuana wasn't entirely negative for you either, was it? Yeah, towards the end it was negative, but you wouldn't have smoked it for a year if you weren't enjoying yourself.

And once again, just because something was one way for you and your body and personal biochemistry, doesn't mean it will be for most other people.

**EDIT:** One thing to add is that there is evidence that heavy marijuana use can lead to lower cognition and IQ levels in adulthood if used a lot when you're young (under 18/19) (although there have been [criticisms](http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/23/us-australia-cannabis-idUSBRE90M14C20130123) of such studies).  So if you do use marijuana before then, try to not use it that often (maybe every few months).

But to be safer, wait until you're 18 to dive into it, or even 20.  You have your whole life to be a stoner, but only a few years where your brain is becoming formed.  So try to avoid excessive use of anything that could alter that unnecessarily.",0,1388866214,,0,1388956592,1,cehbghi,t3_1uen6w,t1_cehbghi,t3_1uen6w,1431798692,272,FALSE,changemyview,t5_2w2s8,272

You'd think that with him being the son of god, STDs wouldn't be a problem, but Jesus hung out with a bunch of whores and lepers back in the day, so his cock is absolutely covered in open sores, puss, scabs and general nasty bodily fluids. He grabs his cock at the base and starts furiously jacking off. Scabs are flying through the air, and Buddha is getting covered in pus. So Buddha grabs Jesus by the torso and rips open his stab wound and starts eating it out like it's a pussy. Buddha is covered in puss scabs and blood and starts to foam at the mouth. He stops eating out Jesus and starts fucking the gaping hole in Jesus' side. Vishnu steps in and grabs Jesus, Buddha and himself all around the neck and strangles the shit out of everyone while simultaneously jerking himself off. Now Jesus's face turns black and he dies from lack of oxygen. Vishnu and Buddha start to devour his corpse  piece by piece, really tearing into the flesh, ripping out eyeballs, real passion of Christ type stuff. It's especially brutal because Vishnu uses three hands to tear at the flesh, and one to jerk off, where Buddha only has the one hand to tear at Jesus with. Of course, using the other one to jack off. At the point, the timer on top of the Marmoset cage has gone off, and a herd of wild, rabid, hungry marmosets all descend upon the scene like some kind of blood orgy. You see, they've been locked in that cage for days. The stench of all the dried crusty monkey shit and diarrhea, plus the blood and organs from the ones they killed is so powerful that it literally causes Buddha to pass out. Now there is a proverbial tide of marmosets, all competing with Vishnu for the chance to eat and fuck Buddha. Fortunately, he has enough fat rolls that every mouth and dick is satisfied. Now Jesus comes back to life, but most of his body has either been eaten or fucked to bloody pulp, so he's really just an oozing mass of puss and blood and sweat. There is so much sweat, I almost forgot about it all. It's not the kind of sweat that you get from going to the gym for a few hours, but it's the kind that collects right where your ass crack stops and your taint begins. It's like, 99% humidity, 110 degree weather kind of gooch asscrack butt sweat. So Jesus comes back covered in what is essentially Santorum, and starts eating Vishnu's asshole. Not like how gays do it in pornos, but more like a hyena eating the asshole of a dead, decomposing elephant. Tearing into it with his teeth, really getting the job done. While that is going on, Vishnu starts to fist Jesus, and the Marmosets all descend into another shit throwing, puss eating, cock smockling blood orgy.

Intelligence agencies such as the NSA were created in an age where nationality mattered more, before the internet and the end of the Cold War changed the paradigm and made us a more global people.

At its core the NSA is charged with protecting American interests technologically by any means, but its role is outdated.  More and more Americans want America to meld in with a more equal global climate.  It's exactly what happened before the Civil War.  Most people saw them selves as a Tennesseeian or a Georgian than an American, but America had to go through a painful change to catch up with how industrialization made our world smaller.  Now its happened again and we are struggling to adapt, with a block of power set firmly in an old world where America as a nation matters more than the global economy or culture.

I imagine many at the NSA are honestly confused about why Americans care they are spying on the Swedes or Russians.  They wouldn't understand that we don't view them as any different from ourselves anymore since we can hop on Xbox Live and have a chat with any of them as casually as we do with our family and friends at home.

TRUE,lol_donkaments,,,"Trap as a genre suffers from rigidity right now.

Hip hop beats themselves are very straightforward, there's relatively little room to mess with the fundamental 808 kick timings, with snare hits on three, claps on each beat, 16th note high hats with 32nd fills, etc.  Hip hop has gotten away with recycling many similar sounding ""beats"" (I hate that word) because what's on top of them - the vocals - are what people really care about, and are different every song.

Trap doesn't have this to the extent hip hop does. Things start to sound the same. Not only is there rigidity in the ""beats"" of trap, the synth lines themselves are severely limited in a creative sense by a lack of tonality.  (Almost) every trap song is in a minor key.  Beyond that, it's rare to find chord progressions in drops, and sometimes even in songs.  What's most limiting here though is that the synth melodies tend to hinge on the tonic (the note of the key the song is in), and move one semi-tone up, or one or two semi-tones down, and not much more.  8 measures into almost every 16 measure drop (90% of all trap drops) the melody is just moved up or down an octave... 

This is all to say, trap, like hip hop, is a mostly percussive genre, not a harmonic one.  The reason house, trance, hardstyle, dubstep, etc. have longer musical half lives than trap is because they have a much larger tonal toolkit at their disposal. Major keys, minor keys and other modes are all fair game.  Obviously this is the case, because they are held to an even more boring standard rhythmically - 4 to the floor kicks - but they're still around, and there is still wide diversity between tracks.

Trap is undergoing divergent evolution currently - on one side the genre will continue polarizing itself more towards hip hop, with lyrics at the focus, and the trappiness of the accompaniment being an afterthought (think Ace Hood's Bugatti). Movement will continue in the other way towards influences of melodic EDM genres.  So basically, from how I see things unfolding, if trap is to continue as more than the cute hiphop/EDM gimmick of 2012-13 we're going to have to see a broadening of what is standard.  The melodic toolkit needs to be expanded.  The 808 kick + snare + claps + hi hat, etc. framework needs to be elaborated on and experimented with by some musically inspired people.  Basically, we need trap's equivalent of Mozart or Beethoven to come around and have the musical vision to say ""this sounds sick but THIS would sound even more dope.""  We have a few of these people now (RL, Baauer, and Bro Safari come to mind immediately, imo) but we need more.  If more and more talented people with great ideas get into trap production, the genre will live and continue to be interesting, if not, it'll fade away as quickly as it exploded over the last year and a half or so.",0,1388869967,,0,FALSE,1,cehd23c,t3_1uet32,t1_cehd23c,t3_1uet32,1431799476,71,FALSE,trap,t5_2qx81,71

Imagine a 6 foot (meter if you wish) long piece of wood. You want to cut it into 3 equally-sized pieces. How long will each piece be? Of course the answer is 2 feet long because 6/3=2. Now cut a 6 foot piece of wood into 2 pieces, the result of this division is 3. Cut a 6 foot piece of wood into **one piece**...

This always makes people stop and think... ""cut it into one piece.?? but if I cut it then won't I automatically have more than one piece?"" The answer is yes, so the solution is not to cut the wood. leaving you with one piece of wood that is 6 feet long. 6/1=6. dividing by 1 is essentially the same as doing nothing. 

Finally, cut a 6 foot piece of wood into **zero pieces**... You should see why that won't work. You're basically asking someone to take something that exists, a piece of wood, and make it no longer exist.

People always say ""BURN IT!"" and think that they are very clever, but if you burn a piece of wood, you have not 'cut it into zero pieces', but you have transformed it into many millions of pieces; ash, gasses, smoke, etc.

TRUE,ghin,,,"An obsession of practicality without a care for meaning in their lives. Where I'm from, no one gave a shit about learning.  They wanted the A.  That's all they wanted so they could get in to their fancy college with a big name.  They didn't care about history or chemistry; they took classes to look good.  At the end of my senior year, my English teacher said to my class: ""You are all, by far, the worse generation I've ever had to teach in my entire life.  You all get the best grades yet you're the worst students.""  We were all grade grubbers.  Analyze Shakespeare? Easy.  Care about Shakespeare? God, no.  After having graduated high school, I still find it true.  In college, most people I know are in majors that are predicted to do well within 4 years time.  If I asked a person why they were in that major, they wouldn't say that they liked it; they would say: ""because it makes money."" 

My generation has been scared shitless by all the stories of jobless degree carriers that they seriously lose any value in their education.  They don't find the things they learn *meaningful*, they find the things they learn a means to an end.  They don't care how cool calculus is, they just need to know how to take a derivative so they can pass a class and add a degree to their resume.

I find people my age have zero meaning to their lives unless it's ""get a job, make money, retire.""  How absolutely *dull*.  This generation is plagued by this obsession of practicality.  ""If I don't major in yadda yadda, I won't get this job! Therefore, I'll be in this major.""  

You end up with a generation of people who can *do* things, but *don't care* about what they're doing.  I find the current generation is struggling to find meaning in their lives, which makes them obsess over money, material objects, and superficial things.

TRUE,2bABee,,the dentist of love,"I think sexual compatibility is a red herring for the bigger problem of seeking instant gratification. Obviously you want someone who meets your needs, but there is a difference between a person who won't meet them and is willing to with time. You can easily determine that from conversation. Anyone who is emotionally invested in you should be willing to meet your sexual needs within reason and work towards pleasing you. That's just part of being giving and generous in a relationship. 

Most of my relationships were pretty lame sexually. So I have sought out via OKC more sexually driven and kinky people. Largely however, our personalities and values do not mesh at all, and my relationships have been with people who have narrow sexual horizons because I find myself far more compatible with them. It's a bit of a bind, but I am who I am. I'd rather try and work with someone who I can get along with day to day than seek out sexual gratification from someone I cannot respect as a person. 

I'm in no rush. To me time is not 'wasted' with people, even if things don't work out. I spend almost four years with a partner who was a dead fish sexually, but it was fulfilling in lots of other ways. We were together over six months before we slept together, and that was fine by me.

I don't mind putting effort into connecting with people at all, precisely because I'm not in it to 'get something out of it.' That entire mentality morally irks me, and is probably why I can't engage in casual sex. I might be able to do FWB, but that just seems boring and too limited to retain my interest. I'm greedy, I want the whole deal or nothing.

The more I think about the more I realize I just don't think about sex/relationships with any of this terminology. It just seems bizarre and transactional to me in a way that seems dehumanizing. I don't interact with people for them to fulfill some subset of my perceived needs, I do it because I want to interact with people who will force me to grow and make me a better human being.

I produce a massive quantity of art that never gets seen, a massive quantity that rarely gets seen outside of its intended context, and then these anatomy studies, which is my hobby and which I enjoy showing off. 

Yes, this is ...like my 5th. But these aren't simple pieces of art you do in a day. These take days, weeks, or months depending on the artist, how much time they have, how fast they work, and how much of a perfectionist they are. So if you want to go back to the first time I tried one of these realistic portraits, I've been learning this kind of specific portrait art for about 2 years.

Every Chief who has ventured here over the centuries has looked up to the light and imagined climbing to freedom. So easy... So simple... And like shipwrecked men turning to sea water from uncontrollable thirst, many have died trying. I learned here that there can be no true despair without hope. So, as I terrorize Kansas City, I will feed its fans hope to poison their souls. I will let them believe they can survive so that you can watch them clamoring over each other to ""stay in the sun."" You can watch me torture an entire fan base and when you have truly understood the depth of your failure, we will fulfill Irsay's destiny... We will destroy Kansas City and then, when it is done and Kansas City is ashes, then you have my permission to die.""

TRUE,DanReggins,,,"At first I moved to Costa Rica.  Lived in Latin America almost 4 years.  If you are an American man, I do NOT recommend moving to Latin America without a professional sponsor.  They overwhelmingly do NOT like Americans and this will affect every aspect of your life (outside of tourism that is; we're the best tippers.)

I also had some savings that I used until I got a job leading expeditions for G Adventures.  

Right now, I have my company and savings I earned from 2.5 years in Iraq and Afghanistan.

You asked -- you know what I left behind in So Cal?  Oh man, I can feel the hamstering coming on, but hey, we support each other here, right? 

Nothing.

Because I had fucking nothing.

I'm a CISSP, about to finish my Masters in Information Assurance.  I've been an MCSE since 2003, but also an MCITP:EA and MSCA for 2012.  CCNA since 2001.  After 7 years of working in So. Cal, you know what the best fucking job I could get was?

Desktop support.  (Help desk.)

I simply could not get even interviews for anything better.  Recruiters outright refused to look for anything for me other than help desk.  I had my own successful internet company running too -- but was told to take it off my fucking resume!  I had proven myself more capable, but it was like the world was telling me that they'd never let me be more than a low level piece of shit.

I have no family.  Well, technically I do, but in reality I don't.  I'll leave it at that.  

Finally, let's talk about women.  It's a big reason why we're here.

Well, I didn't have any.  Say what you want, but now I'm spinning plates.  Much is different now, but nothing that I would think that should justify me going from 0 to plates.  

I know that I didn't have everything going for me.  I'm only 5'10, blond, and didn't have a good job.  I'm also not materialistic.  I accept the negatives that come with that.  I just don't think that I deserved nothing.

That said, I still had spending cash, dressed well, and was in shape.  Not good enough.

I had nothing.  But who got the stupid, vapid california cunts?  A meth addict ""friend"" was popular.  So were the pasty high-school dropouts who offered, literally, nothing.  And you know where I saw the largest number of HOT women?  

When I visited a friend in FUCKING JAIL.

I couldn't believe the number of REALLY, drop-dead gorgeous women there with fucking LOSER criminals.  Listen man, I could understand an attraction to a successful criminal like Pablo Escobar, but a fucking loser who got caught stealing a $50 stereo? Really?

And you know, I had recently done a successful score myself.  Won't say more than that but it was a helluva lot more than $50, and I sure as hell didn't have it on my record.  But I guess the type that aims low and gets caught is what is ""sexy"".  

As you can imagine, shit like this leads to violence.  ""Oh, really, you're going to be another plate for this drop-out pasty little bitch?  How about I fucking show everybody who the better man is right now?""  I remember, even on Christmas eve, dudes punching others in the back of the head followed by a boot there when they're on the ground.  

So, what?  Accept having and being nothing?  Kill myself?  Or do something radical?

Move to another state?  I had absolutely no evidence to suggest that this would work out for me... but I did have evidence that life in other countries would at least fix the woman situation in my life.

So, I got rid of all my shit and I left.  It's been long and hard, but I've found places that are good for me.

And as far as my career goes -- going to Iraq and Afghanistan finally forced the world to judge me on my merits. I got promoted 3 times my first year, and nobody can ever doubt me or take that away from me.  So I'm not so pissed about that anymore.

&gt;what you found? 

There really isn't anything profound out there.  People around the world are fucking shallow and petty.  If I was in a place that liked americans, my life was good.  If not, only slightly better than the US.  That said, there's little to be gained in a place that dislikes Americans unless you're getting paid. 

&gt;And How do you live on that relatively small income?

Things can be lower quality, but a lot cheaper in other places.  Subtract 50% of your rent, then 100% of your heating, your car, gas, insurance, overpriced materialistic bullshit, and you'll see you have quite a bit left.  It takes adjustment but it's definitely possible.

The rest of the courses deal with things like getting the materials from point A to point B (fluid dynamics, transport phenomena and process design), manipulating the state of the materials (heat transfer and thermodynamics), and separating material A from material B from material C (separations, heat transfer, etc.). The rest of the courses deal with problems in specific areas that can fall under the umbrella of ""chemical engineering"" like polymer engineering, biochemical engineering (which deals with things like mass production of hormones or proteins), and tissue engineering to name a few.

To get to 2601 Zuni from the Hilton:

* Just go NE on Welton 2 blocks to 16th
* Take the shuttle (Mall Ride) NorthWest to Wynkoop street (All cross-streets are announced on the PA; it is a couple stops after the Market Street Station). 
* Go SW on Wynkoop and cross the creek.
* Take a moment to enjoy the view; we have some nice pedestrian bridges crossing over Cherry Creek.
* Head across, then up, Speer, over the light rail, over I-25, and you're at 2601 Zuni.

To get to the Pepsi Center from 2601 Zuni:

* Walk back SE on Speer to Chopper Circle / Wewatta Street (It changes names at Speer; don't get lost).
* Walk SW down Chopper Circle, underneath the awesome Pepsi Center Sign / Art Installation
* Continue down Chopper to where it starts to curve (You will cross one little road labeled VIP parking or Permit Only parking - for the curious, it leads to the chiller plant / loading dock area, and the Office Tower on the back of the building). You will see a little round patio with a big Pepsi Logo made of rocks/gravel. This is the main entrance!
* Enjoy The Game!

To get back to the Hilton, if it is before 1 AM:

* Walk NE on Chopper, Cross Speer, Continue NE on Wewatta across another awesome wood-decked steel pedestrian bridge.
* Continue on Wewatta across 15th Street. At this point Wewatta curves to the left. On your left is a mostly-empty grass lot, and on your right is a set of buildings, with a sidewalk that cuts across the lot, hugging the buildings. Take this sidewalk.
* Turn right on 16th, stop at the lit sign that says Wynkoop. It has a bus map on it. The Mall Ride will pick you up here (if it is not after 1:15 AM).
* Diversion: If you want to have a pint post-game, the Wynkoop Brewery is two blocks NE on Wynkoop, at 18th. They have awesome microbrews and great atmosphere).
* Take the mall ride out SouthEast to Welton
* Walk 2 blocks SW to the Hilton
* Rest Easy!

I live downtown, and it's perfectly safe if you keep your head on your shoulders, but sadly I am working Friday night from 7 PM - 7 AM, so I can't be your guide. Let me know if you need a hand or somehow get turned around (16th street has bus maps at every block that show where you are).

TRUE,texasflag1836,,,"You cannot become fluent in a language with DuoLingo.

It's one tool--a great one--but should be one of several you use.

I think DuoLingo teaches *vocabulary* and *grammar* well. It's NOT teaching you how to read and write with any fluency. Being able to translate a sentence from one language to another is not writing. If you think about it, all you're really doing is checking your vocabulary and grammar. Writing is being able to express your own thoughts with a degree of fluency. Do you know how to write a letter, a blog post, or even a funny text message in your target language? DuoLingo isn't teaching you that.

Vocabulary and grammar are foundational skills, but they are not real language learning. There are four basic competencies in language learning: Listening, Speaking, Reading, and Writing. To reach a level of fluency, you have to actively practice each of these.

Fortunately, there are online resources that can help with all of them.

**Listening**: This is probably the easiest one to get online. You can find countless youtube videos, podcasts, newscasts, etc. in your target language at Beginning, Intermediate, or Advanced levels. Spend 30 minutes a day actively listening to something that's challenging but comprehensible.

**Speaking**: To practice this one, you're going to have to speak! You can find cheap online tutoring through iTalki, or find a language exchange partner or tutor in your city. You should be trying to get through a set amount of time without using *any* English. Start with 5 minutes, then build up from there until you can be in conversation for an hour at a time using only your target language.

You'll probably find that you know very little about how to actually speak! What's the most natural way to greet a friend? What kind of slang or bad grammar do people constantly use when speaking, that's never mentioned in the textbooks? You'll also find that listening to a native speaker in casual conversation is much different than listening to the radio or watching TV! You need to learn this stuff, and the only way to learn it is from a native speaker who's willing to be patient with you.

**Reading**: finding these resources is just as easy as listening. You should be able to find books, stories (I found a lot of free ""leveled"" Kindle reading textbooks), news, current events, blogs, etc. in your target language. Anything that you would normally do in English (like browse Reddit!), teach yourself to do it in your target language. Change your Facebook, Reddit, Gmail settings to your target language. Change your computer and smartphone language settings: now you're going to have to learn the menus in your target language! Get creative with it. Anything that's not for your actual job, you can switch to doing in another language.

**Writing**: this is something you need to practice often, hopefully daily. Start with writing short (5 sentences) monologues. Basic stuff. I love coffee, for example, so I'd start with a short paragraph about why I like it, where I buy it, how I make it. Use simplistic grammar and vocabulary at first--the point is that these are *your* thoughts, coming from your own mind, expressed in your second language. You can post it to Lang-8, and native speakers will correct your writing and give you tips. If you have a tutor or language exchange partner, they can help as well.

Again, look at your behavior. What do you do every day? Could you switch from English to your target language? Could you express yourself just as well in another language? Every Facebook comment, reddit response, email, Google search, ask yourself, ""How would I do this in my second language?"" Write that stuff down, post it to Lang-8 or show it to your tutor.",0,1388893100,,0,1388894613,1,cehl8w9,t3_1ud6lp,t1_cehl8w9,t3_1ud6lp,1431803431,9,FALSE,duolingo,t5_2t6ze,9

TRUE,conservativecowboy,,,"I was a female medic in both DS/DS and Operation Iraqi Freedom in 03/04. I was in Iraq and Qatar in DS/DS and Iraq only in Iraqi Freedom.

In DS/DS I treated a fair amount of Iraqi soldiers that were burned. I had very little real world experience at that time and was only an EMT-B in the civilian world. 

For Iraqi Freedom, I was called up from a National Guard unit and attached to a mounted ADA unit, but also did unmounted patrols with both the US and Polish infantry. By that time I was a paramedic in the the real world and had extensive experience in trauma.

Technically I was a POG (people other than grunts), but I earned the respect of the other soldiers in the unit and being a female was never an issue. I carried my own crap, leaned to pee standing up (thanks P-Mate), went days without showers, was the only female with 57 guys and it worked. It also helped that I was older than most of the guys in the unit. Also, there is something about being a medic that we are given more responsibility/treated differently than other soldiers in the unit. 

I became the defacto marriage counselor, financial counselor, just mental health counselor though I had no training in these things. This wasn't just for the enlisted either. I was asked my opinion on things I had no knowledge of militarily. I was placed in situations with Iraqi women that I certainly had no training in. 

Combat is more intense than anything I could ever describe. It is loud beyond belief. It is confusion, fear, anger, shock, center-shocking and by that I mean physically, your insides are shaking from the noise and concussions of explosions. It's also invigorating, sometimes incredibly funny, terrifying and earth-shatteringly sad all within a very few minutes. 

I was in several convoys when I was with the mounted ADA and experienced an IED explosion. This was before our vehicles were up-armored and we were driving around sitting on steel plates. Except it was 110 degrees and those things are freaking hot. So we'd convoy bare and hope like hell there were no IED's. 

First the explosion would cause your ears to pop and your chest to lose air. Like some giant was just crushing your chest preventing you from inhaling. In reality it was the concussive pressure from the shock wave. I was in the vehicle behind an IED explosion and watched the vehicle fly up in the air and come down burning. The gunner manning the .50 cal flew from the vehicle and ended up with a couple of broken bones, but nothing major, the driver was thrown clear but had a TBI, and the Iraqi Lieutenant (he was born in Iraq, but raised in the US and graduated from USC or somewhere out there with an engineering degree) was still in the vehicle. Now the vehicle is burning, but he is still in there grabbing/collecting his gear. 

I'm treating the gunner, the guys are setting up a perimeter defense, I'm calling in a 9-line and I'm screaming at the LT to get away from the vehicle. Finally he scoots away. After the medevac comes in and the two injured guys are gone, I asked the LT what the hell he was doing.

He said he was getting his gear because otherwise the supply sergeant was going to charge him for the lost gear. So weren't not taking fire, but we could have at anytime, the vehicle is burning, there are live .50 rounds cooking off, I have a medevac en route and he's worried about being charged for missing equipment. That is the kind of craziness that makes you break out in giggles.

But the giggles stop when a 23 year old that was hit by a sniper's likely Tabuk round asks me to look if his junk is still there. He lived, but I don't know that he would ever have sex again. 

I helped deliver a teenage wife's baby. She was about 16 and her husband was gone. We just happened to be passing through and the house to house found her crying in a back room. I had never delivered a baby, but a call to my PA and he walked me through it. 

I treated an Iraqi family's goat. The goat was their supply of milk and cheese that they sold, but it was sick. The CO had a relative that was a vet back in Wyoming and between the three of us, we got the goat healthy again.

I am a combat vet, but the military insists on telling the world that women aren't in combat. We've absolutely been in combat for over a decade, but the American public wasn't ready to hear that. So instead we were attached to infantry, engineer, ADA, and cav units so the military can say there are no women assigned to combat units. But you better fucking believe we were and still are there.

You see, we had just lost our mother the previous summer, and shortly after we had discovered Pokemon.  We rented Pokemon Red over and over again from the video game store up the street.  It was our (mostly he played as I watched, but I got him to name Magikarp to Magikrap) escape from everything.  This game meant so much to me (and I assume him as well) as it was a happy memory.  The clerk began to know us by name and knew what we were there for (to extend our pokemon red rental) until we finally beat the game.  

This was before we had internet, so the game took us forever to beat (and we were only able to play while our Dad was at work).  He played it on the Super Gameboy we had borrowed for an unintentionally indefinite period of time from our neighbors.

I had started scrounging around every single coin I could find for months.  Any time I was with somebody who paid cash, I'd ask for their change letting them know my intentions.  Most people happily gave me, a child, their 15 or whatever leftover cents.  After a couple of months of saving and scrimping, I had what I figured enough for a gameboy color and pokemon blue.

I went to the game shop up the street from my house, pulled out the 3 gallon sized bags, one with pure pennies, one with pure nickels, and the last a mix of dimes and quarters.  I said to the shopkeep, ""I'd like to get the purple gameboy color, it's my brother's favorite color!""  He looked down at my intended method of payment, looked at me (a clueless child) and look back at the bags, specifically the one of pennies.

He had an obvious internal conflict going on, until finally he said ""How much do you have here?""  And I dutifully said ""about 100$""  Without even counting, he handed me the gameboy color and Pokemon Blue.  He told me to wish my brother a happy birthday.  My brother played the hell out of that game.  He caught all 150, trading with our neighbor up the street.  He eventually got a case for his gameboy to keep it protected.

TRUE,lllllllillllllllllll,,,"When I was in high school, I had my first real girlfriend. In middle school and before, I had had a few short relationships that lasted between a couple weeks to a couple months. So when I had my first, real girlfriend, I was head-over-heels in love. 

You know when you fall for someone, how they completely consume your life? That's what it was like for me. I thought about her all the time. Literally the first thing I would do in the morning was grab my phone and send her a happy ""Good morning, I dreamed about you last night."" My grades dropped, not drastically, but enough that I fell from being salutatorian to barely in the top 3% of my class (which was a big deal in my high school). My relationship with my family, which was always a little strained but loving and caring, deteriorated because I would rather spend time with her than with my parents or my sisters.

The thing is, our families didn't like each other. Like, not even a little bit. I'm really not sure why, even to this day. I know it has something to do with my grandfather, who was a high ranking officer in the Taiwanese army. He fought on the side of the Nationalists during the Chinese civil war, and when Communists took over, he was forced out under threat of torture/death. My girlfriend's family, on the complete other hand, were utterly Communist. 

It's difficult to explain, and the way I'm describing it makes it sound very petty and lame, but the rift between our families was really severe, and was a huge issue. Nevertheless, my girlfriend and I didn't care about the ROC/PROC conflict, and only cared about each other. Against our respective family's wishes, we began dating. Eventually, as we were young and foolish, we took our relationship to the next level and had sex.

We didn't use a condom. I came inside of her.

She became pregnant.

Despite how young we were, despite the fact that we hadn't finished high school, yet alone gotten a college degree or even found a job, we decided to keep the baby. We were so in love, nothing was going to stop us from having a family. We weren't blind; we knew that it was going to be very tough on us, and that we were going to be looked down upon or disowned from our very traditional families, but we didn't care. We were *in love*.

For some reason, we kept the pregnancy secret. My parents didn't know, her parents didn't know. My grandfather probably would have had a heart attack if he knew. The only person in our families that knew was my little sister, who supported our relationship at the outrage of my parents. What we were thinking, I don't know. It's not like we were going to be able to deny it once her belly became so big. We were still living in our parents' houses.

Then, the worst day of my life occurred when she was 3 months pregnant. I can remember everything in vivid detail. We were in school, walking to class, holding hands and being happy, when she stumbled. I looked at her, her hand squeezed mine as tight as I can ever remember, her eyes rolled upwards, she gasped. 

She fell.

I remember collapsing by her, throwing my binder to the same and clutching her face while teachers ran towards us while others kept the students from stepping on her. I remember waiting by her side when the ambulance came. I remember sitting by her when she woke up. I remember when her parents came to see us, with crazed eyes of equal parts concern and rage. I remember when the doctor came in and told us all that my girlfriend had had a miscarriage.

The next thing I remember was my girlfriend's father's face in front of mine, screaming at me in a jumbled barrage of broken english and chinese, while my girlfriend and her mother cried. He ended up literally shoving me out of the room, and that was the last time I saw her.

It's not like she died or anything. Her parents just refused to let her see me. After getting out of the hospital and dealing with a nosocomial infection, she transferred schools, and their family moved away after graduation. The only information I ever found out about her after was from a mutual friend, who coincidentally went to college in the same town that they moved to. Last I heard, she's healthy again, but has a haunted look on her face. She started doing drugs, and was kicked out by her parents. I've tried looking out for her, but I was never able to contact her.

It's funny, looking back at things with full hindsight vision, when I'm able to see what a complete and utter idiot I was, but this experience is something that I look back upon both fondly and in horror. So, the most regrettable sex I've ever had was my first time, when I got a girl pregnant, permanently fucked up her family, and probably ruined her life.

Edit: Thank you everyone for your sympathies. I've only been able to share this story with a few people in person, so typing this all out in an anonymous forum was very cathartic. Your words of concern have really made me feel better about this whole thing.

I'm glad that many of you have taken an interest in that part of my life, and I've gotten several comments and private messages about contacting her online (my favorite was the PM ""contact her you stupid fuck""). I've tried to contact her online in all the ways that we used to talk to each other, and I haven't been able to actually find her.

As for sharing public information, I'm pretty hesitant to talk about her name, where we're from, and where her family moved to. Being incautious was what got us into this situation in the first place, and I'd like to think I've learned from the ordeal.

TRUE,DeeMI5I0,cookie,"15; The best, I love you","Firstly, OP, I will deal with the first clause of your question: What is the reason behind the popularity of selfie threads


One of the most basic, shared traits among humans is a primal need for attention. But perhaps we should back up a little bit. 

Every single *basic* action humans take is driven by a fundamental desire to survive long enough to pass our genes onto our offspring. From eating and drinking, to attending college. Though we have developed greatly as a species over time, I argue that, in an underlying, essential sense, we have not developed at all.

Let me give you an example. School. From our childhood, we are taught that one must always strive to do well in academia. Those that are most successful will move on to the greatest colleges, and, as a result have an advantage in the job market. This advantage may allow that lucky subsection to find a job and settle in financial security earlier than the other subsections of the population, paving the way for (you guessed it) children. Those who have better paying, more stable jobs will be in a much better position to produce and care for offspring.

Now, you may be wondering how this applies to seeking attention. Well, dear reader, basic human instincts cause us to be attracted to beauty. This beauty is a fabrication of our prudency in ensuring the survival of the human race. For example, big breasts are better to produce milk for an infant. Strong muscles are a sign of ability to provide for children through work. Though muscles are no longer as a reliable sign of a stable income as they once were, our instincts war on! Nonetheless, when one is largely considered “beautiful”, “handsome”, or “pretty” they are offered a huge advantage is the playing field of possible partners. When one perceives themselves as beautiful, or at the least more suitable than average, they will therefore want to ensure that as many people as possible are aware of the fact that they posses favorable traits for offspring. Finally, (as many people on this sub attest) confidence is considered very attractive. So, if trying to get as many people as possible to see your face is caused by you believing that you are attractive, then that simply *exudes* confidence! 

In conclusion, teenagers submit their photos to /r/teenagers in an attempt to spread the knowledge of their desirable genes and in order to appear more confident—thus making the possibility of the production of offspring more likely in our extremely outdated instinct’s mind.

TRUE,Mrs_Frisby,,,"Actually I think NH is a great example ... just not of success.

About 7 years ago the [Free State Project](http://freestateproject.org/) started a libertarian take over of new Hampshire.  They figured out that due to its low population and governmental structure in addition to its relatively large population of native libertarians the local state government could be taken over if enough libertarians re-located to NH.  They set a goal of 20,000 immigrants that would agree to move to the requested counties to flip seats in the state government.  Essentially they became an invading army taking government away from native NH residents.  

And what have they done with it?  [A lot](http://www.unionleader.com/article/20131011/OPINION02/131019875/-1/news).  Libertarian reps are the most active lawmakers in NH by far.  Over half of reps last year proposed no laws at all.  Leading libertarians sponsored dozens each.  For Example:

**Food Safety Showboating**

You know how ~~Ron~~ Rand Paul made up his own board to certify himself instead of being certified by the existing medical board?  NH libertarians are trying to make their own FDA instead of the federal FDA.  To do this they repeatedly pass laws exempting local producers from following FDA rules.  **[but they didn't ask local producers if they wanted this first](http://www.nhbr.com/January-13-2012/House-bill-seeks-to-exempt-N.H.-food-from-federal-safety-rules/)**. Turns out ""FDA approved"" is something farmers want stamped on their products.

&gt;I think the intentions are good -- I think the sponsors are trying to promote New Hampshire agriculture and farm products and make a favorable business climate for them, and we appreciate that,"" said Merrill. ""But we have some concerns about how it could actually play out.""Those concerns, she said, ""relate to food safety and the reputation of New Hampshire food and products."" 

So they have passed 5 laws in the name of libertarian ideology that are illegal on their face, won't stand up in court, waste taxpayer money to defend, and local farmer's don't even want (you don't know what you want, we libertarians know what you want).  Mission Accomplished?

**Libertarian War On Women**

NH Libertarian leaders Dave Itse and George Lambert are *very concerned* about a man's FREEDOM to beat his wife.  Did you know that before the libertarians came to NH if a policeman was called into a domestic violence dispute and found a wife beaten black and blue he could just arrest the husband without a warrant!?!?!  Mere probable cause was enough.  They attempted to correct this with [House Bill 1581](http://legiscan.com/NH/text/HB1581/id/507520) which would explicitly strike existing language permitting arrests in volatile domestic abuse situations.  These libertarian bros also filed bills to make it harder to enforce restraining orders.  Locals were outraged, papers across the state ran articles, the Republicans turned on them (the GOP wants us pregnant, not beaten to death), and after the tidal wave of anger rolled in even the sponsors didn't dare vote for their own legislation.  But its revealing that they thought they could get away with it.  

They could get away with passing additional [restrictions on abortion](http://www.boston.com/news/local/new_hampshire/articles/2012/03/29/nh_house_votes_to_ban_abortion_after_20_weeks/) and legislatively harass abortion providers because the GOP stood with them on that.  So they've added waiting periods, ""conscience clauses"", banned government money going to any organization that provides abortions even if they are the most cost effective organization to provide a service ( and effectively preventing NH hospitals from providing abortions because hospitals need government money to operate ER rooms ) and other bullshit.  Because nothing says Libertarian like government monitoring of women's bodily functions.  There is a reason so few women are libertarians.  We know you'll sell us into slavery to get yourself a tax break.  

**NH Libertarian Love Affair With Sin Taxes**

This is a case of paying attention not to what people *say* they believe but at what *they actually do* when given power.  In theory, libertarians hate sin taxes.  Using taxes as punishment?  Bad!  Anti-Freedom!  Its just a cheap asshole trick to make someone else pay your fair share of the taxes by saying something they like is bad and then punishing them for it.  So what has happened to sin taxes in NH as the libertarians took over?

In 2005 the sin tax on a pack of smokes in NH was 52 cents.  As libertarians keep refusing other sources of tax revenue and creating more and more budget holes they've looked to sin taxes to fill in those holes and sin taxes on tobacco have risen again and again to $1.28 a pack today ... more than doubled!  Thanks to libertarians [NH is ranked 9th in the nation for the percent of its revenue gained from sin taxes](http://xfinity.comcast.net/slideshow/finance-10statesprofitsin/new-hampshire/).  And it does this *without casinos*.  Most of the other heavy hitting states on sin taxes have legal/taxed gambling.  


**On the subject of Smoking**

You'd think a libertarian dominated state would be leading the way on legalizing cannabis.  But they didn't even get around to medical use until this last June and even then they created [the strictest Medical MJ laws on the books](http://www.nashuatelegraph.com/news/1011460-469/cannabis-care-new-hampshires-law-is-one.html) requiring you to actually have a medical problem and to complete normal treatment regimes first using medial marijuana only as the last resort.  Meanwhile folks in non-libertarian Washington and Colorado have had medical use for years and now have full legalization.

TRUE,ParadoxInABox,,,"Now I can finally tell this story! I met this guy at a party, we'll call him C. He seemed very cool, and had just a bit of a southern accent. I pretty much spent the whole party talking to him. We laughed, and drank, and smoked, and laughed more. It was great. So, a few weeks later, we actually go out on a ""date"", drinks at a local bar. I show up and he's already there, which is nice, but the magic we seemed to have at the party was nowhere to be found. The conversation was stilted and awkward. He talked a lot about the girl he had just gotten out of a seven-year relationship with back in Georgia. But, I'd had a few, and he was hot, so when he suggested we go back his place I thought why the hell not. We get back to his place and are making out, which is nice, but that's when things pretty much started to fall apart. The guy is pawing at my boobs, like he's never seen a pair of tits before. He takes his shirt off, and he's thin but pretty hairy (which normally is fine with me, but his body hair was coarse and thick and very odd looking). I started to think to myself ""this is kind of like having sex with a bear,"" due to the hairiness and the pawning. Then he went down on me, and CLEARLY had no idea what the hell he was doing. He basically just slobbered all over my junk, nowhere near the clitoris. I tried to guide him, both verbally and by shifting my body, but he was resistant to any suggestion. Then, he tried to put it in without a condom-- an absolute no-no for me, especially with random dudes I meet at parties. I pretty much had to DEMAND that he use one, and he got all butt-hurt about it. I don't know why I didn't leave right then, but I wouldn't have had to wait long, since he lasted literally 3 thrusts and done. I tired to give him the benefit of the doubt by trying again in the morning, and nope, again, three thrusts and done. I left and never spoke to him again. I now refer to him as The Bear Slug, as having sex with him was simultaneously like being mauled by a bear and attacked by a slug. Definitely most regrettable sex. 

Edit: As I'm off to bed and a few people have asked: I stayed due to having too many drinks to drive home safely, and I was trying to give the poor guy the benefit of the doubt. I should have just left and called a cab, but we all make bad decisions when we're a bit hammered and haven't had sex in six months.

TRUE,[deleted],,,"
It was the end of high school, I had recently come off of a break up that was because of circumstances rather than a lack of love. My ex had started dating a friend of mine which sucked, cause ya know.. Love, right? 

Ok so I had been flirting with a girl who I knew wanted to hook up in hopes of gettin my mind off my ex. We did, it was shitty sex since she just kinda did nothing. 

Here is where it gets regrettable. She and her friends (she told them all) thought it'd be funny to prank me. I was set to move out of the country for study and they didn't like that I wasn't going to be staying in the US. So she told me she was pregnant. I lost it, I felt sick, depressed, ashamed and like my life was over. I almost canceled my study abroad but she insisted I went. For the next 8 months I was constantly checking up on her, making sure she was ok and that the pregnancy was going well and to do whatever I possibly could.

Around 7 months in she stopped talking to me and finally outed that it was a prank. She thought it was funny and didn't have the guts to fucking come clean about it when she got too far into the lie. 

Months of worrying and planning, sleepless nights and depression and pure terror and she was just ""joking"". I've got problems trusting now. I have a really hard time letting people in and I find it incredibly difficult to date now without having anxiety attacks. I hope they all had a good laugh.

TL;DR Chick lies to me about being pregnant for 8 months. Got the ball rolling for some serious trust issues and emotional damage for me in the following years.

TRUE,PedanticSimpleton,,,"So I met this girl in a long line at a burrito stand. She was there alone so when we got our burritos I asked her if she'd like to sit with me as we ate. Her eyes were pretty, her sense of humor was sharp, her teeth were terrible, her tits were huge and my carnitas burrito was a tad overcooked; but all in all it was a nice little ""date."" Anyway, she ended up coming over to my apartment that night and we just sat on my couch and got drunk and talked. One thing led to another and we started making out on my bed and slowly groping and disrobing each other. Now I'm what you call a fucking gentleman so I gave her about 20 min of foreplay followed by about 5 min of ""bean flicking"" (is that the PC term?). Anyway it was getting pretty hot and heavy so I went to go put a condom on but she stopped me and said ""no sex"". So I went back to bean flicking a tit sucking for another 10 min and then again tried to go for my condoms, but once again she stopped me and said ""I don't want to have sex"". And before I could say a word she hunched over my loins and started sucking my dick like a freezee pop. So i wasnt exactly in a position to complain. But I guess her jaw got tired cause she stopped with the oral and switched to just a hand job. I've always been quite the fan of the hand job so I didn't mind... At first. But she had the worst handjob form of all time. She gripped my member WAY too tight and focused 100% on the tip, it kinda felt like she was trying to milk a goat. This handjob wasn't doing anything for me and since sex was apparently off the table I kept trying to force her to do oral by constantly shoving my penis towards her face. When I did this she would suck it for a bit but would just stop and go back to the fucking goat milking, at which point I would shove my dick back in her face and we would start the rotation all over again. We stayed in that weird blowjob/handjob limbo for like 15 minutes before I just gave up and accepted her shitty hand job. The problem was it didn't feel great so i just couldn't fucking finish. But you got to admire her spirit because she just kept going with that hand job for what felt like 45 min. Towards the end of it my dick started to kinda hurt from her rubbing in the same spot so tightly, and looking back I probably should have just showed her how to work a fucking penis, but I was drunk and she was kinda a stranger so I didn't. Anyway, after 45 min of that I realized that there was no way I was going to orgasm to this, so I just threw her off me, crawled on top of her, dry humped the shit out of her thigh and ejaculated all over her stomach. I guess I was kind of annoyed cause I just rolled off of her, put my boxers back on and went to sleep. I'm not really sure when she left but she was gone when I woke up. Relieved, I got up to take a piss and that's when it hit me, a searing pain on the tip of my penis. I look down and there were red blood stains on the inseam of my boxer shorts. In a moment of absolute horror I ripped my boxer shorts off and examined my dick. And lo and behold this chick had ripped the skin off my penis. My dick had been peeled like it was a fucking banana. There was actually loose skin that was hanging off the end holding on by a thin thread, the entire tip of my penis had been rubbed raw and bloody by this chicks shitty hand job. I'm not really sure how I didn't feel it when it was happening. Adrenaline I guess. Anyway, i ignored the girls phone calls after that and had to wrap my dick in gauze for about a week and a half just so I could comfortably wear pants. Worst fucking hookup ever.

Tl;dr: I got a handjob from a lobster.

TRUE,Tylerdynamo,,,"A few years ago I lived in Philadelphia, was in school and working part time at this swanky restaurant cutting meat all day. I had just got out of a really long, unhealthy relationship. Immediately following the breakup, I was pretty much willing to sex anything that would allow me to do so.

So I went out to a club and ended up hitting it off with an adorable blonde girl, well call her Erica. We went back to my place and the usual drunk adult activities ensued. All-in-all it wasn't bad, yet.

The next morning I woke up at like 5 or 6 a.m. and it was still pretty dark outside. So we went at it again then too. That's when things began to go awry.

She passed right back out post-coitus. Normally I would have probably done the same, but for some reason I just couldn't. Something wasn't right. My spidey senses were tingling. I sensed impending doom.

The sun began to peek out over the balcony and into my windows, illuminating the bedroom with that orangey-golden light that lingers only momentarily. I looked down at Erica. The way the light made her hair glow, and bounced off of her fair skin was poetic.

The thing that was NOT poetic was the giant pool of period blood that was now staining a sizeable portion of my ex's baby-blue sheets.

I immediately inspected my junk. Complete disaster zone. We may have to amputate. NO. We can still save this, I thought to my self.

In a panic I rushed to the shower. This is going to be very awkward when she wakes up. Hopefully, she'll hear me in the shower, get up, realize what's going on and she'll take off to save both of us.

But she did not take off. She did the opposite of take off. When I returned into the bedroom I saw that she had got dressed and was rooting through my things. And she was holding one of my paystubs. I was making good money and had a pretty big place for center city Philly. But, the paystub she was holding was a bonus check for some like measly $185 or something.

""How do you afford this place?"" she asked.

Note: It was at this point I noticed that the tote bag she had been carrying all of her things in was made of a fine burlap, very eco-friendly. The letters PETA were embossed on the side. However I didn't immediately register what those letters stood for.

""How do I afford this place? Oh I'm a butcher.""

The color immediately drained from her face and her hand darted upward, kind of cupping her mouth.

Me: Are you ok?

Erica: Oh god I think I may be sick.

Me: What's wrong with you? You hungover? Need some water or something?

Erica: No I'm a vegan.

And with that she darted into the bathroom and proceed to release the contents of her innards in the most violent fashion all up in my bathroom. Not out of sickness, but out of hatred and disgust for my very existence. I am not even shitting you.

So now I have my ex's sheets covered in nosy vegan period blood (the most potent of period bloods) and my bathroom covered her puke.

It was at this point I said to myself ""Maybe I should not have done the sex with this strange woman. I am regret.""

""Fuck it, I'll just go make breakfast I'm strangely hungry.""

But every cloud has a silver lining. And every butcher has raw pork sausage marinating in something in their fridge. And not like store bought precooked, bratwurst. Like raw animal meat, stuffed in intestines, marinating in hot sauce and porter. It looked like a failed lobotomy in a ziploc bag. It was terrifying, even to me.

She emerged from the bathroom

Me: You ok?

Erica: Yeah.

Me: Hungry?

Erica: Yeaaaah.

Me: YOU WAANT SUM SAUSAAAAAAAAGE ARRRRRRRRRRR!!!!

And she darted out my apartment, and I never saw her again, and it. Was. Awesome.

**TLDR; Morning sexed vegan. Period blood on my junk and bed. She looted my bedroom and found pay stub. Puked all over my bathroom when she found out I was a butcher. Rebuked her with raw sausage.**

TRUE,throwaway348293,,,"My wife has depression and no sex drive.  I love her.  She does dozens of things really well.  She only has two flaws.  Sex and depression.  She is genuinely working on both, but depression means I can't slip up or else she is sensitive enough that it can ruin her emotionally for days.  And I'm on the other end, I'm dying for intimacy all the time.  I want her, and I want sex.  All the time.  And I'm finally realizing what it means to be married to someone with no sex drive.  She doesn't know how to genuinely initiate, intimacy is soulless, and I can't fantasize about anything because I know it won't happen.

One night she comes in right before bed and mentions she wants to try sex again, to see if she can figure it out.  It's been weeks since the last attempt.  She's dead tired, eyes are red, and she's yawning.  But she's stubborn and insists on trying.  I know this can't end well, but I know if I turn her down she'll feel like a failure.  So I need to accept.  Foreplay is nonexistant other than a footrub for her.  She asks that I start, and I'm so afraid of what's to come that I try desperately to force myself to stay soft so I can can have a way out of this.  I don't want to see her suffer from her depression any further.  Doesn't work, my physical body does its thing, so sex is a go.  

She wants just missionary position and to hold still.  I try kissing her neck, she tried to like it, but she reacts and pulls her jaw down to hide her neck.  She apologizes because she's trying to like kisses.  So I try some moves instead, and she winces in pain.  I try other things, she yawns and then apologizes for yawning.  It's obvious she's not enjoying this, it's hurting her, but she's trying.  I can't enjoy anything because she isn't enjoying this.  A few months back I was in this situation, and I pulled out.  She was an emotional wreck for a week.  So I'm stuck there, in a boring position, with my face buried in a pillow because I can't do anything else with it, she's holding still, and I can't do much but move my hips.  I hated that I had to be in this situation.  But I have to climb, because she would feel like a failure if I didn't.  First time in my life having sex where I didn't want to climb but I had to.  I wasn't enjoying it, and she wasn't enjoying it, but I had to convince her I was enjoying it.  Eventually the physical body did its thing.  I do everything I can to sell it.  

Afterward she wanted to talk.  She could tell something was wrong.  I slip up.  I said it was really hard to enjoy it seeing her in pain, that I miss sex, and I'd rather sex happen when she's more awake or the timing is better.  BAM.  She's shattered.  Tears and depression follow.  Ugh.  This is my wife.  It's not supposed to be like this.  

Edit: Whoa, thanks for the responses.  Yes, she's been seeing professional help for this.  We've been working at both intimacy and depression issues for years.  We've tried dozens of different approaches at it.  We communicate about it almost daily.  We have a pretty good relationship in all other aspects of our marriage.  She's not on birth control, and she's not using and SSRI based antidepressants.  We both think that if her depression were gone, so many other issues would be easier to manage, and her drive might come back.  But depression can be a very complicated and difficult thing to fix.

TRUE,Unbroken_one,,,"Sadly, this happened to me.  I met a guy for a drink when I got off work at 8:30pm. He was the athletic director of the local catholic high school. When I arrived, he was sitting at the bar &amp; had ordered a glass of white wine for me.  (I know, I know....) long story short is that he dropped me off at my sisters house at 2:30 am (he used to live in her neighborhood), I couldn't speak coherently &amp; my sister thought I was having a stroke. Took me to the ER where my BAC was .30. She told them she thought I had been drugged. Had never seen me like this. (I am a well respected business owner in the community...if that matters.) 
Go to the doc a day later to find out the result of the drug test. They can only test for what I specifically ask to be tested for. Say what?!? From the doctors office, I call the local sex assault prevention center to ask the name(s) of what to tell them to test for. They tell me to go to a different hospital for a rape kit. Do that. That hospital notifies police. Police detective calls me at midnight the next day. Shows up at my house at 1:00 am &amp; is there til 4:00 am. He assures me this is normal routine for police who work the night shift. Get a call at 8:00 am that day from a captain who apologizes &amp; assigns someone else to the case. Turns out that detective #1 was a good friend of the perp. Rape kit results rushed through the crime lab (why??), &amp; 2 weeks later, case closed. The ""investigation"" was a total joke. 

I remember having two glasses of wine &amp; that is it. The total blackout for me was about 7 hours. Video showed us leaving the restaurant at 11:00 pm. Detective #2 did say that I would have had to consume A LOT of alcohol after leaving the place. Have no idea where I was from 11:00pm to 2:30 am. Could not tell you what kind of vehicle he drove that night or anything at all. 

How did I deal? Life is not always fair and I did learn a valuable lesson about being more aware. I truly believe that he will eventually be caught doing this to another woman. Karma is a B.

TRUE,textualintercourse,,,"My Ex while we were married. She hated sex. So I wasn't getting any regardless the 'foreplay starts in the morning with acts of service' BS. One morning (among many) I woke up early and cleaned the house. Our son started crying so I took him downstairs to take care of him while I cleaned. I cleaned the kitchen, bathrooms, living room, dusted, vacuumed, etc. Then I made breakfast.

I am guilty in that I always instigated / initiated sex since she literally never would. She comes down, ""Oh, you are just doing this since you want sex later.""

Instant deflation.

I power on anyway and get the entire place in order. After I finished cleaning I got ready and I left for work. After work I was taking some night classes at the university and I had about 40 minutes between work and first class. So I took some money I had saved from donating plasma (trying to pay down the credit card debt that was sprung on me 1st month after we were married) and I buy her flowers. She was visiting her Mom. I get home from School and put the flowers on the table hoping to surprise her. She gets home, sees the flowers and says, I quote, ""Oh..you bought me flowers, why haven't you done the dishes?"" Literally in the same breath / sentence...her voice went from somewhat sweet to annoyed. 

(sigh)

I go to school. I come back later and she is watching American Idol and our son is asleep. I start homework. She then said she was going to bed and to come up for the nightly prayer (Yay for Mormonism...). We pray, she goes and lays down and i finish my homework. I come up, brush my teeth, and get in pj's and lay next to her. We hadn't sex for 2 months up to that point. So yeah, I'm a guy with a sex drive, sue me. I roll over and kiss her neck. She rolls over and away. Alright I got the hint so I roll back over and am about to close my eyes and I hear:

* Her ""Hey.""
* Me: Hey
* Her: You want to have sex?
* Me: Uh..usually yes.

* Her: How's the Porn problem?  (One particular Sunday the leaders of the church we attended were flipping out about the evils of porn and the destruction it's wreaking on the family. I had broke...(We had sex about 20 times the first year of marriage...which is far from adequate..but Mormonism is a sexual dysfunctional wreck of a system.)...I looked at Porn online literally 2 days before that Sunday the first time ever in the marriage. She questioned me on it, and I wasn't going to lie to my 'eternal companion' so I told her...God..what was infrequent became close to nothing after that.
* Me: Gosh, I'm good. I haven't looked at it. Whatever, have a good night. (I roll back over to my side of the bed)
* Her: Fine, get it over with.

Nothing. Zero. Zilch. Nada is worse than obligation sex. Nothing. It's terrible, pathetic, pointless, stupid, and it's not even that easy to have the attitude, ""Doesn't matter, had sex"" excuse. So, not sure if it was spite, frustration, hate, or what, but I was like, ""Ya know what? Fuck it."" And I did. Worse. Sex. Ever. 

Life is too short. We are divorced now and I'm out of that religion.

TRUE,vogueadishu,,,"Several years ago, I was at a bar with a couple of new female coworkers (strippers, all three of us). A couple of their guy friends showed up, we were all having fun, decided to go drink some more after the bar closed. Went to a hotel room but I was so drunk that no alarm bells were going off. Anyway, I went into the bathroom and when I came out the girls were gone. The two guys said they ran to buy cigarettes, then offered me a drink. I took it, not thinking anything of it. I was drunk but not at my limit (I get drunk quick but can actually tolerate a lot before getting sick) so I thought it odd when I had to throw up. I blacked out while puking... I came to a few times, and while I will spare the details I can say that I was violated in all 3 holes and I do know that I said no several times. I remember hearing one say ""she's moving too much. Hold her still, I'm about to fuck this ***** in the ass."" I came to around 9am with no clothes on, the door propped wide open, and my money, my cigarettes and my phone were gone, as were the guys (the girls had never come back). I called down to the front desk and asked them to call the police. Filed my report, went and got a rape kit done (if I didn't watch so much SVU I probably would have taken a long hot shower). They blood testef me but it had been long enough that there wasn't enough in my system to prove anything (supposedly). Got a horrible detective who hates strippers... I positively id'd them out of a photo lineup and the girls who set me up. There was plenty of dna evidence. The detective in the end said she wasn't going to pursue the case because they told her that I was a hooker and she accused me of being upset that I didn't get paid. I didn't leave my house for almost a year except to go to work. Those guys and the girls had been in the club we worked at so the doormen had their images printed out. Once the detective decided to accuse me of being a whore, the manager of the club have all doormen permission to beat them senseless should they ever show back up (which is the main reason I kept working. I felt safe there)... Sadly they never did, lol. 

I spent a year leaving my house only to work and go to therapy. I then spent another year sleeping around trying to get back the control and power that they had taken from me. It took a while but I finally grew from it. I'm still devastated that those two got away with rape and I really think those women should have been charged as well, but nothing I can do about it now. It's been about 8 years. 

TL;DR: two guys drugged and raped me with the help of two females who set it up. They all four got away with it because the detective was a jerk.

TRUE,theglasspainting,,,"It happened on July 28th, 2001 sometime in the late afternoon. I was eight. My mother and I were on a walk with our dog in a very quiet neighborhood. I was eating an orange popsicle and was wearing a brand new outfit my parents had bought for me. 

Suddenly, there was a loud squealing noise- the sound of tires grinding against pavement. My mom and I looked around for the source of the ghastly screech; across the street was a faded blue Cadillac. The driver (an 80 year old man with a revoked license) kept hitting the gas and the brake, the gas and the brake, the gas and the brake over and over again. The Cadillac almost looked like it was jumping. And then, suddenly, the car was speeding in reverse...right toward us. We tried to run into a yard to escape, but we were like magnets. My mom pushed me out of the path of the blue beast just before she was struck. 

The car literally ran her over. She was like a rag doll beneath the wheels. 

The driver hit a tree in the yard we had sought refuge in. I thought it was over. It wasn't. 

The man then put the car in drive and ran her over AGAIN. This time, he the struck the fence in his yard across the street and came to a halt- there was smoke coming from the hood of his Cadillac. I was throwing blood curdling screams at him. YOU IDIOT! YOU IDIOT!

I ran to my mother the check and see if she was okay. She wasn't. She didn't look like the mommy I knew. Her lip was split wide open, the rip spreading down to her chin. Her nose was broken and bleeding, the skin beneath her eyes already blackening. She was struggling for air. I could tell that she was slipping. She looked up at me and asked me to hold her hand because she thought she was dying. Her eyes were far away. I touched her hand and told her I loved her. 

But I didn't linger. I ran for help. I knocked on doors, I stopped cars, I screamed for people to call an ambulance. 

Finally, after what seemed like hours later, the ambulance came. The paramedics and EMT's did their work and took her away.

I cried in the arms of a stranger for a while. She rocked me back and fourth. Calming me. I wish I could thank her for that. I still think about her every now and then. After that, they took me to the hospital in a police car.

My dad was a fire fighter (he is now retired) at the time and was on shift. The department put his truck out of service and he and his crew were at the hospital a few minutes after I arrived. My dad scooped me into his arms and we said a prayer. 

The doctors told my dad that with the injuries my mom had sustained, she had a 5% chance of survival. They said if she did survive she would likely suffer from brain damage and would be paralyzed. 

But she didn't die. And she doesn't have brain damage. And she can walk. After three months in the hospital she was released. She has tons of metal inside of her body, has quite a bit of nerve damage, and still struggles with pain daily. She never complains. If you saw her today, you would never know that she had been in such a terrible accident. 

I lost my childhood on that day. I was too afraid to play outside for a long time because I was in fear of vehicles. I couldn't cross the street without breaking into hysterics. The sound of cars driving by our house at night terrified me. While my mom was still recovering, 9-11 occurred and then I was afraid of planes, too. I was in therapy for a long time. 

I was far too young when I learned the realities of life and how easily it is taken from us. But, really, I'm not bitter about that at all. I had the privilege of witnessing a miracle in her recovery. I learned the true value of life and that I need to LIVE every second of it. I learned to love my family deeper. My relationship with God is stronger. I never leave the house angry with my loved ones and I always make sure and let the people I love know just how much I adore them. I learned these things long before most of my peers. And really, I am thankful for that.

One thing I want to warn you about is that you seem, from the picture, rather young to have already lost a parent. From my experiences, people don't think about this, so when I'll switch between saying parents in the past tense, but dad in current situations, people question me on where my mom is. Not maliciously (although sometimes nosily),  but in the process of conversation. Be prepared to factually mention that she has passed away and be ready to bulldoze through to continue the conversation. If I linger on my mom, I'll either get upset or the person will say something hurtful while trying to be nice. Being able to function in society without having to constantly censor any mention of my mom has saved my sanity.

Best wishes to you and your whole family, and my condolences.

Less than two years ago I had an old friend show up at my work and tell me how she had just been raped the day before and really needed someone to talk to. Being the nice guy I am go out and get a soda with her at a bar. 

Night goes as one expects except for the last thing I remember is the girl running her hand over my glass and saying we have such a good chemistry in the way out bodies mirror each other, taking drinks at the same time and such. Wound up having sex with this girl and having no idea why. Immediately flash to the next day, nothing comes back to me, but I wake up naked with a girl on my bed.

I haven't been in a relationship since really. I'm lonely, so I've tried setting up different kinds, but I'm too slow to act on things (kissing stuff like that) and can't do a fwb, or anything physical.

TRUE,o0DrWurm0o,,,"NIF's lasers are primarily neodymium amplified. They actually start out with a tiny (you could hold it in your hand) fiber laser that emits a precisely shaped pulse into the rest of the system. That shaped pulse is then amplified by bouncing between a bunch of [neodymium glass slabs.](http://www.wired.com/images/slideshow/2009/05/gallery_nif/nif_4b.jpg) Then the light is cavity-dumped (they take the reflector off the front), split up, and shot at the fusion fuel. 

Actually, right before it hits the fuel, the IR light is doubled twice in frequency, bringing it from IR to UV. If you've ever picked up a green laser pointer, they use Nd:YAG crystals which emit at 1024nm and then halve the wavelength to 532nm with a frequency doubling crystal, which yields a nice, bright green. So, if you stuck another frequency doubler on a green laser pointer, you'd be making the wavelength NIF makes. 

The funny thing about NIF is, really, the technology is quite dated. Flash-lamp pumping? That's like how they did the very first laser. NIF is just a giant version of very well understood laser concepts; in many ways, the optics aren't all that interesting aside from scale. When I toured NIF, they told me they were going to replace their giant, building-sized solid state lasers with couch-sized fiber lasers (which are much more technologically up-to-date), but I'm not sure if that went anywhere.

Back story;

After my wife lost her job, my job alone couldn't support my family. We were forced to spend every last dollar to move from Lansing MI to San Angelo TX to live with her mother. 

I plan on building another, but we'll see how long that's going to take. Time to find another job, a place to live, etc. I'll be drooling over everyone else's post until then.

TRUE,BLSmith2112,,,"Alright I need to get this off my chest. The ignorance here is over the brim. The reason for the lack of zombies is because of how the game controls item/loot spawning as well as zombie spawning. The reason for this alpha test was to exactly test server stability. This is how development works. Start small, make core product work, then go bigger. You are getting a large chunk of the DayZ experience even with these bugs.

So the very fact that people are complaining about lack of zombies needs to be complaining about their own lack of knowledge on this subject. Dean Hall said eventually you'll see over [2000 spawned zombies](http://www.pcgamer.com/2013/11/12/dayz-standalone-needs-more-optimization-before-release-says-dean-hall/), 25,000 loot items, roaming hoards between towns, and so much more. You can't complain about zombies clipping through buildings on one hand, and then on the other say that you want more zombies. They have to fix whats broken first, optimize where they can, then you can have your zombies. 

The fact that zombies walk though buildings is obviously something they are working on. The mod did not suffer from this nearly as badly, and the fact that DH's development team now has full access to the engine files instead of a limited API means that they have much more at their disposal to address these types of issues.

You have over a year until beta people. Sure, duct tape has no use in the game, but I think the community might want to use some on themselves for the time being and read some damn development blogs, AMAs, [patchnotes](http://forums.dayzgame.com/index.php?/forum/76-announcements-information/), etc. This is what you signed up for when buying the game. Dean Hall himself said DON'T BUY unless you want to help with it's development.

TRUE,ClashM,,,"Their aim is fine after episode 3, they just often end up with their hands tied. 

When they raided the Tantive IV above Tatooine they suffered fairly minimal losses considering they were being funneled through a single, heavily guarded, choke point. The local constabulary on the surface was admittedly fairly useless, but their primary purpose was patrolling the spaceport and collecting taxes in the arse end of the galaxy. That's the kind of boring dead end assignment they give to soldiers who made an enemy somewhere up the chain of command. It's understandable they'd be slow to react to Han blasting his way out. 

The troopers on the Death Star had nothing but emergency drills for weeks to the point where they doubted the intruder alerts right up until they were under fire. Before they could even get fully organized they were ordered to allow the intruders to escape so that the ship could be tracked. They showed remarkable self control allowing themselves to be shot at while purposefully missing to put on a good show. 

Nothing to see on Hoth. They overran the Rebel defenses and captured Echo Base in what looked like less than an hour. Two hours tops. 

On Cloud City the troopers arrive mere minutes before the Falcon touched down. In that time they managed to take control of the entire facility without disrupting operations and without alerting the majority of the civilians. That is more impressive than mere marksmanship if you really think about it. Later when Luke arrived the troopers were told to herd him to Vader; again showing an iron will as they purposefully fail to shoot someone who holds no qualms about killing them. 

On Endor the troopers didn't use camouflage or take proper precautions to secure their perimeter. Both Vader and the Emperor were interested in capturing Luke alive so they very likely ordered the ground forces to remain conspicuous for fear they might lose their prize down the sights of a sniper's scope. In the subsequent battle the Imperial reinforcements to the garrison were overkill for a single squad of Rebels, but not the Ewoks as well. Sure they don't seem that threatening, but the fact they effortlessly heave boulders the size of their torsos onto the unsuspecting troopers below shows they're a lot stronger than they look. They're clearly adept at hunting prey much larger than themselves and when the kinetic force of a blow leaves a man on his back surrounded by dozens of little ravenous teddy bears, well... there's no training in the world that will prepare you for that one.

Also, I'm known for telling people not to can things without a recipe and not to follow advice without knowing the authority of the source, especially things on the Internet. So, there's that. My opinions. Large grains of salt.

You're correct in that oil is not safe for canning, but the bigger danger in pressure canning is that it will prevent jars from sealing properly. Jars have to exhaust when they're processed - the air has to purge out, which is why we're instructed not to tighten lids completely before processing. Sometimes a bit of liquid or vapor from the boiling contents of the jar burps out as well. Even a tiny little droplet of oil can prevent the lid from sticking down properly resulting in a bad seal and dangerous, spoiled food.

As for making new recipes safe for canning, the only way to be absolutely certain is to have it lab tested and certified as safe. The reason is that it has to be guaranteed that every bit of contents all the way to the center of the jar reach a temperature of at least 240 and hold there for more than 3 minutes. At home, you have no way to know for sure that this has happened. Too, the reason recipes have to be followed to a T is that any changes in the density of the contents of the jar changes how the heat penetrates.

It's good that you have a pH meter. It will help you with a lot of things, just not this. Right off the bat, this recipe has chicken broth in,  so it's going to be pressure canned no matter what and how long it's processed isn't going to be determined by the pH.  

And now, the moment you've been waiting for..... [The NCHFP suggests that soups are a special category and can be canned without following an exact recipe](http://nchfp.uga.edu/how/can_04/soups.html) as long as you follow the basic rules of:

No milk, cream or dairy products.
No rice, noodles or pasta of any kind.
No flour or thickeners.
Process pints for 60 minutes, quarts for 75 at the pressure advised for your altitude.

The instructions also mention using a 50/50 mix of solids and liquids. There is no instruction on canning a pureed soup. However, the Ball Blue Book does offer instructions for canning a pureed split pea soup which is processed 75 minutes for pints and 90 minutes for quarts, so obviously it can be done, though the recipe also states that it shouldn't be ""too thick.""

There you have it. Probably FAR more information that you wanted, but hopefully this helps you understand how to figure out if your soup can be canned safely!

Basically the American producers of Power Rangers look through the current Japanese sentai shows to figure out what they can make fit with their own stories.

It's actually an ongoing series of loosely connected shows, but there's so many damn shows that Super Sentai could almost be thought of as a genre.

TRUE,revoltbydesign86,,,"the fact is after a few years of service in the military, most become unfit to serve. In the Army or marines anyway. source: I'm active duty military and will assuredly be label 60-75% disabled upon leaving.A lot of people do not understand the cost of service or war. If you think the war was expensive, the care for soldiers who fought them is outrageous. Why do you think that the federal government has relied so heavily on contractors for both wars? many people believe that those guys are more expensive at 250,000 a year paychecks, but they aren't. They're cheaper! mind = blown. The legacy costs of war are astronomical. I would vote for this 100% if it were tried today.  Right now the system as it stands has the government preying on certain ""at risk"" sectors of the population. males between the ages of 17-25 who dropped out of high school or didn't, but didn't go to college that cannot find work = enlisted, 19/20ish- 27 who went college got most of a degree or graduated with a degree in something hard to find a job in (history majors, lit, political SIC,etc) = officers. The volunteerism doesn't stop people from starting wars, what it does is allow the military to become polarized to one side of the political debate 95% republican with a very small disenfranchised liberal group e.g. (bradley manning). This allows the military industrial complex to have huge sway over when wars are started. all they do is buy out the politicians on the right to pander to the military on issues important to them and most of those military personnel will never believe that they could become brainwashed or ""used"" in a system were not supporting your troops is akin to ""pedophila"". This amendment would be a far better solution, but as it stands now we will continue to have more illegal wars of aggression until the system is  changed, until the incentives are changed. Simple fix to your question is that if they're unfit to serve then a ""war tax"" for anyone who wanted the war but couldn't fight would do. Like 50% of your income or something, something large so people wouldn't be stupid about war. In a sense that is probably the amount we will all pay towards these wars in future taxes anyway. 

EDIT: Thank you for Reddit gold, I was just speaking from the heart about my experience in the military I guess it resonants. First timer thank you for validating my thoughts.

EDIT: On careful consideration I retract the statement about the draft. I may have been over zealous, people not wanting to be there was my concern, not because the military would lose effectiveness, but because I would not want that to happen to me. I think this amendment would still serve the nation much better than constantly being at war with everyone. The ""poor tax"" comment I do not retract, because searching through several academic sources I found numerous complaints that information on the amount and severity of ""waivers"" was not represented in their studies. I also found that the military admitted to loosening the standards drastically to meet demand. They did this because they failed to meet recruiting standards as early as late 2003. which would make since considering the US started another war in Iraq at that time. My opinion is my own and while it resonants with some who most likely served around the same time others who didn't find it offensive. I don't care if I hurt your feelings. The truth hurts.

TRUE,maktouch,,,"By doing ""WHERE tag_id = 5"", it will only return those where the tag_id = 5. If there's no keywords attached, it will be NULL, so it will not return, same as if the tag_id is 4. 

If you want to return only the images with keywords, without querying an exact tag_id, you could do ""WHERE tag_id IS NOT null"", or use a normal join. 

If you want to query by tag name, just add a join and query the tag. For long query, I like to split my lines btw. It's clearer this way. 

    SELECT * FROM image 
    LEFT JOIN image_tags ON image.id = image_tags.image_id 
    LEFT JOIN tags ON tags.id = image_tags.tag_id
    WHERE tags.tag = 'cats'

Joins are pretty useful ;) There's some more stuff that might be useful, like GROUP BY. 

For example, you want to know how many keywords is attached to each image

    SELECT image.*, count(image_tags.image_id) as keyword_count     
    FROM image 
    LEFT JOIN image_tags ON image.id = image_tags.image_id 
    GROUP BY image.id

Another example, you want all images with a comma separated list of the keywords. 

    SELECT image.*, GROUP_CONCAT(tags.tag SEPARATOR ', ') as tags, count(tags.tag) as tags_count FROM image 
    LEFT JOIN image_tags ON image.id = image_tags.image_id 
    LEFT JOIN tags ON tags.id = image_tags.tag_id
    GROUP BY image.id

*I'm writing this without testing, might be typos or something. Always test your queries first!*


-- edit

Also, just a few corrections in the first post. You should model your database and think about the col names. In the first post, I said ""table: tags, col: tag"". It should be ""table: tags, col: name (or title)"". That way, you prevent queries like ""WHERE tags.tag"" and instead you have clearer queries, like ""WHERE tags.name"" 


It will also translate well if you're using an ORM or if you're modeling your data in code.

 ~~$tags-&gt;tag~~ = $tags-&gt;name


-- edit2

Regarding your questions of small queries vs big joined queries, it really depends on your dataset. Joining 4 tables of 10m rows will take time. Sometimes multiple small queries are better than 1 big one, but this is more of a scaling problem and you shouldn't premature optimize. Also, if your code is made to do multiple small query, it would easier to use caching methods and stuff. For example, if tags are commonly queried, I'll prefer to have them in memcached so that I don't bother MySQL that much. 

But since we're talking about it.. I prefer to do small queries. I've worked with big data and sometimes, joins are just not manageable (I hate queries that goes over 3 secs). 

Let's add a new dimensions to the queries called ""users_likes"". 

Table: users

id|name|
--|--|
10|Mike|

Table: users_images

users_id|image_id|
--|--|
10|1

You then have to find all cats images that Mike liked.. Let's do it the big query way 

     SELECT * FROM image 
    -- Tags (btw, when a line starts with --, it means comments. Comment your big queries so you dont get lost)
    LEFT JOIN image_tags ON image.id = image_tags.image_id 
    LEFT JOIN tags ON tags.id = image_tags.tag_id
    -- Users
    LEFT JOIN users_images ON image.id = users_image.image_id
    LEFT JOIN users ON users.id = users_image.user_id
    WHERE tags.tag = 'cats' AND users.name = 'Mike'


Or separate small and quick queries with a max of 2 join each. I'm getting lazy so ill let you figure that one out. 

-- edit 3

Also... by default, the id column is an index. The key to fast querying is the index. For example, the indexes for image_tags should be image_id and tag_id. 

Another note, ""WHERE name LIKE '%LOL%'"" seems like a good idea at first but it is very slow, since it's not using indexes. If possible, use ""WHERE name LIKE 'LOL%'"". It will search for everything starting with LOL like LOLA or LOLOL but it will now uses indexes, so it'll be faster. 

But I suggest you look into ElasticSearch for searching. MySQL is not really good for fulltext searching :). 

Ok no more edits!

TRUE,splattypus,,,"Yep, that's the problems with reddit.  

There's no easy solution, because part of the problems are also part of reddit's very identity.  And the more people who come to the site every day, who heard about it by half-assed explanation via who-the-fuck-knows-where aren't interested in assimilating into the *actual* communities that exist within the subs, they want to participate and promote the community they *thought* they were coming too.  

And reddit does a poor job of explaining the differences in communities, and helping users *find* those communities that appeal most to them.

Moderators lack the tools to make any sort of cooperative effort between subs, they lack the tools to thoroughly oversee their own subs. /u/deimorz's AutoModerator is a godsend, and hopefully only the beginning of vastly-overhauled mod tools.  As good as it is now, it's still very complex and takes someone witch pretty significant knowledge to operate, and it's still pretty limited. 

The admins promote the site like crazy, saying 'we are a great community where voting is all that matters, change the world, etc etc' (you all know the ridiculous stuff on the sign-in page if you aren't running add block).  But when it comes to helping the mods, even (especially) the defaults, we all basically on our own.  It's reached that point where they want to run a *profitable* site, not a *good* site.  Time and time again the message is 'Good luck, you handle it' until they find something they want to step in and override or change. There's no communication or consultation.  'You're on your own until we wanna do something different.'

I can't say I blame them for that, but as a mod who's had to put up with stupid shit time and time again because they don't want to get involved, or do the bare minimum to handle a situation, it's hard not to be a little insulted by it.  So then where is *our* motivation? We get minimal appreciation or support from the admins, and get abuse from the users who we somehow insulted by trying to operate an appealing and effective subreddit. But let me say this, if you enjoy a sub, and enjoy the moderators, let them know. Because that's something you can't hear enough. Especially since most hear it so little as it is.

You can't please everybody.  No matter how good of a sub you have, there's always someone with a different impression, or bad intentions who just want to fuck stuff up, abuse users a mods alike, and burn the fucking place down just because they can. Nobody should still mod if they don't care about the sub, about making it good, about always trying to make it better.  But eventually it becomes less of a personal project. It starts to feel like a job. Clock in, do your work, go home and forget about it.  Mod burnout is very high in a lot of subs. It's not about the workload, clearing the mod queue is an easy job if that's *all* you do.  But its every other aspect that wears on you.  Not to mention that reddit becomes repetitive as hell everyone.  

And it does, it gets very stale.  It's to the point that you see reposts of reposts every other day. Sometimes in the same day.  The veteran users drastically change habits, visit less, whatever.  So you have the new users, the trolls, and the just-don't-give-a-damns dictating the content of the communities.  Eternal September.  

But there's no one solution to it. The subreddit system creates hiveminds, and the karma system creates circlejerks.  Karmawhores game the system, and casual users are more than happy to feed them for a cheep laugh. Overwhelmed or under-enthusiastic moderators can or will only do so much. It seems like there's more marketing admins than there are anything else, so the system is lacking and there's no collaboration between upper management and middle management. There's no saving reddit.  Every social site does the same. Eventually it collapses under its own load, and the users flock to the next new site that overs some novel feature that the last.  It won't disappear, and maybe the even the dedicated will be able to revive it under its original purpose as a web-content aggregate when its all said and done, but it's become a social site now. And not the mods, nor the admins, nor the users, nor the very website itself, is capable of handling that.

Total shot in the dark here but your girlfriend is sick of it. She recorded you because she is out of options. Maybe she truly thinks that you dont know the extent of your poisonous behaviour.

This breach of privacy thing is hogwash. How is it a breach of your privacy? It was a conversation between the two of you, she didnt record you masturbating in private. I think you are just so ashamed of how you behaved and that you will be grinding your teeth in embarrassment listening to the ridiculousness.

Frankly she had to sit and endure you being rude and offensive to her so now why cant you?  Maybe you will learn something from this. Yes her measures are extreme and yes it is jarring but maybe she is out of options.

You should definitely increase the volume of your drums since that's one of the most important parts of EDM. Sidechaining your melody to your kicks will give you the usual pumping in electronic music, thus giving an enhanced rhythmic feeling to your track. Additionally your drums will stand out more.

TRUE,ihatewil,,,"&gt; did he really think that people forgot about him when he was making that song?

Yes. Dr Dres reputation took a nose dive shortly before leaving Death Row records in the mid 90s. He became a highly dissed and ""uncool"" in the world of hip hop, and then people even started to question his skill as a producer (to be fair, people still do). For years people talked about how he's passed it, irrelevant, etc. Hasn't worked in years, takes credit for other peoples productions, slaps his name on it, and then it sells. Remember, before 2001 was released in 1999, Dr Dre had not had an album in nearly 8 years.

In between the Chronic and 2001, he had two major hits. California Love with 2pac, and No Diggity with the Blackstreet, but even by the time No Diggity came out,he was being openly mocked. In 1995 Tupac joined Dr Dres record label after having some legal troubles and interscope no longer wanted anything to do with him, coming under pressure from Time Warner to get rid of Tupac. Dr Dre was one of Tupacs heroes, but as they saying goes, never meet your heroes. Dr Dre produced three records for Tupacs album All Eyez on Me, a song called Can't C Me, and California love and the remix. Deathrow Records wanted Dr Dres name to be on the album as head producer, but Tupac kicked up a fuss stating the obvious, Dre only produced three tracks out of 27, why should he get the credit for 27 tracks and the other producers such as [Johnny J](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_%22J%22) and [Daz Dillinger](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daz_Dillinger) do not. That's just business, Dr Dre as a producer was more marketable, but Tupac was having none of it. Before the album even came out he started airing his grievences in interviews making it publicly known Dre only worked on three tracks, and in the end Deathrow changed the head producer credit to Daz Dillinger, who actually was the head producer of the album. 

People close to Dr Dre state that he never wanted the credit in the first place, other people at deathrow (suge knight) actually tried to put his name down as the producer as a business decision, but then blamed Dre when it didn't sit well with Pac. Tupac was very charismatic so people started to treat Dre differently at work, and in the end he decided to leave the company he founded because he found the work environment unbearable. He felt like he lost complete creative control of his own company because people (not everyone) did not respect him. Deathrow started signing artists without his permission as if his opinion didn't matter etc, he was getting cut out of the businesses side and the creative side too - which was supposed to be his end of the business.  


Then he made no diggity with blackstreet and although it did well in terms of charts, he got a lot of heat for it. Tupac recorded a song with a very similar beat and dedicated an entire verse to [openly mocking Dre](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=Owdl9BnxHV4#t=201). After that, he became a bit of a recluse. He stayed away from hiphop and started working on various different projects, even doing mixing work for [Nine Inch Nails](http://ilarge.listal.com/image/1165478/968full-nine-inch-nails.jpg) etc. People really did forget about Dre.

Meanwhile he was trying to start his own label, and signed a rapper called Eminem. That seems like a no brainer now, but you have to remember at the time a lot of people didn't take eminem seriously, even when his first album was out. It wasn't until his second album, the marshel mathers LP did critics really start to think ""This guy is the shit"". So Dre releases the slim shady LP, and if you didn't actually buy the album at the time, you'd just know him as the comedy rapper that made ""My Name is"". So people looked at Dr Dre doing a cameo in that video and thinking ""How far has this guy fallen? Doing video appearances with some white jokey rapper"". Around that time Dr Dre himself was working on his comeback album to shut up the critics, ""The Chronic 2"", but even people from within the industry had been trying to cock block that also. His old label bought the rights to the trademark ""The Chronic"" so he couldn't use that, so he stated he was calling it ""The Chronic 2000"" and getting around the trademark issue by making the album cover a weed leaf with just the words ""2000"" on it, so the album would actually be ""2000"" but it would look like it was called ""The Chronic 2000"". Deathrow records then created an album called ""The Chronic 2000"" which was basically 12 tracks dissing Dre, their plan was to release it around the same time as his album ""2000"", and confuse consumers into buying an anti-dre album. After that, he just ditched ""The Chronic 2000"" idea and just called the album ""2001"" to give them all the middle finger.

It was a massive success and at the time a production masterpiece. He proved everyone wrong and became one of the most powerful people in music in the last 15 years because of it.

Now its been even longer, 15 years since 2001 dropped. People are starting to say the same thing, Dr Dre takes too long to make songs, he's fallen off, he's irrelevant, doesn't have it anymore. I hope he drops one more album and punishes everyone one last more time. The dude deserves it.

TRUE,LordSpasms,,,"There's definitely something about surviving in the post apocalypse that is different than surviving in a fantasy setting.

The post apocalypse survival setting plays on a lot of human fears. The first and most obvious is the loss of humanity, both literally and psychologically. Shooting people in the face in a post-apocalyptic setting has an immediate thematic connection to the setting because it is the most obvious result of losing humanity.

Another big fear that post-apocalyptic settings instill is the fear of scarcity. Post apocalyptic worlds thrive on the feeling of dread that there are not enough resources to go around. This dread fuels the loss of humanity.

These two fears combined paint the perfect picture for a survival game. The feeling of animalistic hunting and gathering works well in a system of scarcity filled with desperate people losing their humanity.

If a fantasy survival game were to work (for me at least), there would have to be a prevailing sense of dread associated with it. I think a good example would be the Game of Thrones universe from the point of view of a lesser house or peasant. You are in a world of powerful, bickering lords who care more about their own apotheosis than the affairs of the common people. A lot of power is being thrown around, and all you can do is cling to life through the chaos.

In cold weather you don't want to let your gas tank get too low.  Over time, water from condensation forms a layer on top of the gas in the tank and if that gets into your fuel lines, pump, filter, or injectors and freezes, you're going to have a bad time as your car won't run.  A bottle of Iso-Heet helps clear out that water safely.

Depending on your level of comfort driving In snow and slippery conditions, it may be a good idea to go to an empty parking lot at night and practice drifting your vehicle around.  Being comfortable and aware of how it feels and got your vehicle handles while sliding can save you if it begins to happen outside of a controlled environment, e.g. While driving and hitting a slick spot.  If driving a rear wheel drive vehicle, be careful of icy spots.  If you accelerate while your rear wheels are on ice or snow, it could cause your rear end to swing out and throw you into a ditch or other lanes.  Front wheel drive cars will pull you the direction the wheels are facing while accelerating, regardless of sliding.  If you do begin to slide sideways, remain calm.  Panicking is what will cause damage.  If sliding into a ditch and you can't stop it, point your wheels into the ditch.  If they hit sideways, there is a high chance of damage to your steering parts (idler arms, pinion arms, control arms).  

Check fluid levels before you leave, it's never fun to see your vehicle overheat on the highway because you are low on anti-freeze (coolant).  Pay attention to cold/hot levels when checking fluids, as the cold will cause levels to appear lower than they will when the engine is at running temp.  When checking oil, the engine needs to be off to get an accurate reading.  The opposite is true for transmission fluid, which needs to be checked while the vehicle is running.

I'm sure if he showed up on our doorstep asking back in he'd be welcomed. He's always gonna be our Dortmund boy right?

When Lewy leaves, he will leavefor no money. There is not a single fan that could argue ""this is a good thing"". Maybe for the team spirit, [but his estimated value is €40m](http://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/en/robert-lewandowski/mwverlaufgraph/spieler_38253.html) and Dortmund aren't getting a cent of that. He could have done what Eriksen did, which was basically say ""if I'm not *bought* this season, I'll renew a contract so that Ajax can make money off of me. They saw my talent, developed me into the player I am, and I at least owe them that."" Lewandowski did not do this. He almost certainly would not be the player he is were it not for Klopp, and it disgusts me the act that BVB get sweet fuck-all but a middle finger for helping him become a powerhouse of football, and to make it worse he is moving to a rival fucking club. I'd rather Kloppo spent the last 4 years playing a meth-addicted hooker upfront, at least she'd know her place. 

Lewandowski, you are a prick. I hope you wither into obscurity but at the same time I wish you happiness doing so. Rant over.

TRUE,a1will,,,"                                                     ***WARNING***   

***Do not proceed unless you are unable to accept that you have been lied to your entire life.  In actuality most people have never eaten real bacon.  The insipid product sold in most stores is injected with smoke flavoring.  Besides high end butchers or artisan food producers (read as $$$$$), you will not be able to find bacon that is actually slow cured and smoked.***
 
  
 Now that I've made myself sound like a food snob (I'm really not) lets proceed.  Here's the process I've pieced together from sources on the internet.  I'm no expert, I'm merely following the advice of others, and have a pretty good hang of it.
  
  




-Start with ***fresh*** pork belly, not frozen.  This will come with the skin(rind) on.  

-Most countries outside of America eat bacon with the rind on, it will result in a crispy sort of pork rind/cracklins type of strip on each slice.  

-A lot of people remove it, I haven't found a good way to remove it (I have dull knives), so I've been removing it after smoking (it just pulls off by hand, and makes good cracklins) or leaving it on. 

-Next I cut into manageable sizes so it will fit on my smoker.  I use a Weber 18.5'' and [Smokenator](http://www.smokenator.com/) insert (very basic setup, most over in /r/smoking put it to shame.  But it works and was cheap, Weber was free, so I can't complain), so I need them in 3-5 lb chunks (I can fit 3 per batch).

-As for rubs/cures we've been experimenting, and on this part of the process I defer to my much more talented gf.  Having said that, there are a few rules to follow.  

-For proper curing use ~1 1/2 teaspoons Morton's kosher salt
and 1/2 teaspoon pink curing salt ***per lb of meat***

-I use that like a base coast and rub it in really good.  Once I have that on them I put whatever other rub/brine on I want.  I've done dry and wet and both work (wet seems to impart more flavor).

-This batch we did a few different batches

[Photo](http://imgur.com/l3cacFr)
[Photo](http://imgur.com/479SQ6I)

Traditional (salt/sugar/herbs)

Bourbon Maple Syrup

Peppered Brown Sugar (I still haven't figured out how to get the pepper to stick to the top like the commercial kinds do)

Asian ( We are on Version 2 of this.  Basically soy, garlic,ginger,5 spice and other ancient chinese secrets)

Asian Fermenter's Delight -various Asian fermented pastes in addition to the ""normal"" Asian we make.

So far the two Asian varieties are hands down the more complex and delicious with the Fermented one being insane.

-Next batch I will attempt to take the skin off before I cure, to allow for the cure to penetrate on both sides, for better flavor.

-As for curing there are days/lb sort of metrics out there. In the past I've used 7-10 days, but this time with the holidays and inclement weather it took me 14 days before I could smoke batch 2 (Asian varieties) and the flavor was so intense I think I will do this from now on.  Make sure to flip ever 1-3 days. 

-After curing I wash off very good (if not it will be very salty), towel dry and throw on the smoker.  Many will talk about drying overnight to form a ""pellicle"", but I don't really put to much weight behind there, after reading Amazing Rib's [debunking](http://www.amazingribs.com/tips_and_technique/zen_of_wood.html).  Speaking of Amazing Ribs, [here](http://www.amazingribs.com/recipes/porknography/making_bacon_from_scratch.html) is a good walk through of their's.

-Now for the smoking.

-I use a remote thermometer to keep on eye on temp.  Not [this](http://www.amazon.com/Maverick-Remote-Smoker-Thermometer-ET-73/dp/B00EQFFOLA/ref=sr_1_2?s=home-garden&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1388958902&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=remote+wireless+thermometer) exact model but something similar.  This really helps on long smokes.

-I put my meat on, get temp dialed in, and relax.  For smoking on cold midwest days, a welders blanket really helps to shield from wind/insulate.

-Smoke over hardwood of choice at ~220F for around 2-3 hours until an internal temp of ~150F.

-Take of grill, cut a couple slices and bask in your awesomeness.

-I throw in the fridge overnight and slice into manageable portions and put in freezer.  Since this is cured and smoked, it will last in the fridge for weeks.  We normally just always have a chunk in the fridge, when it is gone, grab one out of the freezer.

-One last thing. I've noticed that since the bacon is cured and smoked (basically fully cooked already, you can eat safely right off the grill) that it is firmer than store bought.  I used to be picky about having my bacon crisp because I hated the consistency of the fat.  With the stuff I make the fat is firmer and I cook it a lot less than storebought.  I basically cook it enough so that all sides get nice and browned (yummy Maillard reactions) and then pull.  This allows for the flavor to really shine and not be overpowered by that carboney flavor you get when trying to get it crisp. It's hard to explain, because I lack the food vocabulary to describe it.

TRUE,apathy2007,,,"I think explaining how Austin is/was could be compared to how SXSW has changed.

Back in the day, you paid $25-$50 for a wristband, and you had the privilege of going around to all the venues in town and hearing new, up-and-coming, unsigned bands while those same bands had the chance to be heard by record labels and embark on a career. Hanson and Beck both got discovered as a result of SXSW back in the day.

Now SXSW is, essentially, a watered-down, marketing shit hole. Every band is already signed and well-known, and they pack and cram every band in town into every place that has a door and windows and can host a band. Hell, they have stages set up in the streets now. Everything, every wall, window, tree, and door has someone's brand on it. Every stage, venue, and show is sponsored by some corporation - our town is shit all over no matter which direction you look. You cannot park anywhere within reason, nor rent a hotel anywhere within reason. Every restaurant, bar, and business within a 3-mile radius is filled to the brim with tourists. NO ONE in the world likes tourists, no one - it's like having an unsavory guest in your home who doesn't respect any of your sensibilities. Your life has to revolve around that tourist, you can't just relax around them because they change the atmosphere you live in.

Businesses, though, businesses love tourists. Businesses love that they can jack up the prices of their services and see their doors packed to the brim. Businesses love to line the pockets of politicians so the business keeps flowing. And the city is constantly coming up with new ways to bring more and more tourists to our city, and hopefully keep them here so we can continue to take their money. Businesses like Parkside can come in and tell well-established street vendors to take a hike because they're ""dirtying up the sidewalk and weirding out our customers."" Keep Austin weird? The city sided with Parkside on that one, folks. Additionally, they kind of forgot that, in the 80s, they decided to *suppress* our growth by not building the infrastructure and roads to support growth. OOPS. Where do we put the million new neighbours?? TEAR EVERYTHING DOWN AND BUILD A HIGH RISE. Do you know how many art studios, long-time bars, coffee shops, restaurants, and local business have been shut down and bulldozed to build condos? Do you know how many neighbourhoods have been converted into shitty douchebag frat bar strips (here's looking at you, Rainey Bro Street)? East 6th had a few bars dropped in, and now they are building more high-income condos, kicking out laidback local businesses (Cheer Up Charlie's) and seeking not just to gentrify, but corporatize yet another area of town.

Anyway, here is the rub: people LOVE SXSW as it currently stands. They love seeing Macklemore play in the bathroom at a Buddhist elderly woman's retirement home playing only a kazoo. They love sitting around a packed bar with dark wood tones while sipping a *cocktail* they paid $15 for because some bearded dude in suspenders wiped lemon around the rim and called it something like ""Dylan McDermott Cow Rustler Old Timey Vintage"" while, between incessant texting, telling their friend about the Macklemore show so they can make them say ""oh my GAWD are you SERIOUS - hold on I have to check Facebook while you sit there right in front of me, awkwardly.""

People eat it up, and they pay out the ass for these experiences, for this lifestyle. Go to some shithole taco restaurant with cockroaches clearly within sight. Now look at the people - holy shit they all look so rich, dressed up in the latest hipster fashion oohing and aahing over the authenticity of ""real Mexican cockroaches"" while eating a barbacoa taco that, truthfully, tastes exactly the same as the other shithole taco place down the road. However, someone marketed the place really well and had everyone buying into the belief that *this place* is really special, much more special than the other kids. 

We are a town that name drops restaurants we eat at, neighbourhoods/zip codes we live in, bars we drink, or places we shop as a representation of status. Back in the day, the fanciest restaurant in town was Jeffrey's, or Green Pastures, and you saw dudes in jeans, a t-shirt, and flip flops because status didn't mean shit. Rich or poor, we were all just living the same laid back, carefree existence. We weren't about the things we did, the places we went, the things we saw - we didn't have to prove to anyone that we were making it, everyone just *knew* that we were all living in a really special city and having a good time with our lives.

I moved to Dallas for two years to go to college, and when I left, Austin still wasn't about status and glitz and ritz and glamour. Dallas was all these things, and I hated every minute of it. I came back here, though, and found that the Dallas vibe had made it's way south. 

But by god, there are people who love the shit out of Dallas, they love the shit out of status and SXSW and corporate marketing. They love the shit out of their overpriced high rise condo in the middle of downtown Austin. They love the shit out of eating rabbit paste on a bed of tartar and foie gras paired with a mean glass of Riesling. And they love the shit out of telling everyone they love the shit out of all this. These people are exactly whom are flocking to the city. These people are filling our bars, restaurants, and businesses to the brim. If you want to be condescending and tell long-time residents to ""suck it up - Uncle Jimmy is moving in and you're just going to have to like it, or you can move out and let Jimmy have the run of the place,"" then you can fuck right off and kiss my ass on your way out.

I can't move. I make a shitload of money doing a specialized job at a lucrative company - packing up and moving isn't realistic at this point. I used to love this city to the point that it annoyed my non-Austin friends who claimed I worshipped Austin. Now, I yearn to live anywhere else. Hopefully one day I will.

TRUE,DarkLord7854,,,"As someone who moved from the US to Sweden with my gf, and is working as a developer, I can give you a pretty good idea of what to expect, both the good and the bad. Both my gf and myself are EU citizens.

* Everything is expensive. Coming from Florida, everything is easily 2-3x as expensive (even more so furniture/clothing/electronics). Especially going out. I used to go out multiple times a week in Florida, I can barely do a few times a month here without breaking my budget.
* Most places close very early at around ~9pm unless you're dead in the center of Stockholm, and even then, you'll find quite a lot of places closed, especially on Sundays (but McDonalds is open 24/7!).
* Pretty much everyone you'll interact with speaks English. Most people also immediately switch to English if they see you're not fluent in Swedish, which is actually annoying when you're trying to learn/practice your Swedish.
* People are generally very introverted and distant when you don't know them or don't work with them. It's to the point where you can easily consider them rude, especially in public/busy areas. You will rarely find anyone go out of their way to help you just because. On the plus side, they also usually keep to themselves and respect your privacy/silence.
* Apartments are expensive. Very expensive. Did I mention everything is expensive? Because it is.
* Apartments are also high in demand. You probably won't find anything by yourself. I was assigned a rental agency who helped me find a place, pretty much everything was in the 15-22k SEK/mo range for 60-70m^2. I ended up finding a place for 12k SEK/mo for 65m^2. However, I'm finding out that it's still too expensive.
* pretty much everything like internet/phone/tv/rent/etc. requires a 3 month notice for cancellation.
* The public transit system is really good. Don't bother getting your own vehicle unless you really want/need to. You can go pretty much anywhere with public transit without worries though.
* I would not buy clothes (or much of anything really) in Sweden. Prices are **significantly** more expensive. I've found it to be massively cheaper to go to Poland or another EU country, do all my shopping there, and come back compared to buying in Sweden. Don't even bother with designer stores, it's just flat out wallet rape.
* The country ""shuts down"" a lot around holidays, and also for 1-2 months during the summer when everyone takes their vacation.
* Your gf will likely get completely screwed. When I moved here with my gf, I was told there'd be no problem because she was a Polish citizen. We applied immediately for residency and a PIN (think of it like Swedish Social Security) for her. 1 1/2 years later, still nothing. Without a PIN you can't work, can't get health coverage, can't open a bank account, can't be added to an existing bank account, can't get any government benefits, can't get a cellphone subscription plan, can't get paid, can't get tv/internet, etc etc. Luckily she can still go to school thanks to her Polish citizenship, but that's it. Also, aside from tech-related fields, you'll need to speak Swedish to get a job (and a PIN). You're pretty much dead in the water without a PIN, and it can be **really** depressing.
* The immigration process for myself was all handled by the company that brought me to Sweden, so my process was extremely easy and quick, I had my PIN and everything set and ready to go within 3 months of arriving. I definitely would recommend finding a job prior to moving here and asking if they can help you through the process.
* You get 5 weeks paid vacation minimum if you're full time (not including holidays/sick days), which is awesome.
* There's a lot of tech/programming jobs in Stockholm
* Most online retailers don't ship to Sweden.
* You'll need to understand Swedish to use almost every online portal/mobile app/phone helpline from your bank/ISP/cable provider/etc. as they rarely have updated English versions.
* Expect your monthly living expenses for 2 people to easily push past 10k SEK/mo, not including rent.
* Taxes will take about 52% out of your paycheck.
* Coming from Florida, I've found a lot of the Swedish clothing styles look a bit metrosexual, which is kind of amusing. Swedes are also very accepting of pretty much everyone, which is nice. If you care about religious stuff, most here are Atheists/non-religious.


Honestly, I would say that it's fairly hard to move to Sweden, you'll need to adjust to a lot of things, the biggest of which is how tight on money you'll be. Budgeting is **extremely** important, and you'll find that you'll quickly need to pretty much only buy things that are on sale.

I definitely was not prepared when I came here, and it's been a pretty huge struggle to adjust to the living/financial situation here. My gf's situation also definitely does not help, which causes a lot of stress and frustration. I would definitely say that you should expect to be in roughly the same situation. Luckily my employer is now trying to help with the situation.

*ABS has a density of 1.04 grams per cubic centimeter, so a 1kg spool should be
about 962cc. The nominal cross-sectional areas of 3mm round filaments is .07069 square centimeters.  Divide the volume by the area and you get a length of 13603 centimeters for 1kg of 3mm filament.  One of my latest edits has the amount of filament required using my config files for my printer setup and for the smaller parts.  The total is 2257.5 cm centimeters for both inner and outer kits.  With one spool I could print 6.025 kits.  At $30 per 1kg of filament it would cost approx $5.00 per kit.

I'm not a musician, but in my lifetime I don't think I'll ever be able to make anything in my field that good.  And I remember sitting in my living room at age 21, looking forward to graduating college and I realized Nas made that at 19.  *19 years old*. He made a straight up masterpiece at 19.

And then it gets sad, because he spends about the next decade trying to be something that he's not, trying to make hits for other people.  *It Was Written* and *I am...*  have some great songs  (""the Message"", ""Street Dreams"", ""I Gave You Power"", ""If I Rule the World"", ""Nas is Like"", ""N.Y. State of Mind, Part II"", maybe a few more, some of which even broke new ground for Nas stylistically), but the rest of those album show Nas going further and further from being Nas.  I mean, they're *okay* for the most part, but he's just trying to be something he's not.  Rakim brought internal rhymes and rhyme density to hip-hop, but Nas took his lead and mastered the whole thing, at age 19.  To choose an example not from *Illmatic*:

&gt; I *peep*ed you **frontin**

&gt;I was in the *Jeep*

&gt;tinted with *heat*

&gt;sunk in the *seat*

&gt;*beats* **bumpin**.

&gt;Across the *street* you was WILDIN

&gt;talking bout how you ran the ISLAND..

And so on.   Nas's rhymes can just get dense, but it's always in the service of something, in service of the story he's telling or the picture he's painting for you.  Eminem is a great example of artist who sometimes just gets lost in his own verbal density (take a look at his early work, like the first verse of ""[Infinite](http://youtu.be/CtRbEgoTqQs?t=22s)"", where he raps a lot but doesn't say anything--arguably a few of Nas's most technical moments are like this, like his verse on Raekwon's ""Verbal Intercourse""). As this [blog post argues](http://rapmetrics.wordpress.com/2011/09/16/why-nas-lost/), Nas is at his best when he's weaving first person narratives.  Unlike a lot of rappers, it's hard to pay attention to Nas's lyrics and argue that he's glorifying violence or drugs--it just feels more like he's describing it.  Nas makes you feel like you're there, the little details just do it (""on the corner betting Grants with the cee-lo champs/
Laughing at baseheads trying to sell some broken amps"").  

But really, what gets me about Nas is how *effortlessly* he weaves his stories when he's at his best.  Famously, at the very beginning of *Illmatic*, Nas does a little boasting and then goes ""...I don't know how to start this shit"" and he was serious.  Here's DJ Premier describing it:

&gt;""Nas — he's one of our saviors now. When we did ‘N.Y. State of Mind,’ at the beginning when he says, ‘Straight out the dungeons of rap / Where fake niggas don’t make it back,’ then you hear him say, ‘I don’t know how to start this shit,’ ’cause he had just written it. He's got the beat running in the studio, but he doesn’t know how he's going to format how he's going to convey it. So he's going, ‘I don’t know how to start this shit,’ and I’m counting him in [to begin his verse]. One, two, three. And then you can hear him go, ‘Yo,’ and then he goes right into it."" DJ Premier later discussed the unexpectedness of Nas's delivery during the recording, stating ""He didn’t know how he was gonna come in, but he just started going because we were recording. I’m actually yelling, ‘We’re recording!’ and banging on the [vocal booth] window. ‘Come on, get ready!’ You hear him start the shit: Rappers…. And then everyone in the studio was like, ‘Oh, my God’, ’cause it was so unexpected. He was not ready. So we used that first verse. And that was when he was up and coming, his first album. So we was like, 'Yo, this guy is gonna be big.'

Two comparisons come to mind: one, how much effort he clearly put into making club hits in nadir of his career (listen to ""Hate Me Now"", etc,) and how the rapping just sounds strained.  Nas can only describe how awesome cars on when it's in service of story, not for idle boasting. Check his verse on Mobb Deep's ""An Eye for An Eye"" for an example of him talking about ""500 SL, green, ’95 nickel gleam"". It's not a boast, but a detail in picture, just like ""Tailor made ostrich, Chanel for my women friend"".  Plus, that verse includes the vivid simile, ""My sanity is going like an hourglass"".  They're not just words, rhymes, and syllables, they're descriptors, reeled off by a master.  But when he's trying to write for the club, to front something, it just feel strained.  Nas will never have a club banger and most of his best songs just will never be radio hits.  He's managed to be better at being Nas and yet still making radio songs recently, like ""Hip Hop is Dead"" or ""The Don"", but generally, he's at his best not in the club or the radio, but on headphones, or maybe on a system, drunk or stoned, with one or two friends.  A song like, ""Queens Get the Money"", to choose a recent exmaple, is a perfect Nas song that will never be on the radio.  As Nas puts it, he raps ""for listeners, blunt heads, fly ladies and prisoners"".  When tries to rap for someone else, it just falls flat.

For the other half of his effortlessness, look at ""Life's a Bitch"" on *Illmatic*.  AZ delivers a great verse, quite possibly the best verse of his entire career, like he is given a shot and he nails it out of the park. And you almost think, is Nas going to get shown up in terms of verbal dexterity on his own album? And then, after AZ sings the hook, Nas comes on and it's just so clear Nas is playing a different game entirely.  Effortless.  He makes it sound like AZ is reading from a piece of paper and Nas is just sitting on your couch and telling you how it is.  And that's why someone like J. Cole will write a song called ""I Let Nas Down"", because Nas is a rapper's rapper.  When Nas is being Nas, and not trying to be someone else, he just does it.  Honestly, though, what other rapper could you write a song called ""I Let [Them] Down"", and it be about not being the best artist you could be?  Saying ""I Let Jay Down"" probably means you weren't making enough money or something.  Most other ones would be like ""Oh I didn't rep my hometown thoroughly enough"".  But Nas?  Nas is fucking artist.   He paints pictures, he just happens to use words to do it.  And *Illmatic* is nine or ten pure classic tracks of just Nas being Nas, over beats from the best New York producers of the era.   Even when people criticize Nas, they have to acknowledge its greatness (""that's a one hot album every ten year average""). And if you know the album, I can just say ""Jerome's niece"" or ""'Yo, my shit is stuck'"" or ""watching Gandhi til I'm charged"" and it will pull up a mental image as clearly as if I said ""the Mona Lisa"" or Picasso's ""The Old Guitarist"".  And still, because of its sonic and lyrical complexity, every time I listen to *Illmatic* I discover something new.

If the beliefs and practice of Pastafarianism are too vague or ""silly"" to be considered protectable as a religion, what about other religions?

I've seen men in top-hat-ish headwear with curly sideburns blow a goat(?) horn at people by way of blessing. I've eaten a thin, tasteless cracker that I was supposed to believe was actually 100% the real body of Jesus. I've moved my stuff out of the way so a Muslim man could get his prayer rug pointed just the right direction in a cramped room. I've been late to events because I got stuck behind an Amish buggy. 

I think all of those practices are rather silly, but I'm not going to pass judgement on the validity of the religion they belong to; at least certainly not in a legal capacity. I won't even condemn Scientology (the religion) despite the seemingly epic corruption of Scientology (the church/organization).

The whole point of Pastafarianism is to demonstrate the ideal of separation of church and state. Religion shouldn't have an effect on or be affected by the workings of the government. What religious object someone chooses to swear an oath on should not matter, as long as it is significant to them.

Thanks! Great question! 

Currently, Streamus collects absolutely no identifying information about a given user. I do have a server which stores videos, playlists and errors encountered. Storing videos and playlists allows me to enable sharing of playlists between users.

When you first install Streamus a unique 16-digit ID is generated for you and written to local storage on your PC (think  cookie). This ID is then sync'ed between all PC's you're signed into Google Chrome with (think how Bookmarks sync between PCs).

This allows me to simulate a 'logged in user' which can have your playlists shared between PCs without having to actually collect anything.


**BUT**

This implementation is fragile for two reasons:

* A malicious user could send the correct 16-digit ID to my server and delete your information.

* If you uninstall Streamus, your 16 digit ID will be wiped (I can't do anything about this) and you'll lose your information. 

**SO**

**I will be collecting your unique user ID from Google+ in the future. This will allow me to protect your data from malicious users and, if you uninstall and then re-install Streamus, I will be able to recover your data.** I have no plans to collect anything else. I don't really care about your information. I'm here to make a music player that *I* want to use -- I'm simply sharing it with others. :)

The permissions currently requested by Streamus when you install are:

* *.beatport.com: I inject HTML markup and JavaScript into beatport.com to allow you to listen to Top 10 and Top 100 playlists through Streamus instead of using Beatport's player.

* *.share.streamus.com: I inject HTML markup into my own website.

* *.streamus.com: I inject HTML markup into my own website.

* *.youtube.com: I inject HTML markup and JavaScript into YouTube pages to allow you to easily add videos to playlists. 

* streamus.apphb.com: I need to be able to send data to my server.

If you have any concerns about any of the code injection, feel free to browse the code: https://github.com/MeoMix/StreamusChromeExtension/tree/master/src/js/inject or ask any questions you may have.

TRUE,Ryan_Jarv,,,"The following is a critique on your security. Everything I mention is definitely optional, security is usually a trade off with usability so you'll have to decide how secure you need your server to be. If you want to learn then I would say go out, personally I think security is interesting :)

&gt; no remote root login.

So far so good

&gt; only login with keys.

Cool. Just make sure you don't leave your keys laying around, using a password on them is a good idea.

&gt; non standard ssh-port (!=22).

The amount of security this gives is very minimal, I would recommend against this. Your security in your SSH setup is based on your keys. If a attacker doesn't have your keys they won't get in (in however many million years), if they do then all they have to do is find the server it belongs to and the port you used... nmap is good at that. Keep your keys secure and you'll be fine.

&gt; Fail2ban setup to listen to the ssh-port, and ban for 0,5 hour for 3 tries in 10 minutes.

Doesn't give you much a chance if you use the wrong username or accidentally specify the wrong key file. Security is a balance, not saying that it's a bad idea to block brute forcer's but almost all your security is still in your keys.

&gt; 1. I still need to get a log going, but besides that does it sound safe enough?

Edit: sorry didn't see the besides that part, but will keep my response just cause logging is important...

Logging is the most important part, no matter what you do to lock down your server it's still possible for someone to get in... if they do you want to know about it. 

So on the logging subject I would turn on sudo-io logging. So that would look like this in sudoers (use visudo):

    Cmnd_Alias      NO_LOG_IO=/sbin/reboot, /sbin/shutdown, /sbin/halt, sudoreplay
    
    Defaults log_output
    Defaults!NO_LOG_IO !log_output

Sudo logging basically records every command you run as root, if you need to ever find out what exactly happened in a sudo session you can use sudoreplay. halt, shutdown, and reboot are excluded from sudo logging because the system will hang when it tries to write the log to a disk that is unmounted. Last thing regarding logging is in a ideal situation you send log's off to another machine so that if a machine is compromised the attacker can't mess with your logs. 

You will want to look into how to properly configure sudo if you have any other users that need a slice of root permissions other then you (it's very easy to do it wrong, sudo mastery is a good book if need to learn more).

You may also want to look into a logging and intrusion detection stuff like autitd or tripwire.

&gt; http - Input and output. (source-port on input and destination-port on output)

So they can reach any port as long as they send it from port 80?
If your just trying to access web sites from your machine only add the rule on output and on input allow all established from port 80. Also don't forget to add port 443 for https. Also it's worth it to note that browser's are the second weakest link in the chain, most people don't run them on servers, but since it's a home server (and doesn't have any thing too sensitive?) it's probably ok.

&gt; 2. I had to put spt on input, and dpt on output for http, and setup udp dns to able to apt-get update. Is this the regular setup for http and dns?

This is how I usually do it:

* Allow all out
     * The reason I see for blocking outbound traffic is so you notice when a malicious program is trying to call home. If a program has root though it can disable your firewall, so generally you will block outbound traffic on a separate firewall.
* Allow established in.
     * This will take care of letting all your dns and http(s) traffic come back through without explicitly opening any ports.
* Allow in the services that I'm serving to the public, lock them down to certain IP's if I can.

&gt; 3. How can I secure myself so a static address will compromise my network as little as possible?

I assume your referring to your private IP that will be accessed through port forwarding. If I understand networking correctly (it's not my strong area) putting your server on a seperate vlan will prevent [arp spoofing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARP_spoofing) and putting it on another subnet will prevent [DHCP Hijacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_DHCP). Of course it may be necessary to run it on the same vlan or subnet depending on what your trying to accomplish.
There are a lot of attacks a cracker has available once he/she gains access to your internal network, and sometimes it's not possible/desirable to prevent the these things from happening (all kinds of different [mitm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack) attacks. I believe a IDS like snort will detect a lot of these things and at least alert you if it does happen. You would have to set up snort on another computer (rasperry pi?) and give it access to all the traffic on your network ([port mirroring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_mirroring)).

As far as security goes this is just a small part of what you can do to lock down your server. It's always a trade off between security and usability, if you secure something so well that no one uses it then it's useless. Last thing, the weakest link in the chain is always the user... yes that's you! ...or me if you give me access :)

He was first associated with sex abuse in 1993, when Evan Chandler, a dentist/aspiring script writer accused him of molesting his son Jordan. He accused MJ of molesting Jordan only after MJ denied to fund a 20million dollar script deal and build an extension to his house.

Here is a taped phone conversation in which Evan Chandler lays out a plan to extort money from Jackson:

http://youtube.com/watch?v=tx8Z9fxxw-U

This was taped July 2nd, but the Chandlers claim that they found out their kid was abused on July 16th. 

Michael jackson was investigated, he cooperated with authorities, he was strip searched and photos were taken of his genitalia to see if they would match a description given by the boy (they did not), and his homes were raided yielding no evidence to support the claim. Hundreds of children who knew Jackson were interviewed and all claimed Michael did nothing inappropriate with them. The investigation was closed from lack of evidence and criminal charges were not brought. 

The Chandlers were continuously delaying the criminal trial, demanding that the civil one go first (gee I wonder why?.) The law in California at the time stated that a civil trial could precede a criminal one. This was unfair for MJ's legal team as the prosecution could changed their strategy and story after hearing the defense at the Civil trial, which would greatly jeopardize MJ's right to a fair trial in the criminal one. 

Michael Jackson's insurance settled the civil case, (as that was really his only choice), and the Chandlers refused to testify in criminal court over and over again (the statute of limitations was extended for the Chandlers twice.), even though the contract stipulated that they had every right to testify against MJ (after all, you cannot settle criminal charges). Instead, the family immediately  sold stories to the National Enquirer, tried to shop a book deal ([Here is a book publisher talking about being approached by the Chandlers to sell a book, she called them brazen opportunists](http://youtube.com/watch?v=yQYeNfHVBtM)) and then had the gall to sue MJ AGAIN and numerous other company's for 60 million and the rights to produce an album called EVANstory, where they will write and sing songs about their son being abused. Yes, they actually tried this, you can't make this shit up. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_child_sexual_abuse_accusations_against_Michael_Jackson

That was the one time MJ was accused of such things, until the 2005 trial, which anyone who is familiar with it knows it was an obvious shakedown with zero evidence to support the claim, a history of the family approaching celebrities for money, evidence of lying and extortion, inconsistencies, contradictions, an impossible timeline and a complete waste of tax payer dollars.

TRUE,backgrinder,,,"""What I dont understand is how a larger force would be unable to stretch their lines more effectively than a smaller opponent, or how the persuing persian were unable to keep up with the wheeling and charging maneuvers executed by the Macedonian forces. ""

 Your first fundamental mistake here is not realizing that larger groups are harder to move while maintaining cohesion than smaller groups (a mistake the Persians also made). Imagine taking a kindergarten class on a field trip. Now imagine taking an elementary school on the same field trip, with the same number of chaperones. 

 The second error you are making is not knowing what Alexander knew about the Persians. He knew their order of battle (the types and numbers of units). He knew how they liked to fight. And he knew that the Persians by this point were equally familiar with him. This meant Alexander knew how to show the Persians something they would expect, and he also had a very good idea how they would respond to it. Alexander, in other words, knows everything about the Persians at Gaugamela a bullfighter knows about a bull before walking into the ring. He knows where their horns are, how they will respond to seeing a red cape, and where the weak spot he can attack and stab them in the heart is.

 Alexander's standard battle tactic, developed by his father, is to use his infantry units, the Phalanx troops, to make contact with the enemy in the center or left side, and pin the enemies best infantry down there while using his cavalry to sweep wide around the flank and then sweep in and trap the enemy between the two forces. Alexander had used this very tactic against the Persians successfully before, and he knew showing this tactic would be very familiar to the Persians. He also knew they had amassed a large elite cavalry formation to counter him. Like a bullfighter showing a red cape he aligned his infantry to the center left, and started pushing his cavalry off to the right to begin his standard flanking maneuver. Like a bull responding to red the Persians sent their cavalry out wide to their left to shadow Alexander, and started stretching their lines to the left to keep Alexander from flanking them.

 There's a reason why bullfighters use a large brightly colored cape to get a bull's attention. A bull is a very nearsighted animal, and it takes a lot to get their attention. This is to the bull's disadvantage, as it can see the red cape, and not the sword in the bullfighters other hand. The bullfighters standard tactic is to get the bull to not only chase the cape, but to do so on a specific line and drop his head to gore the offending cape at a precise point. If the bullfighter can train the bull to taking this line and dropping his horns to strike at the cape right next to him a small 2-3 inch gap between the bull's shoulder blades will be exposed to him, with the horns to low to protect when he stabs in with his sword. If everything works right the bull will be dropped once his horns are too low. Of course, if the bullfighter misses he is unprotected, and the bull wins.

 While Alexander was riding to his far right, pulling the Persian cavalry along with him, he had a unit of peltasts trailing him. The peltasts are light infantry that can move quickly, and they are armed with slings and javelins to throw at the enemy, and swords for self protection. The peltasts were behind Alexander's cavalry, opposite the Persians and it was a dry dusty day so the Persians didn't see them there. As Alexander keeps pushing further and further to his right, and the Persians keep edging out (to their left) to keep him from turning the corner on him the Persians start getting stretched out.

 As you pointed out the Persians are a larger group, but they lack cohesion, or an ability to stay in neatly ordered ranks when moving. As they stretch their line gaps start opening between different units. Given time they could have corrected this easily, and used their superior numbers to fill in, but time is something Alexander won't give them. When Alexander sees a gap open up wide enough to run through he cuts back. Instead of moving out to he right slowly he cuts back and charges at full speed back to his left, back to the center of the battlefield. The Persians elite cavalry swing around to follow and block him.

 This is where Alexanders peltasts come in to play. When Alexander cuts back the opposite direction his peltasts are now in the open right in front of the Persian cavalry. Instead of charging back towards Alexander across open space the Persians charge directly into a hail of projectiles from a peltasts unit that to all intents and purposes had just materialized in front of them out of thin air. It wasn't enough to destroy them completely, but it broke their momentum just long enough to keep them from blocking Alexander, who is now charging a gap in the Persian lines at full speed with 7,000 elite cavalry at his back.

 If you watch American football you have seen this move hundreds of times. The ball is snapped, the running back moves right with his blockers, the linebackers and safeties move to intercept him. At the last second he cuts back, running against the grain through a hole that has opened up in the defense. Running back hits the opening he saw at full speed, runs through it, and scores a touchdown. This is a common but effective American Football move, pioneered by a man named Red Grange who left a young West Point cadet (and captain of the Army football team) named Dwight David Eisenhower with a permanent limp using it.

 The Persians had a huge army, but the numbers were fluffed with contingents from all of their conquered territories. Their own units, their heavy infantry and their elite Bactrian cavalry (commanded by Darius kinsman) were what really counted here. Alexander had pinned the Persians best infantry units in contact with his infantry in the center. He had stretched the Persians best cavalry off the edge of the playing field and pinned them there with peltasts. He had found a gap in the Persian front line and was charging through it at full speed. At this point there wasn't a single effective combat unit standing between Alexander and Darius. Darius fled the battlefield. It was that or commit suicide. Once Darius was gone the non Persian units all quit. They weren't thrilled about fighting for their slave-masters in the first place, they certainly were not willing to continue the fight after the Persian king had run away. The battle turned into a rout, and Alexander was able to invade Persia proper virtually unopposed.

TRUE,AnimuX,,,"Unfortunately, these confrontations on the high seas between whale poachers and protesters continue because the government of Japan has turned whaling into a never-to-be-cancelled spending program for the benefit of fisheries bureaucrats (amakudari) who expect to one day get high paid jobs in the same whaling industry that's currently propped up by government funding. The whaling is not done for 'science' or for 'tradition' (as if that were a valid reason) and it's completely irrelevant to Japan's food security and economic prosperity.

In fact, Japan's whaling industry has a long history of regulatory violations that dates back before anything like Sea Shepherd existed. Historically the whalers have hunted protected species, killed undersized whales, hunted out of season, hunted in off limits areas, exceeded their assigned quotas, and more. They even hired foreign poachers to kill more whales and smuggle the unreported, illegally gained, whale meat to Japan. So, nobody was surprised when Japan lost the vote on whaling in 1982 and continued killing whales anyway after all commercial whaling quotas were set to zero by the International Whaling Commission in 1986.

Since then, Japan has continued shooting whales in the Southern Ocean and in the North Pacific. Today Japan's government claims it is killing whales for 'research'. This is done specifically to undermine and defy other prohibitions and restrictions on whaling set by the IWC. Japan believes as long as it officially pretends to kill whales for 'science' then the rules don't apply -- citing Article VIII of the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling as a loophole. However, other nations do not agree and the IWC has repeatedly called on Japan to stop killing whales. The government of Australia filed a legal case against Japan's whaling with the International Court of Justice -- oral arguments were heard last summer -- a ruling from the court has not yet been issued.

Japan annually kills endangered fin whales, endangered sei whales, vulnerable sperm whales rare Bryde's whales, common minke whales (many from the threatened J-stock), and Antarctic minke whales. Coastal hunts also include up to 20,000 small cetaceans each year, like dolphins, rare beaked whales, and a Dall's porpoise hunt called 'clearly unsustainable' by scientists.

Regardless, demand for whale meat in Japan is so pathetically low the government failed to sell 75% of the catch in 2012. Much of the whale meat is fed to children in compulsory school lunches and last year the government stated its intent to serve whale to defense forces too. In a 2012 survey of Japanese citizens, 89% of the respondents stated they had not purchased any whale meat in the last year. So, it seems if the government did not force whale meat on children most of them would never even know the taste of it. So much for 'tradition'.

As for the 'science', in 2002, in an open letter published in the New York Times, twenty-one scientists (including three Nobel laureates) stated emphatically, “We, the undersigned scientists, believe Japan’s whale research program fails to meet minimum standards for credible science.” The letter specifically states there is no compelling reason to kill whales in order to obtain data from them.

In 2003,  published in BioScience, IWC scientific committee members supported the 2002 rebuke of Japan’s whaling programs. The scientists stated, “Japan's scientific whaling program is so poor that it would not survive review by any major independent funding agency,” and when it comes to misrepresenting commercial activities as science, “there has rarely been a more egregious example of this misrepresentation than Japan's scientific whaling program.” They also explained that the vast majority of publications resulting from these programs have absolutely no value for the management of whale stocks.

As Australia's representatives explained to the world court, the so-called 'research loophole' was only ever intended for limited use for critical research needs. Japan cannot simply play pretend, continue the same bad behavior and regulatory violations of the past, call it research, and proceed unchallenged. However, Japan's status as the world's 3rd largest economy has effectively suppressed any meaningful response from other nations. 

Thankfully, Sea Shepherd Australia continues to thwart the whale poachers when national governments fail to enforce their own agreements. For several years, the whalers have returned to Japan with only a small fraction of their intended catch as a result of direct interference from activists. In 2013, the whalers were left with the lowest number of whales killed since the whole research scam started in the 1980s. Hopefully, the number of poached whales will be even smaller this season.",0,1388981503,,0,1388982178,3,ceifoj5,t3_1uhz95,t1_ceifoj5,t3_1uhz95,1431818150,2133,FALSE,worldnews,t5_2qh13,2133
TRUE,_male_man,,,"Recalibrate the kinect. By default when you say ""xbox volume up"" it only moves it up one number on the volume control. However, after the xbox turns the volume up and the prompt asks ""did this work?"" or whatever, keep selecting no until it jumps 4-5 numbers on the volume control. After that, you should be able to say ""xbox volume up"" and watch the volume climb 4-5 numbers as opposed to only 1-2.

Edit: for too many words.

Edit: I just received a pm from a kind fellow who informed me the Recalibrate option does not display the prompt and only calibrates the tv audio. However you get back there, it's under the setup for voice commands controlling the tv. I know there's a way to get back to that setup, but I'm at work and I will clarify my poor instructions in about 5 hours when I get home.

TRUE,Rc2124,scholar,[First] [Last] on [Server],"Not even low level dungeons... Pretty much anything. 

I queued in progress for High Level Dungeons last night, and randomly got WP. The healer had left about 30 seconds into the dungeon, which I thought was odd, but sometimes things come up. I said hi, and the PLD said he was new to the dungeon and was excited to run it. At that point, the other two DPS dropped as well. The healer I replaced had dropped immediately when s/he saw the, ""Someone is new"" message. It was obvious why they left even if they didn't say it, and the tank was clearly hurt by it. I decided to stick around because I didn't want a fresh 50 to think that everyone is an asshole in this game. I explained the dungeon to him, and we waited for a little bit to see if anyone else would come, but noone did. So we decided to see how far we could get. As a PLD-SCH combo we didn't have much DPS, so every fight was extraordinarily slow, but he was a very attentive and receptive tank. I guided him through and explained things as we went, while unsuccessfully trying to get FC and LS members to queue up to help us out (some tried, but apparently got sent to other WPs). And wouldn't you know it, we got all the way to the second boss by ourselves. We didn't quite have the DPS to beat it before it hit some sort of enrage timer I never knew existed, and we wiped a few times before deciding we wouldn't beat it with only a few minutes left on the clock. I knew we wouldn't be able to beat the Tonberry King anyways with how low our DPS was. I asked what server he was on, and it turns out we're both on Faerie!

We immediately friended each other after, and I know we're going to stay close friends from here on out. He thanked me profusely and was really happy that I stuck with him and taught him the dungeon. He said he takes the game slow because he has a stressful job and doesn't have a lot of play time, and it meant a lot to him. He said if I ever wanted anything crafted I could just ask, because he and his fiance have all crafts to 50. It cost me nothing to be nice to him, and it was honestly a lot of fun running with just a tank and getting to know someone. I still can't believe 3 people left because he was new, and it really saddens me to think about it, but I made a close friend. Thing is, the four of them all could have been close friends if they had all been nice to each other in the first place. I don't understand the decisions people make sometimes! New people are people too you know!

2. ¿Decisiones correctas?. En mi opinión si es necesario nuevas reformas en el país, PEMEX no podría estar peor y hay que arreglar la situación, pero no creo que esta sea la forma correcta de hacerlo. Yo lo entiendo de esta forma: Los políticos están consientes de que no son capaces de dirigir PEMEX pero tampoco quieren dejar de estar a cargo (ellos aman el poder y también la cantidad de dinero a la que tiene acceso para poder robarlo) así que lo más lógico para arreglar el desastre sin necesidad de cambiar de directores es traer a alguien para arregle el desastre (dígase inversión privada). ah! por cierto, muchos de los políticos mexicanos ya compraron acciones de las compañías que van a intervenir en PEMEX; solo buscan lucrarse y no el bien de la nación.

3. No, no estoy satisfecho. Con los nuevos cambios ahora me van a quitar &gt;40% de mi sueldo en impuestos. Esto significa que de 10 horas que trabajo al día 4 son para pagar impuestos. Es una cantidad increíble de dinero y NO hay beneficios visibles.

She told me I would have to cope with being a failure for the rest of my life. She made me feel worthless. But you know what? Here I am, Ms. Mueller! *Here I am.* We've all dealt with tough times and made it through with flying colors. And from here, the future looks pretty bright...for all of us. Thank you.""

Before the last sentence has fully left Chandler's lips the stadium explodes in thunderous yelling and clapping. Caps shoot up from the gathered graduates' bleachers like confetti. Ms. Mueller sits stonelike, barely smiling, holding her defense against the barbed glances of her colleagues. Who does that? say the whispers, though whether from between or outside her wrinkled ears she does not know. Who tells a kid that? Jesus, some people. Good for him for speaking out. I seriously wonder why she's even a teacher.

So do I. Sometimes, so do I. I was a young teacher, too, once, just like all of you--happy, sensitive, full of confidence...back when grades meant something and children learned how to think hard and work hard and overcome failure and people knew that success isn't a roadway to be paved for the successful to walk smoothly but an obstacle course that makes you a little stronger every time you have the option to quit and you say, goddamn it, I'm not fucking stopping now!...

Her blotchy cheeks twitch, imperceptibly.

I'm sorry, Chandler. But I'm not sorry that it hurt. You have so much fire, so much drive, but you weren't convinced you needed it. The road was too smooth. Most of these kids here, they came in with their dry-weather tires and were told to take a spin around a nice little track and got handed a little gold medal as they finished, one by one. You needed a reason to be better, to study harder, so you could know yourself and know your potential. Maybe you'll decide to become a teacher yourself, to give the next generation the guidance and encouragement that they need, to give them a shoulder to cry on when they run into crabs like me. And you'll tell them, sweetie, you can do it! Old Miss Mueller doesn't know how special you are...you can prove her wrong, right? Let's prove her wrong.

And whoever your student is, I hope she does. 

And I hope you do, Chandler.

Everyone else always told you, but I never could. Maybe I could tell you now...you're all through, you're all grown up, and I'll never see you again. No, what am I saying, you wouldn't believe me...I played my part too well. Maybe I can just think it. Maybe that will be enough. 

I'm proud of you, Chandler.

And I- 
I love you.

Go far.

Run the obstacle course.

Prove me wrong.

The teachers and students congregate, laughing, shaking hands. Parents and teachers are introduced, couples take photos, imaginary toasts are drunk from Sprite cans. Joy suffuses the air, for no gathering is more joyful than a gathering of young people who have shared in a once-in-a-lifetime accomplishment by getting through four years of work, and are getting ready to retire into a seemingly endless summer with seemingly boundless energy and truly boundless confidence. 

Ms. Mueller walks slowly through the sweltering parking lot. Her 1992 Mercury Esquire requires a kick to the door while pulling the handle in order to open. Her hands are not very sweaty, since they have not been shaken. She returns to her one-bedroom apartment, in which pets are not allowed and the A/C sometime dies on the weekends. She hangs her purse on the door knob. Sits at her desk.

It's time to start drawing up the curriculum for next year.

He stole my mother's wedding rings, my grandmother's car, and my tv - to name a few things. 
My family has decided to try again to welcome him back into their lives so I followed suit.

Middle brother drops bag of drugs when he walks in the door - Strike two.

In the car on the way home. Decide it is best to go back into town together so it saves someone a trip. Middle brother asks me for my passport. I say ""no I can't do that"". Middle brother concocts magical story where I have borrowed his ID to get into clubs when I was a teenager. Lies. I did not and would not. He says he needs it to get into a party. He's 300lbs and 35 and would never be carded under any circumstances. 

Middle brother differs to his standard method of persuasion and starts yelling and is getting increasingly loud and argumentative. 
I tell him that it is illegal and that it would be very bad for him if he gets caught. 

There's a line somewhere between asking and demanding something of someone - he crosses it. My heart races like it used to when I was a boy. When he used to follow my friends and I and beat the shit out of us with his friends. I remember him pulling me out of a lake where I almost drowned. But it's not him anymore. The brother I knew is gone and there's a total stranger directly behind me demanding a symbol of my liberty. 
Strike fucking four. 
I tell him that if he mentions my passport again on the ride home, I will crane the steering wheel into a snowbank and beat him to within an inch of his life. 

I hear 'Give me your passport' in the voice of a man I don't know, from a face I don't recognize. Blood and adrenaline surge from my heart faster and more rapidly than I have ever felt. We pull into a parking lot, I open my door and wait patiently until that fucking asshole works up the courage to fight me.

He steps out and yells something I don't hear. I tell him that I'll give him one more chance to get back in the car without saying a word about my passport ever again. He says 'passport' with a wiley grin and expects me to be the same cowering boy that I used to be. The same kid who loved him and adored him and wanted nothing else but to be just like him. 

I connect the quickest and hardest fist I've ever thrown against another person directly onto his chin. Blood spurts out of his mouth with the second blow. He hits me twice above and below my right eye. I completely lose my shit and wail on the left side of his face until it is a broken and bloody ruin.

TRUE,GSpiff,,,"Neighbor of mine, Brian was a total asshole. I was two years older than him, and he acted half his age. He pissed on our deck, threw rocks at my dogs and friends and was a terrible example for my younger brother. Little shit must've been seeking asylum from his addict mother who beat him and her other crack babies.

Anyway, its my sisters 18th birthday. Her and her friends are hanging out in the living room, Brian is in the basement, pestering me, knowing I don't like him. I'm minding my own business, trying to play N64. He keeps smacking the back of my head. Fourth time I told him to knock it off before I hit him back.

Challenge accepted, apparently.

He grabs a plastic bat and cracks me in the back of the head. Game over, Brian. I grab the bat, grab him by the throat, and beat the shit out of him. His face is bleeding everywhere, then I threw the bat aside and worked the torso, throwing him on the ground, stepping on his hands and arms. Soon, I need to pause and regain my energy. He runs up the stairs, full of tears and blood and runs home. I go back to playing N64.

My mom sees him. My sister and her friends see him. My brother saw it all and is bawling. My moms boss, (my first future boss) sees this kid who got the shit beat out of him run out of the house. My mom comes downstairs to ask what I did. I looked at her and yelled ""**I hit him! I hit him and didn't stop until I couldn't hit him anymore!**"" She told me to wait in the basement. I did. Fuck it. Brian told his mom that my sister got her friends to beat him up and throw him against the coffee table. Brian's mom, Fat Slut comes up to our front door, in panties, a tank top and a baby on her hip, saying she's gonna beat somebodys ass. My mom tells her to get off our property but she won't budge. 3 18 year old men tell her to leave, my moms boss tells her to leave and my dad, just getting home, says ""get the fuck away from my family."" Fat Slut asks who beat Brian, I walk right up to her and said ""I did. And ill do it again if he walks into this house again, then ill kick your ass."" Fat Slut storms off to beat Brian for lying to her.

I won. Earned the respect of my sisters friends, proved to Brian that I was a force to be reckoned with, and made a lasting impression on my future employer. Got grounded for 4 days. Brian and his fucked up family moved away afterwards.

TRUE,fuufnfr,,,"Alright, nobody will believe it, but here's what's happening.

Basically, this guys is correct.

But here's the deal, there's good guys, and there's bad guys. Both terrestrial and off world.

Bad guy aliens already made a deal and transferred some tech to the bad guy humans in change down here around the middle of the last century.  Basically, there's a hidden, runaway society on this planet with suppressed super technologies including free energy devices.  But first...

The general story is a bunch of bad aliens showed up here tens of thousands of years ago and have been enslaving humanity in one form or another since then.  

Fast forward to now times.

Good guys aliens have become aware of what's happening here on earth and some have decided they need to help.  There is literally a space war happening out there and we've been quarantined.

The good guys aliens are a mix, so are the bad guys.  Bad guys are the reptilians and their grey minions.

It helps to think of it like Star Trek out there, that's actually a very accurate depiction of it.

Some of the aliens helping are even actually humans, just not humans from this planet.

So yeah, there's that whole prime directive thing about non-intervention. But here's the deal. The bad guy aliens have already screwed up our natural evolution real bad and basically we can't progress anymore while they got their boots on our necks.  So it was decided to allow forces to intervene and get rid of the bad guy aliens so we can go evolving with out the interference and oppression, basically so we'd at least get a chance to do things on our own for once. 

They are not going to take care of our terrestrial problems, that's going to be up to us.

The bad guy aliens control us because they control the Cabal that runs most of the world.  Who is this Cabal?  You all know them as the secretive group of nasty people and what most people refer to as the Illuminati. Many will argue that it is the Masons, or the Vatican, or the Rothschilds, or the Rockefellers, or the Bushes, or the Queen of England, blah blah blah.

The truth is, It's parts of all of them. In various levels of involvement and performing certain tasks they all collude together.

The common name now given to this collective is ""the Cabal"".

[Here's a good backstory on their saga](http://www.reddit.com/r/greenlight/comments/1fclio/backstory_this_is_quite_literally_considered_the/)

Anyway, they good guy aliens are cleaning up things in the background and once the bad alien threat is totally removed (it mostly under control already) then it will time for us to clean up our own mess here on the planet.

How do we stop the Cabal?  Well, that's being done now also, on two fronts, with [The Plan](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRziYS-PZ2U) (mass arrests of the elite criminal class) , and [Neil Keenan](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnC1_o2Rmqk) (legal acquisition of the [Global Collateral Accounts](http://www.reddit.com/r/greenlight/comments/1fyibp/a_brief_history_of_the_global_collateral_accounts/)).

Back to what this guys was saying.  The bad guy aliens shared some crazy tech with the bad guy humans in charge down here.  And now, good guy aliens are taking the bad aliens out, so we can have a chance at taking out the bad guy humans who were working with them.  If all goes as planned, once we take out the trash, the good guy aliens will share some awesome wicked tech with us.  They're not just going to give it to us, they will help us to develop the crazy stuff we already have but is being hidden from us.

Free energy, replicators (constructors), stuff that can clean up the planet (even radioactive pollution), and healing techs  that have been described as even capable of growing back limbs.

Should be fun.

now, my uncle was brilliant. he grew up in the same small town my dad did, but came up with infinitely more ways to fuck someone over. he had taught me a trick called the ""sponge bomb."" buy a very porous sponge (one that holds a lot of water) and get it absolutely soaking. wring every ounce of water out of it, and start squishing it; get it as small as you can. wrap it in twine as tightly as you can, then let it sit. i did for two weeks, as i had the time to wait from their extended stay. when it's fully dry and you cut the twine off, the sponge will hold that smaller shape. 

then, *find a toilet*.

the nice thing about the site was that once the box office was open (it was all outdoors) anyone could use the bathrooms. so, i did. the trick is to *flush* and *then drop*. not the other way around. *flushing* and *then* dropping will make the sponge go further before it swells up and blocks the pipe. 

i made 6 of them and deployed them into separate toilets (i think there were 10 in all). two days later i contacted my friend who still worked there and asked how bad it was. apparently the damage was reaching into the $50K range. they had to replace all the fancy satellites (and they were *very* fancy) as well as clean the river of shit i'd caused right at the entrance.

He spent the first 2 years of his life soiled, wet, hungry, alone, and lacking the communication/stimulation that a child needs for healthy brain development.
After being removed, he was placed in multiple foster homes where he experienced more neglect; physical, sexual, and mental/emotional abuse; the loss of contact with 4 biological siblings, not to mention anyone he formed an attachment to while with a family.

TRUE,themeaningofhaste,astro,Grad Student|Astronomy|Pulsars|Pulsar Timing,"There's a couple of things I've seen in this thread so hopefully I can answer some stuff. I know Scott and he's been pretty excited about this for awhile. Timing of this system has been an ongoing effort at Green Bank because of the crazy geometry. You have to nail down where in the orbit the pulsar is, which isn't quite changing sinusoidally anymore, but is more of a long term sine wave with a shorter sine on top of that (see Figure 1a, I can see it in the free version though it's small). In Figure 2, you can see that there is an outer white dwarf in the red orbit, with the gray orbit as the inner binary. The pulsar is closest to the ""center"" of the system. 

I will say that this is a bit sensationalized because its a news article but this system really is interesting. This goes beyond the three-body problem, which is typically a Newtonian problem, though not always. Various pulsar systems have been used to put massive constraints on general relativity thus far. The most famous example of this is probably the [Hulse-Taylor Binary Pulsar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSR_B1913%2B16), which won the 1993 Nobel Prize for an indirect detection of gravitational waves. Gravitational waves are like ripples in spacetime and when the two pulsars orbit around each other, they radiate away gravitational energy, causing the orbit to decay. They measured this decay by timing the deviations of when the pulses arrive at the Earth from when you'd expect them to arrive (given where the pulsars are, how they are moving, etc.), and found it to match almost exactly with the prediction from GR. In that wiki article, you can see a plot of the data (red) and the prediction (blue). Note that the blue line is not a fit but the mathematical prediction from GR. Pretty cool!

Now, one way that people who study gravity quantify the effects of gravity is by something called the [PPN Formalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameterized_post-Newtonian_formalism#Beta-delta_notation). GR will have certain values for these parameters (0's or 1's, depending on the parameter) whereas other versions of gravity will have different values. In this way, we can compare the effects of one model of gravity with respect to another. If you scroll down to the [accuracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameterized_post-Newtonian_formalism#Accuracy_from_experimental_tests) part of the same page, you can see the bounds that have been placed on these parameters. The closer those bounds are to zero, the more we constrain that GR is the right model for gravity in the Universe. You can see that some of the bounds are pretty good. For example, 0.01 means we've measured it to 1 part in 100. If you'd prefer to think of it another way, it's like saying it's deviation from GR is 0.00+/-0.01. However, most are smaller than that, you can see that the Hulse-Taylor system constrains one of them fairly well, with a bound of 4x10^-5, but then you see the alpha_3, the self-acceleration one. That has a bound of 4x10^-20. That's enormous. You've constrained it to within 1 part in 25 quintillion if I worked that out correctly. 

Pulsar timing has given some of the greatest constraints on gravity and we're working on trying to constrain gravity further by making direct detections of gravitational waves using arrays of them in the sky. This system is the first of its kind found, with three highly relativistic objects all in orbit around each other, and this paper pretty much just says here is the discovery and the dynamics of the system, and hopefully future study will show some really strong constraints of gravity from it.

""Alright, here goes. I'm old. What that means is that I've survived (so far) and a lot of people I've known and loved did not. I've lost friends, best friends, acquaintances, co-workers, grandparents, mom, relatives, teachers, mentors, students, neighbors, and a host of other folks. I have no children, and I can't imagine the pain it must be to lose a child. But here's my two cents.

I wish I could say you get used to people dying. I never did. I don't want to. It tears a hole through me whenever somebody I love dies, no matter the circumstances. But I don't want it to ""not matter"". I don't want it to be something that just passes. My scars are a testament to the love and the relationship that I had for and with that person. And if the scar is deep, so was the love. So be it. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are a testament that I can love deeply and live deeply and be cut, or even gouged, and that I can heal and continue to live and continue to love. And the scar tissue is stronger than the original flesh ever was. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are only ugly to people who can't see.

As for grief, you'll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you're drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it's some physical thing. Maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it's a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive.

In the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what's going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life.

Somewhere down the line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O'Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you'll come out.

Take it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don't really want them to. But you learn that you'll survive them. And other waves will come. And you'll survive them too. If you're lucky, you'll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks.""

it's not a right of first refusal, it's a pro-rata share of the next round. investors who invested via a convertible note often don't get it, either. it isn't by any means a default.

the pro-rata allows the investor to maintain an ownership percentage (which is frequently important to institutional investor's limited partners) - it has nothing to do maintaining the value of what they own. if it is an up round, the value of what they own goes up.

pro-rata is most important in a down round - if a new investor comes in at a lower price than the previous valuation then all the previous investors get crammed down. this lets them prevent that.

TRUE,Izlandi,,,"&gt;Thank you, valuable information right there. I'm surprised Östermalm is that expensive, not knowing any better and looking from Google Maps it looks like Södermalm, Norrmalm or Kungshölmen would be more attractive. Is there a district you would recommend ?

Östermalm has always been an extreme ""upper-class"" district in Stockholm. It's quite secluded (not a lot going on, except for Stureplan) but it's still very close to the more vibrant parts of the city. Södermalm (or Söder for short) is more ""hip"", and many of the buildings aren't as ""nice"" as what you'd find on Kungsholmen or Vasastan/Birkastan (the area around Odenplan&amp;St:Eriksplan). It will be expensive to live at either of these locations, and if you aren't planning on buying an apartment you are in for hell. All of these are nice areas so it all really comes down to personal preference (and money, of course). 

If you can score an apartment anywhere ""innanför tullarna"" (in the city) you're set, public transportation is excellent. It wouldn't be more than 20 minutes for you to Östermalmstorg from anywhere. Use [SL](http://sl.se/en/Visitor/Plan-your-journey/) to see how long it would take. Consider areas like Fredhäll and Kristineberg (still close but not as sought-after as the ones previously mentioned). 

Also, if you are set on working around Östermalm it's worth checking out areas to the southwest like Liljeholmen and Årsta. The red metro line (which goes to straight to Östermalms torg without any changes at the central) runs that way, so from Liljeholmen it would still only be 12 minutes to get there. Those areas are a lot cheaper, while they still have a nice reputation and are fairly close to the city (compared to, say Hässelby or Vårberg). What I'm trying to get across: be ready to commute. Most Stockholmers do, myself included (and I live on Kungsholmen). Good luck, and feel free to ask if you have further questions (about the city in general, I know close to nothing about taxing and stuff).",0,1389004926,,0,FALSE,1,ceim5sx,t3_1ugj84,t1_ceim5sx,t1_cehuquc,1431821281,3,FALSE,stockholm,t5_2r7aq,3

TRUE,takemyworlddown,,,"I was 12 years old and had a Playstation 1 for Christmas. I had two games with it, one of which was Tomb Raider 2 that I was very eager to play. Take into account that I was brand new to having a games console and up until then I had only played on a Commodore 64.

So I had the main menu loaded up and scrolled through all of the options - as far as I was concerned the Passport icon was only for game settings and the option for ""New Game"" didn't come up automatically, so I decided that selecting ""Lara's Home"" was my best bet, since that was the first thing I had read about in the manual that came with it.

For three days, I played on Lara's Home. After playing the shit out of the obstacle course, running helplessly into the groaning butler and desperately trying to find the dual pistols, I was getting a bit tired of it by the third day.

Luckily, my cousin, a few years older than me, visited just after Christmas and had owned a PS for many years. He listened with pity on his face as I told him about my very boring experience with the first level of Tomb Raider.

And, of course, I watched in amazement as he selected ""New Game"" from the passport and I got to play the actual first level of Tomb Raider 2, with dual pistols, enemies and even cutscenes! I was so excited that I didn't even feel stupid about it until many years later.

TRUE,sleepinxonxbed,,,"The Simpsons now is a lot different from the Simpsons during their golden era. When the show started it was very much focused on the characters placed in every day slice of life scenarios. We saw how much the family loved each other and felt a strong emotional connection to them, [""Do it for her""](http://parallelevision.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/do-it-for-her.jpg) is one example. The reason why the Simpsons was successful was because the family loved each other and their friends no matter what. Every one has their flaws and shortcomings, and that's what made them feel so down to earth and human that they could be people we know. That's why each episode in the beginning golden era had a sense of timelessness that can be enjoyed no matter how old it may be.

Ever since the Simpsons have grown massive and taken on many years, the writers have taken the direction of being relevant to our times. The love between the family and friends is still there as evidenced in this episode, but the main theme shifted towards modern relevancy and grand adventures. There are episodes focused that focuses on technology such as media piracy, ipads, video game consoles, things that seem to break our imagination of the world of the Simpsons. This is an ageless family from the 90's, but they've acquired our modern day technology which sort of messes with our perception of the show. Yeah they're portraying feelings and problems that we have with our own technology, but these are just petty first world problems whose gimmick won't last years from now.

There are episodes where they frequently go on trips around the world and can do as much damage as they can with no repercussions. It's all fun at the moment, but this too breaks our perception of what the show was. How are they affording this? This isn't the same Homer Simpson who's (occasionally) working his ass off and scraping by to get what his family needs. Homer was (and still is) the loveable idiot that does what he can for the family. Take for example the very first episode where Homer had to spent his Christmas bonus to remove Bart's tattoo and had no money left to buy anyone presents and how he struggled to do what he can and eventually found Santa's Little Helper. That's the kind of character we can empathize with, not the Homer that can do outrageous things without consequence. I don't remember when for certain, but there were times where I felt like Homer was just an outright asshole that didn't redeem himself at the end (besides Frank Grimes, we were *meant* to hate Homer then).

Now I'm not saying that early Simpsons episodes were extremely realistic, take for example the episode where Mr. Burns wanted to buy all hundred puppies to make some clothing (See my vest! See my vest! See my vest!). That episode was surely exaggerated, but it touched our inner child and played out how we wanted to be the heroes when we were just kids. And the episode of Homer's repressed memory over the mystery corpse in the quarry which turned out to be Mr. Smithers' father (I can't believe I can remember this completely! But if you can picture an episode in it's entirety in your head then you know that it was something really special) It's episodes like these that flesh out the silly but loveable Simpsons universe and exceptionally touches our hearts.

Ever since the Simpsons have grown bigger and the episodes have become more extravagant and unrealistic, the universe the Simpsons had created for itself is broken. The Simpsons hasn't gone to shit, their approach to each episode has changed. That's why ""Steal this Episode"" still is a good episode, but not in the same right as the golden era episodes.

This is one of those times where the modern media really fails us as football fans in explaining exactly what has happened at Manchester United.  I often complain that they focus too much on irrelevance and not enough on the actual business of football behind the scenes and this is an example of where it could have helped.

I'm not sure what anybody else was expecting here but Man United are right about where I thought they would be. I think they'll finish higher than this but their form is somewhat predictable.

United as a Club has completely fell apart and it is the job of David Moyes to rebuild it.  It has fell apart because the Club in the modern era was built entirely to Ferguson's exacting standards and methods.  Every single person in every department of the Club knew what they were doing every day and what the ultimate point was.

Clubs falling apart after the movement of a Czar isn't new. United fell apart after Busby left, Liverpool got worse the more contrived the boot room system became.  It's natural.  

I think United fans should remember the words of Ferguson before he left.  He's a proper football man, as is David Moyes, and they both know the scale of the task Moyes has undertaken and the time it will take to bear fruit.  United can either studiously water their crops over time to create a vast sustainable empire once again that will provide riches for generations or they can dump nuclear waste on their land and grow tomacco.

For me, the real test of the Glazers as owners starts today.  You can talk about money and whatever but to most people it's an irrelevance, United have been ultra successful and the manager has been given what he wanted.  So far so good for the Glazers.  The test starts right now because we discover whether they are the seasoned and patient businessmen that the Edwards family were or just another kneejerk bunch of twats who are sacking managers on ridiculous timescales.

I think Moyes has certainly made mistakes, or rather a single mistake.  I think he tried to transition too quickly from Ferguson's staff to his own staff in the first team which created unneccesary pressure on himself.  This can be forgiven however as I see what he was trying to accomplish.  He knew that this would be a difficult period of transition and he wants to snap it as quickly as possible rather than do it piece by piece.  Managers often do lack patience in transition, AVB had the same problem at Chelsea.  Funnily, Ferguson did the same mistake when he first joined too.

I see people who have called Moyes unambitious because he has said that United played well when they didn't.  This is a man who had a job for life in a stable Premier League team where he was beloved and he decided to pack that in and move to the most famous Club in the world and succeed the best ever manager in the game, to take on a rebuilding job the like of which has never been done in the modern era of football.  Unambitious?  Do me a favour.

You see, Manchester United was a club built in Ferguson's own image and everybody took their lead from him.  He was an imposing figure yet if you meet him he had this working class charm that made you want to fight for him.  David Moyes is a similar figure but doesn't yet covet the same respect and loyalty from everybody at Manchester United.  There's no possible way that he could, that anybody could, most of the people at United were directly employed by Ferguson or employed whilst he was the manager.  In time, Moyes will have the same respect bestowed on him, that's all that it needs at the minute, just some time for him to get his feet under the table.

Some fans believe that David Moyes isn't the man for United.  I challenge the idea that they even understand what United is as a Club.  David Moyes is pretty much the prototypical Manchester United manager, if you had to walk away and design a man who would manage them, it is him.  He's fierce, he's tactically well versed, he has a superhuman work ethic, he believes in youth promotion, he plays with wingers, he inspires loyalty and fight from everybody around him.  Those who don't see this have never been to Everton away under his tenure there.  Moyes managed to turn that place into a lion's den in how ferocious the atmosphere was and how the team played, and make no mistake this developed under him and will wane without him, managers have a major effect on atmospheres as any United fan will tell you (or City fan for that matter), he will do the same to Old Trafford given time.  

So I suppose the problem here is that fans have underestimated the mammoth of a task that Moyes has to accomplish and pundits have over-simplified it.  It will take Moyes several years to get United built in his own image and it will be better off for it rather than start some roundabout of managerial changes.  And I warn United fans, I'm a fan of a Club that has had probably 30 managers in the past 30 years.  Once you start down this path of swapping in and out managers, you can never come back from it.

One last thing to note.  I find it interesting how many people when this was announced said things like ""Moyes will need a transition time"" but have now decided that he should be gone in January.  Transition time is a term used to denote the time it takes to sweep away the mentality of the old regime and bring in your own mentality.  Essentially, how long it takes to forget the old manager and buy into the thoughts of the new even if it conflicts with what the old manager would say.  For a manager who casts the shadow of Ferguson, this will take 3 or 4 years, not 3 or 4 months.  Bobby Charlton, Alex Ferguson and others at United understand this so appointed a manager who can rebuild United and have the wide shoulders it requires to bear the load of expectation from the fans and media.  They think they found their right man in David Moyes and all piss taking aside, so do I.  I hope that they both fight his corner in the boardroom and I'm sure they will.  These people understand United as a Club, understand what makes it successful and understand what makes it special.  

Moyes will be fine if the fans just shut up and let him do his job.

TRUE,catmoon,,,"We need to stop conflating education and job training. They are really two separate things. 

Professional degrees and traditional college educations serve two different purposes. One gives a person a specific skillset for a trade, the other gives the person a broad understanding of history, philosophy, and art. The idea of a professional undergraduate degree really didn't come around until the Industrial Revolution.

Now we find ourselves in a situation where even liberal-minded people discourage others from pursuing interests in the arts or history because you won't be a useful worker bee without an engineering degree. You can't read an article about education without ""employers"" being quoted. 

Well, I have an engineering degree and I am often aghast at the educational background of my engineering peers. They missed out on history, art, and philosophy. Many brag to me that they don't even read books, as if that is something to be proud of. They are uneducated in my mind, skilled but uneducated. 

There can be great and terrible consequences to having capable people go so uneducated and I will always be on the side that encourages a broad education for all. The ""value"" of an educated society is lower crime, better health, better family planning, etc. Employment is driven by the economy, not educational attainment.

I saw your thread and I thought I'd post what information I can to help out. I lead a T5 coil group as a War OT, and I'll try my best to give you our run down for T4. We run T4 with a 2 Magical/2 Physical combination, but adjustments can be made for Knights and Soldiers with little recourse to overall raid DPS. This is by no means a flawless strategy, but it has been working for us for 2 months, even when replacing various DD with inexperienced members. 



**-P1-**



* OT pulls while MT conserves resources for P2.

* Tomahawk &gt; Heavy Swing &gt; Flash &gt; Maim &gt; Blood Weapon + Berserk &gt; Overpower til Pacification &gt; Keep wrath stacks + Maim refreshed til P2

*MT runs NW in last 10 seconds to anticipate P2



**-P2-**



* MT at NW location, OT at NE

* DPS Focus MT targets, then switch to OT targets.

* OT opens with Flash &gt; Heavy &gt; Flash &gt; Skull &gt; Flash &gt; Butchers on Soldier, then I lay my Storm's Path combo on the Knight for the 10% DMG reduction.

* OT uses any defensive abilities with CDs under 2 minutes. Generally I just use Featherfoot, Thrill of Battle and maybe a Foresight if I'm feeling nervous.

* OT pulls his Knight and Soldier from NE to N to avoid melee DD gaining passive aggro on spiders at the end of the phase.



**-P3-**



* MT grabs Dreadknight, all ranged/healers, as well as melee and OT stack directly behind DK to minimize the time it takes to feed the spiders.

* MT slowly kites DK from NW position to S position as DD pop all CDs and kill asap.

* OT keeps Storm's Path active, (will usually pop unchained during this point as well), but stays relatively conservative with his TP/MP.

* At 50 seconds into this phase you want to have roughly 50% TP remaining, with 5 wrath stacks available.

* At 50 seconds use Heavy Swing, then run to East-Central position to anticipate P4.



**-P4-**



* Skull Sunder + Focus Target first Rook.

* Run West-Central, Butcher's Block second Rook.

* Blood Weapon + Berserk + Overpower. Both Pox should be relatively synced, so just stand just anticipate and dodge when needed. 

* BRD should play Ballad during this phase, DD should AoE when possible with melee focus the Rooks.

* When both Rooks are dead, conserve TP while maintaining Wrath til end of phase.

* At 50 seconds left use Heavy Swing &gt; Skull Sunder and then run to mid, while MT runs NE.



**-P5-**



* DD Kill Knight/Solder &gt; DK

* Butcher's Block Knight in Center, Tomahawk &gt; Heavy Swing &gt; Flash &gt; Skull Sunder &gt; Flash on Soldier, then spread your single hate combo out between the two where enmity is required.

* OT must avoid using as many defensive CDs as possible in this phase! Holmgang if things go sour, as you won't need it in P6.

* DD and OT switch to DK when Soldier and Knight are dead. Apply Storm's Patch, while maintaining wrath stacks.

* At 50 seconds into P5 use Heavy Swing &gt; Skull Sunder, then run to mid.



**-P6-**



* Having everyone except MT stacked in center for the start of this phase is very helpful.

* MT picks up second DK ASAP.

* Butcher's Block the Knight, Tomahawk the Soldier, Overpower the Spiders.

* Take notice as to whether or not you have top enmity on the Rook, as you don't want to start kiting if you do.

* After Rook is dead all ranged and healers move to directly behind the two DKs, giving the OT room to kite in a circle rather than an arc.

* OT stagger all CDs while Kiting with Overpower. Vengeance &gt; Forsight &gt; Thrill of Battle &gt; Featherfoot + Covalescence.

* DD Focus P5 DK, then Knight/Soldier.

* When Knight and Soldier are dead OT feeds 2 spiders to last DK.

* Stack up, pop all offensive CDs. Healers spam AoE when enrage starts.

- NiP (Mimer, Malunoo, Bjergsen, Freeze, Deficio) lose in EU LCS playoffs to Gambit and ATn. Not only do they not qualify for Worlds but they also don't qualify for the EU LCS Spring Split in 2014.

- NiP releases Mimer.

- Rekkles finally turns 17 (swear that kid was 16 for 5 years) and finally becomes the starting ADC for Fnatic. While Rekkles was always under contract with Fnatic he was 'on loan' to Copenhagan Wolves for (approx) 6 months. He'd play in CW's Challenger team but wear a Fnatic jersey and play under the name 'FNC Rekkles'. 

- NiP adds Kev1n and hyrqbot from SK roster as starting toplaner and jungler respectively and Malunoo is demoted to substitute player. Kev1n comments that he wanted to join NiP and hyrqbot went with him because they're best mates etc.

- Freeze starts practicing with a so called 'EU super team' (Jwaow, Shook, Froggen, Freeze, EDward) but nothing really happens except a fuckton of reddit drama because nearly all the players are stuck in contracts. 

- Copenhagan Wolves jungler Shook leaves the team for 'an offer he can't refuse'. Team announces that soloqueue superstar Amazing (Diamondprox approved) will replace Shook as the new jungler and Greek superhero and occasional underwear model Forg1ven will replace Rekkles as the new ADC.

- NiP adds talented Danish ADC and former Lemondogs substitute MrRalleZ as their new substitute.

- NiP re-negotiates Freeze's contract and confirms he'll be on the team heading into 2014.

- SK Gaming announces it's roster as it heads into relegations, Fredy122 top, Svenskeren jungle, Jezis midlane, CandyPanda ADC and Nyph support. Nyph is announced as team captain and as the man responsible for building the team. ocelote steps down to substitute until the end of the year when he will leave the team.

- Bjergsen announces he's leaving NiP and TSM pay a huge release and transfer fee to get him playing in NA. Bjergsen then reaches Doublelift levels of fame and gets the adoring fans and Twitch revenue to match.

- NiP announces it has added Lemondogs players Nukeduck, Zorozero and Mithy to the NiP roster as midlane, toplane and support respectively. Nukeduck and co give up their guaranteed LCS spot in the pursuit of more money (NiP are a richer organisation than Lemondogs) and a better infrastructure (NiP actually have a gaming house whereas LD had it's players living in a hotel practicing in ESL studios.

- NiP releases Kev1n from his contract and 'helps him join a new LCS team'. Current NiP roster consists of Zorozero top, hyrqbot jungle, Nukeduck midlane, Freeze ADC and Mithy support.

- EDward rejoins Gambit.

- CLG (trying out TrickZ for the jungle role and Aphromoo for the support role), Cloud 9, Fnatic and Gambit battle it out in the 'pro tournament' at IEM Cologne. Rekkles and Liftlift reignite their rivalry with trash talk and Fnatic fans breath a sign of relief as Fnatic win the series 2 - 1, CLG fans seem happy with the score as well (1 round is better than 0) and [Rekkles and Doublelift hug it out](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BWRA5Ax1Mc) and Rekkles says Doublelift is a big hero of his (d'awwww).

- Cloud 9 get stomped by Gambit 2 - 0. Highlights include Meteos doing Red while Gambit shove 2 turrets and Darien building AP on Shyvana. Gambit then crush Fnatic 2 - 0 and no one really cares cause Fnatic fans are just happy they didn't lose to CLG and win the whole tournament, yey! Reddit instantly proclaims that Gambit are the best team in Europe and with EDward Gambit would've likely crushed those noob Koreans in the Doujin Pink Shovel.

- NiP, SK and CW battle it out in the 'amateur tournament' at IEM Cologne. CW fails to lose a single game and (obviously) wins the whole event, NiP panic and withdraw from Dreamhack Winter and all online events they were scheduled to appear in and give 'we need to practice as much as possible' as the reasoning.

- SK attend Dreamhack Winter alongside a Polish team called KMT (also qualified for the EU LCS offline qualifiers). They look pretty terrible through but, thankfully, their opponents are a bunch of amatuer HoN players so they make it to finals with a few 2 - 1 victories. They then lose a decisive game 1 to KMT and are about to lose game 2 until KMT pull of a huge throw and SK seemingly wake up and start playing well in game 3 as they win the event. (Funfact: This was the first LAN 1st place in the history of any SK LoL team). 

- Tabzz joins Alliance alongside Wickd (top), Shook (jungle), Froggen (mid) and Kazmitch (temporary support player). Alliance takes over EG's spot in the EU LCS (both Alliance and EG are owned by the same guy Alex Garfield, EG is generally seen as the NA brand and Alliance as the EU brand).

- ATn announce that Kev1n has joined them as their new toplaner and that Kerp (Krepo's German evil trackball mouse using twin) will be moving from toplane to midlane, everyone says goodbye to the Eloking of old ForrellenLord and a few cranky redditors celebrate that casters can't continue to beat that nickname to death anymore. 

- The remaining 3 EG members (Krepo, Snoopeh and Yellowpete) move to NA, buy out Velocity's LCS relegation spot and pick up NA rookies Innox (top) and Pobelter (mid) with the aim of competing in the NA LCS.  

- Former Lemondogs jungler Dexter leaves the organisation and announces he's temporarily moving to NA to try out as the starting jungler for CLG.

- Lemondogs announces it's new roster, Myw top, ImSoFresh jungle, Shylaya mid, CrazyCaps ADC and Zeriouz support. Fans give them the affectionate nicknames: who, that toxic wanker, that Frenchie, who and who respectively.

- CW beating MYM 3 - 1 and qualify for the EU LCS!

- Alliance crushes Team Dignitas in an NA vs. EU showmatch and everyone declares Alliance as the greatest team in Europe. Meanwhile SK beat Supa Hot Crew XD (not related to XD.GG) in a very tense and exciting series 3 - 2 and re qualify for the EU LCS!

- Bjergsen's debut with TSM is against the new Lemondogs lineup and, unsurprisingly, Lemondogs get brutally fisted for an hour and a half. Highlights include: ImSoFresh counterjungling the enemy Wraiths with Amumu while TSM push down 2 turrets (\#worth), Bjergsen doing a Faker impression and 1v3ing LD with LeBlanc and ImSoFresh getting fed on Vi and proceeding to build Full Damage (Cyanide commented *'that build was so soloqueue not even soloqueue does it'*).

- EU Redditors demands Lemondogs heads on a stick as is tradition when an European team loses to an NA team (good thing it doesn't happen often).

- NiP loses in a huge upset to Polish team 'KMT' 3 - 0 and fails to qualify for the LCS. All NiP members played terribly and were, as you'd expect, ridiculed for it relentlessly by Reddit. 

- Some intelligent, witty and (no doubt) handsome redditer posts a post called [*'I have collected evidence showing that NiP intends to buy LD's LCS spot'*](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1t05o1/speculation_i_have_collected_evidence_showing_nip/) which does what it says on the tin. More shitstorm from Reddit follows.

- EG qualify for the NA LCS in a dominating 3 - 0, Gambit beat XXDG.XD 2 - 0 in a very trollish manner (Amumu support, Warwick top) and ATn beat CLG (in an actually decently close) 2 - 0. Fnatic then go full retard and lose to Cloud 9 2 - 0, highlights include Renekton mid, Hai crushing on Kassadin and xPeke trying to move Kassadin and realizing he's actually a Renekton. NA fans go back to calling Meteos 'the best jungler in the world' and all is right with the world.

- Some NA teams beat some other NA teams and qualify for the NA LCS (I wasn't paying attention to be honest). I do know that one team had a black guy (like actually black, not that sort of black that Aphromoo is) in it who played Lucian a bit and roleplayed as Lucian in the trash talk intro vid and he had an Asian duolane partner, [they even won a super serious and not all parody award.](http://esportsexpress.com/2014/01/esex-lol-awards-2013/)

- [NA wins Battle of the Atlantic on points but EU won more games so no one really feels satisfied.](http://lol.gamepedia.com/Battle_of_the_Atlantic).

We'll never know for sure how the full extent of the Kataanians' plan or their technology, but I'm pretty sure of the following:

1. The probe was interactive. While I always stress that it was  NOT a dream -- these memories were permanently imbedded -- the Nucleonic beam functioned like lucid dreaming. Picard's own mind filled in a lot of the blanks. 

2. The Kataanians wanted him to ""walk a mile in their shoes"" -- but that required neither marriage nor kids. Picard secretly missed having a family. That was elucidated very subtly in the Writers Draft of ""IL"" in the original Captain's Log I wrote, which the producers eliminated.

3. Yes, the scientist on the team that created the nucleonic beam played the role of ""Eline."" But, if Picard had been gay, she probably would have appeared as a friend or roommate or fellow council member, not a wife. The Beam had that much leeway, depending on Picard's subconscious.

4. Remember, the Probe sought HIM out. Not Picard specifically, but ""one man good and true,"" Green Lantern style. If Kataan was a very family-centric community, maybe it looked for someone with a subconscious that wold go that way. I believe it would have accommodated that inclination whether he was straight or gay.

TRUE,T3chnopsycho,,,"It had to do with what it would cost and what would be gained in return. 

There would have been a lot of difficulties. If Hitler had started to conquer Switzerland the Swiss army had the plan of going into the Réduit. This was basically giving up a large part of the country and going to hiding in the mountains. Sounds maybe stupid (giving up all your cities) but the strategically most important part of Switzerland are all the passes over and the tunnels going through the mountains (e.g. [the Gotthard tunnel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gotthard_Tunnel)) These are very important passages to travel north - south in Europe. By hiding in bunkers throughout the Alps we could have still guarded these passages.

And to add to that there were plans to destroy these tunnels which would have basically made any conquering more or less meaningless.

Also it is rather difficult to fight an enemy in the mountains especially when that is their home territory. 

The next point is that the axis powers wouldn't have gained that much from conquering Switzerland as they didn't really depend on having those geographical points. 

Also noting the Swiss military was at that time quite large (proportional to the number of citizens) which has to do with our military system (every man has to do military service and is in sort of reserve after that service so if we would mobilize we could effectively more than double our numbers in rather a short time.)

And the last point (which some Swiss people dislike to admit) is that we also held diplomatic relations with all sides of the war. We did hold a lot of the money of all contenders and we also didn't (at least openly) support either side of the war. So no party had a reason to attack us. Last thing was that we also really held ourselves out of the war and just secured our country. Even though some of our cities were bombed we didn't threaten anyone nor did we declare war. 

Add to that that we have always been rather a bit ~~isolationist~~ non-interventionist (like not joining any big country groups or alliances and thus didn't have any reason nor obligation to join the war.

I have to say I cannot guarantee that this is all 100% correct. I'm Swiss and this is also a topic that interests me a lot. And I've also discussed this a lot of times before. 

 I also have some other reasons but for those I'm really not sure if they are just speculation or have valid proof so I'll leave them out.

TRUE,klaviersonic,,,"As someone who has studied a lot of theory, from 16th C. Counterpoint to the analytic writings of Heinrich Schenker and Hugo Riemann, I would say that most of what you need to know about ""theory"" is the most practical application of it. I think a lot of beginners confuse ""theory"" with basic musical vocabulary. Understanding what the Lydian Mode is and how it relates to a Major 7th chord is not theory, it's a prerequisite to basic musical understanding! Theory is when you're able to separate the middle and deep structure from the surface musical events, which is useful when unraveling the multiple layers holding Beethoven's Eroica Symphony together, but probably a lot less useful for somebody trying to compose a symphony (or a dance track) as a personal expression or artistic statement.

A lot of Theorists were on track to becoming decent composers before falling down the rabbit hole of ""advanced theory."" Now they spend their time obsessing over pitch-class transformations, but can barely harmonize a pop tune and certainly would lack the pure melodic artistry of a W.A. Mozart or a Bob Dylan.

What most musicians want to gain from theory is an intuitive grasp of how to write a sweet tune, or a funky bass line, and harmonize it with sexy voluptuous chords, or how to improvise a solo over chord changes, creating an emotional progression, and telling a story. To do this, a basic understanding of the IV-V-I chords in every Major and Minor key is the bare necessity, but obviously not the key to opening up the entire art of music to anybody. The foundation has to be there though, and it's not a theoretical task. 

Get to the keyboard everyday, play the V7-I in every Major Key, and the V7-i in every Minor Key, around the Circle of Fifths. Be able to write the same progression on paper in every key, with the key signatures written out. This is the Karate Kid Wax-on/Wax-off boring chore that needs to become subconscious for it to work. If you take more than a split second to figure out the Dominant of A-flat Minor, you haven't mastered the basics yet. Once you do though, understanding Chord-Mode/Scale relationships, extended/altered chords, and progressions/substitutions/reharmonizations will come really easily.

Some resources I've found helpful:

http://danadler.com/misc/Cycles.pdf //Scale-Cycles &amp; ""Giant Steps""


Even all this won't prepare one to actually write a simple melody really well, or to write multiple lines that interact harmonically while being beautiful melodies separately. You have to use your ears, study intensively the music you like, and tons of music outside of the particular genres you're comfortable with. Little stylistic nuances separate an authentic passionate expression from a stiff academic imitation. There's a world of artistry in connecting a handful of tones together, that all the theory in the world is lacking to fulfill. Transcribe as much as you can, this is the best teacher, and the way music has always been taught. J.S. Bach never studied harmony in the academic way it's taught today. He sang in the boys chorus, played the violin, developing a sense of pitch and harmony. He transcribed numerous concerti by Vivaldi and Marcello, acquiring a feel for stylistic gestures and musical language. He walked 250 miles to meet the greatest organist in the world, Buxtehude, and directly absorbed the technique and history of keyboard performance and baroque improvisation through him. Bach said (paraphrasing): ""Anybody can do what I can do, if they have worked as hard as I have worked."" What have you done lately?

To you or me it may not seem like a big deal, but to a perfectionist like her, each bite would taste like an indictment on her own inadequacies. Every time one of those ragged edges played over her tongue, it would taste like failure, and a reminder that her life was a train wreck of bad decisions. It would stab her through the heart like the abortion she never got for the sex she'd  never had with the boyfriend she couldn't keep.

It would represent the torn relationship between herself and her estranged parents who were ashamed of their firstborn.

TRUE,LowkoTV,,,"For anyone on mobile data or whatever, wondering what the video is about!

In this video I cover a relatively easy build order for new or returning Zerg players for StarCraft 2: Heart of the Swarm. This build order is easy to execute after a few hours of practice. It will allow you to beat your opponents.

Maybe you have completed the single player, maybe you have 1000 games logged and can’t get out of silver, but either way, I expect that you know how the race works and how the other races work. You need to know the basics of the game, such as the importance of Queen injects.

In this video I will cover a +1 Missles Attack, Glial Reconstitituion timing attack: A Roach Timing push. But before we make any Roaches, we will try to get a max saturation on 2 bases with a total of 41 Drones (16 + 16 on Minerals and 3 + 3 + 3 on Gas). The early game defence will be done by Queens, 4 of them. After we get all necessary upgrades going, the Lair is done, the Drones are out and the Queen injects are hit we start pumping out Roaches until we hit the timing of around 110 supply at the 9:30 in game minute mark.

The build order:

- 14 Spawning Pool

- 15 Hatchery

- 15 Queen

- 17 Overlord

- 2x Zerglings

- @First Queen: Second Queen

- @Natural Hatchery: Third Queen

- @Second Queen: 4th Queen

- 5:00 Double Extractor

- 100 Gas: Lair + Evolution Chamber

- A little bit later: Roach Warren + 3rd Extractor

- @Evo Chamber: +1 Missles Attack

- @Lair: Glial Reconstitution (Roach Speed)

- At max saturation (32 on Minerals and 9 on Gas), make as many Roaches as possible.

- Push at Roach Speed and +1 Missles Attack.

It’s quite easy to practice a build order, but what you don’t want to do is jump into a game of StarCraft 2 blindly. Make sure to practice this a few times before executing it versus a real opponent. Maybe you need 100 custom practice games, maybe you need 5, but either way: Practice before laddering. Because you will get frustrated otherwise. And frustration sucks!

TRUE,oneanddoneforfun,,,"I just want to preface this with a disclaimer: This is MY approach, which has been exceedingly successful in enriching my life with the company of amazing, attractive and worthwhile women. While your results may vary based on environment, execution and other variables, this is not so much about how you do it as why you do it, and your general attitude concerning personal interactions with people you find interesting.

Perhaps the most important position to adopt is not to be too deterministic about approaching strangers. Approaching a stranger with dating/sex as your primary motivator is putting the cart before the horse a bit. Your first motivation should be simply to interact successfully. That means just being good company and enjoying good company for their own sake. That nervousness you feel when approaching a woman, that you don't feel when you talk to a guy? That's what I'm talking about.

The people who find cold approaches most easy and successful are people who are simply happy to be good company to anyone they talk to, male or female. This general air of friendliness and approachability bypasses the ""salesman awareness"" we all have (the feeling that triggers, for instance, when you get a phone call and you KNOW they're trying to sell you something, and you just want them to go away). It's ""I'm not asking anything from you but some pleasant conversation, and I'm not offering anything more than that either (at this point)."" When your goal is simply good company, if all you get out of your interaction is some pleasant conversation with an attractive person, you're still WAY ahead, and you don't feel defeated or terrible about yourself when it doesn't go well. You just roll on to the next pleasant conversation with the next attractive person, rather than feel like you just blew your shot with ""the one."" When you lower the stakes, you risk less and still get the enjoyment of the game, and it's a lot easier for a woman to reject your approach if she thinks you're just trying to fuck her or con her into a date (which is often just pretext for trying to fuck her).

This shift in objective gives you time to determine if this person is someone you actually WANT to know more about, and I promise you that anyone worth having is going to appreciate that opportunity to do the same. You'll find that, in many cases, the person you cold-approach ends up having nothing going on, or raising red flags that you'll be glad you gave her time to reveal before you took it further. We're not talking about a half-hour here-- If you can find a way to keep her attention for five minutes or more, you usually have a LOT more usable information about her suitability than if you just said something nice about her hair and gave her your number.

If you find, after a comfortable amount of chit-chat, that she's worth your time, don't overstay your welcome. Find a natural reason to take off while there's still a little momentum in the discourse (usually looking at the time and saying ""Oh, damn, I've got to run"" will do the trick), and suggest some means of non-invasive interaction. A phone number is fine, but email is perfectly good too. Just some way of communicating that you enjoyed your chat and would like to continue the interaction later when you've both got time. If she gives you a phone number, text her right there and then. If it's a fake, you know right away and save yourself a lot of hassle. If it's not, now she has YOUR number and the door is open for HER to initiate further contact at her convenience.

Overall, this advice is only useful if you're looking for the company of a worthwhile person that could potentially become an ongoing dating/relationship situation. If you're just looking to get laid, you might find that cold-approaching outside of situations that advance that agenda (clubs, bars, etc) is going to produce mixed results (and invite a lot of chaos and crazy drama into your life).

In any case, good luck. :)

TL;DR: The world doesn't need another pick-up technician, but it definitely needs more good company. Be good company. People like good company. After that, the rest handles itself.",0,1389028935,,0,1389030560,1,ceis9ro,t3_1uj7kq,t1_ceis9ro,t1_ceio2nv,1431824219,170,FALSE,socialskills,t5_2r275,170
TRUE,KillerHoggle,,,"**Edit: I know this is a controversial topic and a lot of people will disagree with me, but please consider, rather than downvoting it would be better if we could discuss this. Downvoting just hides it and prevents debate, where we'd be better off discussing how we can get past this system or improve it rather than just trying to censor opinions we disagree with.**    


I'll probably be downvoted to hell for this, but I can kinda see where the /r/funny mods are coming from. The subreddit is for funny pictures or funny text stories. Stand up shots are basically funny stories or jokes pasted next to a picture of the comedian. For /r/funny, they'd probably prefer that be a text post because otherwise people will just copy all text into a picture format to get karma from jokes. So if it was a funny picture where the picture itself had content and the text was related to it, they'd probably allow it. But I imagine with the case of stand up shots, seeing a load of text with some random, non related picture (apart from it being the person who said it), would seem like an excuse to get karma rather than share the content which could be shared in a self post.    


I noticed in the /r/funny sidebar this rule:    

6. No Pictures of just text	Make a self post instead.     


Which kind of backs up the point I'm trying to make about /r/funny moderators logic. Althought a stand up shot isn't a picture of just text, it's a picture of just text with a persons face next to it, which doesn't really add anything to the text.    

The whole point made about webcomics, in my opinion, doesn't make much sense since in webcomics the actual comic is picture content and submitting it as a link makes sense. Often in webcomics the text itself doesn't work and the pictures help add to the humour. Stand up shots are completely different from webcomics and comparing the two is nonsense. One relies on pictures for the joke, the other is just a joke with a picture added for the sake of it.    


As far as I can see from the rules of /r/funny, there's no rule against submitting a joke that would be in the form of a picture in /r/standupshots but submitting it to /r/funny in text format in the form of a self post. This will allow you to share the content all the same but also prevents people just turning funny stories into jpgs for karma.      


Also, /r/funny does help advertise /r/standupshots in it's sidebar in the very rule section where they mention stand up shots aren't allowed.    
 

Sorry if you disagree with me or feel I'm wrong. I am a fan of stand up shots and a subscriber here, and have been for a long time. I just feel that a lot of the points in this image are misaddressed and the confusion stems from the reasoning behind the banning of stand up shots; it would seem the /r/funny mods are doing it to stop the very karma whores and power users OP here seems to be against himself. /r/standupshots is one of the few subreddits which encourages posting text based content in the form of a link post, allowing the user to gather karma for text content. Whether that's good or bad is up to debate but the /r/funny mods decided they didn't want people to use that system in their subreddit in case of abuse and I think that should be respected.

TRUE,youwillbefineandhapp,,,"My biggest piece of advice is quit researching about DP/DR or any mental health disorders while you are in the process of healing. You need to isolate your life and put yourself in a position where you are living the notions of a healthy individual and the person you want to be. 

1) Don't start diagnosing yourself with anything(I self diagnosed with brain cancer, schizophrenia, Alzheimer, and almost anything you can imagine!). You are not sick and you can be cured. You are not suffering from any incurable disease. I've walked your shoes. I was so numb I couldn't cry when I wanted to. I was so lost I didn't know the people I was looking at anymore. My life was a blur and I thought I was a lost cause. I wasn't and am not a lost cause! I'm happy! I smile now! I laugh at how I lived this experience for such a long time and it's over!

2) There isn't a thought you have thought that isn't normal. You think you are just over analyzing and over thinking everything but it's actually normal. You might think some things you think are sick and twisted but it's not. You don't have to answer the bad questions you may ask yourself or the terrible thoughts that might go through your head. It's normal. You anxiety is the root of all of this. You have to slowly instill thoughts of positive thinking. I'll be honest...it's hard but you can do it. I thought I couldn't but I did and slowly I noticed myself not thinking the negative questions as much and slowly I was thinking less and less bad and more and more positive. 

3) Remind yourself that this is just a phase that will pass. This is just a bad day, week, month, or year. This doesn't last forever. You are rock bottom and things will only move up from now on. Today is better than yesterday, this week is better than last week and so on. Put in a CD that brings you to a time you really enjoyed in your life. Put on a movie that was amazing. It'll seem a little weird watching it now but you'll find it refreshing to get a feeling of something bringing you back to a place you enjoyed. If you experience anxiety because of it remember this is just your anxiety controlling you.

I personally believe anxiety is the root to all of this. You become so attached to anxiety that you live your life in it. You detach from everything because you fear to not fear. I know it sounds ridiculous but from my 5 years of DP/DR that is what I have learned. I learned to control my anxiety and when I started doing that I noticed improvement. I didn't ""cure"" my anxiety but I realized once I didn't let it eat me away I no longer suffered from this anymore. Everyone of you may have a different way of coping with anxiety but my advice to myself was to take my anxiety head on and force myself to feel it. Do things that would make me uncomfortable and put myself in the situation where I was hurting but than I reminded myself I will overcome this.

Those were the most terrifying times of my life but I came out strong and cured. I pushed myself to my limits.

Two years ago she was on a plane that had just boarded and was sitting on the tarmac about to pull away from the gate. Sitting next to my mom was a typical business guy asshat who was on a phone call yelling at someone on the other end. A very nice flight attended comes over, leans over my mom and says ""Sir, you're going to have to turn the phone off, the cabin doors are closed."" (Of course if this was economy class she would have been more forceful, but she gives him a small warning) 

The guy quiets down but he does not get off his phone. At this point the flight attendants are doing the safety protocol speech as the plane backs up and all of the sudden the guy starts yelling again on the phone. Another flight attendent, this time more forceful tells him to turn off the phone. The man turns to her and says ""Fuck you."" She gives this 'humph' face and then turns and goes out of sight.

It is at this point of the story that my mom reminds everyone listening that many pilots are veterans, they are military men and do not take that type of crap from asshats. My mom hears a door slam open and out of the cockpit comes the pilot. He is so angry you can see the veins on his face. His eyes bulge as he yells in rage, ""WHAT DID YOU SAY TO HER?!!? This is my aircraft and in case of an emergency I expect every passenger to follow the commands of my air staff. You disrespecting her, disrespects me and puts every person on this plane at risk!""

The asshat now being borne down upon by this massive angry ex-soldier cowers, puts away his phone and stammers an apology. Without missing a beat the pilot continues ""You can take your sorry and shove it! You are not going anywhere! It is a federal crime to disobey an order from your air crew and you can tell whoever was so gawd-damn important on the other end of the phone call that fact after you talk to TSA."" The pilot goes back into the cockpit, pulls the plane back to the gate. Some uniformed police come in and take the guy off.

Dead silence on the plane. As my mom always closes the story, ""As god is my witness, everyone in unison takes out their phone, waves it in the air and shows that it is clearly in the off position,"" just like the ""tickets"" scene from Indiana Jones.

[Here](http://calleteach.wordpress.com/2010/01/10/sounds-of-english-nasals-liquids-glides/) is a quick rundown on what liquids and glides are (and nasals too if anyone wants extra-credit).

There are a lot of theories, but essentially we don't really know what causes these sorts of disorders. Many believe it's a neurological ""cross-wiring"" when the sounds are developing in children's brains, others believe it's bad habit, and some would attribute it to other things such as hearing difficulty (if you can't hear the sound well, it's hard to produce - think of a deaf person speaking) or other disorders such as autism spectrum disorders.

[Here](http://www.asha.org/public/speech/disorders/speechsounddisorders/) is a quick guide to speech sound disorders from ASHA, the American Speech-Language Hearing Association for an official, non-ELI5 guide.

EDIT: Just to be clear - if a child has a speech-sound disorder it DOES NOT mean that they have a hearing loss or autism. Often, if a child DOES have a hearing loss or some other type of disorder, a speech-sound disorder can also be found in the child. That is also why when I (or any speech-pathologist should, really) am performing an initial diagnostic on a child, I will make sure hearing is OK and do a family interview for any other speech/language related disorders in the family history (among other things which I won't go into here). It could be a symptom of a larger problem, but it may be isolated - you always want to check.

You either are one of these or you are not which is the opposite of how most are using them here.    

IF we are talking solely about diets this gets even more simple.   
 -Veganism is the practice of abstaining from all animal products.    
  -Vegetarianism is the practice of abstaining from the consumption of meat (red meat, poultry, seafood, etc and the flesh of any other animal)    
- Pescetarianism is the practice of a diet that includes seafood, but not the flesh of other animals.  
  
You CAN NOT be a vegan if you use any animal products in your diet.   
 You CAN NOT be a vegetarian if you eat any meat in your diet.    
You CAN NOT be a pescetarian if you eat any meat that is not fish.  
  
To call yourself any of these when you don't follow them, or because you don't like to have to explain yourself, is wrong and lazy.  You are just doing a disservice to those who actually define themselves correctly.  
  
""I'm a vegetarian that eats fish"" is not possible and only further confuses those who aren't educated on the subject.  Saying ""My diet is similar to that of a vegetarian but I eat fish"" would be a much better answer or statement.

TRUE,condimentia,,,"Not an obnoxious passenger story, but a somewhat sad one, about a crying child.

This was in the late 1970s.  I was seated on a plane when a *very* young girl, maybe 5 at the most, was flying unaccompanied. She was escorted to her seat by her grandparents who were loving and kissing her goodbye. They nestled a padded cooler under her feet and said goodbye, crying and holding tissues to their eyes.  She was returning from a visit and on her way back home from Maryland to California.  

The attendants checked on her regularly and she was so quiet and well behaved.  But she kept unbuckling her belt to bend down and unzip the cooler and check inside.  She seemed to be getting more distressed as the flight from Maryland to California progressed.  I finally asked her ""do you have a pet mouse in there?"" with a smile ""...or maybe a rabbit?""

She looked up at me and her eyes welled up with tears.  ""No it's Maryland crab cakes.""  Then she burst into tears.   ""Mommy said to bring home Maryland crab cakes so nana packed them.  Mommy told me to not lose the crab cakes or she'd spank me forever.  What if someone takes my crab cakes?""  She just just started to sob.  ""I can't lose the crab cakes.  I can'ttttttttttt lose the crab cakessssssssssss.""

The passenger ahead of her was a good-old-boy used car salesman type who turned around and said ""Shaddup KID.""

I was so heartbroken for this kid who felt such pressure to deliver mom's precious cargo to her.  I said ""Let's lock them up with a magic key.""  We zipped up the cooler case, the I made as if I was locking it.  I put my invisible key inside her pocket.  ""There.  no one can take your crab cakes.  Now you can take a nap or read if you like.""   She said ""Okay.   You have to watch them for me also.""  I said ""You bet.""

Once we landed and she was escorted off the plane by the attendant, her mother was waiting for her in the gate.  She took the cooler from the girl and said ""Come on.""  Mom turned around and walked ahead of the girl, carrying the cooler and she didn't take the girl's hand or anything.  

The girl was ahead of me several paces and turned around and waved at me as she followed her crab cake delivery.

I think about her constantly. She's an adult now and I hope she is happy.

TRUE,OGLothar,cust ielift,98% Chimp,"This does not directly address your question, but may be of some use anyhow. I did some cooking, testing and weiging of bacon because I didn't like the stats on the back of the bacon packet (they don't account for cooking). 

So here's something I posted in /r/keto a year or so: 

All the MyFitnessPal entries seem to be about the same. About 200 calories or more from two slices of bacon, and a lot of that being fat.

So, I cooked up four slices of bacon, weighed them before and after and came up with the following:

They started out at 118 grams, ended up at 38 grams cooked (medium crispy, not brittle) and lost a total of 35 grams of fat that I poured out of the pan and weighed. [3] Yummy 

According to normal raw bacon stats you might think you're eating about 450-500 calories each time you eat 4 slices of bacon, when in fact it's more like 145 (in this case).

This might help some of you if you're actually counting calories (as I am, trying to stay at 2800 in a weightlifting program).

I was horrified when I realized I was limiting my potential bacon intake on a vicious lie. Of course, if you're eating your bacon totally raw, disregard all this, my Inuit friends.

For those of you that this might help, I entered this into the MFP database as "" Compliments Sobey's Maple Bacon (after cooking)"" - do your own tests, but these stats should be close enough to most store bacon brands. Certainly closer than the raw stats are.

Happy baconing.

Packed movie theater, my SO and I got seats toward the front so we could sit in the middle and not be surrounded by people. The trailers hadn't started yet and our row was one of three or four that was empty. Prospects looked good. 

Then, a gaggle of pre-teen girls show up and sit down a few seats over next to us. They're laughing and talking really loudly. One of the girls brought their parents and they didn't seem to mind the obnoxiousness. So I'm thinking to myself: this is gonna suck. They're giggling at every tiny thing in the trailers, and literally every other line that an actor says is repeated in a stupid voice and followed by giggles. Ugh.

And it did suck. I didn't think it was possible to giggle at every single moment during a mostly serious adventure movie, but they sure fucking did it. I got to the point where I had to Shh them. I couldn't take it anymore. Is anyone reading this surprised that my sshh'ing did absolutely nothing? They stared at me and kept talking. Not bothering to whisper at all. 

Honestly I'm surprised I was the only one, as the people behind us just have been irritated but were silent. Whatever. 

The movie ends and I'm pissed as ever. It literally was my worst experience in a movie theater (even worse than when I went to opening night Harry Potter 8 and the same thing happened- not as bad though.)

My SO took me to Coldstone and treated me to some icecream because you could basically see the steam coming out of my ears. Guess who walked in after us? The fucking preteens. They recognized me immediately and obnoxiously and loudly shushed me in the crowded ice cream shop. My face was so red. 

It was worse when I had to walk by them and they bombarded me with almost yelling shushes, which I didn't know was possible. I said ""fuck off"" and spent the rest of the night regretting not talking to their parents or having them thrown out of the theater. Next time? I'll give you one fucking shush to shut up and I'm talking to the manager. You're not there to talk, you're there to shut up and watch the movie. 

If you wanna giggle and repeat every sentence and be obnoxious, don't go to the movie theater and act surprised when people want you to shut your trap. There are few things that piss me off more than people who can't be courteous to others enough to sit silently through a movie.

TRUE,layinbrix,,,"The real lingering issue in this article is a conflicting interest between the small-scale 'natural' farmer/rancher and the large scale livestock producer.  These check-off and marketing order programs were established to bring market power to an industry that previously had none.  The majority of ranchers aren't producing a value-added animal (i.e. grass-fed, or no hormone added livestock) so when they go to sell their cattle at auction they get whatever price is being offered by the packer.  Ranchers are close to the bottom of the derived demand chain; beef consumers decide how much product they want, beef retailers decide how much they need to buy from the packer, packer decides how much they need to buy from the rancher. The auction is where cattle producers are given a price to take, it's the free market in action. 

If a company wants to boost sales of its product, it advertises.  The typical rancher selling cattle at auction won't benefit from advertising because they don't have a differentiated product to promote.  This is why the National Cattleman's Beef Association exists, they are a government sponsored program to boost industry level demand for a specific product.  The check-off program is subsidized by the government, and the $1 per head of cattle sold is mandatory, because if it weren't free riders would create a market failure.  Nobody would voluntarily pay in, but everyone would enjoy the reward. 

The NCBA isn't run by your typical industry lobbyists, it's run by ranchers, just like how any other check-off program is ran by a group of the industry producers.

TRUE,jerf,,,"Haskell has a thing very like Go interfaces called Typeclasses. One of the big differences is that the typeclass can declare a class as one of the incoming parameters, and then use that ""same"" type as an outgoing parameter [1]. In Go terms, it's as if you can write this:

     type Num interface {
         func add (value SOMETYPE) SOMETYPE
     }

Where ""SOMETYPE"" is actually a variable ""type"" itself, not a type with that name, and then implement it as:

    type myint32 int32
    func (l myint32) Neg (r myint32) myint32 {
        return l + r
    }

    type myint64 int64
    func (l myint64) Neg (r myint64) myint64 {
        return l + r
    }

and then use it:

    func test () {
        var a32, b32 myint32
        var a64, b64 myint64

        fmt.Printf(""%T %T"", a32.Add(b32), a64.Add(b64))
    }

and have everything typecheck out, with the final Printf yielding ""myint32 myint64"".

Thus,

    abs :: Num a =&gt; a -&gt; a
    abs a = if a &lt; 0 then -a else a

Translates to: ""The abs function takes something that implements Num called 'a', and is then a function that takes in a value of that type and returns a value of that type."" That could be a 32-bit Int, in which case you get a 32-bit Int back, or an arbitrary-sized Integer, or anything.

In fact you can't get ""null"" or anything like ""null"" out of that function in Haskell. (At least not without contriving a fake example, and it still wouldn't be a ""null pointer"".) You can't pass anything in that doesn't implement Num; the compiler won't let you, just as Go won't let you pass a value to a function expecting an interface that doesn't implement that interface.

I haven't spent enough time on it to be sure, and I'm not sure this would work, but I've been tossing around the idea of trying to figure out how to make this Go-ic enough to work in Go, too. I haven't had the time to really sit down and hammer through the problem to see if it can be made to work. It certainly doesn't just come right over, I'm not yet convinced there's nothing that can be done, though.

(Also, incidentally, that code is buggy. ""&lt;"", less than, is not part of the Num interface. For that you need ""Ord"", which is Orderable. In the actual [Num interface that ships with Haskell](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.6.0.1/docs/Prelude.html#g:7), ""abs"" is actually one of the elements of the typeclass itself. This example doesn't actually compile.)

We eventually arrive back in town and the thief loses us but we figured we had enough prove to bring this fucker down. Just to make sure we get into two more chases later in the month but used my friends car and it couldn't keep up. About 6 months later I get pulled over by a cop and he asks to search my car because it matches the description of someone impersonating a police officer trying to pull over a newspaper delivery woman.

I went through a similar experience several years ago, and I think you can add more to it. 


That is, don't reclaim your happiness- but try to discover what else makes you happy. Take your mind off that relationship, and ANY other ones to relentlessly pursue the answer to what makes you happy that isn't her/him, isn't a person, and isn't unobtainable. 


Isolate yourself in this pursuit and give it enough time and you will find yourself not just happy, but satiated. And if you're lucky like I was, you'll hear from her again. You'll see that her cheating wasn't because of any unhappiness with you, but with unhappiness with her self. You'll hear all about how her life has fallen apart without you. She'll start to cry as she tells you that her mother's health is failing, but her mom even insists that you were good for her. And as her heart bleeds into your hands, and you remember the familiar happiness that you've shared, you can tell her to eat a bag of dicks and hang up on her because you've found so much more.  


Don't just reclaim your happiness, go find what can make you even happier.

TRUE,O_is_for_Olive,,,"My husband flies a lot for work (he makes Delta Diamond every year), so he's got a ton of crazy stories about insane passengers; the most recent and ridiculous, however, took place on a trip back from Hawaii.

While he's waiting to board the plane, he's noticing a distinct smell of body odor.  He's doing the whole ""wait, shit, is that me?"" panic, trying to surreptitiously sniff his own armpits, when he notices that a bunch of the other people waiting are all doing the exact same thing.  Figuring that it's either someone else, or that there are, like, a stockpile of raw onions nearby, he stops thinking about it.  Until they board.

Because of all his Delta miles, he's in first class, in the aisle seat.  He sits down, and pulls out a book.  The window seat next to him is empty, and stays that way for a while, so he's thinking, cool -- empty row!  Then, just as boarding is finishing, suddenly, this horrible, pungent smell just FILLS the cabin.  It's so bad that he said literally every passenger in first class reacted, snapping their heads up to see what in the smelly hell just walked on the plane.

It was a young-ish woman, probably late 20's, early 30's.  Very hippie-chick style, wearing sort of a flow-y top over a tank top.  And she smelled like she had not bathed in daaays.  Seriously, best guess is that she'd spent a week at a sweat lodge, and hadn't cleaned herself since.  And, of course, she plopped herself down right next to my husband.

Now, like I said, he's a seasoned traveler, so he's used to a lot, and his tolerance is pretty fucking high, but he said this woman's smell was so bad that his eyes immediately started watering.  The flight attendant came over, and the woman ordered a Mai Tai; then she pulled out a book, and started highlighting passages.  Meanwhile, call buttons are beginning to light up like crazy, with pretty much every other passenger on the plane being all, ""Oh, HELL no"" about being stuck in a metal box from Hawaii to L.A. with someone who smells like she fucked every member of Phish back in 2006, and vowed to never bathe again.

Anyway, over the next fifteen minutes while this woman sits there reading obliviously, my husband watches as the poor flight attendants have multiple whispered, nervous conversations at the front of the plane, all the while staring at this smelly lady.  My husband is alternating between texting me in horror and making eye contact with the attendants, and he's doing the Wide-Eyes-of-Terror at them, and they're nodding at him and Wide-Eyeing right back.  By this time, my husband is nervous that he's going to get a migraine because the smell is so overwhelming, and people nearby are wrapping shirts around their faces to combat the odor.  Finally, the gate agent approaches.  She asks the woman to follow her to the front, where apparently, they gave her some soap and a new shirt, and sent her into the bathroom.  

A few minutes later, she emerged wearing a new shirt, but still smelling atrocious (""THEY GAVE HER SOAP, BUT NO INSTRUCTIONS,"" my husband texts miserably.  ""Can't they SEE she doesn't know what to do with it?  SOAP IS HARD FOR HER"").  She sits back down, and promptly orders another drink. 

Another few minutes pass, with more wide-eyed-silent-""help me""- face from my husband, as well as increasingly *not* so silent complaints from other passengers nearby, until finally, it becomes apparent that if action isn't taken, there's going to be a big ol' mutiny in the first class of a Delta plane.  At this point, two agents approach the row.  Now, this lady had the window seat and my husband was in the aisle, so this entire conversation had to take place with him awkwardly in the middle, pressing himself against his seat back, but the agents lean in and tell the woman that, sorry, she just can't ride on the plane; she smells too bad, and she's not fit to fly.  She's incredulous, and keeps saying, ""Just because *you* think I smell?"" and ""This sounds like a lawsuit to me.""  Meanwhile, the agents are being as friendly as they can be, explaining that they will happily put her up in a hotel for the night so she can take a shower, but that they can't allow her to board another Delta plane until she's cleaned herself off.  She didn't make that much of a scene, and they all gathered her things and walked off together.

The best part, though, was that right before she stood up, she complained that she had an important meeting back in L.A., and absolutely *had* to fly out that afternoon; in response, one of the attendants smiled and brightly said, ""Well, *we* can't help you, but I think there's still room on a United flight!""

My husband said it was one of the most surreal travel experiences ever. 

**TL/DR: Sorry, United.**

TRUE,soonami,flag2,Van Winkle Family Reserve Rye,"Here's my impression of expert wine tasters and sommeliers, I feel like a lot of them get by with knowing more than you and memorizing vineyard names and other people's tasting notes. If you remember that Robert Parker gave the 2008 Bordeaux first growths a very high score, then you can probably comment a lot on a 2008 Lafite without having tried it. You could say it's very fruity with jammy blackberries, stewed plums with notes of tobacco, cedar, leather... People are easily influenced in their perceptions, especially som's. Most ""wine experts"" aren't in the business of tasting and reviewing wines objectively, but **selling** wine. Would you trust a car salesman to tell you which car they have the best? They would tell you the most expensive one you would buy is the best!

Back to whiskey, there is a huge spectrum of what people like and what's acceptable. Some people like whiskies that have burn from alcohol like barrel proof offerings and others like something proofed down. Some like spicy Rye, others prefer the mellow sweetness of wheated bourbon. Some people like smooth, long aged bourbons like Pappy's, where as others like fiery, younger bourbons like Wild Turkey Rare Breed. Then there are Scotch drinkers that adore the smoky, briny, peaty, Ardbeg and Islay offerings but hate Sweeter, sherry finished malts like Macallan and Aberlour. There's a place for all of it.

However, if you go within a same category, (cheeseburgers or 12 year old wheated bourbons from Buffalo Trace), you narrow the range of subjectivity. It's like saying what kind of apple is the better for baking. I'm not saying apple is a better fruit than an orange or which is better to eat out of hand. In a specific metric or product, which performs best. In this case, I think that for 12 year old wheated BT juice, more people, in a blind tasting would say that the Lot B is better.

2. click 'send message' directly under karma info. 

Then, try [The rules of Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/rules/) and [Rediquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) for additional information about using the site. 

Beyond that, just remember two things: 

1. /r/mcpe can do nothing about an issue you have with some random person. It's not your personal message board. 
2. If you deal with anger (over a video-game!) by telling off other people, you're going to eventually piss off the wrong person. Learn to chill out or go do something else.

Low interest rates aren't great for life insurer profitability, and interest rates have been pretty low for a while.

There're four ways to find jobs:    
    
**Company Websites**    
To find companies, you can check the rankings in the [Life Insurer's Fact Book](https://www.acli.com/Tools/Industry%20Facts/Life%20Insurers%20Fact%20Book/Documents/FB11Ranking.pdf).    

Alternatively, you can check the SOA's [directory](https://directory.soa.org/) and look for life actuaries in a particular state or city.    

**Recruiters**    
The major recruiters are:    
[Ezra Penland](http://www.ezrapenland.com/)    
[DW Simpson](http://www.dwsimpson.com/)    
[SC International](http://www.scinternational.com/) posts salary ranges for their job listings    
The minor ones are great too, they'll contact you on LinkedIn if you have a profile.    

**Job Boards**    
[Indeed.com](http://www.indeed.com) is the best.    
Monster.com and Hotjobs are pretty awful now.    

**Networking**    
Call your former colleagues who've moved on to other companies.
Work your LinkedIn.    
If there's a company you like, see if their recruiters are on LinkedIn and contact them directly.  Often they have phrases like talent sourcing, or recruiter in their profile.",0,1389044293,,0,1389092043,1,ceizo0r,t3_1ukdq9,t1_ceizo0r,t3_1ukdq9,1431827775,5,FALSE,actuary,t5_2qp2f,5

My granddad past away some time mid January that year (my birthday is January 21st). When my dad went to make the arrangements for the funeral, the last thing my mom told my dad before he left the house was, not to put the funeral the following Saturday, because it was my birthday.
If you haven't already guessed it, my dad did indeed manage to have the funeral on that following Saturday, open casket and everything.
It ended up being the weirdest day in my short little life at that point. Family members in tears saying goodbye to my granddad and then turning to me with a birthday gift. 
On top of that, this was my first funeral and the first time someone in my life had passed away, and I was just old enough to actually understand that granddad was dead and gone and he would never take me fishing or rides in his classic car anymore, which all made me very sad and had me crying a lot that day!

Bonus info: On the day my granddad passed away, he had just come home from his daily morning walk. He then went and sat next to my grandmother in their living sofa, took her hand and said to her: ""I love you honey, and I think I'm leaving now. Thank you for my life.""
He closed his eyes and passed in the sofa next to her, holding her hand. (they were married for 55 years)

I'll go through your profile anyways, but you really should read the FAQ on messaging.  That is a crazy bombardment and obvious copypasta, and coupled with your so-so profile pic, is going to be a non-starter for most women.

**Photos**

dump the seal, jumper, and haiiiiiiiii pic.  Switch the best lit one to your primary. Keep the beach one. Then go and get a photo taken of yourself with something other than a potato somewhere not in your bedroom!

**My Self Summary**

You aren't ""just"" a guy.  you are probably a fun to be around Pharmacology student.  Everyone on OKC is looking for someone to speak too, how are you unique?

**What I’m doing with my life**

Don't be lazy, and especially don't admit to it!

I'm a Pharmaceutical Science student living in Manchester ~~. At the moment I'm a bit lazy with it all, but I still~~ and am doing pretty well.
I have a part-time job at a pharmacy where ~~I work weekends (and occasionally evenings). It's quite a good job; I'm good at it and~~ it has been a very good experience so far.

~~Away from all the formal stuff I just want to have fun times, I try my hardest to go out and do things that I've never done before. And it'd be great to have a person to have an adventure with.~~ (say something along the lines of ""I like going on adventures, just recently i [insert adventure].""
I also play the guitar and ~~would love~~ (am always looking for) someone to jam with.

**I’m really good at**

You are a first year Phara student?  Is that actually a scientist?  Say Chemistry and make a joke about losing your eyebrows in high school or something.  I think that will go a lot further and show some personality, unless you really are by the book.

Rambling in a negative.  best foot forward.

**The first things people usually notice about me**

hard to not be braggy here, but the hair is perfect, the smile is offputting, and the eye thing is interesting!  good work having an interesting genetic marker!

**Favorite books, movies, shows, music, and food**

don't say you aren't unique.  A little more wouldn't hurt, because a book worm, movie junkie, or music geek would pass immediatly.  Maybe not the music geek.

**The six things I could never do without**

dump the first line.

Some of these make you sound inept, but they are creative.  If you aren't having success, I would go with options that make you sound a little more confident.

**I spend a lot of time thinking about**

it turns off.  everyone knows that.  I can prove it to you. You are going in the right direction though by thinking outside the box.  I would leave this until you think of something equal or better, but know that it is not the best.

**On a typical Friday night I am**

OMG you sound fucking desparate!  Just leave this one blank.  And fuck you for being able to drink at 18... goddamn america.

**The most private thing I’m willing to admit**

Someone said to put things like this in.  At 18 it is fine, but as you are the youngest you can be on OKC (i think) you will be pining for older women who are likely looking for older men.  The following basically applys to every section:  How are you more mature and yet more laid back and fun than a 21 y/o who is trying to get with the same 18 y/o girls you are?  What makes you different and better/more compatible?

TRUE,ThatGirl_Tasha,,,"This was pre 9-11 . .  . (and ya, I was just a passenger but it's still a ridiculous story).

Older Southwest planes used to have lounge seating up front where first class would normally be, two rows of seating that faced each other. 

Staring directly at a stranger for four hours, awesome.

The plane was full and pre 9-11 you could bring a ton of shit on board -two good sized bags, food, a huge purse etc. 

The flight attendant went through the aisles trying to get everyone to put their stuff in the overhead because the floor was filled with everyone's crap. 

The woman in front of me had a lunch cooler type bag. The attendant asked if there was any liquid in it and the woman said *no*, so the attendant put it above -over my seat.

The lady across from lunch cooler lady had a massive floor length fox fur coat on her lap (and she was a big big woman-going on six feet and obese), so this coat was HUGE. 

The flight attendant tells her it has to go above in the compartment. The woman sort of flips out and goes on and on; arguing loudly about how this coat costs as much as a car and stuffing it into a small space will ruin it. The flight attendant was on the verge of calling dad over to settle it (the pilot) when Sasquatch fur woman gives in reluctantly.

The attendant assures her she will be very very careful not to compress it too much. And again it goes in the compartment over my seat.

Thirty minutes into the flight the guy next to me perks up suddenly and asked me, ""Did you feel something?"" 

And a second later I did. 

Something was dripping on us. 

Looking up there were lines of fluid all over the button area and what started as an occasionally drip was now like a drip a second in several places.

The attendant came over and searched through the overhead. Lunch cooler lady was the culprit. The bag contained a huge thermos of chicken soup. Lunch cooler woman declared she didn't count it as a liquid earlier because it was in a sealed container.

Then out came the coat, completely soaked in chicken soup. 

And thus began the great stare down of 1999. The two women across form each other, on a flight from Maryland to Vegas that had just finished with take off. 

I have never had such a case of the giggles along with a complete stranger in my life. Every time another drip came down it would start again. 

TLDR; *wore chicken soup for a cross country flight, was worth it for the entertainment value.*

She was from an incredibly abusive family and her two summers in Maryland at her grandparents were the only reprieve.  I'll save the rest of her story if this is really you.  If so, she thought about you constantly and whatever you said to her when you gave her the napkin really made a difference in her life.

My step cousin/whatever you want to call her, Christy, called fakename back after she sent a Facebook message, linking her to this story.  Christy said nothing much about the story (not surprised) but that she would consider bringing her kid over on her way through town in March.  Haven't seen her in some time and neither has the rest of the family.  I'm not holding my breath, but the phone call is the first in a long time.  Maybe this story is bringing up feelings of how great a person her mother was and she'll want to be around family?  I don't know.

In more exciting news:  I 100% believe this is you... however, I think if you had a picture of Charlotte you would be the only one to know for sure.  My sister says she has one from age 7, 8, or 9 maybe.  She'll find it, confirm it's the right sister with my step mom (5 step kids, 1/2 kids, and whole kids on that side and all girls), and I'll upload it.  If not, my step mom looks enough like Charlotte that I may just get a picture of her from that age.  Other than the hair color, you'd think it were Charlotte.

This flight took off at about 10pm, so it was an overnight, and as an 8 year old, I got bored about half way through and couldn't sleep. The flight was only about half full, so I started exploring. About 5 or 6 rows up (not at all in first class) was a fairly large gentleman who was still awake, and there was no one else around, so I started talking to him. He was friendly, and told jokes, and had candy, and the flight attendant kept on bringing us drinks and peanuts long after they stopped even looking at everyone else, which was cool. They also kept on apologizing to him, and asking if he wanted them to make me leave him alone, which I thought was funny. Some time later, I ended up falling asleep next to him, and he got me a blanket, and let me rest. When I woke up, my mother was apologizing profusely and was dragging me off him and ushering me to the back of the plane (both my parents smoked and this was the 80's). When we got back there, she scolded me for embarrassing her, and then didn't talk to me for the remainder of the flight (she was grumpy like that). As we were getting off the plane he came over and told my mother that it was ok, and that I kept him entertained, and that he hates flying by himself, and then he gave me a hug and signed something for her. It wasn't till a few years later that she finally explained to me that the guy from the plane was Meatloaf.

You can have fun while being productive, but I thought I should clarify what I meant by the first edit after the post got a little attention. By ""be productive"" I simply mean don't waste your time in only having fun.

Be productive together.

Work on projects together, have shared goals, etc. Grow together, don't just have fun together and stagnate.

Be productive together with friends.

Team sports for example, or a trivia team. Something whereby you and your partner can feel part of a larger group which caters to both your needs. This will help you grow together, as in the context of the group, you will be thought of and seen as ""a couple"". The other points in the list aid in preventing this becoming a drawback.

Be productive on your own (away from partner).

Having your own goals separate to theirs will of course help you grow as an individual, thereby giving you more to share in the relationship, but also just happier within yourself.

Be productive on your own with your friends.

TRUE,BlackCaaaaat,,,"Just a little advice ...

The honeymoon period WILL end. Trust me. It is not joint ecstasy that forms a solid bond, it is facing adversity together that will make you stronger. Not to mention the mundane day to day stuff: the annoying habits, one partner wanting more sex than the other, the repetition, and the fights about who should do the fucking dishes. Underneath the calmer waters, the relationship is either growing in strength or gradually being eroded away. The latter can be stopped if you both realise this is happening and are both committed to working on it.

Speaking of work, long-term relationships require constant maintenance. And sometimes, hard bloody work. This shouldn't be one sided, though, a partnership implies that you are both in it together. When you find yourselves up Shit Creek, you both better start paddling.

Some relationships do have an expiry date. Sometimes you grow apart - if you are ready to move on to the next stage of life it can be hard if your partner is holding you back. And you don't have to put up with abuse or cheating. 

Learn to love yourself, and find fulfilling things in your life because your partner isn't there to fill those holes. Yes, you will carry one another through the tough times, but your partner can't be expected to solve your deep-seeded issues. It is important to look after yourself, and have some time to yourself, especially if you have children.

And finally: having children is one of the hardest challenges you will face as a couple. It will test you, and you will probably find yourself actively disliking your partner, and many of you will consider separation.

At the end of the day, it's awesome having someone by your side, fighting in your corner. :)

First, let me preface this entire thing. About 90% (I did the math and as everyone knows, pilots are good at math*) of the posts here revolve around one personality. The person that thinks the crew is out to get them. Here's the bottom line - tell your friends: We want to get to the destination as much or more as the passengers do. We often have a VERY short time in our hotel to get dinner, sleep, and be back at the airport for another day already. Delays cut into that. If it is our go home leg, we'll chew through steel to get home. But everything we do is about safety first. The company may fight us on that, but it's our lives and we do our best to keep the flight safe. So, if there is a delay it is either warranted or out of our control. Also, we only get paid when the aircraft door is closed, so while we are sitting there waiting, we aren't on the clock. (There are airlines with different pay rules, but the vast majority follow this structure).

K story time: It was a bad weather day into St. Louis. We got struck by lightning. It happens. We get priority to land because we can't be sure what damage occurred. Once on the ground, I do a walk around and see the damage. The outbound flight, the last of the night, is cancelled because the plane is down for what I would think are obvious reasons.

We didn't have a hotel for the night, as we were supposed to take the plane back out. So while waiting for news from crew scheduling, we were supporting the gate agent. Man, people were PISSED. Insisting we go. I point out the window at the melted wingtip and large scorch mark on the aircraft. One lady got in my face and screamed, ""Do you think I give a fuck about your paint job?! Get me on that plane and get me home, or you'll be sorry!""

Needless to say, that lady didn't go on any flight with us the next day. Don't fuck with gate agents (or crews that are nice to them).

*We are horrible at math. That whole math this is a myth. Math is dangerous in a cockpit.

tl;dr: Hit by lightning. Visible damage to aircraft. Passengers still want to fly - with thunderstorm that caused damage still in vicinity for that matter.

That said, don't feel like you *need* to improve yourself but rather just have goals that you work towards in a pace that you enjoy. 

I've found that being happy pretty much consists of ticking the following boxes once a day:

-Doing something fun

-Doing something social

-Achieving something 

-Exercising


These things can all be done to as small or large an amount as you want to but if you aim to do them all each day, to some extent, then you'll find that you're damn happy.

TRUE,OpenWideSayAah,,General Dentist,"**Re: Why most GPs have not adopted the clark preparation instead.**

**TL:DR; most dentists can't afford a surgical microscope; the matrix system required to do his technique properly is very expensive, and modern sectional matrix systems have caught up to the innovations introduced by Dr. David Clark.**

#1 - most resin composites average 5-7 years before failing.  Patients are typically aware of the longevity difference between silver and resin, and most choose resin anyway.  So your technique has to last an average of 5+ years for it to beconsidered a ""good"" filling.

#2 - Dr. Clark's technique is simply a modified slot prep technique.  Slot preps have had mixed results, and success rates are influenced by a number of factors (type of bonding used, rubber dam usage, layering technique used, etc etc).  Most GPs were never trained to do slot preps well, or have no idea what a proper slot prep looks like.

#3 - As far as I know, Dr. Clark's technique hasn't been around long enough to be studied and published in a peer-reviewed dental journal.  As it stands, it is just his office and his little clan of followers that perform class 2 preps in this manner.

#4 - Even if his technique was published in a peer-reviewed dental journal, most GPs don't know how to read a research article past the abstract, and will lump his technique into the rest of the ""slot preparation"" articles, which, as I had mentioned before, is a mixed bag.

#5 - Dr. Clark claims that doing his type of conservative type slot prep ""requires"" the use of a microscope.  That alone is cost-prohibitive for most general dentists to achieve desired results.  I personally have 4.5x loupes and do it just fine, especially for larger areas of decay.

#6 - Dr. Clark's system of restoring class 2s in this way is reliant on an ""all-translucent system for buccal-lingual curing"".  Until the Triodent V4 Clearmetal came out earlier this year, the only all-translucent system for buccal-lingual curing is the Bioclear matrix System invented by, guess who?  Dr. David Clark.

Don't get me wrong, Dr. Clark's system is really good, but, the Matrix system cost for Bioclear is 2-4x more expensive than a similar all-translucent system (The Triodent V4), and when so many dentists are beholden to piss-poor insurance payouts, that can be the difference between open doors and closed ones.

#7 - Dr. Clark's class 2 composite technique takes a LOT of steps.  In the marketplace of ideas, his technique competes with modern sectional matrix systems and modern bulk fill composites.  I can use a standard sectional system and sonicfill and be done in 2 minutes without changing my technique or re-training my assistants.

**Keep in mind** that Dr. Clark's technique was introduced at a time when most dentists were using Tofflemire bands and wooden wedges.  Basically, trying to kludge it together using tools originally developed for amalgam.  At the time of introduction, his technique was truly ground breaking and revolutionary.

However, Garrison and Triodent have co-opted some of his ideas, and you can achieve similar results without the complexity of Bioclear.

Finally, **the prepped premolar photo is misleading.**  Dr. Clark's photo of a GV Black prepped premolar that fractured is not actually prepped in the style of GV Black.  In fact, that premolar is a textbook example of how NOT to prep for amalgam, and a perfect example of why you don't put amalgam into a composite prep.  Note the rounded edges and line angles.  That's wrong, and if you put the amalgam in that prep, you are GUARANTEED to get fracture lines.  You need sharp line angles and a **perfectly flat interproximal box** in order to avoid the type of fracturing that is occurring.  Whoever prepped that amalgam didn't know what s/he was doing.

That being said, the Bioclear Matrix system is AMAZING for anterior class 3 and class 4 resins.  I highly recommend every general dentist to add this to their repertoire, especially for the price-oriented patient who cannot afford lab-fabricated ceramic veneers.

**TL:DR; most dentists can't afford a surgical microscope; the matrix system required to do his technique properly is very expensive, and modern sectional matrix systems have caught up to the innovations introduced by Dr. David Clark.**

DISCLAIMER:  I receive no financial compensation from Dr. Clark or his company.  I do use the Bioclear Matrix System, although not exclusively.

EDIT:  Reddit gold?  Oh you....!  *_*

EDIT 2:  I might as well add a couple of additional thoughts:

**The advantage of sticking with Dr. Clark's technique and system is:**
1.  Universal technique for both anterior and posterior teeth, even though it might be different than what you are used to
2.  Reduced instrumentation and simpler setup.

TRUE,fuckomaha,,,"The population of the entire Omaha/Council Bluffs metropolitan area is 885,624.   80% of urban Americans live in a metro area that's larger than yours.  I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but that makes Omaha a small area.  

Back of the envelope: putting up sufficient antennas to service Omaha's size and density would require about 3 antennas per sq km.  If we assume they can do them cheaply, that still puts us at $100MM, but $200MM is likely a better estimate.
So to enter your market, t-mobile would need to bet $100-200MM on infrastructure.  

Then, it typically costs about $300-400 in marketing and sales expense to acquire a cellular customer.  T-Mobile has about 13% market share, so they might get 100,000 customers if they continued their national trend.  So we're looking at another $30-40 million dollars outlay there.

That's costs, let's get to revenue.  The average cell phone bill is $47.  So now we're looking at spending $130-240MM to drive $4.7MM/mo in total revenue.  Not profit, revenue.

T-mobile earns just under 30% EBITDA margin, so that $130-240MM investment is looking to return about $17MM/yr of profit, assuming that people in Omaha convert as well as people in other metro areas.  But realistically, the sort of person who chooses to live in Omaha is less likely to be highly digital (not a judgment, mind you, it's just part of the culture).  The smart phones are likely to use smaller data plans, more people are likely to be on budget plans, etc.  

So realistically, T-Mob would be looking at $130-240MM investment to make more like $8-12MM/yr of profit.  And that sucks.

The only players who can afford to make that sort of investment are the market leaders who can reasonable expect to: a) obtain a much larger portion of the market than T-Mobile, and b) charge each customer more money than T-Mobile would charge.

I was taking a nap in my hotel room and had a vague pain in my rectum for a few seconds. It went away and I thought nothing of it. Over the next few months, I became more and more constipated and my rib cage began to protrude. The pain and discomfort in my rectal area got worse. Only sitting in the tub made the discomfort go away. I tried to self-diagnose and treat (almost a doctor, right?), but nothing worked. Eventually, I got an appointment with a gastroenterologist. but he was really backed up and it would be like a month before I could get in. Anyhoo, eventually the constipation became too much and I had to go the ER. I hadn't lost any weight, but the doc in the ER thought my legs looked really thin, so he ordered a CT. Stage IV colorectal cancer, all throughout my liver. The reason my weight didn't go down was because my liver was enlarged and I had fluid in my abdomen.

I had to get radiation to my tailbone in December because a metastasis was causing extreme pain. Right now, my mom is taking care of me. My family were all really sad, but have been very supportive.

There is one thing I suspect we get wrong.  Is that in too many suicide cases we blame mental health as a cause, when in my opinion it is often a symptom. Our health system can treat the symptoms and manage them but they cannot solve the cause.  Like what you mentioned, for many young their prospects are very poor.  After living overseas for many years I don't blame many of the young for being depressed here.  As a society we neglect many of the things they need to be happy.  Until we start to treat the causes as opposed to the symptoms I suspect it will continue to get worse and suicide is a huge issue in Australia.  If I am not wrong we have one of the highest suicide rates in the world.

Some thoughts on the causes:

1. Urban deserts. In my opinion we have separated urban and working environments too much.  Suburbs are very much like deserts in the day.  This tends to detach working and home life.  I suspect for many young it makes everything around them look pointless as it is not attached to their welfare.  I think young need to be around working adults.  We need to spread shopping and business areas more evenly through suburbs so young are more exposed to people working around them.  It also means shops and cafe's would be nearby, which can act as gathering points.When I was in Singapore, nearly all the public housing had shops and eating places on the ground floor.  It provided a much more inclusive environment for young there.  They could always walk down to the shop below them.  It also gave them near by working opportunities and encouraged them to mingle with others near by.

2. Cost of living.  Cost of living in Australia is very high. Average house prices are one of the highest in the world in terms of how many years you have to work to pay off a house. We also rate very poorly on affordability indexes as compared to other developed countries.  That means people here have work longer to get a house than most other countries.  In terms of housing we are poorer than most countries and yet we have very high productivity requirements for workers.  That means stressful working environment coupling with high living costs.

3. Lack of opportunities.  There are very few productive opportunities in Australia.  Most real wealth here comes from what people own.  If you own real estate, a farm of a mine then you can get income from that and do well.  However for a young person who does not own any of these, and with high living costs there is little chance for them to compete which will likely depress them.  If our economy was set up to reward productivity instead of control or ownership(we are rent economy which is why we have no manufacturing) then young would see these opportunities and it would give them something to look forward to.  They would see, hey i get this job, its not to hard and then i can have this house etc.  At the moment, many are stuck with their parents or kicked out to rent single rooms with little future prospects.

4. Lack of social support network. We tend to have very small and separated families. We have an obsession with moving away from extended family and parents.  This means young are often only exposed to a few role models, often their immediate parents.  It means if there parent is bad, they have no alternative role model who looks after them. Extended families often do better, because in the case the parent is bad, then the parents parent or the parents sister may step in to ensure the child has a good role model.  It also means, that for example, if their parent is depressed, or maybe a drinker, they get the full brunt of that depression or drinking. In extended families, other members are their to soften the blow.

5. Work environments, Drug and drinking culture.  It is my opinion that a large portion of Australians are completely unable to handle the alcohol. We have a culture that encourages people to go out and get blind drunk.  The problem with this in my opinion is that it tends to ""numb"" culture.  It makes us too tough. People put up with a lot of things that are wrong because at the end of the day they will go get drunk to forget.  Over time this tends to compound.  For example, lets say a young persons parent is a drinker but the child is not.  They see their parents life, who goes to work, does a job they hate, then each even comes home depressed and then goes our to get drunk and forget the miserable work life.  The child who may not drink will see this as a depressing prospect, that the only way they can avoid how miserable life is, is to get drunk.  If you go to china, you will often hear expats complain that the locals don't work hard, they are always talking and taking breaks. The difference is, they work longer, but the work environment is actually much more enjoyable than an Australian work environment.  Our working environments are very very rigid and formal which tends to make them un-enjoyable.  If we could adapt our culture to make working environments less stressful and more enjoyable I suspect it may even help with the obsessive drinking culture- but both would have to change hand in hand, otherwise one may lead back to the other.

I could go on for ever, but it really doesn't surprise me we have such a high suicide rate. We have so many problems that in my opinion are ignored because of the ""tough"" culture in australia or are taboo to talk about. Its an environment problem that we need to change.  The mental health is the symptom, which after many years probably starts to feed on itself.

TRUE,MangoPip,,,"Sorry mate, abbreviations are a curse - when we start up a section we issue a Notice of Energisation for that area. This makes sure that everyone on site knows exactly what is going on - it must be discussed at all of the contractors' morning meetings. Usually these are issued 24 to 48 hours ahead of time. It is a safety system, and I have found it really good in the past, means that if you accidentally spray an area with water due to a pipe leaking or similar, the contractor who might have decided to mix concrete in that area should be aware of what is happening. Trivial example, but hopefully you get the idea. 

I have only learnt by experience, but there is a book by Martin Kilcross called ""chemical and process plant commissioning handbook"" which looks pretty good, and gives you a good idea of why we do things in a certain order, and why we have so much paperwork. Are you client side or on the engineers' side of things? If the latter, they will have lessons learnt from previous jobs that would make a good read before you mobilise to site. If you are on the client side, usually you will be doing a heap of optimisation once the engineering firm has handed over to you, so it is really good to have a good handle on the process and potential areas that need focus. Make sure you know exactly where your role starts if you are client side - there are contractual issues that could bite you in the arse if things aren't done according to the agreement. 

Remember to punch list in good time, especially if the contract is EPCM, and the push towards the end will be to get the engineer off site because they are costing lots of money. 

Having an electrical/instrumentation engineer with you is really important too - they are worth their weight in gold towards the pointy end of things. 

Not sure on LPG: LNG plants but we use radios to communicate - get someone to explain the etiquette to you before you use it - and never, ever swear at or abuse anyone over the radio, fastest way to get kicked off site. 

There is loads of other stuff, but it sounds like you have the right positive attitude, which is 80% of what you need! Best commissioning engineers I have worked with are the guys who will do whatever is needed to get the job done, who will pitch in to help where needed, and who have a plan for each day of what they need to do, and at the end of the day if things haven't happened, they know what to do to achieve it tomorrow. Sometimes you have to be a bit of a nag to get stuff done, guys have their own priorities which aren't yours, but generally they will understand why you are being so persistent, and will help once they can.

TRUE,Penultimatum,,,"I hate analogies like these regarding privacy. Just because somebody doesn't have a problem with the NSA recording their phone conversations doesn't mean that they're fine with them taking video of their bathroom or something. The bathroom is reserved largely for **personal** uses, whereas a phone has a much broader range of uses.

I tried thinking of a good analogy, but I couldn't come up with one. So instead, I'll give a scenario in which I would not be comfortable with a roommate gaining certain information, but I have no problem with the government having the same exact information.

I would be very disturbed if I found out that I had a roommate who snooped on my computer and looked through my browsing history. This would disturb me for many reasons, of which I will list the ones I can immediately think of:

* My roommate invaded *my* privacy, targeting me specifically and nobody else (or very few people else, such as perhaps my other roommates). This makes it **personal**.

* My roommate had an ulterior motive which is unknown to me and affects me personally. Their actions are not transparent in the least, nor were they expected.

* My roommate chose to find out this information through an unconventional avenue. If they had a friendly motive, they could've just asked me personally. If they had an unfriendly motive, well, they had an unfriendly motive.

Let's say that the NSA is recording everyone's browsing habits. I'm *not* disturbed by this and I'll say why, in part echoing the reasons I listed in my bullets above:

* The government is recording *everybody's* habits, not just mine. This makes it **impersonal**.

* The government is doing it with a motive I do not consider wholly unreasonable (preventing crime) and it is at least making a show of explaining its motives. Their actions are somewhat transparent (though admittedly not as much as I'd like) and they are expected.

* The government does not have an easier way to record my browsing habits than directly through me or my ISP. They *could* ask me personally, but seeing as they're trying to prevent crime, I would be unlikely to outright disclose any incriminating actions I may have taken. There is little to no chance of their motive being fulfilled in any more comfortable manner.

I do think that the government should be more transparent in the motives for its recording actions and in disclosing what information it chooses to record. However, even disclosing what information the NSA chooses to record is risky. It's for the same reason so many online communities' admins (especially in gaming, e.g. Riot Games) choose not to disclose the particulars of why somebody has been banned. If they release what information they record, there is a potential for criminal activity to occur more frequently again, as now people know which channels of communication to avoid and - by process of elimination - which channels to use for such activities.

Recording is a useful approach for preventing crime, especially in today's information age. I believe the correct approach regarding sentiment towards the government is not to denounce them for recording information on citizens, but instead to denounce unjust criminalization of activities.",1,1389063029,,0,FALSE,1,cej8guh,t3_1uk2au,t1_cej8guh,t1_cej3zi8,1431831997,-7,FALSE,politics,t5_2cneq,-7

TRUE,SoulLessGinger992,,,"They/it appears to be a grey whale. This is especially interesting since baleen whale twins is something that's never been recorded in the wild. That said, no one is certain if that's because it rarely happens, or because twins cannot be maintained by the mother. Mysticetes (baleen whales), a group which includes the grey whale, usually nurse their young for 4-11 months, depending on the species. The larger the species, the longer they nurse. The fat content in whale milk is extremely high, usually 40-50%, to allow the calf to quickly grow blubber and to become large as fast as possible. Large whale calves are only susceptible to predation when they are very small, so growing as fast as possible is the main priority. In addition to that, most baleen whales migrate to warm waters to give birth, and warm waters are extremely nutrient-poor (read: no plankton or small fish), so they're largely fasting. That means that most whale mothers are getting the calories that goes into the calf's milk only from their own fat stores. 

So, because of all these factors, it would be nearly impossible for a large mysticete whale to successfully raise two calves to adulthood. And that's where the question comes in. If a whale were to give birth to viable twins, does she reject one or try to raise both and they end up starving (and potentially the mother as well since she would be drained by the milk herself). These conjoined twins would obviously not be able to survive since it's unlikely they can successfully swim or hunt (yes, baleen whales do hunt to a degree). It's likely this has nothing to do with Fukushima at all, since low dose radiation has never been shown to increase conjoined twins. Conjoined twins are something that does happen in the wild in both live-birth species and those that hatch from eggs. It's uncommon, but only just as uncommon as it is in humans, so it's nothing to freak out about. If we start finding dozens of them, then I think we can start to worry, but this is probably something that happens once in a blue moon, just like human conjoined twins, but we never find them since they would likely sink to the bottom of the ocean after birth/death.

TRUE,jayblackcomedy,,,"I like the college circuit a lot.  They kids are fun and the pay is great.  There are only two real problems with the college circuit (aside from the travel, which I deal with in a moment):

1. The shows are very rarely in traditional show spaces.  Very often, you're in a student center or a bar on campus or in the cafeteria.  This means you have to adapt to many different situations and that can be difficult.

2. The pressure to do well is always high.  You're being paid a lot of money and the kids don't *know* that they're show space is difficult (""Why should our cafeteria at noon in front of 300 kids who didn't know there would be comedy be any different than a comedy club?"")  So, unlike a club, where you might shank one and have management be understanding, the colleges expect for the money that they're paying that you're going to do well no matter what the circumstances.  This is very similar to corporate and I would say the *most important thing* is that you be consistent no matter what.  A guy who can get a 7.5 *every time* is a lot more valuable to colleges, corporate, privates, and the military, then a guy who gets a 10 when the crowd is good and a 5 when the crowd is bad.

Now, the travel.  Yeah, it can be tough.  When my second kid was born, it got *especially* tough.  My wife is moving to half days this month and she's a teacher (so summers are off), and I think that will make things a lot easier as it will reduce her stress.  But there's no getting around it -- if you are going to do this, it'll make things hard at home.

The psychological toll of being on the road by yourself is high as well.  Most of the shows are done by yourself, so there isn't even an emcee or feature to hang out with.  Also, if you have a string of one-nighters (a ""block"" as they're called in college terms), you might be spending every morning flying or driving somewhere, every evening performing, and the rest of the time questioning every decision you've ever made.

I'm pretty okay with being alone and my wife is pretty good about letting me go do this crazy thing (especially now that she can relax a little bit at work), but even for me it's very tough.  If you're a really social person, I would expect it would drive you half insane.  Either way, that's something to consider on your way in...

TRUE,zenfish,,,"We lived together for about six months. Possibly the best six months of life up to then. You know, slogged after the 9-6 grind, the usual feeling, like somebody bashed you head in with a blunt object, thinking of what you're going to do for dinner, then, that moment of clarity, a tiny miracle, an epiphany, oh yeah, she will be there. Or if I get home before her I will shortly hear her keys on the lock and move to the door like a giddy child.  
  
She was usually home first. She'd hear me coming and greet me at the door, sometimes with little to nothing on. Sometimes she'd lock the deadbolt and I'd hear her giggle as I turned the key and bruised my shoulder at the same time.  
  
We grew to be somewhat childish in our off times. Not everyone does, but our bedroom passed through to the bathroom then out into a hall and back into the bedroom and was separated by French doors. This was conducive to a chase and she'd make me run her down when I wanted it.  
  
When you live together, sleep side by side each night you get to know your own quirks more intimately. You are a mirror held to each other. You get to know that you steal pillows and blankets and that sometimes she'll sit up in bed and mumble some question of nonsense to no one. When you put your arm under her she’ll protest, she’ll say your arm will fall asleep but you won’t care.

You sort out who likes the shower head pointed high, who needs it low. Same with computer chairs.  
  
You've got, by default, somebody to worry about you. Take care of you when you are sick. Wait up when you're working overtime. You come home to the TV on and a bowl of soup on the kitchen table.  
  
You shop together. For me, shopping no longer seemed like a chore. 

I ate better. She was a good cook. As a sales rep, she traveled a lot for business and so she'd spend half a day before a trip making my favorites and freezing them in gallon bags and labeling them in marker. She was afraid when she was gone I'd eat junk, like a kid, and she was right. I often dismissed the freezer bags of the things I told her were my favorites and loaded up on pizza, McD's, chips and coke.  
  
So this leads to the most important piece of advice: don't be the one to clean the place out when and if things come to an end, if you can help it. Or take some help.  
  
Standing there with cardboard boxes ready to be folded, six months of memories destroyed me.  
  
Cardboard boxes are such an indignity, then. They are blank and ugly and brown on the outside and when you put things in them it's like they are gone, eaten up. It's not even the sentimental things, not even the nested leather heart boxes from Bombay Company you got her one Valentine's day, or the handmade beer cozy she made you in return because she was broke, but the little things, most innocuous things.  
  
Like hair ties. Yes, hair ties were everywhere, and imagine having to pick them up one by one, or be cleaning and have one pounce on you, the fist of rubber clutching strands of her hair.  
  
Then the things you have to throw out because you can't see any possible way to keep them. You open a freezer and there they are staring back at you, each neatly labeled with her handwriting and date, long expired, and a little smiley face, a bag of bacon and kale soup, some empanadas, glittering there right where you had left them, a freezer full.  
  
I broke down cleaning the place out, having to box up all her stuff, because she was no longer around to do it, and take the boxes back to her folks.

He listened solemnly as Royce introduced the knights who had accompanied him, then said, “My lords are welcome here. You know our Maester Colemon, of course. Lord Nestor, you will recall Alayne, my natural daughter?”
“To be sure.” Lord Nestor Royce was a bullnecked, barrel-chested, balding man with a grey- shot beard and a stern look. He inclined his head a whole half inch in greeting.
Sansa curtsied, too frightened to speak for fear she might misspeak. Petyr drew her to her feet. “Sweetling, be a good girl and bring Lord Robert to the High Hall to receive his guests.”
“Yes, Father.” Her voice sounded thin and strained. A liar’s voice, she thought as she hurried up the steps and across the gallery to the Moon Tower. A guilty voice.
Gretchel and Maddy were helping Robert Arryn squirm into his breeches when Sansa stepped into his bedchamber. The Lord of the Eyrie had been crying again. His eyes were red and raw, his lashes crusty, his nose swollen and runny. A trail of snot glistened underneath one nostril, and his lower lip was bloody where he’d bitten it. Lord Nestor must not see him like this, Sansa thought, despairing. “Gretchel, fetch me the washbasin.” She took the boy by the hand and drew him to the bed. “Did my Sweetrobin sleep well last night?”
“No.” He sniffed. “I never slept one bit, Alayne. He was singing again, and my door was locked. I called for them to let me out, but no one ever came. Someone locked me in my room.”
“That was wicked of them.” Dipping a soft cloth into the warm water, she began to clean his face... gently, oh so gently. If you scrubbed Robert too briskly, he might begin to shake. The boy
was frail, and terribly small for his age. He was eight, but Sansa had known bigger five-year- olds.
Robert’s lip quivered. “I was going to come sleep with you.”
I know you were. Sweetrobin had been accustomed to crawling in beside his mother, until she wed Lord Petyr. Since Lady Lysa’s death he had taken to wandering the Eyrie in quest of other beds. The one he liked best was Sansa’s... which was why she had asked Ser Lothor Brune to lock his door last night. She would not have minded if he only slept, but he was always trying to nuzzle at her breasts, and when he had his shaking spells he often wet the bed.
“Lord Nestor Royce has come up from the Gates to see you.” Sansa wiped beneath his nose. “I don’t want to see him,” he said. “I want a story. A story of the Winged Knight.”
“After,” Sansa said. “First you must see Lord Nestor.”
“Lord Nestor has a mole,” he said, squirming. Robert was afraid of men with moles. “Mommy
said he was dreadful.”
“My poor Sweetrobin.” Sansa smoothed his hair back. “You miss her, I know. Lord Petyr
misses her too. He loved her just as you do.” That was a lie, though kindly meant. The only woman Petyr ever loved was Sansa’s murdered mother. He had confessed as much to Lady Lysa just before he pushed her out the Moon Door. She was mad and dangerous. She murdered her own lord husband, and would have murdered me if Petyr had not come along to save me.
Robert did not need to know that, though. He was only a sick little boy who’d loved his mother. “There,” Sansa said, “you look a proper lord now. Maddy, fetch his cloak.” It was lambswool, soft and warm, a handsome sky-blue that set off the cream color of his tunic. She fastened it about his shoulders with a silver brooch in the shape of a crescent moon, and took him by the hand. Robert came meekly for once.
The High Hall had been closed since Lady Lysa’s fall, and it gave Sansa a chill to enter it again. The hall was long and grand and beautiful, she supposed, but she did not like it here. It was a pale cold place at the best of times. The slender pillars looked like fingerbones, and the blue veins in the white marble brought to mind the veins in an old crone’s legs. Though fifty silver sconces lined the walls, less than a dozen torches had been lit, so shadows danced upon the floors and pooled in every corner. Their footsteps echoed off the marble, and Sansa could hear the wind rattling at the Moon Door.

TRUE,rpfile,AIOTD,AstroBin Image Of The Day 2013-10-22,"that is correct. ACR, lightroom, photoshop, iPhoto, the Digic processor in the camera making a jpeg - all of them apply a stretch and a saturation boost to the data before it is shown to you.

this is essentially because a CCD/CMOS sensor has a linear response to light, but the human eye has a non-linear (exponential/logarithmic) response to light. so if you look at a raw image from your camera, it is very dim and does not look like what the eye would see when stimulated by the same light. with astrophotography it's *really* bad because we're recording so little signal and have to stack to boost the SNR.

with astronomical images, we have to start with the linear versions for a couple of reasons. the first is that we need to (or want to) calibrate the images to remove fixed patterns (like the bias signal, or the dark (thermal) signal). also we want to correct vignetting with flats. if we were to let someone or something stretch the image before these defect corrections, they would come out all wrong. the dark signal, for instance, is a linear function of time. it is possible to use a master dark of 1800s, for instance, and simply multiply it by 0.5 in order to apply against a light frame of 600s. if you let the image become stretched somehow this scaling will not work.

another reason is that for certain operations (background extraction, color calibration, and deconvolution) the images must still be in linear mode for the algorithms to work right. 

PixInsight and other astro image processing packages (DSS, etc.) use an open source package called DCRAW to open CR2s (and other DSLR raw files). it is always invoked in a way that does not touch the data, in fact it also requests that the data even not be debayered. what you get is a greyscale image with all the color filter data interspersed together (just like it is on the sensor.) further on down the pipeline, after calibration, you debayer the images making them 3-plane RGB images, then register them, then stack them and only then do you apply a stretch.

this is why pixinsight and other astronomical tools have ""screen stretch"" functionality - so you can see what you are working on when the image is still really in a linear state.

also because there are 2 green pixels in each 4x4 bayer matrix, usually even a terrestrial image will have a strong green cast when opened in linear mode. anyway the upshot is ACR is doing *a lot* of processing behind the scenes to make your images look nice. in astrophotography we have to do a lot of that stuff by hand…

hope that helps, i tend to go off on tangents…

TRUE,blaaaarg123,,,"First off, I don't disagree with you. In most situations, your SO should come before your friends. That's why you are in a committed relationship with them.  
  
That being said, I want to explain ""the other side"" a bit.  
  
I am single. Most of my friends are in serious relationships. Most of the time, they do a pretty good job balancing the friendship vs. the relationship.  
  
However...even with that, I can't even count the number of times I have had plans with a friend and they have cancelled or left halfway through because their SO had a bad day, or felt sick, or ""missed them"".  
  
Like I said, I truly believe an SO should be a priority. And I do not necessarily blame my friends for rushing to their SOs sides--they are just being good boyfriends/girlfriends. I'm sure that when the day comes that I am in a committed relationship, I will behave the exact same way.  
  
But as that single friend...it's VERY hard not to just wish your friends' SOs would just man the fuck up. I have bad days, I get sick, and you know what? I deal. I may text a friend and see if they're free or whatever, but I certainly wouldn't expect them to drop everything to come to my aid at the slightest whim (as seems to be the case whenever a friends' SO texts them). I try very hard not to think this way, because like I stated above I do not necessarily fault my friends for being good boyfriends/girlfriends. That does not mean that I don't feel like crap every time I get ditched, or every time I think about the fact that if it was between being there for me or being there for their SOs, my friends would choose their SOs every time. Sometimes, I'm reaching out to a friend because I need someone to talk to, or because I've had a terrifically crappy day, or because I'm feeling lonely and just want some company. Watching that friend leave in the middle of our planned dinner that I've been looking forward to for a week because their SO had a crappy day at work or something just makes me feel low and unappreciated.
  
I guess what I'm trying to say is, keep the friend in mind. Yes, it's important to make your SO a priority in your life. But at the end of the day, your SO should know that you are always going to be there for them. You will ""go home"" (emotionally or physically) to your SO. Not to your friends. Try to make your time with them worthwhile.

TRUE,MorganFreemanAsSatan,,,"Satanism is sort of an umbrella term for a lot of religions that share a common identification with the literary figure of Satan.  In the world of poetry and literature, the mythology of Satan came to mean many things, and these very characteristics became quite popular around the time of the Romantic period.  Prior to the Romantic period you had Milton's Paradise Lost, which combined with the Ophite Gnostic view of the serpent as a positive figure of enlightenment, spawned the Satan archetype that most so-called Satanists revere.

It became a character of self-reliance, independence, sovereignty, freedom, opposition to tyranny, revolution, pride, science, sex, pleasure, and other such once-maligned characteristics.  Go and read Milton's Paradise Lost with modern eyes, and you'll find in Satan quite the amiable character, at times.  And as I said, during the Romantic period, this Promethean characterization of Satan was even more entrenched: Carducci, Byron, Blake, Baudelaire, Twain and Goethe all have quite a bit of ""Satanism"" running through them.

That said, you can go different directions with this mythology.  The Church of Satan, for example, takes some of the character traits of Satan and combines them with a Nietzschean or Randian egoism, which turns out quite a bit differently than the more traditional Romantic/Gnostic stance of Lucien Greaves/The Satanic Temple.  But because the former has a historical precedent in the form of Anton LaVey founding ""Satanism"" as a legal religion first, the Church of Satan types tend to say that everyone else is either a poser or a fraud, that is, they alone are responsible for the modern Satanic paradigm, and mythology, because they made it legal -- even though much of the literature they draw on is far older than themselves.",0,1389069002,,0,FALSE,1,cejbbpi,t3_1ukpl7,t1_cejbbpi,t1_cejag8c,1431833394,27,FALSE,news,t5_2qh3l,27

And there definitely are people who will never look past women's looks (e.g. the people who obsess about how Palin's ""such a MILF"" and don't give a shit about her political career, or vice versa, people who talk about how disgusting and fat famous women are without paying a moment's attention to their incredible life accomplishments). It's not like they're looking at these women on a dating site or something - they're reading about them in the news or something. As an intelligent, ambitious, and high-achieving woman, that sort of shit is really frustrating to hear. I don't expect everyone to be attracted to me; I do expect to be able to get respect and (when appropriate) recognition for my accomplishments from my male friends and colleagues.

Anyway, to the main point, what really kind of turns me off about the whole PUA thing, even if in a ""nicer"" package like you say, is that it tends to focus heavily on making a woman want something she doesn't already want rather than trying to make sure she and her male partner are both getting something they want and having their needs met. It's a subtle difference but an important one. Trying to change someone's desires - ""how do I make her like me?"" - is inherently paternalistic. It's saying that your view of what she should want is more important or more correct than what she actually wants, which devalues and disrespects the woman. Seeking to provide her what she actually wants aims towards a mutually beneficial exchange that respects both parties as equals who both have equally valid and worthy desires and needs.

I think a lot of stuff that has been mentioned (like eye contact, not approaching from behind, etc) can be easily rephrased to fit in a framework of fulfilling women's needs and desires. Generally, women want to feel safe (thus don't approach them from behind), they want to be able to trust someone they're talking to (see id), they want to have a good time (thus smile and joke with them), they want to feel like you're actually listening to them and being engaged in the conversation (thus eye contact) and so on and so forth. Insofar as PUA offers this advice, it can fit within the framework.

However, it seems like PUA pretty much just gives advice to how to get and maintain women's attention, how to get them in bed - basically how to make them happy enough for your own ends. It's not about actually making women happy - their happiness is a means to your ends. Particularly with respect to the pursuit of casual encounters, that PUA seems to ignore the importance of teaching men how to please women in bed suggests to me that the focus is really making women change their desires rather than fulfilling women's existing desires. The main reason, imho, that women do not engage in casual sex or seek it out as much as men do is because of the [orgasm gap](http://www.alternet.org/sex-amp-relationships/orgasm-gap-real-reason-women-get-less-often-men-and-how-fix-it). Women are far less likely to experience an orgasm in a heterosexual encounter than men are, and the gap is particularly large with ONSs and casual sex. As the article above explains, women who have sex with women have orgasms at much higher rates than women who have sex with men. Women also average the same amount of time to orgasm through masturbation as men do through intercourse. So, basically, it's not that it's 'naturally difficult' for women to orgasm; it's sex with men that is the problem. Which is understandable to an extent - if you (men generally) come easily, then you don't need as much effort from the other person, so you have less of an incentive to make sure they come so they do the same for you. Understandable doesn't mean excusable though.

Thus, we have a situation in which women's expected outcome from a heterosexual encounter is much lower than men's, and that's especially true for casual sex. (At least with longer term things, there's some possibility of teaching.) So of course women are going to seek out casual sex less than men. It's not that women don't want good sex - it's that they know they're not going to get it, so they don't even bother. (In my experience, about 90% of hookups are ""meh"" to godawful. I can do a lot better than that just by staying at home and taking care of myself. Most of my girlfriends have described similar experiences.)

If men want more casual sex, or even more sex in general, they have to work on their skill. Even if you're *just* looking for a ONS, women talk, and that will impact your chances. I've had women I don't even know warn me about a guy's actions in the sack; I've also heard dirty details and gotten 'recommendations', which I have subsequently pursued (for hookups, a lot of my friends and I are fine with sharing - this isn't the case with a lot of friend groups, but you'd be surprised how much gets around. Also, Lulu's a thing now.) Plus, it's always nice to have the option of repeat business when the business is good. Generally, though, the more guys work on their skill (and COMMUNICATE! ask her what she likes! if it feels good!), the more positive sexual encounters women have with them, the more women will be down for casual sex and the easier it will be for both parties to find mutually satisfying sexual encounters.

If PUA can do all this, and do it while respecting women's autonomy, wants, and needs, I don't really see a problem with that. In fact, it sounds pretty great. (Though it would be nice if it were a two-way street, and there was more good advice out there for women to find and/or approach interesting, good men!) I just feel like PUA is rarely if ever versed like this, and I feel like there's a real lack of attention to the orgasm gap, which ends up causing problems for both men and women.

Vring at 1.125 (I think or it may be 1.15)


There are some other settings too but be sure to read that overclocking guide in depth. This is a long process. You have to feel it out. Don't rush it. Don't try and push without understanding everything and what it does. Doing that will result in the OC you originally posted (bad) or even worse a chip that dies very quick. This isn't a quick game and there are no fast rewards. CPU's are expensive don't wreck it by not taking your time. Treat it like an old sportscar. You don't just take the car out and rev the shit out of it. You learn what it likes, you treat it right and all of a sudden you're really moving. Be patient. 

Also, post your full setup.
