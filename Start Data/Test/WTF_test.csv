"CrappyInternetGuy","","","A few things I noticed as an employee of an Electric Cooperative.. that was a 1 in a million deal right there.  The line fell ON the cows.  I've seen cows killed by a fallen line that didn't blow a line fuse but never one that fell on top of animals....That line is no more than 7200 volts which is way plenty to kill pretty much anything but the bells on the pole is 7.2kV framing.  Also, just judging by the look of the pole top that was a VERY old pole that should have been replaced several years ago.  Not knowing where this pic was taken I'd say that this pole was set in the late 60s, maybe early 70s at the latest.  It also has a transformer on it to step the voltage down to 120/240 phase-ground/phase-phase as well as service attachments that lead me to believe that this pole had open wire secondary attached rather than the (now) typical aluminum triplex.  Also, it used to be a deadend pole that had a new tap built off of it at some point....The wire on one side looks like #4ACSR, the wire on the other side (where the cows are) appears to be #6 amerductor which where I work hasn't been used since the mid 70s.  The top wire is the energized conductor, the bottom is the system neutral.  Luckily for your dad he took this picture after crews had already arrived on scene and grounded the line (the jumper going between the primary and neutral with the red flag).   I see liveoak trees in the background to the left....Where in Texas are you?  
Lastly, as I have seen in my 20 years in my electric cooperative that looks like about $60,000 worth of cows....Yeah to you they're just cows on property used for ag exemption, but it's amazing how no-count cattle become amazingly awesome breeding specimen who have won countless awards as show cows when they are killed by a power line.

I'd just like to clarify at this point that he decided to come back into the restaurant and get even more aggressive; however, he didn't do this to me but to other people (even though I'm the one that threw him out)

* It takes a koala four days to digest a meal: Fact. The word ""koala"" comes from the aboriginal language meaning ""no drink"" indicating the first of the three rules for gremlins.

* Koalas sing to defend their territories and win mates, like blue birds or [Michael Buble](http://i.imgur.com/q6miwc2.gif).

* Koalas are not bears. Koalas are [Hellspawn](http://i.imgur.com/IGooh.jpg), and like everything else in Australia they know only hate. More beastly than Hank McCoy, these blue-grey creatures have razor sharp claws and [a voice that sounds like a tiger dry heaving.](https://youtu.be/XPdaU9A-RqU)

* I'm not sure where the bear comparison comes from; they are less Smokey and more Fozzie bear with that stupid Muppet nose. Real bears eat delicious things like salmon, berries, honey, and ants; the *bare* necessities of life. Koalas only eat eucalyptus leaves, which are an ingredient in cough syrup. It was believed it made them drunk and pass out, but [robotripping](http://i.imgur.com/WBquWuB.jpg) is just how koalas roll. 
Eucalyptus is not very nutritious so they must spend five hours a day eating, eighteen hours a day sleeping, which leaves just one hour to get their mack on.

* Like many other marsupials, koalas are social creatures and like many other drug addicts they are mostly antisocial creatures.

* Koalas have a scent gland on their chest they use to mark their territory, so they aggressively hug trees to leave their stank.

* Koala have uncannily human-like fingerprints they use to grip things. They also have large claws to help grip even harder. They also have two thumbs. You do not want to be gripped by a koala.

* Koalas are afraid of paper bags. Researchers use a pole-mounted paper bag to coax koalas out of trees.

* Half of koala pregnancies are sired not by resident alpha males like Buster and Hendrix, but by koala charlatans like Captain Bogart [who roam the suburbs,](http://i.imgur.com/P0CQiwP.gif) looking for ladies and a fix. Only the toughest of koalas can survive on the streets with their devil-may-care attitude and shapely ears.

* [At the culmination of the violent tantrum which is koala coitus,](http://i.imgur.com/dAhabpV.gif) the male leaves a seminal plug which blocks the female's *multiple* vaginas from being entered by the hemipenis of another koala.

* Koalas are a protected species so its illegal to touch or pick one up without a permit. This is for the protection of the humans, not the koala.

* Also koalas get sick. During this documentary I saw a koala named James got Chlamydia and lost his territory to Hendrix, who then got Chlamydia and was taken to an animal hospital before it got to *full-on wet bottom*. Continuing the tradition of cuddlefying these monsters, ""wet bottom"" is what they call a urinary infection that stains their fur. Basically an STD leads to them pissing all over themselves. Finding out that koalas have Chlamydia is like finding out that [ponies get herpes](http://www.msuextension.org/musselshell/PDF%20FILES/ehvfaq.pdf) or that [kittens have AIDS](http://www.vet.cornell.edu/FHC/health_resources/brochure_fiv.cfm). *Both of those things are true by the way.*

* But the most common cause of death for koalas is reckless drivers.

I work with a research apiary, we currently have a little over 200 hives and can expect to get stung ~4 times a day. It's all fine and dandy once you get used to it, but early on my boss told me that 500 stings is enough for a lethal dose in a non-sensitive person.

So this image looks like a shitton of stings in one arm alone, and if he really was stung on 85-90% of his body, it's pretty damn likely he was stung many many more times than 500. So, I did some research.

Apparently, my boss was wrong. According to a 2006 [study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17265905) by Fitzgerald and Flood, the average lethal dose of bee venom for most mammals is 20 stings per kg of body mass. 

Now using the Hamwi method of calculating the ideal male body weight assuming that a man is 5'10 (the average height of an adult white man), we can theoretically say that this guy would ideally weigh 166lbs, or approximately ~75 kg. 

Given the 20 stings/kg statistic from the previously mentioned study, it would take about 1500 stings to kill an average adult man, three times as many as my boss claimed. It's probably something they tell us as to keep us on our toes I guess.

But for the sake of curiosity, I calculated my own lethal dose of stings. I weigh approximately 115 lbs, or ~52 kg. This means that it would only take around 1040 stings to kill me. Much more than 500, but still kind of sobering now that I think about it, especially given the fact that we had to deal with a swarm containing over 150,000 bees last week.

More calculations for shits and giggles. This all gets even more interesting once we learn that the man in the picture is an amputee. According to [some guy on the internet](http://www.quora.com/If-a-person-weighs-150-pounds-how-much-should-their-arm-weigh), an average arm weights about ~5.3% of a persons total body weight, while a leg is ~17.5%.

Still assuming that this dude is a completely ideal 166 pounds, an arm would weigh 8.8, and a leg would weigh 29.1. Now we don't know his amputee status, but we do know he has at least one arm. So the remaining possibilities are as follows:

Missing one arm- 157.2 lbs/~73kg.

Missing one leg- 136.9 lbs/~62kg.

Missing one arm and one leg- 128.1 lbs/~58kg.

Missing both legs- 107.8 lbs/~49kg.

Missing both legs and the remaining unseen arm- 99 lbs/~45kg.

So, the resulting lethal number of stings for each of these possibilities would be;

One arm-1460 stings.

One leg-1240 stings.

An arm and a leg-1160 stings.

Both legs-980 stings.

Triple amputee-900 stings.

I'm running out of steam here, but if anyone wants to count the number of stings in the image, learn the average area of the skin on both an adult man's arm and his entire body, calculate an estimate of stings per square inch based on the stings from the image (assuming an equal distribution of stings across his entire body), and then apply that to 85-90% of the total area of his skin, we could figure out if he should be dead. You could even go as far to account for different sting counts for each amputation possibility. But hell no I'm not going to do that.",1429840876,"","1429849163",1,426,"WTF"

One day my dad bought some nice, one gray the other white. He ate the white one no problem but was kind of running away from the Gray. I fell asleep watching and waiting and the next morning, I woke up and started crying. I saw the gray bastard standing on my snakes back and eating him as my snake casually strolls about the cage. A puddle of blood on his back next to his spine. Id say maybe a quarter inch deep. I took the mouse and threw him outside out of rage (I was 13 and stupid I guess). My snake ended up being fine. I didn't have enough money for the vet. So I thought about my options.. Do I cut his head off? Put him out of his misery? I couldn't do that.. So I was selfish and I picked him up. Walked to the bathroom and soaked up the blood with gauze. Then I grabbed some hydrogen peroxide and just poured. . I felt my snake tighten up on my arm and hiss in pain. I felt so bad. I stopped putting and saw it bubble up. I waited and grabbed some neosporin and covered the hole. I noticed my snake had called down. So I started doing it two times a day. I would cover it with a cut up bandaid and then let it breathe a little every day. He's fine now, about 12 years old and strong. He's got a badass scar too. So I guess happy ending.

"mycroftxxx42","","","Family Story Time:

There used to be an airforce base in Houston, Texas - Ellington Field.  It's used by NASA now, I think, but in the 60's it was active in the southeast part of the city.  

Pasadena, Texas, is a suburb of Houston on it's east side, and was mostly strawberry fields at this time (It's now mostly poor and refinery now).  The flight path for airforce craft had them avoiding the small residential area of Pasadena and flying over these fields.  From wherever they were coming from, this was a notable detour and not every pilot bothered.

This irked my 9-year-old father to no end.   One particular craft, the Fairchild C-119 ""Flying Boxcar"" was apparently in common use of the time and the pilot used to fly these prop driven aircraft at exceptionally low altitudes occasionally dipping below twenty feet.  The noise, as you might imagine, was rather extreme.

One day, my father was playing in the back yard with his older brother's bow and arrow.  A c-119 flies slowly over his neighborhood and in a fit of pique, my father raises the bow and shoots at it.  

Imagine his shock when the arrow not only hits, but penetrates the wing and sticks!  After being scared for the rest of the afternoon - fearing not only the government, but an older brother's wrath at losing ANOTHER arrow - my father mostly calms down and forgets about the incident over the next week or so.

A bit over a month later, an airforce vehicle parked itself in front of my grandparents' home and two men stepped out to stand guard while an airforce officer came up and knocked on their door.  My grandmother answered and he asked for my grandfather by name.  Shocked, since she assumed that a family friend who had been using their address while deployed in vietnam had died, she left the officer on the porch and got my grandfather.

Eventually the officer is shown inside and surprises everyone when he asks about my father, who is still nine years old.  My grandfather steps outside and whistles for my dad, who comes inside just as the officer is opening his briefcase to reveal... an arrow.

Apparently my fathers first thoughts  were, after ""CRAP!"", wondering how much a C-119 cost, and how long it would take him to pay one off at his allowance.   The officer asked him if he fired this arrow at a plane and when he shamefacedly concedes that he did, proceeds to tell my grandfather the story.

The pilot was very surprised when a civilian shot his aircraft, and expressed that surprise vocally.  Unfortunately, the cursing and exclamation of ""the little bastard shot me with an arrow"" went out over a live microphone back to the base.  Apparently, the pilot's commanding officer was waiting on the side of the runway when he got the plane down to verify that there was an arrow sticking out of the plane, and additionally cite the pilot for conduct unbecoming an officer, deviating from a flight plan, endangering civilians, and whatever other charges he could get out between laughing at this poor schmuck.  The details of the charges weren't ever really made clear to my dad, unfortunately.

At that point, my grandfather had to do some of the best acting of his life to date not to let on how amused he was at the situation and secretly proud of my father he was.  He was very stern with my dad and nodded along with the officer when he told my father that he was not allowed to shoot at US aircraft any more, and that they would be avoiding his house in the future.

My grandfather did ask for the arrow, but was told that it was going to be used as evidence.  While no details are known as to the arrow's eventual fate, it's assumed that it was kept around as a memento and story-prompt by someone, probably the officer.

-------



Am I an idiot for thinking about calling this in? Buchanan, VA only has a population of ~1100 people so even if it's nothing it is probably worth reporting, since I doubt the police are swamped.

Edit: OK, I called the VA state police, told them what i knew, and she gave me a nice grilling. She pulled it up on Google maps and it hasnt been updated since 2011 (or so she said, others are saying it's still there. It's been there since 2011 though). So who knows? Either way, she asked me where I found this info and I told her this thread. Took a while to explain to her how to find it on /r/WTF (maybe if the search function worked!!). So yeah, VA state police are now looking at this thread. She said she would give the info to the state police and that's all I know. I probably just got trolled but so what? I'll sleep better knowing I did the right thing, in my mind.

Edit 2: also, fuck you OP for making me do that instead of giving us the story. You should be ashamed. Maybe it was you I was trolled by...

I will just hope it's a hoax we all got caught up on, OP included. But OP had the info on Twitter before making this post. Either they didn't check their Twitter , or OP is a huge dickwad.

* *Myth: Declawing a cat keeps it out of the shelter.* A study published in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association found that declawed cats were at an **increased risk of relinquishment to animal shelters.** Among relinquished cats, 52.4% of declawed cats were reported to exhibit litter box avoidance, compared to 29.1% of non-declawed cats. A national survey of shelters from the Caddo Parrish Forgotten Felines and Friends indicates that approximately **70 percent of cats turned in to shelters for behavioral problems are declawed.** According to a study published in the October 2001 issue of JAVMA by Dr. Gary J. Patronek, VMD, PhD, “declawed cats were at an increased risk of relinquishment.”

* *Myth: Declawing doesn't hurt the cat.* A study of 163 cats that underwent onychectomy (declawing), published in the July/August 1994 Journal of Veterinary Surgery, showed that 50 percent suffered from immediate postoperative complications such as pain, hemorrhage, and lameness; long-term complications, including **prolonged lameness**, were found in nearly **20 percent** of the 121 cats who were followed up in the study. Cats can suffer from complications such as bilateral flexor tendon contracture, abscesses, and claw regrowth (under the skin). A 2005 study by J. Gaynor (""Chronic pain syndrome of onychectomy"") found that feline patients who have had onychectomy (declaw) **may experience chronic pain.** ""Owners of such cats usually report one of several concerns, the most common of which is fear that the cat is still in pain, especially in the fore paws, because it seems to walk very lightly on those feet, as if walking on nails or glass. Another common concern is behavioral changes, which may include decreased activity, decreased appetite, or increased aggression.:

http://www.historyofcircumcision.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=category&amp;sectionid=8&amp;id=73

US circumcision has its rootes in the super-Christian victorian days of the 19th century where people like John Kellog touted the genital mutilation of boys and men to stop the ""horrible"" illnesses of masturbation and fornication. It was widely thought it would make sex less pleasurable and thus encourage their ideal of holy chastity.   Curious that Muslims today do a very similar procedure, for the EXACT same reasons today and we call it barbaric.  

And then at the same time that they thought the bumps on your head legitimate gave insight int your health, and the electro-shock butt plugs could cure anything but a lack of kinkiness, they claimed it would reduce the spread of VD's.   

Modern medicine has shown there is little no significant risk of disease or legitimate reason to preform circumcision for health.   There is a very small reduction in the transmission of HIV, but its nothing compared to the protection a good condom provides.  Bascially in the 2000's there is no compelling reason to preform widespread circumcision automatically at birth other than tradition.  

Then it became tradition, pushed by a small number of doctors on infants with no respect to their rights.   Apparently parents are allowed to tell doctors to lop any ol' part off their kids at infancy with no respect to the rights of the child.   

Granted male circumcision is nowhere near as brutal or debilitating as female circumcision.   That still doesn't make it ok though.  The issue at point is that its done often at the moment of birth, and yes it has on occasion destroyed the penises of baby boys.   Any surgery or body mod should be done under informed consent.  

Personally I don't care if you wanna get cut.  By all means.   But it should be illegal to circumcise anybody under 18 who doesn't give informed consent themselves to undergo the procedure.  I can't fault my parents because they didn't know any better, but I now wish I hadn't been myself.  ",1427223420,"","1427223682",1,108,"WTF"

3. In one smooth movement, put the cat in the toilet and close the lid. (You may need to stand on the lid.)

5. Flush the toilet three or four times. This provides a ""Power Wash"" and ""Rinse"".

6. Have someone open the front door of your home. Be sure that there are no people between the bathroom and the front door.

"kittyfodder","","","I remember back in 2005, a guy in Sydney was home with his wife when 2 burglars broke in wielding a shotgun and a katana.  They tied up the husband and wife as they went about their nefarious deeds and at some point the husband became concerned about the direction things were going.  

Hero husband managed to break free and jump the guy with the sword, disarming and hacking him up.  When he was done with samurai sam, he turned his attention to shotgun jake and went all chop happy.  Shotgun jake, now just jake, dives through the front window pane to escape the husband (now known as Usagi Yojimbo) and disappears into the night.  The cops turn up and soon after low blood pressure jake turns himself in as he's in desperate need of medical attention.  Let's not forget samurai sam, who died at the scene from his wounds.

We're not done.  When this happened I was working in a role that meant I was privy to the goings on of our judicial system.  So I'm watching the sheets waiting to see how this turned out.  I mean, Yojimbo there killed a guy and damn well had a good go at the other.  Nothing...I never saw it.  It's like it never went to court.

He put it on the end of his penis and marvelled at the beauty of his own genitals. One day he fucked a deer so hard that the jewelled band fell off into the animal and since then he is cursed to ride the deer, trying to retrieve the band with a broomstick.
