"Tickle_Me_H0M0","","","The leaked documents basically reveal that the NSA is preparing a variety of cyber tools in case of a major cyber war. Such tools include being able to take down entire networks of foreign governments and conduct sabotage of critical infrastructure. 

Such tools were necessary because adversaries like China and Russia had similar developments. 

In other words, there is a cyber arms race going on between the worlds major powers.  

Another interesting revelation is that while the NSA was investigating cyber attacks against the DoD, it was able to trace the attack from where it originally came from. They were then able to plant a bug inside that source which happened to be one of the central routers that China's intelligence services uses and intercepted whatever the Chinese cyber spies were stealing. One instance, the Chinese were stealing documents from the UN and in turn the US intercepted those documents. The NSA was also even able to get the identity of the hackers. 

This explains how the FBI was able to [publicly charge 5 Chinese military officers for espionage.](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-05-19/u-s-said-to-charge-chinese-military-officers-with-online-spying.html) It seems the US was warning the Chinese military that the NSA knew what the Chinese espionage apparatus was up to and knew the identities of their spies.

The documents also highlight the fact that the NSA caught other nations spying and doing similar things that they were doing (in particular China, Russia and France was mentioned). 

Snowden says that he is concerned about the NSA focusing more on offense rather than defense. 

However, despite all the NSA's efforts in protecting US government and US military networks, there were over 30,000 incidents in which foreign attackers had succeeded in penetrating such networks. 

There is no perfect defense. A good offense helps deter and mitigate the potential consequences.

"Abevege","","","Obama's got it wrong when he thinks the underlying problem is ""disaffected sunnis"" some of whom have no access to education etc. Wrong, wrong wrong. The rise of fascist Islamism has nothing to do with wealth or poverty, education or ignorance - the impulse to religiosity is not linked to wealth, social status or education.

In this case religiosity is indivisible from politics. Fascist Islamism is a political dogma, not a religion, and its first victims are secular Muslims who are termed apostates and killed.

This is why they kill atheists, apostates, they have beheaded Christians but will revert to the Sharia principle of suffering the Christians and Jews to live in return for the payment of the Jizya tax.

And yes, ISIS is probably a direct consequence of the invasion of Iraq - but the rise of fascist Islamism has nothing to do with it.

Fascist Islamism attacks countries all around the world that have nothing to do with the US adventures in the Middle East. 

Fascist Islamists have attacked:
Nigeria (Boko Haram)
Philippines (MILF)
Pakistan (Lashka-e-taibba)
Indonesia (Jemaah Islamiah)
Chechnya/Russia (Beslan bombing, Russian theatre attacks)
Somalia (al-Shabaab)
Kenya (al-Shabaab)
Sudan (Janjaweed)

and on and on it goes.

All of these groups are fascist Islamist. None of them have anything to do with Iraq. All of them share the ideology of implementing the Caliphate through Sharia. 

All get their inspiration if not their funding and money from the fascist Islamism of the motherland: Saudi Arabia - where atheists are executed, other religions are banned and no non-Muslims are even allowed to set foot in the city of Mecca.

Isn't it time we faced facts? Secular Muslims and former Muslims signed the 2007 St Petersburg Declaration warning the Western World not to allow the intolerance preached by fascist Islamists to grow a foothold in the West. They asked us to stand up for Enlightenment principles, for freedom of speech. To resist the push to blasphemy laws and to ban faith courts and Sharia outright as a seditious legal system that enforces laws not passed through the democratically elected representatives of a country's citizens.

Why have we not done this? We've done the opposite: pretended there is no such thing as fascist Islamism, betraying secular Muslims. Then we stomped on freedom of speech and gave the spies and cops unlimited power to pry into our emails and phonecalls, to track us by our mobile phones and our metadata. We persecuted whistleblowers like Edward Snowden, and trashed civil liberties instead of protecting them. We did the work of the fascist Islamists for them - we destroyed ourselves.

Overseas we tried to play tribal politics and kingmakers as if that will work. stupid stupid stupid. All because we won't call out the Saudis. Are they really that powerful? Surely the US and Russia between them have enough energy resources for us to exert a bit of ideological pressure on Saudi Arabia.

Boycott Saudi. Boycott them until they give equal rights to women, gays and atheists. Boycott them and leave them to the mercy of Isis until they introduce freedom of religion in the holy land. Tear down that tower of intolerance and religious fascism.

&gt;Israeli officials justify demolitions of Palestinian structures on the grounds that they were built “illegally” without building permits in areas not zoned for residential construction. However Israeli authorities have zoned land in ways that unlawfully discriminates against Palestinians. Israeli authorities have zoned 13 percent of East Jerusalem for Palestinian construction, but expropriated 35 percent of the area for settlement construction. Israeli authorities in practice permit Palestinian construction in only one percent of the other area of the West Bank, “Area C,” that is under exclusive Israeli control. According to B’Tselem, an Israeli rights group, Israeli authorities have allocated 63 percent of Area C to settlements.

It was distasteful and unnecessary to announce his sexual preferences during MASS. That information has zero place in a mass. He essentially announced to the congregation that he has the desire to have sex with men. Since when is that an okay subject for the pulpit, whether from a gay or straight priest? The pulpit is also NOT the place for blatant political pandering. In the Church's view, he just actively encouraged his flock to vote for and support something sinful. He is not brave or gutsy, he is inappropriate and according to his own faith, leading his flock astray.

To reiterate, I don't care one iota if you support SSM or not. The fact is that a Catholic mass, where Catholics go to receive Catholic teachings, is in no way the place to campaign about homosexual marriage. It should be respected as a place of worship and not made into a platform for things the Church firmly teaches against.

For the most ""liberal"" city in the nation, I've never heard so much Islamaphobia in my entire fucking life, being a Marine who had just served in Iraq, it actually fucking disgusted me.

There were easily well over 20 politicians there, all Democrats except for 2 Republicans, they even applauded, more than for anyone else.  He had the greatest response of any key speaker there.  A little history about me, my Grandfather was German, they came here to avoid what was happening in Germany when he was a child, and he went back to fight them in World War II.

[The will is there to improve your system.](http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2012/07/connor-kilpatrick-its-hip-its-cool-its-libertarianism.html)

&gt; For almost two decades, roughly two-thirds of the American public have supported what we’d call a moderate European welfare state—putting the average U.S. citizen significantly to the left of the Democratic party, a center/center-right organization saddled, much to their dismay, with a perpetually-disappointed center-left constituency.

http://mediamatters.org/research/progmaj/

I don't think that Scandinavians are somehow much more awesome than Americans so much as I think that the US has a [really shitty political system](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7tWHJfhiyo) and a corrupt government. Also, the individualistic mentality that Americans historically have had is slowly dying out, which is very good for the country.

Most can at the very least agree that getting a single-payer healthcare system would be a huge step up.

As for Norway, let me clear up some arguments:

1) The oil argument is libertarian / conservative propaganda.

The social safety net here in Norway has historically been paid for by **high taxes**, not the Government Pension Fund (oil fund). If it were paid for by oil money, it wouldn't be sustainable in the least (the fund would be gone in a few short years).

It is against the rules to spend more than 4% of the fund per year; since it is an emergency fund, we take good care of it. Some years (like 2007), it's not touched at all and just grows.

It is a myth that it is simply oil money that lead to the success in Norway: sound fiscal policy, spread wealth, technology building, nationalization of the energy sector, high education, stable global region, close situation to the market, predictable and stable government, balanced mix between taxes and benefits...the list goes on.

**Sweden is also a very similar country to us, and they're doing just fine without the oil.**

2) Homogeneity is certainly helpful, but not anywhere near as important as racists claim. What's more important are factors that interact with and reinforce homogeneity across cultural borders: [equality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_inequality-adjusted_HDI) and [overall peace.](http://www.visionofhumanity.org/#/page/indexes/global-peace-index) These factors play off of each other along with homogeneity, but to claim that homogeneity is the sole cause or something is ignorant.

3) Size is a poor excuse. A higher population makes things more difficult but by no means impossible. Besides, you could easily make the comparison of the EU as a whole compared to the US in arguments such as universal healthcare, etc.

--------

I'll tackle another typical complaint:

&gt;This is very misleading, because most people on welfare are not counted as unemployed.

Yeah, the way unemployment is calculated won't include someone who's on welfare *and* isn't actively seeking employment.  It doesn't matter though, since Norway's labor market activity rate is at 66% while the US is at 63%, meaning even given the generous welfare benefits, more people choose to activate in the labor market in Norway than in the US.  South Korea spends almost nothing on welfare and their activity rate is 61%, while Sweden's is 64% (World Bank). 

The level of benefits really doesn't seem to be related to labor market activation.  Of course 20% of people in a Scandinavian state are going to be ""on welfare"" since welfare in those states is *universal*, not *means tested*.  That means if you are well off and have a kid, you get welfare.  If you are a student, you get welfare. If your industrial sector didn't get a cost of living increase in the last round of wage bargaining, you might be compensated by a cash benefit (this happens in more [corporatist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_corporatism) countries.)

Guess what?  *The US is the same way.*  The same thing happens as in all these other countries, but the US spends welfare money through the tax system as a subsidy instead of in cash benefits.  Have a kid in Norway? Get a check.  Have a kid in the US?  Get a tax credit. It's the exact same thing, only when it comes to tax based welfare everyone *thinks* they're not on welfare while only lazy people are, when in fact almost everyone in the US gets generous welfare support unless you are a single, income earning individual. 

It's the hidden welfare state, and it's really fucking inefficient.

We literally viewed Jews as Satan personified. If some kid went missing ""it was the Jews"", if someone shoplifted some milk from the store ""it was the Jews"". And it didn't matter when the next day we found it was some local kid who took it. We never thought back to ""we shouldn't have blamed the Jews for that one"".  We just moved on to the next one.

Here's Peter Bergen's response (he actually visited the compound in Abbotabad after the raid): [Hersh's account of the bin Laden raid is a farrago of nonsense that is contravened by a multitude of eyewitness accounts, inconvenient facts and simple common sense.](http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/11/opinions/bergen-bin-laden-story-a-lie/)

Here's Bobby Ghosh, Quartz's Managing Editor: [The story is certainly sensational. But it is also highly questionable](http://qz.com/402375/one-question-seymour-hersh-never-answers-in-his-alt-history-of-the-killing-of-osama-bin-laden/).

Max Fisher of Vox has the most comprehensive takedown to date: [The story simply does not hold up to scrutiny — and, sadly, is in line with Hersh's recent turn away from the investigative reporting that made him famous into unsubstantiated conspiracy theories](http://www.vox.com/2015/5/11/8584473/seymour-hersh-osama-bin-laden).

**Update** Here's Former CIA Deputy Director Michael Morell: [“every sentence I was reading was wrong. The source that Hersh talked to has no idea what he’s talking about.”](http://www.politico.com/story/2015/05/seymour-hersh-bin-laden-story-rebuttle-former-cia-chief-117811.html)

**Update 05/12 /15**  Slate's contributors decide to beat on a dead horse:

Joshua Keating: [Seymour Hersh’s Version of the Bin Laden Raid Is Not Only Illogical. It’s Not New](http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2015/05/11/seymour_hersh_s_version_of_the_bin_laden_raid_is_not_only_illogical_it_s.html).

**Update 05/13/15** 

 Seth Maxon: [The Last Time Seymour Hersh’s Reporting Raised Doubts](http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2015/05/11/seymour_hersh_on_syria_stories_about_rebels_launching_chemical_weapons_attacks.html).

And for his part, Seymour Hersh refuses to respond substantively: [“I Am Not Backing Off Anything I Said”](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/foreigners/2015/05/seymour_hersh_interview_on_his_bin_laden_story_the_new_yorker_journalism.html).

**Edit 05/13/2005**  I just read through Isaac Chotiner's [interview with Hersh](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/foreigners/2015/05/seymour_hersh_interview_on_his_bin_laden_story_the_new_yorker_journalism.2.html).  I'm not a psychiatrist, but Hersh sounds insane.  That's not hyperbole, he literally sounds like he's sitting on a park bench ranting.  If somebody's going to rescue Hersh's piece, it's going to have to be somebody other than Hersh himself.

&gt;Hersh: You want to write about this totally tedious shit? Yes, I am a huge pain in the ass. I am the one that decided to publish it wherever the hell I please. That’s the story. You want to listen to hall gossip about me? Go ahead. [Sarcastic voice] It is so immensely important to so many people to know where I published. I can’t believe it.

&gt;Chotiner: Can I tell you why?

&gt;Hersh: I don’t want to hear why. You think there is a different standard in London?

&gt;Chotiner: I wish you would listen.

&gt;Hersh: All right, maybe I will listen, but I gotta hang up.

&gt;Chotiner: If people here are turning down stories because of certain politics—you yourself said it was easier in Europe—that is a story that should be written.

&gt;Hersh: Now you said the first intelligent thing you have said. If you had asked whether he didn’t run this because he is in love with Obama and all that stuff that people think, no … It is a very good question. Although we have huge disagreements. My children and I have huge disagreements. I have a huge disagreement with my dog. We have a lot of disagreements and there are times when he will call me and I will not answer the call. Oh fuck hold on. He always has said to me he welcomes any information and it was I who said fuck it.

Some skeptical background on Hersh's other recent exposes:

James Kirchick: [The Deceits of Seymour Hersh](https://www.commentarymagazine.com/article/the-deceits-of-seymour-hersh/)

 Emmanuel Sivan: [Media consumers should heed the unwritten warning, ""Reader beware.""](http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/opinion/thus-are-reports-about-the-mideast-generated-1.223615)

Michael Calderone: [New Yorker, Washington Post Passed On Seymour Hersh Syria Report](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/08/seymour-hersh-syria-report_n_4409674.html)

**Update**  [NBC News](http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/pakistanis-knew-where-bin-laden-was-say-us-sources-n357306) has corroborated *part* of Hersh's story.  A very small part in which

&gt;two intelligence sources say that the year before the U.S. raid that killed Osama bin Laden, a ""walk in"" asset from Pakistani intelligence told the CIA where the most wanted man in the world was hiding - and these two sources plus a third say that the Pakistani government knew where bin Laden was hiding all along.

NBC News doesn't corroborate any of the more sensational aspects of Hersh's story such as that the entire raid was an elaborate hoax cooked up together by the Pakistanis and the U.S. or that U.S. forces met no resistance in the compound or that the Seal Team cut up parts of Bin Laden's body and dropped them over the Hindu Kush mountains. In fact, NBC News's sources reject those parts of Hersh's story outright:

&gt;Multiple U.S. officials, however, denied or cast doubt on the assertion that the U.S. told the Pakistanis about the bin Laden raid ahead of time.

So, in case you're keeping score at home, Seymour Hersh is still a nut who's been wrong dozens of times and there's no reason to believe the bulk of this story either.

I also think this is a global problem and cultural relativism needs to be taken into context because no culture is perfect. Not even our own, wherever you may be.

I am an Arab who comes from a Muslim family and thoroughly understands Islam's current situation. Apologies for my English as it is my third language, and apologies for this extremely lengthy post which I am to proof read after I wake up tomorrow. Here's the full story. 

Understanding the world's Muslims position on what's happening today requires a thorough understanding of an array of nodes, or variables, which are often off-set against each other in arriving at any given situation. These variables are extremely important to know in order to understand the fuller picture, and without them the international alienation of Muslims and Arabs may continue for reasons often viewed as a mesh; an extremely hard to decipher web of interconnected values leading to extremism and the complete insanity often portrayed by the few bad apples.

First, yes, it is important to understand that the conversion from a normal sane Apple to an horribly bad apple is quite simple under certain circumstances, and in order to avoid those and help the international Muslim world wake up, international governments and media must tread carefully and hand-in-hand in order to contain an ever boiling situation. 

It is extremely easy to point fingers and blame a whole religion, and it's even easier to deal with brute-force-bombing villages and towns which are spewing terrorists around the world, but those are merely symptomatic-reliefs and are far from an actual cure. The virus that is religion-fueled extremism, especially when driven by faiths which make it ""morally"" easier to die, adapts rapidly and dangerously unless fully understood and contained.

First, allow me to give you a background about myself.

I am a 30 years Arab Muslim who comes from a very authentic Arabic and Muslim background, I was brought up reciting verses of the Quaran throughout my childhood and I studied moderate -gulf states version- Islam for all my years of school and most of university. I also grew up in a typical Arab setting where being a ""tough man"" is often a survival instinct dictated by the constant bullying spread across various classes and often targets the ""weak"". The weak here is anyone who isn't willing to sustain bodily harm in order to defend oneself, usually women, the more feminine guys, children, and anyone who doesn't ""cover up his sisters"". The Arab world is a fascinating place where you can find the most human to human love and understanding, and you can find the most hateful and condescending interconnections, sometimes in the same damn building or house hold.  

If you think you can get beheaded for drawing prophet mohammed, try swearing at a guy's sister in front of his dad, or try whistling at a veiled mother in front of a protective husband in many parts of the Arab world; be it Egypt, Jordan, Yemen, Saudi even Lebanon, that can easily get you killed. To understand that a non-religious Arab would risk death and would murder for ""honor"" is an extremely essential part of understanding how this reflects on religion, because it is often that deep bewitched ""readiness for martyrdom"" attitude is what trickles down to religious extremism, honor crimes, and even crimes after a football match. 

Often asked yourself why Palestinian riots or demonstrations are often far more violent than, say, an Israeli demonstration? Why North Africans are -this is sad but true- extremely hard to deal with in places like Europe and are often avoided by the police? Why the Lebanese in Australia tend to be the most violent among their peers? It is extremely understand that the nature of Arab ""honor"" is transitive, it actually is not exclusive to Islam, a Christian Arab is far more likely to defend any version of ""honor"" more violently than say a Dutch Christian. I am here not saying that being Arab is the cause of extremism, not at all, but it is the interconnection of all these elements. The reason you won't find a Christian Arab strapped to some c4 somewhere is because Islam, as a misinterpreted and often politically exploited religion, makes it easier to ""go big"" for all those falsely promised rewards of 72 virgins and eternal paradise. The need to defend ""honor"" is very essentially the same, it is just extremely compounded when coupled with religion and systematic brainwashing of neglecting this ""transitive temporary"" life and focusing on avoiding eternal hell. 

I remember my dad rushing to school when my sister was five in order to fight with the Islamic-studies teacher. My sister had returned home earlier that day, utterly traumatized and pleading my father to make ""Allah forgive her"". That asshole of a teacher has just exposed an innocent five years old to unimaginable descriptions of eternal hell, graphic suffering that gets into the details of burning flesh, wearing molten-steel shoes until the brain boils, eating puss-filled thorny food for eternity, and an array of things even adults can't handle to hear; yet there we were with my sister being just five and traumatized in one of the world's most progressive Islamic countries on Earth. That teacher taught me too, and I went through the same exact detailing of said horrors but I never went back home crying because guess what? Boys don't cry, or else how can I defend my honor? That teacher had no agenda asides from doing his job and getting his salary and doing what he though was a good job in transmitting a religious message, and I was in a private Arab school which taught Islam as part of the governmental curriculum. It is then easy to imagine the horrors the Arab and Muslim youths go through when systematically brainwashed by people with actual agendas, in countries where extremism is a national export. 

In the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks, the United States had Saudi and many other Arab governments restructure their school curriculums where all teachings related to Jihad and martyrdom were moderated and teachers were instructed to lessen from their tones. This I believe was a great step forward is still lacking in traction.

Islam today carries this extremely strong ""honor"" overtone because it was born in one of the most tribal societies on Earth, and although it was a marvelous rebellion against many horrid tribal virtues once prevalent, it still inherited from the culture and like most pagan-to-Abrahamic conversions, it still had to cater to local tastes and thus punishments were often extreme: cutting hand of the thief made much more sense than the once common ""kill him and rape his family and take his daughter as a slave"", and to stone a woman and a man to their death for adultery was a way to defuse the ""honor"" anger and avoid the once extremely savage and common tribal wars. When Islam first arrived, it was a systematic solution to many of the huge issues back then, but it is evident today that even backward Muslims view such punishments as extremes let alone the moderates. Just like we will view capital punishment as extreme one day when we will have brain-reset solutions, humanity advances but religion makes it damn hard to let go and Islam is very good at that.

This school of ""honor"" though was the vehicle through which Islam spread back in its time, and many cultures who adopted Islam adopted with it this school of thought. Hence today, places like Pakistan, Afghanistan, Eastern Europe, Nigeria, even the Philippines adopted it and started producing their own versions of extremism. Some other countries were lucky enough to have adopted Islam without the extremism multiplier, where Malaysia often stands-out as a good example. 

The problem with understanding international Islam today is to understand that the Arab world is still, largely, few centuries backwards in its way of thinking, yet this same Arab world clings to the leadership role of explaining and guiding Islam around the world. In the Arab world of today, Human life is still easy to waste for the silliest reasons, from a girl losing her virginity then murdered by her brothers all the way up to what just saw unfold in France, they stem from the same deadly formula; a skewed understanding of a tribal honor system and a religion which makes it easier to say ""fuck it all"", and those two are often exported in a couple and are dangerously offered throughout terrorists-production camps.

To add to this deadly formula, the Arab world sadly sits on a huge oil reserve which only lets international powers and human greed fuel these differences and feed them, and with Israel's presence in the region and another Abrahamic religion fighting for yet another prophecy in Israel, the Arab world and the Muslim world at large is a mess.

To fix this, the international community must take firm steps in not allowing Arab governments to continue their puppet-shows and to cease fueling hatred and extremism. Scientists worldwide must help us take major leaps against petrol-dependency and render the region uninteresting for all those meddlers. Education and schooling must vastly improve in order to give the Arab and Muslim youths purpose instead of the current desperation rendering them easy prey to remote exploiters.

It is time to stop the insanity and to stop each others' 2000 year's old books causing all this destruction. The exploitation and abuse is systematic and is politically driven, and if real efforts are made into corrective steps, international world peace is a very attainable dream. 

Meanwhile, free world, keep on doing what you're doing. Adherents to all religious must respect every human's right to say whatever they want to say with no risk of any punishment whatsoever, be it a risk of horrendous crimes or being taken to court, all religions must cut their bullshit. No human on earth has the right to shun another human from their birth-right of free speech. 

Long live Charlie.

They completely gloss over the fact that the reason there's that much fucking oil on the seafloor is because BP used Corexit to ""clean"" after repeatedly being told not to. Corexit can be used to clean up smaller spills with efficiency...but when used in the volume that it was with Deepwater Horizon it does exactly as the article describes. It breaks down the oil and forces it to clump into denser droplets and...sink to the seafloor to be broken down by bacteria. For BP, this was perfect; out of sight, out of mind (as far as the oil slick goes). For everyone else, its awful. Corexit is highly toxic, kills not only marine life but also the cleanup workers exposed to it. Additionally, now we have a situation where we have a SHIT TON of clumped up oil on the seafloor, suffocating the bacteria that is supposed to clean it up. Its like getting coated in mud, and getting in the shower, and wondering why the shower drain backs up. You clogged it, motherfucker. 

Its weird, when I was a kid I never understood the hullabaloo about Exxon Valdeez, as in why it was talked about years upon years after the cleanup had ended. As an adult, a Louisiana resident, and just an American who appreciates the natural beauty of our nation, I'm fucking livid. I'd love nothing more than to see anyone involved with the decision to use Corexit put on trial for crimes against the environment. Seriously, put them in jail for injuring the *one planet we have*.

"JamesColesPardon","","","This also plays into [Parallel Construction](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/08/dea-and-nsa-team-intelligence-laundering), a term used to describe a process of building an incriminating case against a citizen without their knowledge, and then tipping local authorities off when and where they will be to do a routine traffic stop and find the incriminating evidence that authorities already knew was there.

Follow me? [Reuters](http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBRE97409R20130805?irpc=932) did a nice job explaining it:

&gt;The undated documents show that **federal agents are trained to ""recreate"" the investigative trail to effectively cover up where the information originated, a practice that some experts say violates a defendant's Constitutional right to a fair trial**. If defendants don't know how an investigation began, they cannot know to ask to review potential sources of exculpatory evidence - information that could reveal entrapment, mistakes or biased witnesses.

This is blatantly against the fourth amendment, of course, but the US Government has bypassed this issue by utilizing the FISA (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act) court's warrant rubber-stamping process (here's [list](https://epic.org/privacy/wiretap/stats/fisa_stats.html) of the warrant requests presented, approved, modified, or rejected). Of note, 0.3% of requests are **denied**.

Also, the vast majority of these warrants have nothing to do with *terrorism*, as you may think. The court even reinterpreted the legal doctrine used to compel railway workers to get drug tested (*a minimal intrusion in privacy*) to allow for almost limitless electronic surveillance on Americans. [I shit you not](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/07/us/in-secret-court-vastly-broadens-powers-of-nsa.html?pagewanted=all).

&gt;In one of the court’s most important decisions, **the judges have expanded the use in terrorism cases of a legal principle known as the “special needs” doctrine and carved out an exception to the Fourth Amendment’s requirement of a warrant for searches and seizures**, the officials said.

How patriotic! Continuing:

&gt;The special needs doctrine was originally established in 1989 by the Supreme Court in a ruling allowing the drug testing of railway workers, finding that **a minimal intrusion on privacy was justified by the government’s need to combat an overriding public danger**. Applying that concept more broadly, the FISA judges have ruled that the N.S.A.’s collection and examination of Americans’ communications data to track possible terrorists does not run afoul of the Fourth Amendment, the officials said.

So, that overwhelming public danger (drugged out railway workers laying railroads) was legally bound to *terrorism* in the schema of minimally invasive privacy intrusions. Your tax dollars hard at work, people.

Also, the President's legal framework adjustments entitled [Updated Administration Proposal: 
Law Enforcement Provisions](http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/legislative/letters/updated-law-enforcement-tools.pdf) reorganize cyber crimes under the RICO (Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organizations) statutes, which gives the administration broader powers for prosecution. He alluded to this during the SOTU.

It also specifies under Section 103 (Modernizing The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act) that *intentionally accessing or exceeding authorizations on protected computers without causing &gt;$5,000 worth of damage is lawful* (or at least specify no penalties), which to me seems a lot like what the NSA has been doing.

Edit 3:

At the risk of making this comment far too verbose, I would not live with myself later if I didn't try and capitalize on this visibility for an idea I've had for awhile now. There has been some great discussion about this below, and am thankful for all the great conversations in the morning while I've been snowed in. Many have brought up how there really is *no recourse here for this issue* other than belly-aching on Social Media. So here's my idea:

Don't like this policy? Don't like all the Surveillance State regulations that have crept onto the books in the past 14 years? Tired of bitching about it? So you wish there was *someone* willing to do something about it, who isn't bought by corporations, and would run not out of the possibility to gain power but to give power back to the People? Well, what are *you* waiting for?

Did you know that legislation needs to be agreed upon by a House Majority (which is 218 votes)? You really only need to get 218 people to agree to *not pass any legislation at all* until these various policing powers are reigned in and we start projecting solutions to this country's policies. That's not that many people. Did your Rep run unopposed?

What if *this idea* actually caught on? What if Wolf-PAC vouched for you and helped at least get the process started? Surely the get-big-money-out-of-politics is an idea that most here can agree with. Sixty-nine districts ran unopposed last year - and maybe it's time my age cohort (18-35) gets politically active? 

*Could you imagine*? 

If anyone knows anybody willing to help towards this crazy idea, let's talk about it. I'll help in any way and talk to anyone willing to put 217 people in Washington in November of 2016, regardless of silly Ds and Rs next to their name.

Here is a link to [Episode 288: Kickstarting A Revolution](http://www.dancarlin.com/product/common-sense-282-kickstarting-revolution/) which offers the unique idea of utilizing existing crowd-funding technology to supplant corporate candidates, which would be necessary, along with Wolf-PAC, for this idea to have any legs (IMO).

"StJohnsFog","","","I'm a pretty liberal person. Politically, when I lean to the right it tends to be about fiscal issues.

The more this happens, the more I begin to think about things in ways I haven't before. I can't imagine any neutral observer watching this happen time and time again, over and over, and continue to think that defending the all aspects of the religion is what needs to happen. Obviously everyone knows that these people represent only a small fraction of the group, but its becoming more and more clear that there are larger ideas and themes that simply don't mesh with western ideas as we know them.

So how do we change this peacefully? Is it possible? As I watch ISIS terrorize, and I watch these seemingly ""individual"" attacks occur more frequently... there is a common theme. There is a common denominator, and to ignore it is to willingly blind yourself. Extreme solutions (kick them out! Invade the middle east!) are just as extreme as the perpetrators and are not the Western way. However, political correctness, and continuing to protect and defend ideas that are at war with us, does nothing to fix the problem and move society past this mess.

I don't know what the answer is, but I know I'm not happy about what the current status quo is.

**EDIT:** To clarify, I am suggesting that there needs to be a way to differentiate between the incompatible ideas that these extremists are latching onto, and the generally good intentions and good people that make up the majority of Muslims in the West. It is unfair and unjust to suggest that these attackers are the norm. They are anything but. That said, most people bury their head in the sand or come to the defense of every facet of the religion simply because it is ""politically incorrect"" to begin to acknowledge that ""hey, some of these ideas aren't defensible"". 

What I'm saying, is that there are clearly ideas that are polluting a small portion of a major world religion, and these ideas are causing them to commit unthinkable crimes. It is irresponsible to not try to combat these ideas, in the same way that it is irresponsible to try and lump the entire religion in with these monsters.

I regret reading the comments on here they made me feel pretty shitty. I'm a secular liberal Jewish girl. I was born in a country with lots of antisemitism and my parents moved us as soon as it was possible when I started experiencing antisemitism in school. So from a young age I grew up in Israel, and there was some discrimination there too based on my country of my birth but I loved living there. It's beautiful, there are many wonderful people from different religions, cultures, countries. Since I was little I always hoped for peace and argued with those who believed security wasn't possible with peace. We moved to the U.S. I am still a supporter of peace and have always hoped for it. Every time I meet someone new from the Middle East I make it a point to mention I'm from Israel so they can see there are peaceful Israelis as well. My best friend growing up was Muslim and I have had wonderful experiences with friends from other middle eastern countries.

Of course there are Israelis who choose security over peace, but that's not all Israelis and not all Jews.

These comments lump all Israelis and all Jews together and vilify people based in the actions of their government. It makes me feel like I can't tell others my country of origin or culture anymore because they will have a negative opinion of me based on their preconceived image.

About 45 minutes into the flight the plane went into a sharp and as yet unexplained descent from it's cruising altitude of 38,000 ft to roughly 6,000 ft. Contact with the plane was lost shortly thereafter.
Debris was scattered over a large mountainous area, with the largest piece being roughly the size of a small car.
The black box has been found, and no links to terrorism have been reported though the cause remains a mystery.

* Unfortunately there is no survivors. The best thing that we can take away from this is that they probably felt no pain. To quote /u/someone110000: ""At 400 knots that's 200 metres per second, the cabin length is about 27 metres, so the plane disintegrated in about 100 milliseconds.

+ Every media talks about him like he is yesterday's shooter so that seems 100% confirmed now. 

+ His identity hasn't been communicated yet (though the police identified him and he seems to be a member of the same organization than the Kouachi brothers). 

+ **at least 5 hostages is rumored** including women and kids, there seems to be 1 wounded too.

EDIT :

+ SHOTS HAPPENNED, **AT LEAST 2 DEATHS (it's just been denied by the Police as of right now (14:48 GMT +1))**, France 2 says. Looks to be confirmed by BFM TV.

EDIT : 

+ A PHOTO OF YESTERDAY'S SHOOTER HAS BEEN PUBLISHED. He was seen in a car yesterday after the shooting with a woman who may be his partner. Unsure if he's the hostage taker of the kosher shop right now, I'm a bit lost to be honest!

EDIT :  

+ [**SEARCH WARRANT FOR 2 PEOPLE BELIEVED TO BE YESTERDAY'S SHOOTERS, MAN AND HIS WIFE/PARTNER**](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B66SsSzIMAAmnLC.jpg)

EDIT : The search warrant is more like the communication of their identity. 

+ It is confirmed that the man called **AMEDY COULIBALY** is the hostage taker of the kosher shop

+ Unsure if the woman's involved today too. She was only seen with him in a car yesterday after the shooting.

EDIT (14:48 PARIS TIME, GMT+1) : 

+ Police source says at least 6 hostages, no deaths confirmed according to Le Monde.

EDIT (14:54) : 

+ The hostage taker came right before the Kosher shop closed, before shabbat, worst timing for the jewish people so this could hint at a somewhat planned attack...

+ Unsure if the woman HAYAT BOUMEDDIENE is with him in the shop, she appears to have been with him when the first shots happened at around 13:00 in front of the supermarket.

EDIT (15:00) : 

+ A woman can be seen from outside laying on the ground, wounded but still alive. 

+ BFM TV said another person is hiding in the cold chamber inside the supermarket right now.

+ The shooter openned fired right when he entered the supermarket so there seems to be casualties but nothing confirmed

EDIT (15:21) : 

Not much more happening right now. 

+ It's unclear if this hostage taker is in contact with the terrorists responsible for the Charlie Hebdo attack right now. 

+ Police aren't in contact with the hostage taker.

+ Another info that I didn't specify is that he has got at least two AK47s as weapons.

EDIT (15:25) : ~~Two unrelated events : Armed man apparently seen near the Place du Trocadero in PARIS, all the perimeter + subway was closed but seems to reopen so looks like a false alarm. Another armed man apparently seen near ROUEN, another city close to Paris where the Kouachi brothers come from. Very little info about this right now, probably bullshit!~~ (confirmed false alarm by the Minister of Interior). 

EDIT (15:51) : 

+ The hostage taker apparently said that he will kill the hostages if the police don't let the 2 brothers responsible for the Charlie Hebdo attack escape.

+ If you don't follow it [here's the thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2ru9y0/charlie_hebdo_hunt_shots_fired_as_police_chase/) about the other hostage situation happenning right now in a print company in Dammartin-en-Goele, North of Paris.

+ Crisis meeting still underway at the Elysee with the president.

EDIT (16:08) : 

+ A fellow inmate of the hostage taker has contacted the police and is now on the spot. He proposed his help to maybe initiate contact with the hostage taker. 

+ His lawyer of 10 years has also arrived. 

+ No confirmed negotiations or contact established.

EDIT (16:37) : 

+ Things seem on standby right now as both hostage situations are linked and police is hesitant to do anything.

+ Nearby schools and buildings are evacuated

+ TV channels have stopped to live stream in order to hide possible infos to the hostage takers.

+ We know nothing about potential contacts between the police and hostage takers. We only suppose that the 2 hostage situations are in contact with eachother.

+ It looks like we're entering a ""waiting phase"" that coud last hours (The last hostage situation in France in 2012 lasted more than 30 hours before the assault was given).

EDIT (16:56) : 

+ **LOTS OF GUNFIRE AND EXPLOSIONS HEARD AT THE OTHER HOSTAGE SITUATION AT DAMMARTIN, MORE NEWS TO COME**

+ No more doubt the assault has been given by the GIGN at Dammartin. 

+ It's been going on for 2-3 minutes and it's now over. Initial shots were followed by a short pause, gunfire again, another pause and a final gunfire session. Smoke rising from the building can also be seen.

+ An emergency helicopter has arrived. The assault is over so the two terrorists are surely dead/captured. No info available right now

EDIT (17:09) : 

+ Waiting for more news about the consequences of the Dammartin assault which is now over

+ We can highly suspect that an assault has simultaneously been given at the Kosher shop Porte de Vincennes, ZERO info about it though.

(17:15) ASSAULT ALSO GIVEN AT THE KOSHER SHOP Porte de Vincenne a couple of minutes after the one at Dammartin.

+ About 50gunfire/explosions heard
+ Around 10 Hostages seen escaping!
+ Policemen from the RAID appear to be wounded
+ ""Ils l'ont eu, ils l'ont eu!"" = ""They got him! They got him"" AMEDY COULIBALY apparently dead/captured. So both assaults are now over.

We're waiting more information as for now regarding potential casualties/wounded

(17:20) **THIS WILL BE THE FINAL EDIT AS ASSAULTS ARE OVER AT BOTH HOSTAGE SITUATIONS**

**FINAL DAMARTIN HOSTAGE SITUATION** **:** 

+ BOTH TERRORISTS DEAD
+ THE HOSTAGE IS SAFE!
+ 1 policeman injured

It seems like the two brothers went out of the building and faced the police in a desperate attempt.

**FINAL KOSHER SHOP SITUATION :**

+ 3 policemen apparently injured
+ about 10 hostages escaped
+ CONFIRMED HOSTAGE TAKER KILLED 
+ rumored one other man dead who seemed to be with the hostage taker

"MongolPerson","","","The guy who get's all the credit from this Bellingcat analysis is Elliot Higgins, I recently watched a video of him even presenting this information. He did the same thing to ""prove"" that Assad was in-fact the one who used chemical weapons.

&gt;In a report assessing possible implications of faulty US intelligence Richard Lloyd, a former UN weapons inspector, and Theodore A. Pistol, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), examined the delivery rocket’s design and calculated possible trajectories based on the rocket’s payload. The authors concluded that sarin gas, “could not possibly have been fired at East Ghouta from the ‘heart’, or from the Eastern edge, of the Syrian government controlled area shown in the intelligence map published by the White House on August 30, 2013.”Even France, one of Assad's most vicious critics, plainly admits that ""samples it had collected suggesting Syrian government forces had used chlorine gas in the country's civil war may not prove to be conclusive.""If Higgins is certain that he has cracked the Da Vinci Code of the Syrian  chemical attacks, he needs to get on the phone with the Associated Press and the United Nations and set the record straight. 

&gt;“It’s clear and unambiguous this munition could not have come from Syrian government-controlled areas as the White House claimed,” Theodore Postol[professor in the Science, Technology, and Global Security Working Group at MIT] told MintPress News. Higgins, Postol said, “has done a very nice job collecting information on a website. As far as his analysis, it’s so lacking any analytical foundation it’s clear he has no idea what he’s talking about.

There was also some criticism, by I think, the very same people of his so called ""proof"" of the Russian Army's strikes into Ukraine based on the ground that both the Rebels and the UA have crossed into Russia multiple times in the conflict. You have to remember that coordination in the Ukrainian Civil War is terrible; in [July the UA actually shelled Russia](http://rt.com/news/172404-russian-donetsk-shelled-victims/), and just recently we found out, according to a British trainer in Ukraine, that the UA is responsible for 60% of their own casualties.[[Original Sunday times article]](http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/world_news/Ukraine/article1522268.ece)

"TheEarthquakeGuy","","","Okay! How are we doing guys? Welcome to another earthquake update! When it rains, it pours!

This is the third event that has happened within a week at this location. At this point, I would not be surprised if we see something bigger. This is not a prediction, just a personal comment.
***

**What you need to know:**

***

* **Magnitude:** Originally a 7.5, but has since been downgraded to a 7.4 event.

* **Depth:** Originally reported at a depth of 10km, this quake has since been deepened to 63.1km, which is good news all around.

* **Intensity of Shaking:** Currently the USGS has this at VIII on the Mercalli scale which means Severe shaking. The did you feel it reports reflect this.

* **Expected Fatalities:** Currently the Pager is Green which means the USGS does not expect many, if any deaths from this quake. Due to the depth, the shaking experienced from the quake would likely have felt dampened due to the amount of earth the waves had to travel through. 



Expected Fatalities | Percentage
-------------------|----------
**0** | **65**
1-10 | 30
10-100 | 4
More than 100 | 1


* **Expected Cost of the Quake:** Again, this is green too, which means the USGS is confident that the quake didn't create too much damage.



Expected Cost (US) | Probability (%)
------------------|---------------
**Under $1m**  | **68**
$1-10m | 30
$10-100m | 2

* **Tsunami:** There is currently no watch in place for the greater Pacific Ocean, although there is a watch for coastlines within 300km of the epicentre. The data used for this commentary reflects the quake occurring at a depth of 10km, so this may now be incorrect.

"TheBestWifesHusband","","","People don't smoke because they think it's good for them.

People smoke because there's so little joy and acheivement in our lives.


So you can save up, and look forward to that holiday, or that nice car or that meal out, you feel fulfilled and satisfied.

That need sto keep up though, the feeling wears off and another purchase (in our world of marketing and consumerism) or ""treat"" is needed to ""get the fix.""

If your entire life is a struggle to get from one payday to the next making sure all the bills are paid and the family is fed with little chance of any significant savings, not growing your wealth, just surviving, there's much less satisfaction in your life and your brain is missing that vital input.

However, what you can do is go to the shop and buy a pack of ciggies. It's not quite the same as genuine satisfaction, but damn does it do a good job of tricking your brain into thinking you've acheived something! You could save those few dollars each day and eventually, after years buy something that satisfies you briefly, only to find you then need to begin the long term cycle again.


Or, at the risk of shortening your depressing, miserable, unsatisfying life, you can get a synthetic sense of satisfaction every couple of hours.


There's a reason many more poor people smoke than rich.

Smoking, despite knowing it's dangers (back when they thought it was good for you was a different situation) is a symptom of a broken society in which people are willing to sacrifice part of their life to trick themselves into feeling like they acheived something in a world where so many are priced out of genuine satisfaction.

We all need something to look forward to. For some that's the next holiday, night out, or exciting purchase, for others it's that feeling of slow suicide and synthetic satisfaction that smoking brings.

Now wait a minute before you take out the pitchforks - yes, I know that U.S. test scores are lower than the rest of the world, and yes, I know that teacher's unions can protect bad teachers from being fired. While they can be a great program for quality educators, tenure programs can be abused. Certainly, U.S. teachers and our education system can (in the aggregate) be doing a better job. All these things are true.

The problem is that the entire fucking system is fucked.

Due to initiatives like NCLB, teacher salaries (and state education budgets!) are often determined in large part by test scores. This causes schools to harp on teachers to teach to standardized tests, which may or may not be legitimate indicators of how much a student has learned. Yes, accountability is important, but standardized tests are an extremely limited way to provide accountability. They also incentivize teachers and administrators to use teaching practices that only really work towards improving test scores while ignoring other important areas such as developing life skills and critical thinking.

Teachers also don't, in many cases, get the support they need to succeed, particularly in the first few years of teaching. In NYC (where I live), the middle school TEACHER burnout rate is HIGHER than the STUDENT dropout rate! How can teachers be successful in environments where they don't get the support (social, work-related, and financial) that they need? Perhaps more importantly, how can students be successful in an environment where the adult role models in their lives are constantly rotating in and out on a conveyor belt of stress?

**Note:** Poverty also plays an enormous role in the failure of many American schools. Kids from impoverished families have less support at home and more dependence on school services, which are usually pretty lacking in low-income districts. I've taught at schools where over 80% of the student population was getting governmental assistance for food, and remember that that is a symptom of the underlying financial struggles that these families go through. It is nigh impossible for kids to do well in school if they don't have heat at night, if their family is struggling to put food on the table, if they are living with their cousins and grandparents because mom and dad are junkies, if they have to be part of a gang in order to walk safely home after school, if they have to take care of their baby brother when Mom is working the late shift. Life sucks for the poor, and fuck you if you honestly think that this country is a meritocracy. It is not, at least not for these people. Some of the noblest, hardest working individuals I have met were my students' parents who work overtime for minimum wage pay to pay the bills. 

In light of all these factors, teaching is hard, and teaching often leads to burnout. The best potential teachers often take other positions because teaching doesn't pay the bills, or at least doesn't really compensate for the often 60+ hour weeks that the best teachers work for 9 months out of the year. In order to get better minds in the profession and really turn things around on a distributed, nation-wide level, teacher salaries need to be more in line with what someone with the same degree could be making in the private sector.",1429243026,"","1429246953",1,234,"worldnews"

[The Israeli Committee Against House Demolitions: Key Facts
](http://www.icahd.org/faq)

&gt;Since 1967, about 27,000 Palestinian homes and other structures (livestock pens and fencing for example) crucial for a family’s livelihood, have been demolished in the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT)

&gt;Throughout the OPT Israel follows a policy of not granting Palestinians building permits. How is this done in a country that claims to be a democracy? Discrimination against Palestinians (and this is true for the Palestinian citizens of Israel as well) is embedded in the dry technicalities of planning, zoning, and administration. Almost the entire West Bank has been declared by Israel “agricultural land,” so that when Palestinians request permission to build on their own properties they are refused.

&gt;The policy of house demolitions, based on a manipulation of planning mechanisms and closely linked to the confiscation of land and the growth of Israeli settlements, is a grave human rights violation against the Palestinian residents of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. This unacceptable policy has caused homelessness and accompanying trauma to thousands of Palestinians, including children; it has brought in its train wounding, and even killing. Amnesty International calls on the Government of Israel to:

&gt;1) End the discriminatory policy of denying building permits and demolishing the houses of Palestinians.

&gt;2) Ensure that all outstanding demolition orders are cancelled and responsibility for planning be restored to the Palestinian communities in each area.

&gt;3) Repeal discriminatory laws without delay.

Some bright soul managed to save a cached link - http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:FeW8L6A-1R4J:www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/anjali-bhushan-co-producer-of-indias-daughter-speaks-out-full-statement/article1-1323775.aspx+&amp;cd=12&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=in

Make no mistake. Rape is a heinous crime. When public anger over the Nirbhaya incident boiled over, the question which confronted our society was how a human being could be driven to commit acts of such depravity. Although, it is said that the moral compass of all criminals is skewed the brutality of this incident made it necessary from a social viewpoint to examine the question of where such behaviour stems from.

The documentary ""India's Daughter"" was therefore conceived to serve a social cause which was unfortunately overshadowed by the self-promoting agenda of my collaborator, Ms. Leslee Udwin. I had fallen out with her by the time that the principle photography of the film was completed and was conveniently excluded from the final edits. Subsequently, her attempt to exploit the subject matter of the documentary in a self-advancing attempt to sensationalize the content has not only brought disrepute to my profession and the country but also resulted in hurting the sentiments of the victims of rape who would invariably be exposed to the film. Granted editorial and journalistic privilege, there is also a particular sensibility that should be a guiding factor as an ethical standard. This is the same sensibility because of which the international media decides against telecasting the brutal immolation of a Jordanian pilot by terrorists. The social message which is the very essence of the film I wanted to make is now lost in the unfortunate controversy which has followed. When one edits several hours of footage, it is this sensibility, suitably deployed, which comes into play. It was this 'sensibility' which I was not able to exercise having been prevented by Ms. Leslee Udwin from participating in the post-assembly review of the film. And it was the lack of exercise of this 'sensibility' on her part, (having denied herself of my input as an Indian woman), in a cynical attempt to capture eyeballs and headlines which has led to the unfortunate controversy which will continue to cast a shadow on her career as a film maker. The story does not end here. Regardless of her lack of sensibilities and judgment, Ms. Udwin knowingly and cynically breached the conditions and undertakings under which the permissions were granted. It was clear right at the outset that the permission to shoot the documentary was conditional upon the viewing of the unedited footage and the final cut by the authorities. Having completed the shooting, Ms. Udwin arrogantly refused to comply. On being shown snippets of the film, the authorities at Tihar Prisons had categorically stated that the comments of the convict were objectionable. The authorities further asked for the full i.e. unedited film to be able to review the same in the proper context. It was reiterated that the film should not be released till it is approved by the prison authorities and the Ministry.

When Ms. Udwin categorically refuted this demand by Tihar Prisons, I was horrified especially since I had repeatedly pleaded with her to comply with all conditions and formalities. Ultimately, in September 2014, I received a letter from Ms. Udwin's lawyers terminating our agreements. One of the grounds of termination was that my warnings had in fact led to the DG (Prisons) sending a legal notice to her company on the grounds of breach of permissions granted by the jail authorities!

Subsequently, when I accidently stumbled upon the fact that plans to release the documentary were afoot, I was both angry and surprised, since I had been informed that the BBC will not air the documentary until the Supreme Court hearings were over. I immediately proceeded to warn the media houses planning to telecast the film, both about the fact that permission to do so had not been received and also the fact that the matter was still sub judice.
That despite my warnings the documentary, which includes an abominable portrayal of the issue, was still aired is a sad reflection of the triumph of the personal ambition of a producer who valued publicity and international recognition over the social agenda of the entire production.",1425875301,"","1425876982",1,126,"worldnews"

The Kurdish army (Peshmerga) were the first ones to act and America aided them with guns and troops and Germany aided also in weapons.  40 countries signed a pact of ""bombing"" ISIS to the ground. 
 
The Iraqi army is cowering behind the Kurdish army and the American army. 
 
WE Kurds have been allies to America long long ago even before sadam hoessein. 

The Iraqi government is giving weapons to iraqi people who want to fight and.get trained by the American ""ADVISORS"" but what do they do? They never come back when they receive their guns and go back home and protect their own ass at home instead of fighting the shit head goat fuckers ISIS. 
 
I find this very offensive towards the Kurds.
 
The Peshmerga are keeping our own region calm and peaceful and always have fought every sources that wanted to attack our region.
 
I'm happy that the Americans are so helpful and always have been. 
The France and Germans have also added the Kurds very well.

First: we still aren't an official country. 

Second:  the Turks would be totally pissed off by this of course. 
 
 Third: I know this is a meeting to convince other countries to help arm the Kurds and aid them in destroying ISIS.
 
And one more thing.
 
We Kurds have been let down more than once by so many allied country's... 
 
America Is the biggest allie of the Kurds.
They aided us in destroying the sadam empire and we were promised independence but nothing happened not even the troops that were promised. 
 
But that didn't stop us and that's just ONE example but the Americans are still and always will be the best friends and allies with us Kurds.

I am at school right now so I don't have the time to find it again however I will outline its major points.

**Thanks to Alfredo_BE for finding the article. http://aeon.co/magazine/philosophy/male-and-female-circumcision-are-equally-wrong/** Please read this if you are looking for a balanced view on the subject which i tried to emulate in this comment.

The article outlined the fact that female genital mutilation (FGM) occurs on a slider of medical cleanliness and severity of procedure. It ranges from out back aboriginal tribes women preforming FGM on their daughters with old spear tips to operations done in hospitals by medical professionals. It also ranges from 'minor' nicking of the clitoral hood (causing it to be permanently exposed) to complete removal of the clitoris and parts of the majoral and/or minoral labia. As well (and this is a major part to bring balance to the conversation) male genital mutilation (MGM) also occurs on such a slider.It ranges in procedure in a similar way (and in similar tribes) from fathers preforming the procedure with an old spear tip to medical professionals in medical practices. It also ranges in severity from the 'minor' Mosaic practice of removing the overhanging bit of foreskin (preserving the majority of its lubricating and overall sexual function) to the complete removal of the foreskin (this is the common western type most people are familiar with) to in some aboriginal tribes slicing the penis open lengthwise along the urethra from the base of the penis to the head (usually resulting in the complete loss of sexual function).

The argument the MGM has medical validity in the form of cleanliness later in life is moot because the same might be said about FGM. The vagina has many folds and moist places that may harbor pathogenic bacteria and the removal of some of these folds may reduce the chance of infection - we will just never know because it is illegal to preform in the western world. However, the risk to the individual's health in either FGM and MGM in their most minor forms is evident with multiple cases of death in infants in the US each year from complications of MGM and the same would be expected of FGM^1. Then ethically the argument would be that without life threatening medical cause there should be no operations done on either gender-ed patient. 

**TL;DR;**Both male and female circumcision should probably be considered genital mutilation (MGM and FGM) because in neither case is the consent of the patient obtained (nor can it be until the patient is an adult eg. 18+).

Both occur in 'innocuous' forms and extreme forms.

The argument that MGM increases cleanliness is moot because it most likely would be the same for FGM.

Both FGM and MGM pose serious health risks to patients (multiple cases per year of infant death due to complications of MGM in the UK alone).

Neither MGM or FGM should be common medical practice because of these risks and absence of medical necessity or patient consent.

The US has been planning to topple the Syrian government since 2001. However, they (like the Saudis) know that Russia is a firm ally of Syria (hence the Russian naval base there).

So the plan involved preventing the Russians from interfering with a US invasion by cutting off their access to the Middle East. They began training and arming the Georgians in 2002, and in 2008 sent them to invade South Ossetia with the express goal being the capture or destruction of the Roki Tunnel.

The Russians foiled that plan.

So now the plan is to use economic incentives to try and bribe the Russians into abandoning Syria (and then Iran - also on the 2001 list of nations to be attacked).

So the US stirred up a civil war in Ukraine, then lied about Russian involvement in it, in order to justify sanctions. Then they asked their terrorist supporting friends in the Middle East to further weaken Russia by driving down the price of oil.

"Mohamed-ElShamy","","","explaining the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attack in the eyes of Islam with verses from the Quran itself. 

please read to the end and judge by yourself .

if Muslims find someone who is cursing their religion and mocking it's holy book , and Quran's words ,how do they react ? 

well , the answer is actually in the Quran itself , the first source of legislation for -true- Muslims , that every Muslim should follow and do by it's words , instead of following weak historical novels that are fabricated , which some like sticking to .

1- Allah says in the Holy Quran : 
( He has revealed to you in the Book that when you hear God's revelations being rejected, or ridiculed, do not sit with them until they engage in some other subject. Otherwise, you would be like them. God will gather the hypocrites and the disbelievers, into Hell, altogether.) 
Women ( Al Nisaa') : Verse 140. 

if a Muslim was sitting with a group of people who are mocking Allah's words in public , which in Islam is a degree that's more offensive than infidelity , and a Muslim is hearing this with his own ears , what should he do ? he should leave them , Allah didn't say to engage with them in defending his Religion , or go get your gun and shoot them to death , no only leave silently .
Allah even says ( until they engage in some other subject ) , that means if they go back to talking about normal life matters , A Muslim can sit back with them , which the verse is dedicated to sophisticated degree of rationality and the separation of the issues of life and religion , and the diversity of ways of relations between humans .

2- Allah Says : 
(And endure patiently what they say, and withdraw from them politely.) 
The Enwrapped ( Al Muzamil ) - Verse 10 .

which means that a Muslim should be patient on their annoyance and their words and cursing , and leave them politely .

3-Allah Says : 
(As for his statement: ""My Lord, these are a people who do not believe.
Pardon them, and say, ""Peace."" They will come to know.) 
Decorations ( Az Zukhruf ) - Verses 88 89 . 

Quran legislated that Forgiving them after they curse and disbelieve and saying "" Peace "" will renounce any kind of violence that might get triggered .
because if swords changed countries , they don't change hearts , and if bullets kills innocents , they don't kill ideas , and Islam depends in the first place on conviction , freedom and testing the mind at the matters of the universe which imprints the magnificence of Allah , and these are things that won't work unless all the people are living safely in peace .

4- Allah Says : 
( If they accuse you of lying, say, ""I have my deeds, and you have your deeds. You are quit of what I do, and I am quit of what you do."")
Jonah ( Yunus ) - Verse 41 .

5- Allah Says : 
(The hypocrites worry lest a chapter may be revealed about them, informing them of what is in their hearts. Say, ""Go on mocking; God will bring out what you fear."")
Repentance ( Al Taubah ) - Verse 64

the verse clearly says that people will mock , but it didn't include any punishment in life by anyone , and didn't order Muhammad ( PBUH ) to punish them , even though they make annoyance and internal disorder because the Prophet had a political position as well as a religious one when he ruled Madina , so he had all the power to do this back then ( this is when this verse was suggested to him by Allah ) , but the truth is the prophet made Madina at this time a place where everyone can criticize anyone even the Prophet himself .
and when someone said : prophet ,why don't you kill them ? , he said : i fear that people will talk about how Muhammad kills his friends .
as Islam reputation was a priority to the Prophet over getting revenge of those who disobey Allah .


The Prophet Muhammad when he founded his State  , he made  human and worldly and political behaviors. Though some of the political and military actions to protect the state is acceptable under it, // but it is not a religious legislation transferred by him //. It is the same to open the door so he said (and if i tell you to do something from my opinion , i'm just a human ) . But the difference is that the Prophet was moving within a state that was calm and balanced and clear for all its policies, and not a random terrorist group that disappears from sight and practices criminality.

But after that settled it and ended the conflict became a prophet puts fixed for life legislation, which represents the origin of the transaction. And expressed by saying, ""Today is a day Compassion is the axiom"". in which he forgives enemies who cursed him and threw dirt on his head and drove him out of his land.

Which is consistent with the message of Islam in the Qur'an (but as a mercy to the worlds )

my whole point here is that criminal acts like these are made by people who don't understand what Islam is , and they are extremists who are hated by every community even the community and religion that people think they represent . 
they misuse the word Jihad ( fight for religion ) , the word actually means that Muslims should fight their sins in order to follow their religion .

"flynavy88","","","This is going to be an interesting few years for Saudi Arabia. King Abdullah was considered a reformer - his brother and predecessor, King Fahd, was a conservative who drove Saudi Arabia far deeper into Wahhabi Islam, in order to appease the clerics. King Abdullah, on the other hand, pushed quietly for a lot of reform for females and tried to reverse a lot of the change the hard-line conservatives in the country did during his predecessor's reign.

There are a LOT of people who don't quite understand the dynamic between the Saudi people and the Saudi government - an absolute monarchy - and why blaming splitting/spurning Saudi Arabia could hurt us a lot more than trying to keep reforms in Saudi Arabia going. The following is a bit of a history lesson, but very relevant to the struggle going on there.

First, we must go back to December 1979, a pivotal month year in modern Islam.

At the end of 1979, Islamists seized the Grand Mosque in Mecca, during the hajj, when millions around the world came for pilgrimage. Hundreds of pilgrims were taken hostage - hundreds died and the ringleaders were beheaded.

That same December, Ayatollah Khomeini officially became the 1st Supreme Leader of Iran. In doing so, his revolution had successfully created a Shia theocracy in Iran, a rival of the Arabs and in particular Saudi Arabia.

Also in December of 1979, the Soviet Union, an atheist state, invaded Afghanistan, an Islamic state.

Why do all of these tie in together?

For one, the Saudi royal family sees themselves as the caretakers of Mecca and Medina - a sort of royal protector of Islam like an Islamic Vatican State. In Iran in 1979, however, there was a new rival in both culture (Arabs vs Persian), religious sect (Sunni vs Shia), and now in government (monarchy vs theocracy). Note that many hardline Islamists do not believe that monarchies can exist in strict Islam - as thus, the Saudi royal family was nothing more than a western, imperialist creation that was ultimately un-Islamic. Furthermore, the agreement they've had with the US for protection (established by FDR during WW2 actually, after he met with the founder of Saudi Arabia, in exchange for logistics bases for the war) was seen as a mortal sin - dealing with an infidel country.

The Saudi family feared that Iran would become a model for the commoners to rise up. The Saudi populace is very conservative and while the Saudi royal family has been famous for its debauchery and westernized living (especially abroad), for the most part the population had been quiet. The Seizure of the Grand Mosque, however, sent a shockwave through the Saudi family - they were not immune. They feared they too would be toppled by an Iranian-style revolution by those who deemed them not Islamic-enough.

As thus, the Saudis embarked on appeasing the hardliner clerics with more strict laws, a tougher moral police, etc. Prior to all this, Saudi Arabia didn't have such strict laws as requiring women to be covered in public, foreign females could drive legally, etc. In exchange, the clerics continued the agreement to legitimize the Saudi family.

Furthermore, the Soviet invasion was an unexpected boon - the Saudi government encouraged young Islamist-leaning males to go fight in holy jihad against the atheist commies and defend Islam in Afghanistan. Also, many Saudi citizens donated money to establish mosques in Pakistan and Afghanistan to preach their ideology and send more fighters against the Soviets. All of this was welcomed by the Saudi government -this relieved a lot of the pressure internally as those fighters and money went away from funding fundamentalists internally.

Where did it all go wrong? Well, fast forward to 1991 and the Gulf War. When Saddam invaded Kuwait, Osama bin Laden - through his family connections - petitioned the Saudi king to let him and his hardened fighters in Afghanistan come and fight the Iraqis.

The Saudi King refused - instead, he requested the US and an international coalition come help. The Saudis volunteered their soil for US bases.

To Osama, this was the last straw - the Saudi King let an infidel army establish bases on the holiest soil in Islam. In turn, Osama declared war not just on the US and the west - but also on the Saudi government and its royal family.

This is why all the talk about removing our support from Saudi Arabia, etc. simply isn't going to happen. Yes, most of the 9/11 hijackers were Saudi citizens - but the Saudi government itself has been under attack by people of those same ideologies. The Saudi government has had to play a balancing act between its western-leaning royal family and the hardliner citizens that make up its population.

This is also why we need the Saudi government to come aboard in cracking down harder on its citizens - after a string of attacks in the 90s and 2000s, they finally came to a realization that they had to do something and it's made a lot of headway in the fight against Islamists.

And that's why Saudi Arabia has supported toppling Gaddafi (because he's a clown) and Assad (because he's an ally of Shia Iran), whether there are Islamist rebels or not -- its radical citizens have a place to go wage jihad away from home  -- but also has supported toppling Morsi (because he's a hardline Islamist) and re-establishing the secular rule of the Egyptian military.

(Yes, I know much of this is very simplified, but it should provide a big picture to what's going on with Saudi Arabia)

"DonTago","","","It is important that rankings like this be taken with a grain of salt. One problem with the Reporters without Borders methodology is that its results are largely based off of surveys/questionnaires handed out to a small number of pre-selected [journalists, NGOs and activists](http://rsf.org/index2014/data/2014_wpfi_methodology.pdf) around the world, gauging their specific individual perceptions of their countries and others press freedoms... that doesn't really seem like the most reliable type of data to use in such a ranking (being that there would be a lot of opportunity for respondents to insert personal bias and exaggerations). As a result, nations like the US and France bounce wildly in the rankings *every year* despite no real changes in the law or policy, but more so because of things like stories put out by Wikileaks or heavily reported or sensationalized events in the mass media. I suspect they bounce in order to generate news coverage on how ""Press Freedom is in decline in the US"" which sends many people, Redditors especially, into a gleeful tizzy.

Admittedly the US, as with most countries in the world, can certainly be working towards creating a freer system of press/media... much still needs to be done in fostering a more open system of journalism not just in the US, but across the world. However, being that we have Freedom of the Press literally written into the First Amendment of our Constitution puts us far above many countries, as far as extending press freedoms. You can say a lot about the US, but when it comes to freedom of speech, the US is probably the most protective country of it... I really don't think there's a whole lot of competition in that arena. I mean, we even lack 'hate speech laws', something very popular in many European country's legal systems now.

Furthermore, there are even parts of the press that are distrustful of the results these sorts of surveys put out. For example, NYT reporter Andrew Rosenthal asks, in an [article here](http://www.imediaethics.org/News/2626/Nyt_criticizes_reporters_without_borders_annual_press_freedom_ranking_of_us_below_hungary_for_occupy_wall_street_arrests.php), why, in the 2011 Press ranking, there was decision to move the United States down 27 spots because of Occupy Wall Street arrests, especially in comparison with countries like Hungary, which was is 40th.  ""*27 places? That seems arbitrary. What is that, one spot for each arrest?*"" he asked, going on to say:

&gt; ""For the 2010 list released in 2011, Reporters Without Borders placed the U.S. at 20, and Hungary at 23. Then a bunch of American cops harassed journalists at Occupy protests, and the Hungarian government tried to do away with the very principle of an independent press. Surely what happened in Hungary is worse than what happened here. Surely this is a more hospitable country for journalists. And yet, going by the Press Freedom Index, it isn’t.""


At the end of the day, these rankings seem weirdly topical and subjective and fail, I feel, to actually capture a real state of the world's press freedoms, meanwhile, I can't help but feel like the RWB might have a slight political axe to grind. If this survey means something, I'm not clear on what it is. More than anything, they seem like it's just proof positive for anyone who already thinks the US press is terrible. So I guess it's got that going for it. Do I think the US should be at the TOP of this list? Definitely not... but do I think we are 49th in the world, below such countries as Malta, Niger, Burkino Faso, El Salvador, Tonga, Chile and Botswana? I very much doubt that.

"az_st","","","First post on Reddit. Hi.

My Father was a farmer his entire life - started when he was a kid back in the 70s. As far as I'm aware, he'd been spraying crops for 20-30 years. Always a very pragmatic, safe guy (farms are really dangerous for a tonne of reasons), he was very well certified and was always extremely kitted out when working with chemicals.

A few years ago (2013), he got sick and was *eventually* diagnosed with Non-Hodgkins (Diffuse Large B-Cell specifically IIRC). I kept asking myself why him, he was physically very fit, never smoked, drank very little, maintained a healthy diet and was only 53 years old. People were surprised to say the least.

I recall being with him when we saw the Hematology doc for the first time - she asked him what he did, and specifically asked if he worked with pesticides. When I looked in to it myself, I found that pesticides were suspected of potentially causing it, but really the causes were pretty much unknown.

It'll be 6 months ago on Tuesday that he passed away, and although I have no hard evidence of any kind, I personally believe that his long-term exposure to such chemicals was a factor in his illness and ultimately his death. I'm not gonna sit here like ""omg must ban all chemicals"", I just think that not understanding the long-term (particularly 20+ years) risks of new technologies is a part of life in a world that has changed so quickly. I've no doubt that in time we'll get better at eliminating the risks of stuff like this.

---

TL;DR... Father worked with pesticides over a long period of time. Died of NHL. Personal opinion is that pesticides was a contributing factor but that it's an inherent risk of new technologies in a world that changes so quickly. Knee-jerk decisions banning beneficial technology on inconclusive research would be nonsensical.

However, implementation of law doesn't exist. It is an incredibly convoluted judicial system that even the police on the streets have no sense of the law and do as they please. This makes it extremely easy for people who use aggression to meet their needs, get away. Add to that, the fact that Indians also don't like to be told they are wrong about anything- clearly seen in Venkaiah Naidu's statement that this is a conspiracy to defame India. People like him don't like to be called out for being ridiculous and will go to any extent in showing aggression to impose their point of view. Education in India prevents questioning and freedom of thought and material is imposed on students. At home, the thought that women are inferior is imposed. There complete lack of sex education is schools. All these factors combine and have a deadly effect on a person's thinking. How does one expect the govt, where majority of these parliamentarians who themselves come from such a system of toil, to accept a free thinking documentary that is highlighting everything that needs to be seriously addressed?

When Singapore was unceremoniously booted from Malaysia, Lee Kuan Yew broke down and cried. When your Prime Minister starts sobbing on national TV, you know you're in trouble. Lee Kuan Yew had neither desired nor coveted exit from the union. Singapore had

* A GDP per capital lower than Jamaica
* No land for agriculture.
* No water resource
* No natural resources beyond a few fisheries.
* A tiny manufacturing capacity.
* No military.
* A tiny population of largely illiterate, uneducated immigrants torn by ethnic tensions.
* A communist insurgency.
* A Indonesia trying to annex it

Malaysia fully expected Singapore to collapse from the above factors and beg for readmission into the federation at a weakened bargaining position. Now look at where we are now compared to Malaysia, South East Asia, or even our former colonial master.

Lee Kuan Yew is the founding father of modern, independent Singapore. His legacy is transforming Singapore in the course of the late 20th century from a poverty-stricken malarial country equivalent of some of the poorest African countries, into a peaceful and economically prosperous state. 

Great respect for him even though I know that he's not morally impeccable. He's success was not built on liberalism or democracy but on enlightened authoritarianism, with a sizable helping of Confucian values. Democracy does exist in Singapore, but it was less pivotal than the fact of the meritocratic corporate state he built. Lee Kuan Yew has substituted the beauty of ideas in favor of what works.

Lee Kuan Yew was an authoritarian no doubt. But his rule led to economic and technological development, to better governance, and to an improved quality of life. Most important, his rule, however imperfect, have overall better positioned Singapore for better democratic reforms later on.

**Edit for reasons:** Look... I've worked InfoTech/InfoSec for over a decade. I am *well* aware the ""Nigerian prince"" is not the end-all, be-all of phishing scams. In my organization, I do not accept ""but it's too *hard* to be careful!"" as an excuse. You check headers and know who sent you an email. You hover your mouse cursor over any links and see if they point to where they purport to send you. You don't interact with unexpected attachments and you *scan* the ones you do decide to download. You don't give your credentials out. You don't use your dog's name with a ""1"" after it for your password. Yes, it's complicated. Yes, it's a pain in the asshole. Don't like it?

"Reilly616","","","Misleading title. This has been in the pipeline for a couple years now, and we already knew we would be holding a referendum since before the shootings. 

**EDIT**: Since this is at the top of the comments I thought I might explain a bit more.

* A Constitutional Convention was established in Ireland at the end of 2012. 

* It was composed of a Chair, 33 members of the Legislature (including 4 from Northern Ireland), and 66 ordinary citizens (randomly selected, but reflecting the age, gender, religious, and social makeup of the State). 

* Its terms of reference stated that it was ""to consider the following matters and to make such recommendations as it sees fit and report to the Houses of the Oireachtas"". The ""following matters"" were all potential amendments to the Constitution, including ""removal of the offence of blasphemy from the Constitution"". The public, and interested bodies, could make submissions for the Convention's consideration.

* December 27, 2012: The [first public submission on the topic of blasphemy was made.](https://www.constitution.ie/Submissions.aspx?cid=80)

* November 3, 2013: The Convention [made its decisions in relation to blasphemy.](https://www.constitution.ie/AttachmentDownload.ashx?mid=b7d9c660-a044-e311-8571-005056a32ee4)

* January 27, 2014: The Convention [officially laid its report on this topic before the Houses of the Oireachtas.](https://www.constitution.ie/AttachmentDownload.ashx?mid=b37871b4-3d87-e311-877e-005056a32ee4)

* October 2, 2014: The Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality [announced in the Dáil that the Government had accepted the main recommendation of the report, namely, that a referendum should be held on removing the requirement for an offence of blasphemy from the Constitution.](http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014100200011?opendocument#N5)

* Over three months later: The Charlie Hebdo attacks took place, and thus entered the already ongoing public discussion on this topic.

**EDIT 2**: A few people are asking why we don't just get on with it and hold the referendum *now*. Well, the fact is, we have a lot of other referenda on the cards too (and some are far more important than this one). Remember, the Irish Constitution cannot be changed in any way without a referendum. 

Also, one doesn't want to hold too many on the same day, as this could lead to confusion in the electorate, and the lead-up to the vote would have to cram in debates on too many separate topics, leading to uninformed voters. 

Finally, we have a thing called voter fatigue. We hold a lot of referenda in Ireland (possibly second only to Switzerland), and the general public can frankly get fed up of having to learn about, consider, and debate disparate (sometimes obscure) topics one after the other. Thus, we like to spread them out so that we don't have more than one or two referendum days per year. 

All of that said, these are the referenda currently on the table:

* Constitutionally require that the State must provide for same sex marriage (to be held in May)

* Reduce the required age for President from 35 to 21 (same day as the above)

* Reduce the general voting age from 18 to 16 (probably later this year)

* Ratification of a Treaty setting up a Unified Patent Court open to EU Member States (probably later this year)

* Establish voting rights for citizens abroad in Presidential elections (no indication as to when)

* Amend a clause (that is now widely viewed as sexist) on the rights of ""women in the home"" (no indication as to when)

* Remove blasphemy (now most likely to take place after the 2016 general election)

"so6p","","","Everything about Zuckerberg and Facebook stinks of corruption and mass control. And how many people are still on Fb? A Billion? Fuck, people are stupid putting out all that personal information and wallowing in the pit of non-stop status update drama. 

Just man the fuck up, and quit it already. Go have real friends. Quitting facebook will initially feel like a divorce or a major heartbreak, but eventually you will have so much free time and such liveliness in your interactions with people. Just try it for 6 months, or until you have gotten over that depression hump which comes after leaving your 'friends'.

I can see how Fb has alienated friends. Nowadays, it's so hard to talk to someone without them wanting to share something they learned from their news-feed, or this false feeling they have that they don't care about you as much because they have 'so many friends'. 

It puts you in a stupor. Sit down and think about the times before fb, where when you met someone or talked to someone, you gave your all because you weren't afraid that they might share what you just talked about with the entire world, or because you knew that it would be a while before you will see them again. It has had a weird subconscious effect on how you think about personal communications.

Now, the one not on your fb profile is not even remembered. Think about it. And when you do meet them, you have this sense that they they don't know what you know and hence they seem a little alien. After all, they didn't 'Like' you inspirational status updates or comment on your pensive thoughts. You think, ""How could such an off-the-grid person even understand what you have been going through?"" It's better for you to hangout in real life with people who *you think* are browsing the same pages and have the same thought process as you.

Fb is the worst thing to happen to culture. There are positives to Fb but they all can be achieved elsewhere - Twitter to spread viral information, And emails/phone-calls to connect with people you consider important. Yet, you deny to see that what addicts you to Fb is this invisible play on your psyche - much like the effect of hard drugs on your nervous system. ",1429467200,"","False",1,4,"worldnews"
