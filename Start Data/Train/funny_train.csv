Only ever ticketed 2 cops. One was super nice and thought I was hilarious. He parked in the fire lane and walked inside to buy a soda so I ticketed his cruiser. When he came to pay he said I was a jerk. I told him I was sorry, but his fire looked like a cruiser . He laughed and paid his fine and hung out with me every day for about 10 min when I did rounds on his side. The other would have strangled me if I wasn't a huge man when I got out of the car. I made him hand ME the money when he paid. ",1428545027,"","False",0,1,"funny"

"orbit222","","","If this was the case, then

&gt; jpeg

would be pronounced ""jayfeg,"" since the 'p' stands for 'photographic' (Joint Photographic Experts Group).

If this was the case, then

&gt; scuba

would be pronounced ""scubba,"" since the 'u' stands for 'underwater' (Self-Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus).

If this was the case, then

&gt; base (as in 'base jumping')

would be pronounced kind of like ""bass,"" like the fish, since the 'a' stands for 'antenna' (Building, Antenna, Span, Earth).

If this was the case, then

&gt; laser

would be pronounced kind of like ""lasser,"" not ""layzer,"" since the 'a' stands for 'amplification' and the 's' stands for 'stimulated' (Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation).

Acronyms are NOT pronounced based on the words that make them up. They're pronounced based on how they appear as words. Now G is a fucked up letter anyway since it takes on some sounds that should belong to J. But 'gif' is pronounced 'jif,' not because of what the 'g' stands for, but because it makes sense and the creators said so. End of story.

Edit: English is a fucked up language, but it's still possible to try to figure out how to pronounce a new word (like 'gif') by looking at examples in the language. English doesn't have many 'rules' that work well since every one has many exceptions, the one I'm about to mention included. But it's still a fair way to attempt a pronunciation.

As a rule (again, with exceptions!! but still right enough of the time to be a rule), the hard G sound (as in 'gap,' 'gut,' 'gopher') happens when a G is followed by an A, O, or U, and a soft G sound (as in 'giraffe' and 'germ') happens when a G is followed by an I or E. 

&gt; This alternation has its origins in a historical palatalization of /ɡ/ which took place in Late Latin, and led to a change in the pronunciation of the sound [ɡ] before the front vowels [e] and [i].[1] Later, other languages not descended from Latin, such as English, inherited this feature as an orthographic convention. [Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_and_soft_G)

The same rule (remember, there are exceptions) applies to C as well (where it can sound like S). These are all hard examples, where the G or C is followed by A, O, or U: comment, country, cant, cute, coiling, curtain, candor, go, goblin, garage, gallon, gun, guppy. These are all soft examples, where the G or C is followed by I or E: cement, cent, century, city, ceiling, circle, gem, germ, gentle, giant, giraffe. 

THE POINT IS, someone seeing the word 'gif' for the first time, knowing how English tends to pronounce words, would assume it's pronounced ""jif"" based on the rule above. THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT'S OBJECTIVELY RIGHT AND YOU WILL GO TO HELL OTHERWISE, but given the English rule and the creator's reasoning behind the pronunciation, there is no reason to pronounce it with a hard G. Unless you're Kevin.

Addiction in any form can cause serious life long consequences. Internet addiction combined with a website like Reddit, that has a never ending supply of new material, can come to completely rule a persons life. Some people start and end their day with the website, for some it's the only comforting thing they have. The problem with addiction is that it is cyclical, and the only cure in the addicts mind is to fuel their addiction. Sometimes people can see beyond their addiction, and wish they could quit, but because you have spent so long habituating yourself with patterns, the task of breaking out of them seems insurmountable. 

The easiest thing to do for addicts is to switch between something that gives them immediate gratification. The internet, gaming, masturbating and sex, drugs or alcohol. When we neglect our fundamental needs for these highs, it can have a disastrous impact on our lives. Introspection, self growth, meditation, helping and sharing with others, are all healthy habits to replace old debilitating ones.

"BBlasdel","","","This is a serious scholarly concept called the criterion of embarrassment. There are a bunch of parts of the New Testament that really don't fit the simplistic version of the Christian narrative, and these are, if anything, parts that we can trust the most. Why would anyone make them up later? In a lot of first and second hand accounts in ancient texts, and particularly the bible, you will often find things that just make too little sense to be fiction - like Jesus yelling at a tree and also the random naked guy running through the Gospel of Mark. Where, during Mark's very condensed run through of the final arrest of Jesus in the garden of Gethsemane, Judas gets with the Jesus kissing, the fuzz shows up, Jesus cops to causing trouble, and then everyone books it, but then something really interesting happens. Some random dude, its not even clear if he was a follower of Jesus, loses his clothes as he tries to flee butt naked. The naked guy adds absolutely nothing to the story, isn't the least bit relevant to the narrative, and if anything detracts from the message Mark is trying to convey; but fuck would that be memorable to an eyewitness. In a time when to be naked was to be dishonored, and to be dishonored was to be less than human in a way that is only really understandable in the abstract in our post-Christian world, that was a pretty big fucking deal. While this would never occur to a fiction writer to put it, an eyewitness talking to the author of Mark would have good reason to consider the tale incomplete without it.

It would be unimaginably awesome if we had contemporary accounts by perfectly disinterested observers to learn about the life of Jesus from, or better yet multiple independent ones, but the contents of the bible really are pretty much the best we've got for figuring out what actually happened. It was formulated by committee in the fifth century, but that committee did a pretty decent job with what they had. Unfortunately, after Josephus' less scketchy of his two brief mentions of Jesus in 90 CE, the earliest undisputed account that we have like this is from Pliny the Younger who, as a governor, writes to the Emperor in 112 CE that there are ""Christians"" about who are meeting illegally and who ""worship Christ as a God,"" all he wants is advice as to how to handle the situation. The next earliest is by Pliny's friend Tacitus in 115 CE in his history of Rome where he mentions that the great fire, supposedly set by Nero, in 64 CE was blamed on ""the Christians."" He seems largely uninterested in the scapegoats, but does mention that they got their name from Christus and that the ""superstition"" spread from Judea to Rome after Pontius Pilate executed Christus under the reign of Tiberius. This is still seventy nine years later. The earlier stuff that we have is indeed pretty terrible by the kinds of standards used to asses modern history, though is importantly a pretty standard level of terrible for the age. The accounts we have are written by true believers, who were not themselves eyewitnesses, who mostly spoke a different language and lived in a different country than the eyewitnesses, they are not free from collaboration (With Mark being used as a source for Matthew and Luke), and they are pretty wildly inconsistent in both details and global understandings. However, there is still a lot we can do to get decent information out of what we've got. Thankfully there is a common thread among an extended community of puzzle solving oriented atheists and theists who FEEL VERY STRONGLY ABOUT RELIGION in a certain way and who have obsessed about these kinds of questions for centuries. Since well before the enlightenment, people have been putting A LOT OF THOUGHT into squeezing just about everything that we possibly can out of the extant records we have. They've found that when assessing the veracity of historical materiel, it is important to keep in mind a few more principles, not all of which are very intuitive,

* First, and intuitively, the earlier the sources that the materiel is found in the better. Twenty years is indeed an awfully long time to be playing a game of telephone, or even for a single person to keep a consistent view. We do have pretty reasonable ways to date even the earliest texts, for example each of the gospels refer to the destruction of Jerusalem (even if it is sometimes as an awfully specific prediction) and so we can reasonably assume that they were each written after that.

* Second, is the criterion of multiple attestation, or the more sources we have that cite or repeat the materiel the better. Materiel found in multiple sources that are independent and contemporary to each other is more likely to be historically accurate. It is pretty intuitive that it would be difficult for someone to make something up and get someone else, somewhere else, to make up a similar thing at the same time. Thus a dozen folks saying something in 75 CE isn't that much worse than someone saying the same thing in 50 CE. For example, both Matthew and Luke talk about how Jesus is from Nazareth but say very different and unique things about how he got there from Bethlehem. Mark also says that Jesus was from Nazareth and so does John, which was written totally independent of the other three Synoptic gospels. Thus, we can pretty solidly trust that Jesus was from Nazareth. However, as we can assume that since both Matthew and Luke were aware of the prophesies that declared that the messiah would be born in Bethlehem, their unique stories of the nativity are probably a result of their common need to explain how Jesus was both born in Bethlehem and from Nazareth. (The traditional Christmas story that most of us get as children is a pretty forced mash-up of the two).  With this in mind, we can also trust that Jesus did indeed come from Nazareth all the more using the criterion of embarrassment. Nazareth was a two horse town in the middle of nowhere that was famous for precisely nothing and recognizable to practically no one, and particularly when the messiah is supposed to come from the birthplace of David, why make that up? Even so, how could you possibly get everyone to agree on it if you did? 

* Third, is my favorite criterion, just making sense. Jesus was an itinerant rabbi in the first century Levant, and any traditions that don't make sense in that context are a lot less reliable. A lot of the later non-canonical Gospels suffer from stuff that is just stupid, but even some of the canonical gospels have some subtle things that don't make sense when you think about them. For example, in John's account of Jesus' famous late night conversation with Nicodemous, Jesus tells him that he must be born again/above. It is a play on words, and kind of a neat one. The words used are gennao (Strong's 1080), which means begotten or born in a formal father oriented sense, and it is modified by anothen (Strong's 509), which can mean either again or from above. The author of John uses anothen for both meanings in different parts of the Gospel and so the effect is obviously intentional, but importantly, neither the Arahmaic nor Hebrew languages that Jesus could have been speaking have an analogous word with both meanings. Whoops.

EDIT: thank you for the gold, it is even more special than usual because a year and a half ago, i got downvoted to hell for saying that Mitt Romney was right and Putin was probably going to invade Ukraine, people rarely get vindication on reddit, but its nice to know that i have been vindicated for having the foresight to realize that the guy who invaded Georgia and had said numerous times he would invade Ukraine or other countries would in fact invade Ukraine

"fpsmoto","","","Notes from an inexperienced Chili taster named Frank, who was visiting Texas from the East Coast:

Recently I was honoured to be selected as an outstanding famous celebrity in Texas, to be a judge at a Chili cook-off, because no one else wanted to do it. Also the original person called in sick at the last moment, and I happened to be standing there at the judge's table asking for directions to the beer wagon when the call came. I was assured by the other two judges (Native Texans) that the chili wouldn't be all that spicy, and besides, they told me that I could have free beer during the tasting. So I accepted.

Here are the scorecards from the event:

CHILI # 1: MIKE'S MANIC MONSTER CHILI

JUDGE ONE: A little to heavy on tomato. Amusing kick.

JUDGE TWO: Nice, smooth tomato flavour. Very mild.

FRANK: Holy Shit, what the hell is this stuff? You could remove dried paint from your driveway with this stuff. I needed two beers to put the flames out. Hope that's the worst one. Those Texans are crazy.

CHILI # 2: ARTHUR'S AFTERBURNER CHILI

JUDGE ONE: Smokey, with a hint of pork. Slight Jalapeno tang.

JUDGE TWO: Exciting BBQ flavour. Needs more peppers to be taken seriously.

FRANK: Keep this out of reach of children! I'm not sure what I am supposed to taste besides pain. I had to wave of two people who wanted to give me the Heimlich manoeuvre. They had to walkie-talkie in three extra beers when they saw the look on my face.

CHILI # 3: FRED'S FAMOUS BURN DOWN THE BARN CHILI

JUDGE ONE: Excellent firehouse chili! Great kick. Needs more beans.

JUDGE TWO: A beanless chili. A bit salty. Good use of red peppers.

FRANK: Call the EPA, I've located a uranium spill. My nose feels like I have been snorting Drano. Everyone knows the routine by now. Barmaid pounded me on the back; now my backbone is in the front part of my chest. I'm getting shit-faced.

CHILI # 4: BUBBA'S BLACK MAGIC

JUDGE ONE: Black Bean chili with almost no spice. Disappointing.

JUDGE TWO: Hint of lime in the black beans. Good side dish for fish or other mild foods. Not much of a chili.

FRANK: I felt something scraping across my tongue, but was unable to taste it. Sally, the barmaid, was standing behind me with fresh refills; that 300 lb bitch is starting to look HOT, just like this nuclear-waste I'm eating.

CHILI # 5: LINDA'S LEGAL LIP REMOVER

JUDGE ONE: Meaty, strong chili. Cayenne peppers freshly ground, adding considerable kick. Very impressive.

JUDGE TWO: Chili using shredded beef; could use more tomato. Must admit the cayenne peppers make a strong statement.

FRANK: My ears are ringing, and I can no linger focus my eyes. I farted and four people behind me needed paramedics. The contestant seemed offended when I told her that her chili had given me brain damage. Sally saved my tongue from bleeding by pouring beer directly from a pitcher onto it. It really pisses me off that the other judges asked me to stop screaming. Freakin' Rednecks! ! !

CHILI # 6: VERA'S VERY VEGETARIAN VARIETY

JUDGE ONE: Thin yet bold vegetarian variety chili. Good balance of spice and peppers.

JUDGE TWO: The best yet. Aggressive use of peppers, onions and garlic.

FRANK: My intestines are now a straight pipe filled with gaseous, sulphuric flames. No one seems inclined to stand behind me except that slut Sally. I need to wipe my ass with a snow cone!

CHILI # 7: SUSAN'S SCREAMING SENSATION CHILI

JUDGE ONE: A mediocre chili with too much reliance on canned peppers.

JUDGE TWO: Ho Hum. Tastes as if the chef literally threw in a can of chili peppers at the last moment. I should note that I am worried about Judge # 3.

FRANK: You could put a #)$^@#*&amp;! Grenade in my mouth, pull the #)$^@#*&amp;! pin, and I wouldn't feel a damn thing. I've lost the sight in one eye, and the world sounds like it is made of rushing water. My shirt is covered with chili, which slid unnoticed out of my X*$(@#^&amp;$ mouth. My pants are full of lava-like shit, to match my X*$(@#^&amp;$ shirt. At least the during the autopsy they'll know what killed me. I've decided to stop breathing, it's too painful. I'm not getting any oxygen anyway. If I need air, I'll just suck it in through the four inch hole in my stomach.

CHILI # 8: HELEN'S MOUNT SAINT CHILI

JUDGE ONE: A perfect ending. This is a nice blend chili, safe for all; not too bold, but spicy enough to declare its existence.

JUDGE TWO: This final entry is a good balanced chili, neither mild now hot. Sorry to see that most of it was lost when Judge # 3 passed out, fell and pulled the chili pot on top of himself. Not sure if he's going to make it. Poor Yank.

So, for example, before a trial the parties could stipulate that the event took place on a certain day; they could stipulate that the defendant owns a black Corolla. These things don't need to be proved by evidence. The parties agree that they're true.

However if I were to sit in the back of the plane and ride on it for a flight, I have to get molested by the TSA. Even if I was the one who taxied the plane to the gate, I would have to get out, leave the secured area, pass through TSA, and get right back on the plane for the flight.

The TSA is absolutely ridiculous.  Last week I got hassled by an agent because I forgot to take off my belt. It took all my effort to not make a remark that I was in an aircraft 1 hour earlier with a fucking knife, and now he is having a stroke over my belt, however that would have been a quick way to be placed in the penalty box for an hour, held without charges, and possibly losing my security clearance because of it being his word against mine.

- The first time she says ""I'm ready"" is just a knee jerk reaction to finally getting her shoes on, she really then has to figure out her jewelry then make a smoothie for the road (even if we're only going to be gone for 20 minutes)...this usually takes 15-20 minutes.

- Second ""I'm ready"" is actually the mirror check. That's when the final primping begins. You know, making sure the hair is right and the ""do I look okay in this top?"" questions begin. This takes about 15 minutes barring any unforeseen wardrobe changes.

- Third ""I'm ready"" is the worst because she actually walks towards the door like it's time to go. Don't be fooled because the great purse swap has actually begun. This is the process of transferring all the crap she might need from one handbag to the next...""do you think I'll need my sunscreen for the movies? I better bring it just in case."" This is the longest 5 minutes of your life because you're standing there with your hand on the door handle ready to roll.

- Fourth ""I'm ready"" usually it means it's time to go...unless she's suddenly remembered she wanted to wear the red shoes instead of the white...then go back to step 2 and repeat the process...ugh.

"BeOFF","","","OK, I'll have a go: most women are taught from an early age that how they look is more important than what they say. For example, a girl who is playing outside with boys might be told ""don't get your good dress dirty"". Complements to girls tend to focus on their appearance, and to boys tend to focus on their behaviour or actions.

This can lead some women to feel anxious that their appearance and bodies are being judged at all times, even by their lover.

You've never seen a little girl ride a roller coaster? We didn't realize until it was too late but we had were about to board the tallest, fastest wooden roller coaster in the world. Ascending the initial incline allows you a spectacular view of your fate: [a 180 feet near vertical drop](http://www.dirkschreurs.com/gallery/roller/ElToro.jpg). Slowly ratcheting up the mountain also affords you the time to ask yourself important questions like ""*Is it safe to build something this big out of wood?""* or *""How do the cars stay connected to a perpendicular track?""*.  It wasn't until after the second drop, a mere 110 feet, that I remembered that I had a daughter. She had melted down into the car. On her face was not the look of fear or horror, shock or awe, but of wide-eyed serenity; the look of a person who has accepted their fate with stoic calm. ",1421272290,"","1421272719",1,159,"funny"
