Why-so-delirious,,,"Bad shit happens to people all the time.

You don't ban guns from TV, stores, newspapers, or anywhere else, because some kids got shot.

You don't ban cigarettes and images of cigarettes because someone's parents died of fucking cancer.

You don't ban knives because someone was stabbed and it might fucking remind them they got stabbed.

I don't give a fuck any more. I'm done with being PC about this shit. Call me a fucking misogynist. Call me a fucking horrible person. Call me whatever you want.

But I honestly fucking believe that if you need to have people removed from your vicinity, because they remind you of something that happened to you, and that's too traumatic to you, *YOU'RE THE FUCKING PROBLEM*.

Grow the fuck up and learn to deal with the real fucking world. Shit happens. Bad shit happens to good every single fucking day. But this is just fucking ridiculous.

Is this supposed to be the new status quo?

Get a teaspoon of cement, put it in a glass of water, and *harden the fuck up*.

If you've got PTSD, then you fucking stay away from whatever is 'triggering' you. It is not the fucking duty of the facility, or the people who run it, to hide away things that personally offend *you*.

And anyone who *does* think that it's the facility's duty to do this shit should be fired immediately.

lazarus870,,,"I used to work three jobs.  Two part time day jobs, and a full-time graveyard shift job.  I would work 8.5 hours overnight, and on my ""lunch break"" I would go to Starbucks, down a drip coffee, go back to finish my shift and and drive to one of my day jobs.  Then I'd go home, sleep a few hours, wake up, have a couple of hours to myself, go back to my night job.  

There came a point in my life where I physically couldn't do it any more.  I was probably worse off driving than the drunks on the road.  I was miserable.  I would want to cry I was so tired.  But I couldn't cry.  And though I was working a lot, I wasn't making much money, nor was I receiving very good benefits.  

People used to admire my work ethic.  They'd see me hauling ass and tell me I was one of the good ones.
I quit.  Once I quit, it was like I never worked a day in my life.  People treated me like an unemployed bum.  Nevermind that I hauled ass and worked while everybody slept then went to *another* job.  
Nevermind that I had to deal with a job that found a way to fuck me out of overtime by scheduling the week in a way where I could work 6 days straight and have the days placed on different weeks.  
Once I was unemployed, I was nothing in society's eyes.  I was a leech.  
I quit so I wasn't eligible for any benefits.  I lost my health benefits but gained my sleep, sanity and my actual health.  
So I had my savings to fall back on.  

My point after this rant is, people act like those receiving benefits are all deadbeats.  I wish I could quality for them, but sadly I couldn't.  
Most people on benefits have worked, but through some circumstances, need some help.  Many of them **still** work but aren't making enough money to make ends meet.  
Once you're in need of a hand, people act like you've never contributed to society.

You know what makes people feel human?  A little money spent on themselves.  A little bit of a treat. Even a movie ticket to just forget your situation is nice.  A workout is nice.  A swim would be wonderful.  They're not living a wonderful life.  Unemployment fucking sucks, and underemployment fucking sucks.  But sometimes you have to feel like you're not losing your mind with the absolute bare minimum.  

I need to be able to spend a bit on myself to feel like a human being again.  And not extravagance either.  When I was working my ass off at night I remember hearing about people who were getting benefits and buying new iPhone or showing pictures of their toes soaking in the sun in Cancun.  **That** pisses me right off.  If you wanna crack down on people crack down on people who abuse the system to that degree.  But the guy who just wants to see a movie to forget the 20 online job applications he just filled out?  Come on...

I also think people severely underestimate how much of a handout they get when they look down on welfare recipients.  Companies get tax breaks.  Politicians get part of their salary from people making very little money.  The list goes on.

For every case like in this story, there is probably a similar story with a different outcome. Let you tell you mine. Last March, right after having knee replacement surgery, in fact it was the day after I got the staples out, I was out walking and tripped on something causing me to land right on the knee I just had replaced. Ripped it open real good and it started swelling up.. When I called the doc they told me to come into the ER, which for me is about a 40 minute drive.  Had someone drive me but by the time I got there the knee had really swelled up and it locked up.. couldn't move the leg nohow for nothing. So the person who drove me went into the ER and asked for a wheelchair. Instead of just the wheelchair, two orderlies, a nurse and a VA police officer came out and helped me get out of the car, put me in the wheelchair and then wheeled me right into triage.    

I'm sure at VA hospitals across the country there are thousands of instances of an employee going above and beyond every day. It's just that we never hear about those. We only hear the stories about when a patient encounters that one asshole whose actions defies all logic, reasoning and compassion.

But seriously, every time there's an attack like this Muslims all over the world condemn it but the media only listens to the handful of radicals and then says that Muslims need to stand up against terrorism. Muslims are the ones fighting ISIS right now and the ones being slaughtered in areas that ISIS controls. Muslims are the ones being killed by Al Qaeda because they fight for education, and Muslim countries are the ones taking in incredible numbers of refugees from what's becoming the greatest refugee crisis in decades.

[csb] Way back in the dark ages when we was still sending around our packets in a token ring network, ol' 'Whack was in the Marine Corps.  4066, techie geek extraordinaire.  This was back before the world went nuts again.

Anyways, we were running on a track once for PT.  A public area and not on base, so there's civs also there.  Queue fat guy.  There was one man there, easily  over five hundred pounds, shuffling on the track, and obviously in all sorts of agony.  A couple of people there made a couple mean jokes and what have you.  The standard douche fare.

When he was done, I went over there to shake his hand.  I got the crosswise look, because he thought at first, I imagine, that I was being sarcastic, or a jerk, or both.  But I meant it.  I said, ""Sir, I respect the hell out of that run.  You wasn't fast, and you wasn't strong, and you definitely wasn't pretty doing it, but you put out way more effort than the other Marines here who did that who didn't even break a sweat.  I respect that.  Anyone gives you any trouble, come see me.""

Saw the same dude a year later.  Probably down to 300.  Runnin' like a champ.

So what I'm saying, is, if you're heavy, or even got things flapping all over when you run, do it anyway!  There's jerks out there, but there's a lot of us who aren't, and we'll cheer you on.  [/csb]

OldFatGod,,,"Call this a Tulsa History Lesson and Rant:

Tulsa has been a good ol' White boys club for almost 100 years and this story is nothing new for it, the timing however, of this story is going to bring Tulsa's ugly, dirty history to light. There are many types of ""Law Enforcement"" working in Tulsa County and they are all on the take. Black people are their favorite and easiest targets. Besides the Tulsa Police and the Sheriff's department, there is also private security firms with wide ranging powers. A private security force is contracted by the mayor's office directly. A few years ago, the mayor put down the local Occupy Tulsa group with this force so the local TPD union would have to worry about protecting its officers from public fallout. They came out with a force of over 150 officers in full riot gear against a group of 6 people sitting on grass after midnight and a group of 15-20 people on the sidewalk. They filled the faces of passive, absolutely non threatening people with pepper spray in order to carry them to one of over a dozen 'law enforcement' vans waiting. They must have wasted hundreds of thousands of dollars on that one night.... but they told the media that only about a dozen ""TPD officers"" carried out arrests. BULLSHIT! 

Look up Tulsa's Race Riot.... many people still think the ""Race Riots"" were about a bunch of black people rioting, but NO.... the Tulsa Race Riots were a bunch of white people burning down the most successful and most prosperous enclaves of the post-slavery era for black people. It was LITERALLY called ""Black Wall Street"" when they burned it down. Dumb ass white people hate it when black people are successful and gawd forbid make more money than them. So they put snipers in the tall buildings downtown to shoot every black person in sight, murdered thousands and buried them in mass graves that still surround the east side of downtown (They built a freeway loop over most of them to hide them... more recently, they built a baseball stadium to hide others), and they imprisoned hundreds of others on the County Fair Grounds' Armory site for weeks afterwards. 

Tulsa has remained effectively segregated to this day. ""North Tulsa"" is treated like ""East St. Louis"" by the local government... 'let's just wait till all of 'those people' are gone, THEN we'll develop it.' They treat it like the Israelis treat the Palestinians.... interestingly, the police chief actually worked for several years as a ""consultant"" with the IDF? If a house in North Tulsa is behind on any taxes, in violation of any ordinances, or even has a broken window it can be red-tagged... once it has that red-tag, it can be bulldozed by the first private developer to show up with a bulldozer. Then the developer gets the property and pays minimal taxes on it since it is without a structure. Nice, cozy relationship going on there. Oh, not to mention the rash of ""arsons"" that happen in Tulsa and especially in North Tulsa. ""Need to get rid of about 12 families of black people? No Problem!"" There were several CITY BLOCKS of homes burned up by the 'mysterious and elusive arsonists' that just happened to be all round the City Surplus yards.... within days of the burned rubble being cleared, the ENTIRE area was fenced in by 8' chain-link topped with barbed-wire with ""City of Tulsa"" signs. No one ever found the arsonists and no one ever questioned the city's acquisition of the land.

When they struck oil in Glenpool, a suburb of Tulsa, the area became known as ""Mid-Continent Capital"" because of how important the oil was for the World War I. So when  the IWW started organizing the oil field workers, the obscene profits of the grandfathers of the men who still run Tulsa were threatened. . The union members were round up by the local police, tried by a local judge, and officially kicked out of the county. While the group was being driven to edge of the county, a 'Klan style' group calling themselves ""The Knights of Liberty"" stopped the police cars and took the men from the police, hung some of them, and tarred and feathered the rest of them. Tulsa is fiercely anti-union and likes its workers poor, dumb, and borrowing.

The ""Knights of Liberty"" were made up of the white, wealthy business owners of Tulsa and their thugs to keep the black people and so-called ""loafers"" in line.

vaguerant100,,,"It's easy to say such a thing, but Americans as a whole (regardless of religious affiliation) always stop short of meaningful action. They think a couple more solar panels or windmills can stop us from ravaging the Earth, when in reality it's capitalism's psychotic obsession with growth at the expense of sustainability and our hunger for cheap consumer products that we don't need which is the actual root cause of environmental destruction. 

We've built an entire civilization off of consuming things in excess in the name of profit and personal ease. That's our problem. Unless you're challenging that system you're just talking out your ass. 

I reread the New Testament recently. The thing that amazes me about it is how most modern Christians live in a way that is almost totally opposite of what Christ said. I'm not talking about any of that typical reddit atheist shit about gay marriage or anything (that's a separate issue here). I mean the actual lifestyle that American christians lead. Big cars, big houses, a thousand and one different electronic devices, cheap plastic non-biodegradable everything...

Just look at megachurches. Hell, some of them have gift shops. Or the general American tendency to treat property as sacrosanct, even though one of Jesus's most famous moments was smashing up a bunch of small business owners' shit. In fact the guy had an open contempt for private property, excess wealth, and state institutions. 

Now how many American Christians seriously challenge any of those things? Hell, watching Joel Osteen the impression I get is that god is supposed to be some sort of corporate CEO. 

""God wants you to succeed!""

Fuck that, no he doesn't. He thinks your success is immoral bullshit, Osteen! The bible is 90% Jewish nationalism and 10% railing against rich people. Nowhere in this thing is there anything remotely resembling a defense of American materialism

Anyway, what I'm getting at with this rant is that American capitalist culture is never going to be environmentally sound, and it doesn't even jive with the bible. Yet that doesn't stop Christians from worshiping the ground it walks on (generally, anyway. I'm not going to speak for billions of people). 

Everybody I know, Christian or not, makes claims about caring for the environment or worrying about global warming and shit, but the moment you point out that our very way of life is what's causing all that destruction people get indignant and start justifying the very people laying waste to the Earth.

You've invariably heard about Google paying a low tax bill, say by merging and having assets in the UK or Ireland.  That's at the corporate level and not individuals.  Cap gains don't count until a year later for those talking about stock dividends; otherwise it's income.  Like it or not there is a very reasonable debate about why cap gains should be lower than income and why we should use a gentle hand when it comes to double taxation.

Where it gets weird are the one dollar CEO's like Steve Jobs who get taxed low due to options and back dating scandals.  But that's the .001 percent.

Druidshift,,,"A constant complaint I hear amongst the #blacklivesmatter protesters is that there is a system of oppression in America against Black people.  That if you go into any black neighborhood, the schools are poorer, there are less consumer options, less healthy food choices, more drugs and more violence. 

On this point, I agree with the #blacklivesmatter group.  You often do find these elements in black neighborhoods.  

Where I DISAGREE with them is that they say the reason for all of the above is because White people go out of their way to keep black communities this way.  Because of racism.  Whites make sure businesses don't invest in black communities because we want to keep the systematic oppression going.

I think the real reason is, it's because businesses don't WANT to invest in black communities.  Even black owned businesses don't want to open in black neighborhoods.  Because the #blacklivesmatter ""protesters"" burn shit down and destroy everything.  And then say that they are helping ""the cause"".  When you stand in roads preventing people from commuting and businesses from functioning.  When you burst into eateries screaming bloody murder yelling how ""brunch is the white mans new Jim Crow!"".  When you burn down businesses and riot and loot in your own neighborhoods whenever a grand jury doesn't go your way......THAT'S why black neighborhoods are so often shitty.  

How many fires broke out in the Castro when gay people lost the Prop 8 vote in California?  How many glitter queens roller bladed up and down Christopher Street burning down gay owned businesses because they were ""mad as hell and not going to take the oppression anymore!""?

It has nothing to do with White people keeping blacks down.  Blacks are keeping blacks down.  And don't pretend that the #blacklivesmatter protesters and the rioters/looters are separate people.  They are not.

http://patch.com/new-hampshire/windham/nearby-news-pumpkin-festival-rioters-arrested-teacher-administrative-leave-man-threatens-blow-dunkin

The #blacklivesmatter group keeps on protesting brunches, and pumpkin festivals, and symphonies and insist that they are doing these things because WHITE people are keeping them down in order to retain a system of oppression.  And then when a business in their neighborhood closes down because they have burnt it to the ground, not once do they stop and go ""Hmm....maybe we need some self reflection?  Maybe we need to see how we are hurting our cause?""  No, they just compare themselves to MLK and talk about how white people telepathically made the black rioters burn down the businesses...you know..because of oppression.

I will agree that many black neighborhoods and schools are inferior and suffer from crime and just aren't as nice as white neighborhoods.  But when a neighborhood is shit, it's because the people LIVING in that neighborhood keep it shit.

IF the schools are bad in black communities, GET PARENT FUCKING INVOLVED IN YOUR SCHOOLS.  Stop crying about how it's impossible to improve your own schools because it's too hard as working single parents to attend PTA meetings.  That's not the white mans fault.  Find TIME to improve YOUR children's schools.  If business owners won't open shops in your neighborhoods, maybe try to SUPPORT your local businesses?  You know, instead of setting them on fire every 2 months or so.  If you want your neighborhoods to improve, if you want cops to stop being jumpy because entering black neighborhoods is like entering a warzone, then MAKE your neighborhoods better.  

Or keep on interrupting brunches, and burning BBQ places down, and standing in highways.  Because the one blazing neon sign that tells you people are still children and not adults is when they go ""The problem is everyone else!  I'm PERFECT!""  Standing in traffic and burning down businesses really will change your neighborhoods /s

I am generally liberal in my philosophy and politics.  I always have voted for Democrats.  I generally sympathize with social causes, trying to effect change.  But #occupywallstreet and #blacklivesmatter is about to turn me into a conservative pretty damn fast.  What a bunch of whiny little shits.  They cause riots, turn people off from their causes, and then complain that the problem isn't them, it's racism!  How are they any different from the Westboro Baptist Church?  (Who by the way, ALSO compares their funeral protests to MLK).

I consider vaccinations as nothing more than an extension of human invention.

I don't believe technological advancements should ever be considered a necessity for human survival then forced on the public.

*edit* -  I'm not looking to further political party vitriol here, and I don't care to engage in any more discussion over how terrible X political party is in this thread.  There are other threads and subreddits where that makes more sense, rather than being pointlessly injected. As I said later:


&gt; The top up-voted and gilded comment is a made-up position, of everyone of X party opposing something, all because of something someone from Y party said. That hasn't happened, it contributes nothing else than a feel-good circlejerk. Closest thing seems to be Chris Christie, which was taken out-of-context anyway.

As a gay guy, I would lay down my life defending the right of the Westboro Church to call me a f*ggot. Because the same free speech laws that allow them to hate, are the free speech laws that gave protection to the civil rights movement, and the gay rights movement. Free speech laws are not meant to protect popular popular opinions.

I don't support the Westboro Baptists just because freeeedom. I went to an anti-westboro rally once and was immediately brought to tears, not because the Westboro Baptists hurt my feelings, but because 500 people from my conservative suburban community showed up, held hands and formed a human chain to block them in the name of love. Public outcry is *the* most powerful catalyst for change. And in that respect, the Westboro Baptists have done more to advance the cause of gay rights than all other American HR groups combined.

777lover,,,"This right here! I'm a public defender and part of my misdemeanor work is defending dads who are being charged with contempt of court for ""disobeying"" a court order. 

It is one of the worst cycles I've seen in the criminal justice system. In family court these dads are usually not represented (because they can't afford an attorney) and are slapped with a ridiculous monthly child support bill. Of course they can't afford the payments so they get charged with contempt and failure to provide (California Penal Code 166 and 270, respectively). Then they go to jail and lose their job. Then the court orders them to submit ""seek work"" forms which require them to submit proof to the Dept of Child Support Services (DCSS) that they've applied to at least 5 jobs every two weeks.  If they don't do that then they face more jail time. The system is so stacked against obligors- men and women alike (I regularly represent both sexes, however I do represent more men than women). Then the ""arrears"" add up with interest accumulating every month. It is not at all uncommon for my clients to owe over $100k to DCSS for their unpaid support. 

Here's what you should do if you are trapped in this system in California: 

(1) always pay whatever you can against your monthly child support. Even paying $1 shows good faith to the court that you are trying to make good on the court's order. 

(2) if you don't have a job and are ordered to submit seek work reports, just apply to any job in your area (even if it's fast food). This also goes a long way with the court. 

(3) do NOT give your children money outside of child support, especially if you can't afford to make the monthly payments. Any money you give them should go through the DCSS system so there is proof of the money you gave them. 

(4) always ask for a public defender to help you out on your case. Too often I see obligors refuse my assistance because they think they can do it on their own. Just face it: unless you are an attorney just assume I know more than you do about your options. It's the same thing as me asking for your help when I need electrical work done on my house. When your freedom is at risk always get a lawyer. 

(5) don't automatically take a plea deal -  even if there is no jail time involved. Your plea deal will contain a promise to pay your child support (with arrears and interest added each month). If you cannot pay this then your probation will be violated and you will surely do jail time. Always put the case over to give yourself opportunities to pay. I regularly see my clients earn dismissals for doing just this.

(6) remember, in California, at least, a finding of contempt requires the judge to find that you willfully disobeyed the court's orders. So if you absolutely cannot pay, and have a good reason or reasons for not paying, make the DA take the case to trial. I've won many trials based solely on the willfulness requirement. 

(7) Important EDIT- always try and modify your support order so that it reflects your current income. If you are making less money your child support needs to be modified! So many of my clients fail to do this and end up in trouble. Because they can no longer afford their support they just stop paying altogether. 

To all of you sending me angry messages:  please take notice that I in no way am advising people to not pay their support. I'm trying to help those who are caught up in a bad situation (as outlined in OP's article).",1429559120,,1429591801,1,906,news,False,False,634,0,Afternoon,61+,0,20,"{u'probability': {u'neg': 0.4531524302108829, u'neutral': 0.8287619510770442, u'pos': 0.5468475697891171}, u'label': u'neutral'}",0.453152430211,0.546847569789,0.828761951077,neutral,"{u'tone_categories': [{u'category_id': u'emotion_tone', u'tones': [{u'tone_name': u'Anger', u'score': 0.522434, u'tone_id': u'anger'}, {u'tone_name': u'Disgust', u'score': 0.46149, u'tone_id': u'disgust'}, {u'tone_name': u'Fear', u'score': 0.089529, u'tone_id': u'fear'}, {u'tone_name': u'Joy', u'score': 0.1489, u'tone_id': u'joy'}, {u'tone_name': u'Sadness', u'score': 0.542956, u'tone_id': u'sadness'}], u'category_name': u'Emotion Tone'}, {u'category_id': u'language_tone', u'tones': [{u'tone_name': u'Analytical', u'score': 0.677232, u'tone_id': u'analytical'}, {u'tone_name': u'Confident', u'score': 0.17692, u'tone_id': u'confident'}, {u'tone_name': u'Tentative', u'score': 0.0, u'tone_id': u'tentative'}], u'category_name': u'Language Tone'}, {u'category_id': u'social_tone', u'tones': [{u'tone_name': u'Openness', u'score': 0.29603, u'tone_id': u'openness_big5'}, {u'tone_name': u'Conscientiousness', u'score': 0.865875, u'tone_id': u'conscientiousness_big5'}, {u'tone_name': u'Extraversion', u'score': 0.700577, u'tone_id': u'extraversion_big5'}, {u'tone_name': u'Agreeableness', u'score': 0.730029, u'tone_id': u'agreeableness_big5'}, {u'tone_name': u'Emotional Range', u'score': 0.823645, u'tone_id': u'emotional_range_big5'}], u'category_name': u'Social Tone'}]}",0.522434,0.46149,0.089529,0.1489,0.542956,0.677232,0.17692,0.0,0.29603,0.865875,0.700577,0.730029,0.823645

-The man claimed the CIA was passing him over for career progression out of racism and he made a complaint

-He tried to sue the CIA twice and lost

-The CIA did not renew his contract

-After all this he spilled secrets about a plan to pass bogus nuclear weapons blue prints to the Iranians in hopes it would occupy their time for many years and lead to no where. The would be operation called for a CIA turned asset (A Russian scientist) to provide nuclear weapons blueprints to the Iranians. The US predicted these blueprints would hinder the Iranians for years.

So basically he leaked secrets out of spite for the CIA allegedly being racist to him, not renewing his contract and not promoting him. No one was getting killed and no drone strikes on innocent people were being planned. This was just some guy with a grudge who leaked classified information for his own agenda.

madsmith,,,"This guy may very well be the giant f&amp;ck3r that he seems to be but keep in mind that he has not been found guilty.  It may be that he is in fact innocent and is only pleading guilty to a lesser issue because he does not believe he can win a jury trial. Perhaps he's being manipulated by a very sympathetic 19yr old who's pissed that they were arrested.

I'm thinking of the story aired on [This American Life](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/02/This-american-life-cops-see-it-differently/385874/) of Earl Sampson who was arrested 63 times (mostly for trespassing by showing up for work in a convenience store) and always plead guilty because he didn't think anyone would believe him (and he is partially mentally disabled).

Pleading guilty to something does not imply that you in fact did the thing.  More over, pleading guilty to a lesser charge does not imply you are guilty of a greater charge.

Then again, it's hard to not think that the prosecutor will by default side with a cop and I'm likely to believe that he did what he was accused of because he's pleading.  But what I believe is not necessarily the truth.

And so on.) people also have to realize these positions are 4-6 years positions with little to no restriction on re elections and when people don't care about these people you give power to another part of government and the checks and balances system doesn't work. Voting for a great president and not a decent senators just brings everyone back to square one.

We need to change our behavior with respect to water and our understanding of how much water we actually have available to us, not only in California, but around the country.”

While I respect a academic point of view, and agree that in general we do as a society need to rethink the way we use water, it is important to notate the *fact* that 80% of the water usage in california is from *agricultural usage*.

Even if every citizzen stopped using water entirely, becoming dust , it would only dent 20% of the water's usage.

So that begs the question: How efficient can we get our water usage for every day life, and how largely would that impact overall water usage and reserve levels? 

Even at a 50% reduction for everyone, we are still looking at only a 5% change to overall water usage.

This issue is a national one, since california supplies 30% of agriculture to the united states, and we should perhaps look at how the business model effects the greater whole, and what the net benefits and negative impacts are to society.

My humble suggestion is that, unlike his British or Canadian counterpart, the US officer must act on the high likelihood that the person he is approaching is armed with a firearm and possibly faced the likelihood that, if apprehended with even small quantity of illegal substances would go to prison. Now, if I was in that situation, I would be very, very cautious.

I would be very happy to hear the opinions of others, especially police, on this hypothesis.

&gt;Porter asserts that a defendant who does something intentionally could not have also been reckless, and thus should not be convicted of anything at all. But this distinction between recklessness and intent “really doesn’t make any sense at all,” University of Illinois law professor Marareth Etienne told ThinkProgress. At least under the national criminal law standard known as the Model Penal Code that all first-year law students are taught in Criminal Law 101, a higher state of mind such as intent “always proves a lower level,” in this case, recklessness.

&gt;Recklessness “just means that you were aware of a risk and you didn’t take the proper precaution. So clearly if you shoot at somebody and you shot in a crowd you’re aware of a risk that they’re gonna die,” Etienne said.

&gt;“This is incredible!” University of Illinois Director of Trial Advocacy J. Steven Beckett said. “It appears to me that a lesser included offense was ignored because the proof of the greater offense was obvious. This put prosecutorial decision-making under scrutiny beyond anything imaginable.” In other words, the prosecutors were punished for not having charged Servin with a more severe crime. Even more remarkable, Porter came to this decision in what is known as a “directed verdict” before he even heard the defense’s arguments.

&gt;“When a motion for directed verdict is made by the defense, the evidence must be considered in the light most favorable to the prosecution,” Beckett points out. “What the judge did here appears to be just the opposite!”

and of course this is a great point:

&gt;Etienne points out several adverse consequences that would result if Porter’s understanding of the law prevailed. **A defendant charged with involuntary manslaughter could get on the stand and make the very argument Porter now makes: I am not guilty of a crime of recklessness because I did this on purpose. “And by the way my trial has started so double jeopardy. You can’t go back and charge me with an intentional killing.”**",1429640619,,False,1,746,news,True,False,339,0,Afternoon,61+,0,0,"{u'probability': {u'neg': 0.4532844247757203, u'neutral': 0.19935414801350373, u'pos': 0.5467155752242797}, u'label': u'pos'}",0.453284424776,0.546715575224,0.199354148014,pos,"{u'tone_categories': [{u'category_id': u'emotion_tone', u'tones': [{u'tone_name': u'Anger', u'score': 0.17923, u'tone_id': u'anger'}, {u'tone_name': u'Disgust', u'score': 0.231192, u'tone_id': u'disgust'}, {u'tone_name': u'Fear', u'score': 0.460544, u'tone_id': u'fear'}, {u'tone_name': u'Joy', u'score': 0.12893, u'tone_id': u'joy'}, {u'tone_name': u'Sadness', u'score': 0.487192, u'tone_id': u'sadness'}], u'category_name': u'Emotion Tone'}, {u'category_id': u'language_tone', u'tones': [{u'tone_name': u'Analytical', u'score': 0.875392, u'tone_id': u'analytical'}, {u'tone_name': u'Confident', u'score': 0.554113, u'tone_id': u'confident'}, {u'tone_name': u'Tentative', u'score': 0.0, u'tone_id': u'tentative'}], u'category_name': u'Language Tone'}, {u'category_id': u'social_tone', u'tones': [{u'tone_name': u'Openness', u'score': 0.965936, u'tone_id': u'openness_big5'}, {u'tone_name': u'Conscientiousness', u'score': 0.647895, u'tone_id': u'conscientiousness_big5'}, {u'tone_name': u'Extraversion', u'score': 0.773672, u'tone_id': u'extraversion_big5'}, {u'tone_name': u'Agreeableness', u'score': 0.558071, u'tone_id': u'agreeableness_big5'}, {u'tone_name': u'Emotional Range', u'score': 0.721665, u'tone_id': u'emotional_range_big5'}], u'category_name': u'Social Tone'}]}",0.17923,0.231192,0.460544,0.12893,0.487192,0.875392,0.554113,0.0,0.965936,0.647895,0.773672,0.558071,0.721665

rayfound,,,"So many of the top comments don't seem to understand how money works. 

Money is fungible. That means it is useless to try and manage where a particular dollar goes, because if not this dollar, a different one will be used. 

Most recipients of aid are not going to use their Government Aid for food/shelter, then just save the rest of their money... no, they are going to spend whatever they have. Maybe the Aid lets them get a little nicer place, maybe it means they can pay for a cell phone, etc... 


But, at the end of the day, foodstamps are the single most cost-effective economic stimulus we have. 

&gt;[For every dollar spent on that program $1.73 is generated throughout the economy, he said.
""If someone who is literally living paycheck to paycheck gets an extra dollar, it's very likely that they will spend that dollar immediately on whatever they need - groceries, to pay the telephone bill, to pay the electric bill,"" he said.](http://money.cnn.com/2008/01/29/news/economy/stimulus_analysis/)

So yes, some people are going to use aid money to do things that we might feel that morally ""The taxpayer should not pay for"". But you know what? Fuck that. We are giving assistance because people need help, and we are not just trying to make poor people into vegetables who just sleep, shit, and eat all day. We want people out in the world, enjoying what the market has to offer and giving them things to strive for. 

And spending money. Because when they spend money, it means some other person might not need to be on Government Aid. 


But no... let's not  look at what is EFFECTIVE (you know, evidence and all that) and let's look at how things make us FEEL. Because this is America, and we have no greater love than the love of ideology and dogma. 



Edit: FWIW - I understand that this was not specifically about foodstamps. I've edited it to generic ""Aid"" in a few locations, left foodstamps in when talking about the study that I linked. 

You can take that or leave it, because you can call aid whatever you want, you can restrict it however you want, and it is all just MONEY, because money is fungible.

nojob4acowboy,,,"It's sad to say but the FlDOC has been a dismal nightmare for much longer than Scott's watch. Florida has been running the prison system like a business for years, the spending goes through a convoluted and highly corrupt process where former prison officials start businesses that sell or provide goods or services to the system, they make millions above and below the table from ridiculous and shoddy equipment or services, money is shoveled away on useless equipment.  Wardens are incentivized to eliminate positions and overtime and mandate shift supervisors always run at critical staffing levels (if anyone calls in, your holding OT) some facilities run below what is allowed by doc policy and state statute, shift rosters and security rosters have ""ghosted"" officers that aren't actually there. Staff generally don't have basic equipment like radios, gate keys, chemical agents or handcuffs, what can they really do to defend themselves?

These tax breaks were given since 2008, not all at once or in the next years budget as some people seem to think. 

Louisiana actually has much lower tuition then many ""liberal"" states like Massachusetts and Connecticut, yet I don't hear anyone blasting the governors of those states. 

The tax break in question is 10 years of no property taxes if you make a capital investment. The thinking is that will make business's want to relocate and invest in the state, which will help the overall economy. They will earn income in the state, which is taxed, hire people, who get taxed, and so forth, so you can't just look at the forgone property taxes, you have to look at the overall economic impact. Would Exxon have invested as much if they didn't get the tax break? Hard to tell and this article doesn't explain.

VoightKampffTest,,,"Something on this scale wasn't a spur of the moment thing; the protestors have to have been socking away supplies and planning defenses for weeks if not months. The main limiting factor for the besieged is usually water, if policies haven't changed since I tactically GTFO of that blighted industry the SOP is to cut off water and electricity to the overrun buildings. 

Cafeteria meals have been deliberately tweaked to primarily consist of things that don't keep long without refrigeration, so not much beyond corn bread and canteen goods are going to be edible after a few days. 

If these were dormitories, the water situation is going to fuck them over significantly faster than food. Maybe a dozen toilets and sinks without drain plugs per every dormitory unit of one hundred people. Cellblocks are more sustainable, with one toliet holding about 1.5 gallons of water per two man cell. No clue about the tents. After about three days, the dehydration is going to be degrading the cognitive abilities and physical performance of the protestors involved. 

It was hot and sunny today and will be tomorrow, so they'll probably be quite thirsty by Monday. If the organizers were really looking ahead, the weather forecast predicts rain on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday so collecting rainwater may allow the besieged to extend the time they can hold out. 

These inmates aren't getting their meds as well. Wouldn't be surprised if we see a few deaths from diabetes, heart attacks, etc. Many old men in the system, and a lot of HIV/AIDs cases with compromised immune systems. 

The lack of electricity also isolates the inmates; they can't use radios or watch TV to keep abreast of the public reaction to their uprising and see what kind of forces are being marshaled against them. The batteries of the smuggled cell phones they are using to coordinate efforts between units and contacts on the outside will steadily drain. Limits their weaponry as well; a Dixie cup full of syrup, sugar, and water boiled for twenty minutes in a microwave is a nightmarish thing to have thrown in someone's face and poured down armor. Same for using extension cords to electrify puddles of urine and the like. 

The fact that they have no hostages is very surprising. You're looking at one unarmed officer at a desk, probably a middle aged woman, to one hundred inmates. Or two in each cellblock of a few dozen with 1-2 patrolling between units outside. It would be an absolute trivial manner to dogpile them and take them hostage, which makes me very curious about how things played out. The lack of hostages makes the strategy of just waiting out the rioter's supplies more viable. 

Any firearms the inmates have somehow gotten ahold of are going to have no reloads. Only armed guards are typically in towers or fields outside the wire, carrying a mix of Mini-14s, revolvers, lever action 30-30s, and pump action shotguns. From the sound of it the riot never made it anywhere they could obtain firearms and armor. Majority of weapons (if any) will be padlocks from personal lockers stuffed in socks, blades from broken disposable razors melted into toothbrushes, improvised brass knuckles, clubs, etc. 

They'll try to create barricades everywhere and rearrange the interiors to slow down a storming of the buildings with drapped bedsheets, mattresses, furniture, etc. 

The responding agencies will talk tough to the public about how ""we don't negotiate"" but behind the scenes anything short of full amnesty and letting them leave the prison is on the table. Best case scenario, they negotiate an improvement in medical treatment and a few other categories and the ringleaders get hammered. 

I have no familiarity with illegal immigrant prisons, but I'd assume they will be less prone to escalate to violence due to the relatively minor sentences involved and the cross-section of society they encompass. More likely to have the kind of useful knowledge and skills that a typical inmate population would not, though.

So far there's no reason to think that regular citizens are in any danger. Waco and the surrounding areas may have too few police, but thankfully they're a great force and doing their best to keep everything safe and contained.

Edit 4:37 pm: Waco PD just stated they're closing the entire Central Texas Marketplace. For everyone not in the area, it's kind of like a very large, outdoor mall. It's a really big area to lock down.

Edit 5:17: Local news said that the FBI is on the scene. Press conference should be incoming any minute now. They interviewed some crazy woman whose son got shot, she wanted to clarify that they were part of a motorcycle **club** but the police are stressing that these are motorcycle **gangs**.

Edit 5:24: The Waco Convention Center is I guess where they're holding some of the injured and arrested until they get a better handle on the situation. Insane to see Officer Swanton on TV.

**Edit 5:26, press conference**: 8 bikers dead at Twin Peaks, one died at hospital. Expecting to recover over 100 weapons. Tactical unit was on scene before the incident because they knew something would happen. Sgt. Swanton confirms that management of Twin Peaks refused to work with police to prevent the incident. All injured are part of the motorcycle gangs, I believe he said 18 injured transported to the hospital. Confirmed that other bikers are expected to head toward Waco. There is no other crime scenes, just areas with preventative police presence. Sgt. Swanton is obviously furious that Twin Peaks allowed this to happen, he's reiterating it multiple times.

Edit 5:47: Sgt. Swanton is clarifying again that this is a criminal biker **gang** and that anyone who says members of these gangs aren't criminals is an outright liar. Very strong opinions from the Waco PD about the management of Twin Peaks and people associated with these gangs.

Edit 5:59: Seeing multiple people say the Walmart on Franklin is shut down. That's a good distance away, so I have no idea why.

Edit 6:21: Local news is confirming that a large number of bikers are expected to come in from out of town. Police from different counties are still in the area and monitoring I-35 by helicopter, they seem prepared to settle any new confrontations. 

Edit 7:01: Missed most of the latest press conference because my husband stole the TV...but they did say that there are at least 5 gangs involved. Something like 150-200 people involved in this shooting.

Edit 8:07: Update from Waco PD: ""Officers have the entire scene and Central Texas Marketplace secured.

If you are making $50,000 a year, that means you pay $3000 in state taxes.  Assume one percent of the state budget goes to public assistance (http://www.cbpp.org/cms/?fa=view&amp;id=2783).  So 1% of your $3000 went to public assistance.  That is $30.  Thirty dollars.  Now, even the most hardened among us will admit that not ALL poor people are bad people.  How about we say half the people getting assistance are good and hard working, they just fell on hard times.  The other half are just bad.  So now, at this point, all your anger and vitriol is about $15 of your money you think was ill spent.  FIFTEEN DOLLARS.  Over the course of a year.  Seriously, stop it.

JaKaL63,,,"30 year old former (due to heart condition) LEO here. In this situation you have to look at it from the officer's perspective to decide whether or not the escalation of force is reasonable. I haven't seen a video that clearly shows what was going on before the first rounds were fired in the intersection, so I can't speak on that. The clearer bits of the video at the spot of the fatal shooting show the suspect fleeing, then dropping his hands near his waist and spinning around, while crouching into an aggressive posture and raising his hands toward the officers. If you were one of those officers, you now have to make the choice whether or not to shoot at the suspect who very easily could have retrieved a gun from his waistband and is about to fire on you and your fellow officers. Police have a dangerous job. They are given training to quickly handle situations like this. It's easy to call it an execution after all the smoke clears, but if things had been different, there are two other possible headlines that would be in the papers.

It is unfortunate to hear this happened but it does not look like it was malicious. I know many hunters who live in states south of Wyoming and Idaho who have told me that they have seen wolves in the forest. They are migrating south but that is not being made known by wildlife authorities.

From [this](http://www.childtrends.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/53_appendix1.pdf) source, we can estimate that there are approximately 26 million children in each of the following age groups: 0-5, 6-11, 12-17. As this is an estimation only, I will use the same figure despite the source's slightly differing figures. Modified grouped numbers for the data cited along with estimated usage prevalence percentages can be found below.

Okay, there are several things that are worth discussing at this point. The first is that, going by this (very crudely estimated) percentage, it is clear that the percentage of kids on meds is still pretty low. Seeing that close to five hundred thousand 13-17 year olds take antipsychotics can seem shocking, but that's less than 2% of that age group. And there clearly aren't very many toddlers on antipsychotics or ADHD medications, although I think that it's important to note that there *are* many cases where the use of these medications is fully justified in that age group.

I'm not really going to argue about the necessity of these cases. I think that there is absolutely no valid argument against the treatment percentages of all four classes in the oldest age class. I also think that the middle class's percentages seem reasonable. So let's look at the youngest kids.

For ADHD medication, the treatment numbers seem low enough to only contain fringe cases for 0-5yr old kids. The 0-1yr olds are almost certainly extreme fringe cases, and we don't know if the medication was being prescribed on-label or not. I don't think anyone can really complain about this.

I don't know how reasonable the antidepressant prescription numbers are. The grouped percentage is reasonable, but the individual numbers are a bit dubious. There may be a specialized use in pediatric populations. Or maybe it's being used off-label. I don't have the time to research this right now, so draw your own conclusions about these figures, but don't jump to accept CCHRINT's scare tactics.

The antipsychotic use figures are very, very low.

Here we get to anti-anxiety meds. Wow! 227k scripts for infants? 2.8% of 0-5 year olds on anti-anxiety meds? Seems crazy, right? This is the reason why I decided to sit down and waste a good two hours on researching and writing up this post, because it seemed too crazy too be true, and I just couldn't believe it.

When you think of anti-anxiety meds, you probably think of benzodiazepines. They may primarily be anti-anxiety meds, but another major use is to treat seizures. After a bit of research, I found [this article](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16080423), which is very relevant. Here are two important paragraphs from the full text:

&gt;BDZs are frequently used in controlling various types of seizures in children due to their strong efficacy. It is postulated, based on the
EEG readings, that BDZs suppress the spreading of firing discharges and generalized abnormalities and have limited effect on focal changes (39). Amongst the most commonly used BDZs for this indication are diazepam, clonazepam, clorazepate and lorazepam. Diazepam is frequently employed in treatment of status epilepticus, prevention of febrile seizures, and tonic-clonic seizures (40,41). Nonetheless, other agents may be equally effective. In one study (42), intranasal midazolam was compared to intravenous diazepam in the treatment of childhood seizure disorders. It was concluded that both agents were equally effective.

&gt;Clonazepam has also been used in the treatment of complex partial seizures, absence seizures, myoclonic seizures, infantile spasms
and atonic seizures. However, children may be especially sensitive to clonazepam and may display irritability, hostility and aggressiveness, in addition to drowsiness, ataxia and hypotonia (39).

Aha! That's a *very* good explanation for the usage prevalence in younger pediatric patients. It's also an excellent example of how taking CCHRINT's claims at face value is a bad idea.

There is also another possible explanation for the usage prevalence. Infantile Hemangiomas are an extremely common issue in infants. Beta-blockers such as Propranolol are extremely effective at treating Infantile Hemangiomas, and as a result, the use of beta-blockers in infants has increased greatly. These beta-blockers are also frequently used as anti-anxiety medications.

I don't know how the source's data is grouped, but I can pretty much guarantee that all benzodiazepine use in children is lumped together, and I wouldn't be surprised if beta-blockers are also included, but non-anxiety uses of benzodiazepines alone are enough to explain the figures.

SP17F1R3,,,"So the judge made a ruling based on very complex case law.  It appears, from reading the decision that part of the dismissal is due to a tort immunity exception for police that congress passed in 1974


&gt;“Known as the ‘law enforcement proviso,’ this provision extends the waiver of sovereign immunity to claims for six intentional torts”—assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, abuse of process, or malicious prosecution—if they “are based on the ‘acts or omissions of investigative or law enforcement officers.’” 


From this excerpt it would seem that part of the justification for dismissal is that the judge believes the government's case that the agents acted within their powers and under good faith with this investigation.  As long as they weren't ""abusing"" their powers, they are granted tort immunity by this provision.  I wouldn't agree, but there you go.

Ragnar__Danneskjold,,,"Good. Being a police officer is my job, but being a libertarian is who I am. I can see the need for SWAT teams. There are simply some incidents where the average road cop just can't handle things. I can see the need for patrol rifles. Again, there are time where a pistol and a few extra mags just aren't enough. Hell, I can even see the need for a vehicle with armor, like to get close to a building with a sniper or a hostage situation.

But those are special incidents. The first word in the acronym SWAT is *special* meaning **not normal**. Normal road cops do not need to be decked out like they're doing a foot patrol in Afghanistan. And I know, I've done foot patrols in Afghanistan. I've taken fire from PKMs and DShKs. I've worn the IOTV and carried an M4 (a real M4). That's not what road cops need. I'm reminded of the line from the movie *The Siege*: "" There is historically nothing more corrosive to the morale of a population than policing its own citizens"". I want the days of the friendly beat cop walking the street and knowing the citizens by their first names to come back. I hate rolling into neighborhoods and wondering how many people are sighting me with a rifle. I hate walking up to a random car and wondering if I'll be dead in 10 seconds. I hate having to lie about my job to people I meet because I'm afraid they'll hate me because I'm a cop. Being hated by the people you swore to help is a tear on your soul that never stops. It drags you down. It permeates every aspect of your life. I change out of my uniform before going home every day. I don't wear police shirts in public because I'm afraid of everything between people spitting in my food or breaking my car windows while I'm inside a shop to being gunned down while I walk out of Wal-Mart. If reducing the  militarized presence of police makes people hate us less, than I'm all for it. And in my heart of hearts, I know that if someone like Jefferson or Locke looked at police in 2015, they would be saddened to the core. That saddens me.

I don't believe all police are a problem. I don't believe most or ever a large portion of police are a problem. I work with men and women every day who feel as I do and hate that we're despised by everyone. I've seen first hand the lengths the average police officer will go to help a citizen. I've changed tires in the rain, I've given rides to stranded motorists, I've done CPR on a 10 year old kid who collapsed while playing basketball. I know that most cops are not a problem.

But the perception is that we are. Because of a handful of rotten criminals who happened to weasel their way into being given a badge before anyone figured out who they really were. Because of shitbags who are more concerned with their jobs than the Constitution. We are a thing blue line. We're there for each other.  But the flip side of that is that one cops problems and misdeeds do become the business of all of us. When one cop fucks up, it reflects on all of us. That's what being family means. And if taking all the cool high-speed tacticool gear from the schlub who doesn't know how and when to use it and more importantly **not** use it helps our police family regain our lost honor, so be it.",1431955368,,False,1,734,news,True,False,611,0,Morning,61+,2,43,"{u'probability': {u'neg': 0.7603532096047092, u'neutral': 0.16587826180158485, u'pos': 0.23964679039529074}, u'label': u'neg'}",0.760353209605,0.239646790395,0.165878261802,neg,"{u'tone_categories': [{u'category_id': u'emotion_tone', u'tones': [{u'tone_name': u'Anger', u'score': 0.11926, u'tone_id': u'anger'}, {u'tone_name': u'Disgust', u'score': 0.185739, u'tone_id': u'disgust'}, {u'tone_name': u'Fear', u'score': 0.417813, u'tone_id': u'fear'}, {u'tone_name': u'Joy', u'score': 0.239951, u'tone_id': u'joy'}, {u'tone_name': u'Sadness', u'score': 0.479725, u'tone_id': u'sadness'}], u'category_name': u'Emotion Tone'}, {u'category_id': u'language_tone', u'tones': [{u'tone_name': u'Analytical', u'score': 0.089947, u'tone_id': u'analytical'}, {u'tone_name': u'Confident', u'score': 0.0, u'tone_id': u'confident'}, {u'tone_name': u'Tentative', u'score': 0.568148, u'tone_id': u'tentative'}], u'category_name': u'Language Tone'}, {u'category_id': u'social_tone', u'tones': [{u'tone_name': u'Openness', u'score': 0.665894, u'tone_id': u'openness_big5'}, {u'tone_name': u'Conscientiousness', u'score': 0.042644, u'tone_id': u'conscientiousness_big5'}, {u'tone_name': u'Extraversion', u'score': 0.140113, u'tone_id': u'extraversion_big5'}, {u'tone_name': u'Agreeableness', u'score': 0.08944, u'tone_id': u'agreeableness_big5'}, {u'tone_name': u'Emotional Range', u'score': 0.289113, u'tone_id': u'emotional_range_big5'}], u'category_name': u'Social Tone'}]}",0.11926,0.185739,0.417813,0.239951,0.479725,0.089947,0.0,0.568148,0.665894,0.042644,0.140113,0.08944,0.289113

I didn't have the mine for that and my graduate student health insurance. It was hard during that time since I was paying a 100 dollars a week for a therapist visit.

LoudCow,,,"Total BS.  Police targeted Williams because he had been on the board of directors of a ""compassion club"" in Battle Creek, an hour away, and his name had turned up in records in a raid there, Grow said, even though he had not been involved with the club since 2011. 

The seizure was allowed under Michigan's Civil Asset Forfeiture laws, which allow police to take property from citizens if they suspect a crime was committed, even when there is not enough evidence to charge them. Homeowners like Williams have to prove they did not purchase their property with proceeds from criminal activity and then sue to get the property back.

Such laws are currently under attack nationwide by critics and legislators who say it is ripe for abuse. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder announced earlier this month that he was tightening federal forfeiture laws to stop abuses. Michigan, with its own forfeiture laws, was ranked in a 2010 national study by a private, nonprofit group as among the worst in the nation for abuse.

Disband the DEA, and see if that fixes corruption elsewhere in the government.

Lucifuture,,,"As a liberal I like to throw out the fact that when you take away suicide and gang warfare gun deaths hit something like 1200 people a year, 800 less than pools.

EDIT: I have seen some figures claim as high as 80% of gun homicides are gang related [this source](http://extranosalley.com/?p=36491) pins it closer to 70%

[This source](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/05/24/suicides-account-for-most-gun-deaths/) pins suicide at about 60% of over all gun deaths.

I am not saying people who commit suicide don't count or that gang members aren't people. I am a suicide survivor myself and have lost friends and family members to suicide, so forgive me if I seemed insensitive as I am impacted by suicide greatly and am sympathetic. 

My point is that gangs will kill each other with sticks if they have to and people will find other ways to kill themselves if they are desperate enough. You can cherry pick statistics to back up any debate especially one that is charged by emotions so much rather than logic. As an advocate for responsible gun ownership I could easily throw out gun ownership rates in Switzerland vs their homicide rate but that really has a lot to do with their culture more than owning guns or not. Just like how guns are banned in Mexico but there are a ton of gun deaths because of the Cartels.

You can find statistics to back up what you already think and rationalize and bolster your opinion. I found that I wasn't originally very strongly opinionated about guns so I tried to educate myself, shot guns (which is really fun), and reformed my opinion. I might be for actual practical laws say like a gun tax that is spent on suicide prevention or gang prevention, but passing superficial laws banning assault rifles that look scary but in effect allow the same exact gun with a wooden stock seems like a waste of time and dumb since so few gun deaths are even caused by assault style rifles anyway.

Sorry to rant, felt like I should explain my position more since people responded to it.

EDIT 2: re crunching the numbers might put it closer to 2000 i dunno how I originally got 1200 but that was the original number I calculated, maybe with sources that were more generous to a pro-gun bias. There are a lot of conflicting numbers but something like 19k suicides 11k homicides minus 80% of 11k is a little more than 2000 admittedly.

MyNameIsStevenE,,,"I don't think some people understand how traffic stops work, officer safety is taught, and probable cause is defined. I'll go through each of these for everyone to make it easy for everyone; I'll also go over how it pertains to this video. Age is a moot point.

**Traffic Stops:**

During any traffic stop an officer must have a probable cause to perform the stop. Once this probable cause is defined and can be articulated by the officer the person stopped is for all intensive purposes ""being detained"" by the police pending an investigation. ""Being detained"" means an officer can hold a suspect for up to 72 hours (depending on the state it can be 48 hours) WITHOUT charges even being filed by the state. If you have ever been pulled over and issued a ticket you were probably asked to read/sign the ticket. An officer giving a ticket is effectively filing charges and releasing you out of their custody (ending the investigation) and giving you a date to see a judge (kind of like a bond set at $0). 

*In the video*, the officer stopped the car for a light that is out which validates the stop as lawful.

**Officer Safety:**

When it comes to officer safety, policies are generally pretty clear and standard. If two people then two or more officers. It wouldn't be unheard of for one officer to attempt to separate the occupants outside the vehicle. If the officer detects another crime is being committed they will have to continue their investigation in a safe manner. Safety is paramount; an officer would not know the contents of a car or a person so it would be in safety's best interests to search the occupants for weapons and continuing the investigation by checking for drugs.

*In the video* the officer has said he is continuing his investigation and needs the occupants out of the car presumably to search the occupants (weapons for the officer's safety and drugs for the investigation). When they are not compliant with the lawful order the officer moves up a rung on the ladder of force by attempting to pull the occupant out of the vehicle. The occupant continues to be non-compliant so the officer climbs the next rung and deploys OC spray this continues until the TASER is deployed and at which point you can even see the occupant kick out the door at the officer as he tries to pull him out. Now lets talk about how he wants to call his mother and have her present and how it pertains to officer safety. How safe would it be for an officer to allow ANOTHER person (whom the officer has never seen) to show up on a scene with an unknown motive/demeanor/direction compounded by obviously non-compliant occupants with unknown contents on their persons and vehicle? No police officer would allow this unless they have a deathwish or a stupid amount of confidence in a person they've never met. Add to the fact the officer knows he can detain this person for 72 hours without charges being filed.


**Probable Cause:**

Probable cause basically means through the officers training and experience the officer can articulate that a crime was or may have been committed. An officer with more training and more experience can articulate based on more circumstances what probable cause means and if an officer can't articulate why they stopped someone it would be considered unlawful.

* Did the officer have probable cause for the traffic stop? **Yes** we already talked about it. There was a clear violation with a light.

* Did the officer have probable cause to remove the occupants? **Yes** for officer safety an officer can remove occupants for any stop.

* Did the officer have probable cause to search the car? **Yes** The officer believes he can smell marijuana coming from the car. Based on the officers training and experience (probably from dealing with marijuana and its users directly in the field) the officer can articulate that he can search the car for marijuana and any other unsafe contents.

As for the officer ""turning off the camera"" it may have been a bad move, but I believe at this point the officers have decided they are arresting the occupants regardless of drugs. The officer was more than likely returning the phone to the suspects to be booked with them at jail instead of being left in the car on the side of the road to be impounded and inventoried at a later day. The officer was not turning off the phone to hide anything, because he knew everything he did was lawful. More than likely he was returning the phone so they can get their phone back when they get out of jail as opposed to going through hoops and hurdles to get it later. As to her video getting ""deleted"" wouldn't it be convenient that it's in the recently deleted file instead of actually being deleted? Cops aren't stupid, if a police officer wanted to delete a video, where said video doesn't affect the officers at all, and put their career on the line don't you think they would know how to REALLY delete the video?",1428683222,,False,1,2,news,True,False,869,0,Morning,0-20,1,13,"{u'probability': {u'neg': 0.730171653836906, u'neutral': 0.8539156887027328, u'pos': 0.26982834616309403}, u'label': u'neutral'}",0.730171653837,0.269828346163,0.853915688703,neutral,"{u'tone_categories': [{u'category_id': u'emotion_tone', u'tones': [{u'tone_name': u'Anger', u'score': 0.456663, u'tone_id': u'anger'}, {u'tone_name': u'Disgust', u'score': 0.453703, u'tone_id': u'disgust'}, {u'tone_name': u'Fear', u'score': 0.186188, u'tone_id': u'fear'}, {u'tone_name': u'Joy', u'score': 0.095522, u'tone_id': u'joy'}, {u'tone_name': u'Sadness', u'score': 0.309013, u'tone_id': u'sadness'}], u'category_name': u'Emotion Tone'}, {u'category_id': u'language_tone', u'tones': [{u'tone_name': u'Analytical', u'score': 0.837419, u'tone_id': u'analytical'}, {u'tone_name': u'Confident', u'score': 0.0, u'tone_id': u'confident'}, {u'tone_name': u'Tentative', u'score': 0.777041, u'tone_id': u'tentative'}], u'category_name': u'Language Tone'}, {u'category_id': u'social_tone', u'tones': [{u'tone_name': u'Openness', u'score': 0.764852, u'tone_id': u'openness_big5'}, {u'tone_name': u'Conscientiousness', u'score': 0.76012, u'tone_id': u'conscientiousness_big5'}, {u'tone_name': u'Extraversion', u'score': 0.583641, u'tone_id': u'extraversion_big5'}, {u'tone_name': u'Agreeableness', u'score': 0.455964, u'tone_id': u'agreeableness_big5'}, {u'tone_name': u'Emotional Range', u'score': 0.856193, u'tone_id': u'emotional_range_big5'}], u'category_name': u'Social Tone'}]}",0.456663,0.453703,0.186188,0.095522,0.309013,0.837419,0.0,0.777041,0.764852,0.76012,0.583641,0.455964,0.856193

All of our patients are ex-military, most of them are gun-crazy, most of them have seen real, serious battles, most of them have an abundance of physical disabilities that take away what freedom they had left. Their friends died before their eyes, their families don't understand them, and they're mostly old and just....sick and tired of being sick and tired. Our mental ward is always crammed packed. Our patients constantly talk about wishing it were all over, having suicidal thoughts, angry outbursts that put our staff in danger.

I know the VA has programs. But a crisis line and the option to anonymously speak to a therapist just isn't working. I hope someone comes up with a creative solution to this problem. It's hard to watch heroes go through such anguish.
