I've been dealing with schizophrenia for over a decade, was officially diagnosed six years ago, and I've been off of antipsychotics for three years. While going off of antipsychotics was incredibly difficult decision, I have no doubt that it was the best decision for me. I am able to still manage my condition with lots of self-awareness and help from a therapist. I know plenty of other people who are able to deal with schizophrenia the same way.

The thing is, that's not how it works for everyone. My condition, while serious, is fairly mild when compared to what many schizophrenics go through. Around 40% of schizophrenics attempt suicide. Paranoia can easily be crippling. There are people whose only hope at living a regular life lies in their regularly taking antipsychotic medications. Sadly, their condition drives them to not take the same medication that could help them.

Since being diagnosed with schizophrenia I have had the wonderful opportunity to meet many great people who share my condition. But I've also seen some of those people lose their minds and their lives because they felt they shouldn't or didn't need to take their medication.

"karmavorous","","","In just a few weeks you'll get to see the first ever detailed images of the dwarf planet [Ceres](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceres_%28dwarf_planet%29). Courtest of the [NASA Dawn Mission.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawn_%28spacecraft%29)

Unlike New Horizons at Pluto which is just a fly-by encounter, Dawn will actually orbit Ceres and study it for at least a year.

Ceres is between Mars and Jupiter.

From studies from ground based telescopes and Hubble, it appears that Ceres has a LOT of water ice. Possibly more ice than there is fresh water on the Earth. Even though it is a fraction the size, it probably has more water than Mars has.

Ceres contains 1/3 of the mass of the Asteroid Belt. It is the largest asteroid. It appears to be large enough that it is round in shape. It also appears from distant observations that surface does not retain impact craters for as long as Mars or Earth's Moon does - possibly indicating that it has ongoing geological processes - although it is probably something more like ice churning than plate tectonics. It could be periodic cryo-volcanism that is stimulated by the planet's somewhat elliptical orbit around the Sun. This *could* mean that during certain times in the Cererean year, the planet has a tenuous atmosphere rich in water vapor.

Ceres definitely isn't just another asteroid. It is more like a little infant Earth, that early in its development was starved for material by Jupiter's gravitational interactions with the asteroid belt. 

In some ways it is more like one of Jupiter or Saturn's moons. But likely very different because the moons of the gas giants are shaped by tidal interactions with their host planets while Ceres has no real tidal interactions with anything. 

Seeing Pluto is going to be cool since many people alive today remember when Pluto was a planet. Ceres was considered a planet too after it was discovered. And it too go the demotion when astronomers started finding more bodies in it's neighborhood (which is the real reason Pluto stopped being considered a planet). Ceres was discovered 200 years ago, so nobody alive today remembers the day it got demoted. 

However, when Pluto get demoted, at the same exact time, Ceres got promoted to the newly adopted category of ""dwarf planet"" where it and Pluto both reside. 2015 is the year of the dwarf planet. We'll get to see our first two, a glimpse of Pluto and a long duration orbital study of the other.

Pluto is not a place humans will probably think or revisiting any time soon. It takes too long to get there. It would be very difficult to set up an orbital mission, much less a lander.

Ceres might be the next best location to send humans after Mars. It takes twice as long to get there, but you have more frequent opportunities to launch or return. The way the orbital resonances work out, if you go to Mars you have to stay for 2 years before you can return. If you go to Ceres, you have to stay for more like 1.3 years before your next opportunity to return.

Ceres has less gravity than the moon or Mars, but it has more gravity than Comet 67P - where you can jump off the surface. You don't have to worry about things floating away on you, but it takes less energy to return to orbit than even the Apollo moon lander had to deal with. This might make it an excellent place to build a shipyard to build interstellar vehicles. Ceres is conventiently close to the raw materials in the asteroid belt.

New Horizons at Pluto is going to be cool.

Dawn at Ceres will probably blow people's minds.

Mars in big in popular culture because we've had good pictures of it for almost 50 years and it always seemed like the next best place for humans to go in the solar system.

We're all about to get a big ole face full of Ceres. It could be a game changer in a lot of ways.

If you want to hear Dawn scientist say the same things I just said and even more amazing things about Dawn and Ceres, the google hangouts on the Dawn Mission's website are great.

http://dawn.jpl.nasa.gov/multimedia/hangouts.asp

Today, dawn is slightly closer to Ceres than the Earth is to the Moon (Ceres quite a bit smaller than the moon though). Dawn is expected to enter orbit in early March, but there will be a few distant photos taken between now and then. The latest is supposed to be released on January 20th and by early February they will probably release at least one image that is better resolution than the Hubble picture from 2004 on the Ceres wiki page.

Misleading statistic is misleading. All you need is to apply some critical thinking and math.

Consider first, the overall applicant pool:

* There were [49,480 applicants to medical school](https://www.aamc.org/download/411780/data/enrollment2014.png) in 2014. 
* Of those, [20,343 enrolled](https://www.aamc.org/newsroom/newsreleases/411636/10282014.html). 
* That's about a 41 percent enrollment rate.

The black pool:

* Of those 49,480 candidates [only 3,990 were  black](https://www.aamc.org/newsroom/newsreleases/411636/10282014.html). That's about eight percent of the pool
* And out of that 3,390 applicants, only 1,412 enrolled. 
* That's about a 35 percent enrollment rate.

This means that: 

* Black applicants make up about 8 percent of the 49,480 pool. (3,990 divided into 49,480) 

* It also means that black applicants make up only 7 percent of the 20,343 applicants who actually enroll. (1,412 divided into 20,343).

* It also means that **over 65 percent of black applicants to medical school didn't get in.** (1,412 divided into 3990).

So why is the black acceptance rate so high compared to other groups?

Think of it this way.

Five black applicants apply to a medical school. Three get in. That's a 60 percent acceptance rate.

Compare this to twenty Asian American applicants who apply. If ten get in, there's a 50 percent acceptance rate. 

In this hypothetical there would be three black candidates and ten Asian ones (i.e. over twice as many). 

The acceptance rates don't tell you anything about an individual candidate's chances of acceptance, even if you know the total number of candidates. It suggests that either a group has a huge admission advantage, or that their number of applicants is so small compared to the rest of the pool, their admission rate looks much higher than everyone else's. Even though that doesn't bear out in absolute (or even relative) numbers.

And the latter is what happened here.

**TLDR:** Affirmative action didn't help black applicants here. The vast majority of black applicants didn't get into medical school. Black acceptance rates (at 35 percent) are still lower than the overall acceptance rate (~40 percent). Sources are included if you doubt the black guy.",1429572819,"","False",1,11,"todayilearned"

"SEND-ME-YOUR-SELFIE","","","The title is a bit misleading. Recall doesn't necessarily distort a memory, but it makes that memory vulnerable to being distorted.

Memories are more like word documents than like PDF's.

So to see the contents of a .doc file, you gotta open it up in Word. Now, unlike a PDF, a .doc file is not a read-only file, so while the Word document is open, it can be changed. Now imagine that to close the file, you have to first save any changes made.

See, recalling a memory opens it up in a malleable form, and when you're done with recall, your brain goes through reconsolidation of the memory, a process very similar to how that memory was initially put into long-term storage.
So let's say you and your friends are talking about a childhood memory. You all open up your editable file, and as you talk, one of your friends points out a detail of the story that seems to differ from what you remember. He's certain of it. Now, this is an old fucking memory that's been recalled a bunch throughout your life. You feel unsure. I mean, that detail could have gone how you remember, but you can also be dead wrong. Your friend explains the events surrounding that detail, and it makes more sense than what you remember. Suddenly, you realize he's right, and when you picture the event in your head, you now see it as he remembers it. Now your memory of the event will be stored as such.

Another example. Let's say you're telling a story about something that happened to you, but you exaggerate some details in a subtle, believable way to make yourself look better or make the story more exciting. Now, after years and years of telling the story this way, when you picture the event in your head, it will be far easier to remember the event playing out as you told it than it will be to remember it as it actually happened. You may have both memories in place, being cognisant about having lied, but you've been pulling up the altered version all these years, and you're not even sure at this point how the real story even went down. Maybe over the years even more points have been exaggerated. You're so good at telling the story the way you want to, it almost seems like, well, that's what actually happened!

Third example, let's say you're trying to remember an event, but one aspect is fuzzy. To make a whole picture, your brain looks at the data is has available, and fills in logically the fuzzy aspect. You save the changes made, and next time you remember the incident, it will play out in your head, complete with the ""filled in"" part. Now this may be what happened, but the ""movie in your head"" is playing a version of it that is, in fact, partially fabricated after the fact. Maybe you don't really remember having taken your phone out of your pocket and putting it on your friend's table before you left his house, but your brain's going to fill in the blanks once your buddy hits you up on Facebook saying he found your phone on his table.

But, on the other hand, you can go opening up word documents, making no changes, and closing up the document just dandy.

"VeritassAequitass","","","I am glad people are learning about this. This is a huge problem that touches upon many issues affecting Aboriginal women in Canada, notably in BC. Many of these women originally come from reserves, where there are insufficient resources - financially and otherwise - and where the legacy of colonialism has left a pretty dismal life for many people, especially women. Aboriginal women who are disenfranchised and suffering from poverty, either on the reserve or off, as they try to escape to big cities, often have no choice but to hitchhike to try to get out. They are left, just as they were on reserves or in Vancouver, in extremely vulnerable and precarious situations, leading to these tragedies on the Highway of Tears.

It gets worse though. The RCMP (federal police) often overlook these missing and murdered women. Investigations have been insufficient and the police have been proven to be callous and discriminatory in the way they treat these cases. Not only that, but RCMP officers have actually abused Aboriginal women and girls themselves, without being held properly accountable. So not only are Aboriginal women ill-treated in Canada, leading to things like this happening, but families and entire communities have no way of getting justice, leading to further feelings of alienation and disenfranchisement.

The whole thing is super fucked up. The international community (notably the UN, but also other countries) consistently calls on Canada to do something about the way they are treating Aboriginal people, especially women, but Canada doesn't do a goddamn thing about it.",1432588319,"","False",1,1005,"todayilearned"

Interestingly enough, this fact is presented by ONE GUY - a [Dr. C. George Boeree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._George_Boeree) - based off this [ONE PAGE](http://webspace.ship.edu/cgboer/race.html).

So I was like... well surely there must be somebody else also saying this - confirming that 2% of the world is actually naturally blond other than this one guy -so I started looking.

Every single source, over 2 dozen different websites - ALL QUOTE THIS *ONE* *PAGE* FROM THIS *ONE* *GUY*.

So who is this Dr. C. George Boeree guy to be such an authority?

&gt;C. George Boeree (born January 15, 1952) is an American psychologist and professor emeritus at Shippensburg University, specializing in personality theory and the history of psychology.

&gt;He is the author of the first online psychology texts,[1] which he made available at no cost to students and other interested parties starting in 1997. They have been translated into German,[2] Spanish,[3] Bulgarian,[4] and Indonesian.[5]

&gt;Boeree is also the inventor of the auxiliary language Lingua Franca Nova, introduced on the Internet in 1998.

So we have this ONE GUY who specializes in ""personality theory"" and the history of psychology, writer of the first online psychology textbook, and inventor of some strange ""auxiliary constructed language"" which I'm not even going to bother trying to to explain; POINT BEING - none of these things attribute strengths/history/study/reason to think he would be any kind of authority.

Now I'm not saying he's wrong, he could very well be in fact right. I just found it exceptionally strange that this information is based from ONE GUY who has no real past experience in said field to be considered an authority on the subject.

&gt;We know inhalation of any chemicals is dangerous

&gt;BHT - Known as a neurotoxin, endocrine disruptor, immunotoxicity, non-reproductive organ system toxicity, skin eye and lung irritator

""Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), also known as butylhydroxytoluene, is a lipophilic organic compound, chemically a derivative of phenol, that is useful for its antioxidant properties.""

**Yeah... we all like anti-oxidants right?**

&gt;Acetaldehyde - Known to cause cancer, toxic to reproduction and development, immunotoxin, non-reproductive organ system toxin, skin, eye and lung irritator

""Acetaldehyde (systematic name ethanal) is an organic chemical compound with the formula CH3CHO, sometimes abbreviated by chemists as MeCHO (Me = methyl). It is one of the most important aldehydes, occurring widely in nature and being produced on a large scale in industry. Acetaldehyde occurs naturally in coffee, bread, and ripe fruit, and is produced by plants.""

""Traditionally, acetaldehyde was mainly used as a precursor to acetic acid.""

**Produced naturally in coffee and fruit... and makes vinegar (acetic acid). Yeah... it's like hitler in a bottle.**

&gt;""Fragrance"" - One of the three ingredients actually disclosed, it's a neurotoxin, immunotoxin and allergen

**Really? I mean... REALLY? ""fragrance"" is a neurotoxin. That's just fucking sad. They don't say what fragrance... just... fragrance. We don't know what it is but it's probably DEATH!! eyeroll**

&gt; Propylene Glycol - Causes cancer, allergies, toxic to immune system, accumulates in the system, non-reproductive organ system toxin, is classified with ""enhanced skin absorption"" and irritates the skin, eye and lung

""The acute oral toxicity of propylene glycol is very low, and large quantities are required to cause perceptible health damage in humans; propylene glycol is metabolized in the human body into pyruvic acid (a normal part of the glucose-metabolism process, readily converted to energy), acetic acid (handled by ethanol-metabolism), lactic acid (a normal acid generally abundant during digestion),[16] and propionaldehyde (a potentially hazardous substance).""

**Yup... ""no differences"" between the group given the chemical and the control group which isn't given the chemical. The study also mentions that human testing hasn't been found. So the claim that it's carcinogenic is just fabricated.**

&gt;Limonene - Allergen, immunotoxin and skin, eyes and lung irritator

""Limonene takes its name from the lemon, as the rind of the lemon, like other citrus fruits, contains considerable amounts of this compound, which contributes to their odor.""

**FUCKING LEMONS! See... this one is great because it's actually used as a natural alternative to other synthetic compounds for things like fragrances, citrus flavors in food, and for treating gastric reflux.**

&gt;Methyl pyrrolidone - Toxin to reproduction and development, allergen and immunotoxin, non-reproductive organ system toxin and skin, eyes and lung irritator

**[The chemical name was incomplete so it took a while to track down but I'm assuming this is what they are referring to](http://www.cdph.ca.gov/programs/hesis/Documents/nmp.pdf). TL;DR... in large amounts over long periods of time this might cause lasting effects such as... fatigue. It also delayed impregnation in lab rats. So far this is the worst of the bunch... and it makes you ... tired... maybe.**

&gt;Ethyl acetate - linked to developmental/reproductive toxicity, neurotoxicity, organic system toxicity and and skin, eyes and lung irritator

""Ethyl acetate is used primarily as a solvent and diluent, being favored because of its low cost, low toxicity, and agreeable odor. For example, it is commonly used to clean circuit boards and in some nail varnish removers (acetone and acetonitrile are also used). Coffee beans and tea leaves are decaffeinated with this solvent.[3] It is also used in paints as an activator or hardener.[citation needed] Ethyl acetate is present in confectionery, perfumes, and fruits. In perfumes, it evaporates quickly, leaving only the scent of the perfume on the skin."" 

**Hmm... but is it dangerous? It's basically just a derivative of acetic acid aka vinegar.**

""The LD50 for rats is 5620 mg/kg,[5] indicating low toxicity. Given that the chemical is naturally present in many organisms, there is little risk of toxicity.""

**Oh, okay.**

""Linalool /lɪˈnælɵ.ɒl/ is a naturally occurring terpene alcohol chemical found in many flowers and spice plants with many commercial applications, the majority of which based on its pleasant scent (floral, with a touch of spiciness).""

**Yup... natural substance found in flowers... and they put it in an air freshener. Crazy right?**

&gt;Benzaldehyde - neurotoxin, and skin, eyes and lung irritator

""Benzaldehyde (C6H5CHO) is an organic compound consisting of a benzene ring with a formyl substituent. It is the simplest aromatic aldehyde and one of the most industrially useful. This colorless liquid has a characteristic pleasant almond-like odor. In fact, benzaldehyde is the primary component of bitter almond oil and can be extracted from a number of other natural sources.[2] Benzaldehyde was first extracted from bitter almonds in 1803 by the French pharmacist Martrès.""

**Almond oil. Uh huh.**

&gt; Diethylene glycol monoethyl ether - non-reproductive organ system toxicity

**[Little information quickly available. It appears to be a solvent that can be mildly irritating if sprayed in your eyes.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2-%282-Ethoxyethoxy%29ethanol).**

**This is an emollient. Likely used to help combine all the disparate fragrance oils with the volitiles (the smelly stuff with the stuff that makes it vaporize and then goes away).**

""Air exposure of 2-ethylhexanol to a human in a case study involving concentrations between 80 and 470 μg/m3 included throat irritation, cough, sore eyes, headache and blurred vision. Other volatile organic compounds were detected in the air as well, but 2-Ethylhexanol was of the highest concentration.[6] Another study involving several people exposed to 2-Ethylhexanol reported headaches, dizziness, fatigue and gastrointestinal disorders, but the concentration of 2-Ethylhexanol in this case is not known.[6] According to animal studies, 2-Ethylhexanol does not seem to be carcinogenic.""

Among the 30 countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development – a body that
comprises the world’s most affluent nations – the United States ranks fourth in per pupil spending on K-
12 education; this is not an unreasonable position to hold. **In addition, about 8 percent of U.S. education
spending is for health insurance, while other nations account for these costs in their health systems.
Finally, if one instead looks at preprimary-secondary education expenditures as percent of GDP, which
some economists think is a better measure of education spending, the United States falls to 14th.**

Years and years ago I was on a flight from Chicago back home to San Francisco. During the flight something went wrong with the plane and we had to do an emergency landing at a small airfield in the middle of nowhere, I believe somewhere in Wyoming (keep in mind I was 10-11 and this was 2 decades ago so specifics are fuzzy). 

Once we landed we had a very long wait while arrangements were made and eventually we were given the option of taking a shuttle to the closest large airport or chartering a small plane to Nevada. 

My dad wanted to seize the opportunity to allow me to see a small plane, and didn't want me to be afraid of flying after the emergency landing ordeal so we opted for the flight. 

During the flight in this tiny 4 seater plane while my dad was drifting off from our incredibly long day I saw two of these! 

I thought it might be buildings shaped as arrows, I wasn't quite sure. I tried to nudge him awake but that didn't work. When we landed I told him about it and being a kid of course he didn't believe me. Actually no one really did and partially thought I was delirious from lack of sleep, eventually I doubted it myself. Back then you couldn't google something so it remained a mystery.  Now it's solved! 

TLDR; Saw these as a kid, no one believed me. 

Edit: went camping and came back to this comment being somewhat popular... Thanks all! I emailed the story to my dad right away. He doesn't check email often so I'll probably call him tomorrow and tell him to check it out!

Hell it would be refreshing to see actual rape cases hit the front page (excluding Indian rape). Rape and sexual assaults are pretty common, but reddit would make you think you're ten times more likey to be falsely accused of rape than getting raped yourself. Hell, I've seen at least three times as many posts from the male rights groups talking about getting raped than I see women talk about it. Why the fuck is talking about women rape so taboo?

"Ofactorial","","","It's the result of food becoming cheaper and much more fattening over the last few decades. Turns out how tasty most people find a food is directly related to how much fat, salt, and sugar is in it, so economics is just giving people what they're programmed to want. And thanks to advancements in food technology, we can now churn out a lot more of it for a lot less money, so now everyone can stuff their faces with as much high-fat, high-sodium, high-sugar food as they want.

In neuroscience we have a name for this: ""super-stimuli"". It's a phenomenon where a stimulus manages to be so salient that it completely overpowers the brain system handling it. The result is the animal is virtually helpless to resist reacting to it. In this case the stimuli is the tastiness of food. On a neural level, what happens is that when you eat food you find tasty, you release dopamine in a certain area of the brain. Thing is, dopaminergic activity in that same area is also what drives eating behavior. As a result, the release of dopamine causes you to eat more, which releases more dopamine, which makes you eat even more, which releases even more dopamine, which makes you eat even more, and so on. The system quickly adjusts to this new level of stimulation, and suddenly a lot of foods are no longer palatable because they can't compete with the stimulation delivered by the extremely fattening food. At the same time, the stomach grows in response to such large volumes of food, so now it takes way more food to feel full, much less not-hungry. It would be bad enough if it were just normal food we were over-consuming, but like I said, today's food is intentionally designed to be as calorie-dense as possible, so it's now more than possible to eat more than an entire day's worth of calories in a single sitting. Do that three times a day, and now it's easy to see why 1/3rd of the population is obese.

In layman's terms, we've succeeded in turning food into an addictive drug.

It's not even just America anymore. Many countries, even in Europe and Asia, are now reeling from their own obesity crises. America isn't even the fattest country these days. Even France which just 10 years ago was laughing at how fat Americans were is now grappling with the fact that nearly half it's population is overweight or obese, and France is still the least-fat nation in Europe. Turns out it was just a matter of getting people the right food. Once a person eats enough unhealthy food, they're addicted. Just like once a person uses enough meth, they're addicted.

""he case was delayed on the court's docket when Bright Tunes was placed in receivership. During the interim, Harrison's contract with Klein was terminated in what proved to be a bitter parting of the ways (and another lawsuit involving the Beatles). After Bright's affairs were put in order so as to enable it to continue the case, settlement negotiations between Bright and Harrison resumed.

After much discussion, Harrison's best offer of $148,000 was made in January 1976, a few week's prior to the trial on the issue of whether or not MSL was too similar to HSF. That sum represented 40% of the writer and publisher's royalties earned in the United States by MSL, and further provided that Harrison would retain the copyright for MSL. The attorney for Bright viewed the offer as ""a good one"", but did not accept the offer, but rather raised its demand from 50% of the U.S. royalties to 75% of the worldwide receipts, and surrender of the MSL copyright.

Why did Bright turn down what was viewed as a good offer and make a counter that was so harsh to Harrison? What Harrison didn't know was that Klein had again entered into discussions with Bright Tunes to purchase all of Bright's stock, except at this time, he was not attempting to buy the stock for Harrison, but rather for ABKCO.""

TL;DR:  Harrison's manager scuttled settlement negotiations to benefit himself, so the court ordered him to sell the song to Harrison.

"Maquiavelico","","","I think the title is misleading and people don't really understand the book's purpose, it's not just a bunch of repeated information in order to accomplish some kind of cool gimmick, it was the author's attempt to make the reader more personally involved in the storytelling process, and so, you can read it from the first to the last page and enjoy the whole story, you can read it following the author's path (which leaves out pages that don't add to the main arch), you can leave out the last few pages or you can make up your own path.

What's interesting about it is not the ""gimmick"" itself, but what can be experienced through it; the book itself is great: great characters, great plot and great writing overall; however, even if at the end everyone has read the exact same story, the way they think about the characters and their actions will be invariably change depending on what path they followed, because every single chapter shows different sides of the characters, so if you skip some parts here and there you'll have experienced the same story as somebody who read all the way through but both of you would've read about completely different characters, and the way you see the story will be affected by it. Yeah, you might say that can be the case with any book because different people will think differently about it, but in Rayuela this difference is even bigger, because not only are the characters affected by your own outlook about the world but they're also affected by which path you follow; in a way, even people who read it following the same path will think differently about it, giving it even more interpretations.

And no, you can't read Harry Potter or most other books in any way you want and always have them make sense and that's because of the way they were written, J.K. Rowling wrote Harry Potter as a linear story and if you start in the end, skip most of the middle and end at the beginning you probably won't understand shit about it because it wasn't meant to be read that way, and by doing this it's very likely you'd be leaving out key elements of the story, wheareas Cortázar wrote this book specifically with this intention in mind, taking the time to structure it in a way that allows you to grasp the main elements quickly through any chapter and leaving all the secondary elements up to you. It's also important to note that the book's main arch is about self-discovery, which makes it a relevant excercise of meta-language: the reader is discovering his way through the book while the main character is discovering his way through life.

Julio Cortázar is one of the most important writers in the Spanish language, and I think it's a shame most people over here  are disregarding his work just because it looks ""gimmicky"" or because they think it's a copy of other books (it's not). It's meta as fuck, I honestly think you guys would like it.

"ejchristian86","","","* The rates of false rape accusations are the same as any other crime -  between 5-8% depending on the study.

* That 5-8% is the percentage of reported rapes that are proven to be false **or** for which *not enough evidence could be gathered to build a court-worthy case.* Depending on the laws where you live, ""legitimate rape"" (ugh I hate that phrase) could be dismissed if the perpetrator didn't use violence, if the victim was too intoxicated to give an accurate account, if too much time had passed to collect viable evidence, etc. Just because a rape accusation is made and then dismissed doesn't necessarily mean the accusation was false, just that no one could prove it in a court of law.

* Rape only has about a 40% reportage rate and over 95% of those accused will never spend any time in jail. There has to be some truly shitty planetary alignment to get someone falsely accused of rape imprisoned.

* One of the reasons so many rapes go unreported is because of shit like these threads that automatically assume the accuser is some lying bitch out for vengeance or covering up ""regrettable sex"" or whatever. No one wants to go to the police or even tell their friends if they're afraid no one will believe them. When you make a big deal about false accusations, or when you try to pass harsh punishments for those who make accusations that can't be proven (see second bullet), you make victims afraid to come forward. False rape allegations hurt future victims, too. Every time one makes a headline, it makes it that much harder for future victims to be believed because the false allegations stand out in the popular consciousness. 

* Rape tends to happen between two people behind closed doors. Don't presume to understand ""what really happened"" when your buddy says he was falsely accused or whatever. Look at the percentages and ask yourself if your buddy is really such a special fucking snowflake or if there's actually a wee little chance the accuser is telling the truth. 

* Studies of men on college campuses have revealed that roughly 1 in 25 men will admit to behaviors that would be legally classified as rape  - but they won't admit it if the word ""rape"" is actually used. They'll say, ""Yeah, I used violence or the threat of violence to get a woman to have sex with me,"" and out of the other side of their mouths will say, ""But I'm not a rapist."" If someone you know denies being a rapist, that might just mean they don't consider what they did to be rape when *legally and morally* it is.

* About that 1 in 25 - in the US, that's 6 million men. That's more than the number of Jewish people, or single mothers, or postal workers, or grocery clerks. How many of those demographics do you interact with on a daily basis? Because you've probably met more rapists. Think of how many men you know, and then realize that 1 in 25 of them is a rapist. There were probably 6-8 rapists in my high school class. How many were in yours? How many are in your frat or your classroom right now?

* Think of how many women you know, and realize that 1 in 6 has been or will be raped in her lifetime (a conservative estimate; some researchers place that number as high as 1 in 3). 1 in 6 women will be raped, but only 1 in 25 men will rape. Those rapists in your classroom have probably done it more than once, and will continue to as long as you dismiss their behavior as ""that bitch made it up.""

* 3% of American men (1 in 33) have experienced attempted or completed rape in their lifetimes (comprising about 10% of all rape victims), and 21% will experience sexual violence other than rape. In cases of male rape, 6.5% of perpetrators are female. So as a man, you're more likely to be raped or sexually abused by another man than you are to be falsely accused of rape.

How the situation on this site managed to get so bad I don't know. All that I know is that I've been aware of what has been going on for years now and watched it unfold. 

Last month, the subreddit /r/metaredditcancer was created after [a user made this comment in /r/AskReddit exposing the SJW cabal of mods and admins controlling large swathes of this website.](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2v39v2/what_popular_subreddit_has_a_really_toxic/coe8704?context=3) Reddit's admins inexplicably banned this subreddit and all of its moderators for **no apparent reason whatsoever. I have never seen anything like it on reddit and the admins refused to respond to anyone when they were asked why they shutdown /r/metaredditcancer.** In its place, /r/subredditcancer sprang up to become the new home of /r/metaredditcancer and the new subreddit devoted to discussing reddit's social justice warrior cabal of users in addition to being a place for discussing Ellen Pao's multimillion dollar gender discrimination trial. I have been posting discussion threads with news about the trial each day now since it started so that subscribers can read about what's going on and talk about it as well. I don't know what reddit's admins were thinking when they shut down /r/metaredditcancer for no reason but doing so only spread the word around about how shitty and corrupt some admins and mods are and to show people just how big a problem they have become. 

Buddy Fletcher was an openly gay black man for at least ten years of his life when he married Ellen Pao. This leads us to assume that he is likely bisexual. Despite being married to Fletcher, Pao had an affair with a married co-worker at the venture capital firm she is currently suing for $16 million over alleged gender discrimination. She was cheating on her husband with a co-worker whom she said that she wanted to marry and have kids with, all while still being married to Fletcher. Some people believe that Pao and Fletcher are in a marriage of professional convenience for the sake of career advancement and power and the fact that they are still married with a child after it came out that Pao wanted to leave Fletcher and marry her co-worker only strengthens this theory.

Those two links are in-depth stories about both Fletcher and Pao and they explore their marriage in addition to their shady behavior and business dealings. This week in Ellen Pao's trial, [the defense was not allowed to mention Fletcher's shady business dealings and so the jury wasn't allowed to learn about how Pao and Fletcher have made a living out of suing people for millions of dollars over gender and racial discrimination.](http://fortune.com/2015/03/12/ellen-pao-kleiner-perkins/) Unfortunately, both the jury and most of reddit's users will never learn about how the person in charge of reddit is a scumbag hustler married to another scumbag hustler who creates drama, plays dirty, and then sues people for millions in order to get herself money and power. Pao said this week that she brought her $16 million dollar suit against her former Silicon Valley employer because [she ""wanted to end the boys club"" at her former employer and also so that she could ""level the playing field for women"" and create  ""an environment where people who complained about problems related to discrimination or to other issues would be heard and that the firm would do something about it.”](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/mar/10/silicon-valley-sex-discrimination-lawsuit-ellen-pao-boys-club) Yeah, she says that is the sole and primary motivation for her suit but her financial situation says otherwise in a big, big way.

&gt;What kind of financial straits was her family in when Pao filed this lawsuit? Bad ones.

&gt;When Pao filed her suit in 2012, her husband was having considerable financial difficulty. Kleiner wants to now submit evidence of a tax lien sent to Kleiner for Pao’s partnership interest, and bankruptcy filings of her family, including her husband. They want to say that because her husband’s hedge fund was doing poorly, her family needed money. Pao’s husband is a bit of a controversial figure, as you may have read in the long Vanity Fair profile of them. He also has a history of being litigious.

A group of users, including myself, have been watching mods and admins with social justice warrior and feminist bents worm themselves into positions of power on this site and then abuse their power by running their subreddits and this website in a censorship-happy and agenda-driven way that has been pissing people off in recent times more than ever.

The goal of /r/subredditcancer is to raise awareness about this situation that has developed and to hopefully draw enough attention to this development through subscriber growth and good posting so that those mods that can do something about it will take notice and find a way to push the cancerous moderators out of their subreddits. At least one [**reddit admin or employee has secretly contacted the defense in Pao's trial (Pao's former Silicon Valley venture capital employer) and told them to subpoena reddit employees so that they must talk about what it is like to work for Pao at reddit. This was done to try and aid the defense team against Pao's claims that she was discriminated against on the basis of gender. If subpoenaed reddit employees testify that Pao is hard to work with or for then this will aid the defense's argument that Pao was not discriminated against due to her gender and that she was instead fired because she is a toxic narcissist who is difficult to work with**.](https://np.reddit.com/r/subredditcancer/comments/2wtydj/rogue_reddit_employee_contacts_former_employer_of/) At least one person in a position of influence on this site is trying to do something about this whole situation.

"battleship61","","","Wow.. utterly pathetic reddit. So many comments about how he was anti-semetic despite that being a bold face lie which has been propagated throughout the last 60 years. 

Here are the facts. 

- Art Babbitt (who is Jewish) who worked closely with, and **intensely** disliked Walt even said he saw no evidence of anti-semetism from Walt. 

- The legendary Sherman brothers (both Jewish) said they never saw any evidence of anti-semetism from Walt. 

- The legendary Joe Grant and Disney icon (Jewish) said that *""some of the most influential people at the studio were Jewish.""* and never saw any evidence of anti-semetism. 

- Walt often donated to many Jewish charities in his time

- Walt won the 1955 Man Of The Year from the B'nai B'rith chapter in Beverly Hills.

- Disney biographer Neal Gabler was given unprecedented, and unrestricted access to the Disney vault and files. He concluded that Walt was in fact not anti-semetic and rather suffered from poor public perception because of a few instances. 
 - He had invited German film maker and Nazi propagandist Leni Riefenstahl to Hollywood to promote her film Olympia without knowing her Nazi affiliation. He didn't retract the invitation once he found out which led to the rumours. 
 - Walt also got himself allied with a group called the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals, which was an anti-Communist and anti-semitic organization. Disney eventually distanced himself from the Motion Picture Alliance in the 1950s but was unable to expunge the reputation as anti-semetic because of it, despite the fact he had no time for such political meetings and was considered ""very apolitical"".

**He was not an anti-semetie** it's a rumour that persists because of uneducated sheep who hear a rumour and take it as gospel. Many of the most important and integral people at Disney studios were Jewish. Do you honestly think that if Walt was anti-semetic that he would A) Hire them, and B) If he were anti-semetic one of the many Jewish individuals there would have fucking said something? Babbitt pretty much hated Disney and vice versa, never accused him of anti-semetism. 

Get your facts straight Reddit. 


**EDIT**: Because people are demanding I provide sources to back what I'm saying. How ironic considering they'll believe he was an anti-semite without any sources.

Quote from Gablers book regarding what Joe Grant said
&gt; “Of the Jews who worked [with Disney], it was hard to find any who thought Walt was an anti-Semite,” Gabler reported. “Joe Grant, who had been an artist, the head of the model department, and the storyman responsible for Dumbo... **declared emphatically that Walt was not an anti-Semite.** ‘Some of the most influential people at the studio were Jewish,’ Grant recalled, thinking no doubt of himself, production manager Harry Tytle, and Kay Kamen [head of Disney’s merchandising arm], who once quipped that Disney's New York office had more Jews than the Book of Leviticus. **Maurice Rapf concurred that Walt was not anti-Semitic**; he was just a ‘very conservative guy.’”

"alexdrac","","","i'm romanian. we **really** love using the words for male and female genitalia in your day to day conversations. 

we use the word *""pizda""* - which means ""cunt"" or ""vagina"" - to express appreciation. so it's like ""cool"" or ""great"". anything that can be called ""cool"" in english, can be called *""pizda""* in romanian. something that is *pizda""* is very positive, usually surprisingly MORE positive then was expected (any object, action, etc. can be *pizda*. not people). people are called ""*pizdos/pizdoasa*"" (m/f) the literal translation being ""vagin-y""  or ""very vagina like"",are more then just cool, they are impressive, to be respected and admired, and who are so by being themselves. ""Clint Eastwood e clar un mos pizdos"" - ""C.E. is definitely a *pizdos* old man""  

it has negative uses too, but fewer, such as it's synonymy with the american ""bitch"" , used for people who display two faced, manipulative, passive-aggressive behaviors or any other kind of psychological aggression. *""Nu mai fi asa o pizda si spune-mi ce ai de zis""* ""stop being such a &lt;vagina&gt; and tell me what you have to say"" 

in romanian we use the word *""pula""* - penis -**a lot** , even more then the english speakers use ""fuck"". we tend to use *pula* more creatively and to express feelings, thoughts and outcomes, all negative or at best neutral. it's a conversation filler too, the words ""pula mea"" lit. ""my penis"" are used like the words ""mmmhh"" ""like"" ""so yeah"" ""basically"" in english. 

something is of low quality, is worse then expected - ""this thing sucks"" - *""e ca pula""* (it's like penis). ""the water is cold as *pula*"" or ""the team played like *pula*""

when something is in the way, we say it's sitting in the middle of the road like a penis  *sta ca pula in mijlocul drumului""

the shirt looks bad on/doesn't fit you ""*iti sta ca pula*""

""fuck, fuck, i hit my toe"" would be *""baga-mi-as pula-n ma-sa, mi-am lovit degetul""* (i'll stick my penis in it's mother, i hit my toe)

something is having trouble functioning properly, but it's not completely broken, we'll say *""merge ca o pula""* - ""it works like a penis"". when it's completely broken we say it *""o pula merge""* . So when it's **like a penis**, it's terrible, but functioning. When it's functioning level is *pula*, it doesn't work at all. 

""fuck you, you fucking asshole/cunt"" is *""sa-mi bag pula-n dumnezeii/mortii ma-tii""* meaning ""i'll stick my penis in your mother's gods/dead relatives""

a simple ""fuck you"" is *""sugi pula""* - ""suck dick"". note that there's an equivalent expression, just as popular, if not more so *""du-te-n pizda ma-tii""* (sometimes shortened to just *""pizda ma-tii""* or *""te-n ma-ta""* ) - Go back inside your mother's vagina! . the connotation here is not that the person should go to a bad place, but that his/her mother's vagina, a good thing, should suffer ,while you're also being told to disappear from the face of the earth. there's no sexual connotation to this one, the sexual one, also used interchangeably with the previous two is *""s-o fut pe ma-ta, mai &lt;insert whatever insult you want here&gt;""* which means ""may i fuck your mother, you &lt;retard/idiot/cow/pig/shit/etc.&gt;

when we are surprised negatively we say *""ce pula mea?""* - what the fuck. 

when you're in trouble, we say that *""ai belit pula""* (or *""ai belit-o""*. ""o"" as a suffix replacing a feminine noun) - lit. ""you've flayed your penis"" ; ""you're really fucked""

when something good, positive ends up going bad beyond repair, or when someone dies of their own fault or fucks up their lives really bad, we say that *""s-a dus pe pula""* - ""he/she/it's gone on the penis"" - eng ""fucked up really bad"" ""completely gone to shit""

extremely drunk - *""beat pula""* lit. ""penis drunk"" (not as in drunk as a penis, the *pula* here being a level on a scale, the worst level one can get himself to) 

*""Pula""* can mean ""nothing"", ""fuck all"" = *""o pula""*
""did you find anything ? no, nothing "" *""ai gasit ceva ?  O pula""* 

The two words *""pula mea""* work really well together with para and non-verbal communication, like tone, posture, volume, gestures, etc. 

here's an example of a typical conversation between friends 

*Ce pula mea-i asta ?* (what my penis is this?) (in a surprised, slightly angry, inquisitive voice, with an upward tone. meaning ""what happened here and how could you have done this, you idiot?"")

*Pula mea ....* (descending tone, lower volume, looking down, head tilted forward, lifting both shoulders. meaning ""does it really matter how this happen. obviously i fucked up"")

*In pula mea ?! Sa-mi bag pula, zau daca nu* (exasperated voice, raising the arms and then lowering them slowly, sighing . meaning ""really, dude ?! you should have known better, really"")

*Scuze, pula. Pula mea.... Hai ca dau o bere !* (first two sentances in a low, but rising tone. the last ""mea"" has a long aaaa at the end, to express admission of guilt, while emphasizing lack of intent in causing harm. translation ""sorry dude. i fucked up, but didn't mean to. Let me buy you a beer""

*Pula mea ...  ok ! Hai! Dar dai 3 beri.* (the first ""pula mea"" and it's conceding tone of voice, while still bearing a little anger, is to say that he's forgiven .... again. The past can't be changed, so with a bit of a defeated tone, he forgives , but asks for 3 beers, not one. Translation ""what can i do now ... fine. Come on, you're buying me 3 beers""

*Pizda ! Hai !*  (with a sigh of relief, and a smile on, he says ""Vagina - *Great* Let's go)

Anyway, i'll stop my wall of *pula* here. I think i made my point. 

If you're interested in more pula, a classic romanian story called ""The story of the pula"" or ""the story of stories"" written by I. Creanga in the 1880s is available in english. It's got jesus and saint peter, irreverent peasants and horny noblemen's wives, a field of pula as big as the eye can see, and a butt fucked priest to boot. It's a comedy, written by a man who used to be a priest and it's very popular in Romania. 

but officially, nobody EVER uses that word, EVER. Kids get beaten by their parents if they are heard saying it. If it's used twice in a movie, there's a national uproar against ""the filth in art these days"". 

And i'll end with my favorite saying, not insult/curse. It's about how one choice in life excludes another and you have to take that into consideration. And once you make your choice you can't complain or go back on it. It;s similar to ""you can't have your cake and eat it too""
*Nu merge si cu pula-n cur si cu sufletu-n rai""* translated : One cannot have both a cock up his ass and his soul through the gates of heaven.There is no limit of topics for the use of the *pula*, even philosophy and religion can use the jolliness that the pula brings to any conversation.  

Edit : the last paragraph added to show that the *PULA* is truly ubiquitous in the romanian language. But God forbid the press hear someone say it once, everyone suddenly turns pious and pure, shocked by such foul language that they have NEVER, NEVER heard before. 

Edit 2 : well fuck me twice and call me shirley, GOLD, i struck gold after year's hard work . back to /r/conspiracy and /r/polandball for me, this is too exciting. thank you kind stranger. *Sa-mi bag pula daca ma asteptam*. ---&gt;Surprize, complete surprise ""I'll put my dick in it if i'd had any idea of this""

"Gertiel","","","**TL;DR: Awesome grandma collected up excess food and drink passed to her when bussed to destination due to airport closing. It was like Mary Poppin's bag, only with canned drinks and boxed lunches.**

My grandmother decided to fly down for my brother's wedding some years ago. My folks live about ten minutes from a smaller local airport and you can get a puddle jumper from DFW to that airport. Grandma found some deal online and so decided it would be kinder not to make one of my folks drive 3 hours to pick her up in Dallas. Grandma by this time was legally blind and using a walker, so when she flew my folks always set it up that she is a wheelchair passenger needing escort. The airline will pick up wheelchair passengers with a cart and see them to their next gate, where typically an airline employee will then wheel them onto the plane if you request help in advance. This way we ensure my grandma, who wouldn't be able to read the signs, finds her way.

So my grandma gets to Dallas and shortly thereafter the airport is shut down due to weather. Grandma phones us to say she's been comfortably ensconced in a seat in the airline lounge with free food and drinks, so don't worry about her. The day wears on. Grandma doesn't have a cell phone, but her neighbor in the lounge lets her use his every hour and a half or so. Eventually we don't hear anything for a couple of hours, and my dad starts to get worried. As my dad is chewing out probably the tenth airline employee telling him they don't know anything about where she is and have no way of finding out, my grandmother walks in. The airline eventually gave up and shoved all the passengers for that particular flight onto one of the buses typically used to cart passengers around the airport.

The best part was when my grandma disengaged herself from family hugs explaining she had things that needed to go into the fridge. She proceeded to unload the over-sized purse she liked to travel with, stacking half a dozen boxed sandwich lunches and probably 8-10 canned sodas into the fridge. We were pretty flabbergasted.

Turns out most of the passengers had not been happily ensconced in the lounge with free food and drink, and the thoroughly overstuffed bus ended up leaving around dinner time. The airline's solution was to toss a couple of coolers of cold drinks and boxes of boxed lunch sandwich packs in the front of the bus and ask passengers to hand them back among themselves. Due to her wheelchair passenger needing help status, grandma was the first person on thus seated in the far rear of the bus. As grandma put it ""They just kept passing it back, and what was I gonna do with it? There was no one behind me to pass it on to. So I just kept taking them and putting them into my bag.""

&gt;That's putting it kindly. The strangest moment involved a track called Dead Rat. In the middle of the song, Ono left a 20-second gap. ""I had a bad feeling about that hole -- I kept thinking of it as the dead rat solo,"" he says.

&gt;Sure enough, he recalls, when all the tracks were cut, Ono's assistant showed up with a shoe box. Inside was a dead rat. Ono wanted it incorporated in the recording. So Douglas had his assistant place it on a stool and set up an expensive mike inches away.

"NoMoreKarmaHere","","","Quoting the article:
Using new international measurement standards and technology not available in the past, NOAA’s National Geodetic Survey has calculated the official architectural height of the Washington Monument to be 554 feet 7 11/32 inches -- a highly precise measurement that makes it eligible for inclusion in official registers of the world’s tallest structures. NOAA’s NGS provides the framework for all positioning activities in the nation.

The NGS measurement was made using measuring certification standards of the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitats (CTBUH) and was finalized in December 2014. The final results were reported to the National Park Service in a report that will be available online beginning February 17.

Although the newly established architectural height differs from the historical height of 555 feet 5⅛ inches, neither the starting point nor the so-called “standard deviation” used for the original 1884 measurement is known, making comparison of the two measurements difficult. The new architectural height provides baseline documentation that can be easily reproduced for comparison with future measurements and investigations to determine if the height of the monument is changing in any way.

"recremen","","","Sharing a trout, Frank and Bear idled under a tree on a warm summer afternoon.  Frank had his old, worn-down cowboy hat slid over his eyes, and that cheeky smile that drove Bear wild.  Bear nudged him with his snout, and Frank responded with a light punch to Bear's shoulder, followed with a coy offer of the rest of his fish.  Bear humored him, taking the rest in his maw and offering a loving lick to Frank's hand.  Soaking in the mottled drops of sunlight that managed to pierce the canopy, they both settled into a short, peaceful nap, hand in paw.

The first bullet hit the tree right next to Frank's head, putting another mark in his faded hat.  Bear awoke in a confused started, but Frank shot up like a spring.  He knew.  And he thought he was ready.

They had become too complacent, or maybe too bold, or maybe just too tired.  Sometimes, when you spend so long hiding, you end up actually wanting to be found.  Those stray looks at the grocery store, every giggling whisper in the ear, the interlacing of his fingers in Bear's claws, quick as a falling raindrop and lingering just as long... it all came flooding back in a bittersweet cascade of memory.  And while he didn't want to admit it, that wasn't even what stood out most in his mind.  It was the eyes.  The way people could look at you was worse than any word, real or imagined.  Or maybe, under other circumstances, that would take a back seat, and only the warmth of his lover would flood in, melting away the fear, the doubt, and the hopelessness.  Memory is so unreasonable, so caught up in evidence and circumstance, you could never hope to get the whole picture.  Maybe that's why he'd already forgotten.  Way back, the first time this happened... with *him*.

As Frank focused his eyes and poised to defend his partner, another bear stepped into view, surrounded by his posse, who were all plaid and balding red hair and old rifles, one barrel still smoking from its recent discharge.  The bear, another Bear from another time, glared menacingly at Frank, who could feel the hatred seeping through both that beast's eyes, even if one was mostly scarred over. He looked almost too pleased that the first shot had missed... maybe he wanted Frank to live just long enough to see his face before his whole world fell apart.

Bear stepped forward, face full of concern and fright, but Frank put a hand in front of his nose, guiding him back.  Tears began to well up in Frank's eyes, his mind racing, searching for a way to escape.  Bear backed up more, looked behind him, but Frank gave him a firm pat on the shoulder, and shook his head, almost in resignation, while he whispered ""No... don't run.  It will only be worse if we run...""

The other bear gave a brief grunt and it all went to hell.  There was a rush of flesh, bats, iron pipes, and suddenly Frank become unable to distinguish what he was getting hit with anymore.  The last thing, though, was definitely the ground.  An untender paw grabbed what was left of his hair and yanked his head up, and though the world seemed cloudy and red, he could just barely distinguish Bear's face... no, no that face didn't have a scar yet, this was the first one.  His other Bear.  *You used to be so much more gentle-* Frank's thought was cut brutally short.  Not by a blow to the head, but to the heart.  His head pulled abruptly to the side, Frank saw Bear, lying bloodier than he ever knew a creature could be, breathing shallowly and surrounded by the plaid-wearing thugs.  One gave Frank's lover a swift kick to the head, but this didn't even elicit much more than flinch, he was *so weak now*.

The one with the scar let go of Frank's head, spat on his shirt, turned, and left, his posse trailing shortly behind.  Frank tried to crawl over to his lover, but something was keeping his legs from working.  It was spreading up, too, the more he struggled.  His lungs stopped taking in air after a while, even as he tried desperately to suck it in.  It would be poetic to say that his last thoughts were of Bear, but this isn't the truth.  Dying, for him, was far from college, where he learned about poetry, and the beauty of nature, and the glory of love.  It was far from his Bear, so far and he couldn't reach and it wouldn't matter if he could.  Dying was misery, as he tried in vain to keep his body from seizing, as he tried to ignore the sound of his ribs cracking, spilling blood into his lungs.  Finally, at the culmination of his suffering, the paralysis reached his heart and he lost consciousness.

What would happen if they were found?  How would they be remembered, how would their story be told?  Memory is so unreasonable.  It's caught up in evidence and circumstance, and you could never hope to get the whole picture.  Anyone stumbling upon this scene would assume that Frank and Bear had fought here.  That wouldn't be wrong, I suppose.  Maybe the observer would conclude that they had killed each other.  That wouldn't be far off, either.",1426319774,"","False",1,94,"todayilearned"

"99trumpets","","","Biologist here with a PhD in endocrinology and reproduction of endangered species. I've spent most of my career working on reproduction of wild vertebrates, including the panda and 3 other bear species and dozens of other mammals. I have read all scientific papers published on panda reproduction and have published on grizzly, black and sun bears. *Panda Rant Mode engaged:*

THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE GIANT PANDA. 

Wall o' text of details: 

- In *most* animal species, the female is only  receptive for a few days a year. This is the NORM, not the exception, and it is humans that are by far the weird ones. In most species, there is a defined breeding season, females usually cycle only once, maybe twice, before becoming pregnant, do not cycle year round, are only receptive when ovulating and typically become pregnant on the day of ovulation. For example: elephants are receptive a grand total of 4 days a year (4 ovulatory days x 4 cycles per year), the birds I did my PhD on for exactly 2 days (and there are millions of those birds and they breed perfectly well), grizzly bears usually 1-2 day, black bears and sun bears too. *In the wild this is not a problem* because the female can easily find, and attract, males on that 1 day: she typically knows where the nearest males are and simply goes and seeks then out, or, the male has been monitoring her urine, knows when she's entering estrus and comes trotting on over on that 1 day, easy peasy. It's only in captivity, with artificial social environments where males must be deliberately moved around by keepers, that it becomes a problem.

- Pandas did not ""evolve to die"". They didn't evolve to breed in captivity in little concrete boxes, is all. All the ""problems"" people hear about with panda breeding are problems of the captive environment and true of *thousands* of other wild species as well; it's just that pandas get media attention when cubs die and other species don't. Sun bears won't breed in captivity, sloth bears won't breed in captivity, leafy sea dragons won't breed in captivity, Hawaiian honeycreepers won't breed in captivity, on and on. *Lots and lots* of wild animals won't breed in captivity. It's particularly an issue for tropical species since they do not have rigid breeding seasons and instead tend to evaluate local conditions carefully - presence of right diet, right social partner, right denning conditions, lack of human disturbance, etc - before initiating breeding.

- Pandas breed *just fine* in the wild. Wild female pandas produce healthy, living cubs like clockwork every two years for their entire reproductive careers (typically over a decade).

- Pandas also do *just fine* on their diet of bamboo, since that question always comes up too. They have evolved many specializations for bamboo eating, including changes in their taste receptors, development of symbiosis with lignin-digesting gut bacteria (this is a new discovery), and an ingenious anatomical adaptation (a ""thumb"" made from a wrist bone) that is such a good example of evolutionary novelty that Stephen Jay Gould titled an entire book about it, The Panda's Thumb. They represent a branch of the ursid family that is in the middle of evolving some incredible adaptations (similar to the maned wolf, a canid that's also gone mostly herbivorous, rather like the panda). Far from being an evolutionary dead end, they are an incredible example of evolutionary innovation. Who knows what they might have evolved into if we hadn't ruined their home and destroyed what for millions of years had been a very reliable and abundant food source.

- Yes, they have poor digestive efficiency (this always comes up too) and that is *just fine* because they evolved as ""bulk feeders"", as it's known: animals whose dietary strategy involves ingestion of mass quantities of food rather than slowly digesting smaller quantities. Other bulk feeders include equids, rabbits, elephants, baleen whales and more, and it is *just fine* as a dietary strategy - provided humans haven't ruined your food source, of course.

- Population wise, pandas did *just fine* on their own too (this question also always comes up) before humans started destroying their habitat. The historical range of pandas was massive and included a gigantic swath of Asia covering thousands of miles. Genetic analyses indicate the panda population was once very large, only collapsed very recently and collapsed in 2 waves whose timing exactly corresponds to habitat destruction: the first when agriculture became widespread in China and the second corresponding to the recent deforestation of the last mountain bamboo refuges.

- The panda is in trouble *entirely* because of humans. Honestly I think people like to repeat the ""evolutionary dead end"" myth to make themselves feel better: ""Oh, they're pretty much supposed to go extinct, so it's not our fault."" They're not ""supposed"" to go extinct, they were never a ""dead end,"" and **it is ENTIRELY our fault**. Habitat destruction is by far their primary problem. Just like many other species in the same predicament - Borneo elephants, Amur leopard, Malayan sun bears and literally hundreds of other species that I could name - just because a species doesn't breed well in zoos doesn't mean they ""evolved to die""; rather, it simply means *they didn't evolve to breed in tiny concrete boxes.* Zoos are extremely stressful environments with tiny exhibit space, unnatural diets, unnatural social environments, poor denning conditions and a tremendous amount of human disturbance and noise.

tl;dr - It's *normal* among mammals for females to only be receptive a few days per years; **there is nothing wrong with the panda** from an evolutionary or reproductive perspective, and it's entirely our fault that they're dying out.
