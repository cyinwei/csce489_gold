True,wazoheat,geo,Meteorology | Planetary Atmospheres | Data Assimilation,"Well, if you weren't wearing a space suit, no matter where you started you would die almost instantly because there is essentially no oxygen at any level of Jupiter's atmosphere.

But let's say you do have a space suit. What do you mean by ""step foot on it""? Jupiter is, as you noted in your question, a *gas giant*, meaning it's made of gas. There is no solid surface. And just like Earth's atmosphere, the gas doesn't really have a ""top"", it just gets thinner and thinner as you get further and further from the planet, until at some point it is indistinguishable from interplanetary space (which, you may be interested to know, [is *not* a true vacuum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_space#Interplanetary).

But let's say you just get dropped from some height way outside of Jupiter's visible atmosphere. Once you got within about 200,000 miles (about 300,000 km) of the planet's surface, you'd [die fairly quickly from radiation poisoning](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2001/03/010329075139.htm).

But let's say your space suit has radiation-resisting superpowers. Well due to Jupiter's extreme mass, you'd quickly accelerate through the tenuous upper atmosphere at about [2.6 *g*](http://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/circles/u6l3e.cfm), and burn up just like a meteor flying through Earth's upper atmosphere.

But let's say we dropped you in the middle of Jupiter's upper atmosphere, where the pressure were just about the same as Earth's surface pressure (1 bar). **Now** we're getting somewhere. You'd be falling, but since you're already in the thicker part of the atmosphere, your terminal velocity will be fairly low (taking Jupiter's higher gravity and the atmosphere's lower density into account (it is mostly hydrogen, so its density is about 10 times less than Earth's even though the pressure is similar), your terminal velocity would be about 3200 km/h (2000 mph)). This is probably slow enough that frictional heating and heating from [supersonic compression](http://thesciencepundit.blogspot.com/2010/04/air-friction-myths.html) would not burn you up. 

But hell, for shits and giggles, and in the name of keeping you alive as long as possible, let's give you a parachute, a little smaller than the one given to the [Galileo probe](http://www.agu.org/journals/je/v103/iE10/98JE01766/98JE01766.pdf), so that you fall at about the same velocity initially (~100 m/s, or about 360 km/h, 220 mph). Now we're cooking. Not literally though, because the temperature at this level is fairly comfortable: The temperature is [just about 0 C (32 F)](http://www.agu.org/journals/je/v103/iE10/98JE01766/98JE01766.pdf), so you'd actually be pretty comfy. 

So okay, now you're in your radiation-proof spacesuit, with your handy parachute, falling through the atmosphere just at the top of the clouds. These clouds are made of ammonia, but let's just assume your spacesuit and parachute are okay with that. You'd actually be okay for quite a while; maybe a little bored, but hey, you're on motherfucking **Jupiter**.

After about 5 minutes, you've fallen to the 2-bar level (about twice the average surface pressure on Earth). You are now falling through different clouds, made of [ammonium hydrosulfide and ammonium sulfide](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Jupiter#Vertical_structure). They don't look much different than regular clouds, but they do have a brownish tint that gets browner the deeper you go. Some people may find this surprising, but you won't feel many ill effects, even as the pressure increases rapidly. The bends are only seen with rapid *decompression*; the only ill effects from rapid *compression* are if the compression is too rapid to allow your body cavities (such as inner ear, sinuses, etc) to equalize. So as long as [your ears are clear of wax](http://american-hearing.org/disorders/barotrauma/), you should be fine.

About 10 minutes later, you have reached the 4 bar pressure level, which is about 4 times the average atmospheric pressure at sea level, or about the pressure you'd experience under 30 meters (100 feet) of water. The temperature has actually gotten quite cold, and is now around -40 C (-40 F). But assuming all the capabilities your spacesuit already had, I'm sure it wouldn't be too much to ask for a small heater. You are now passing through clouds of water ice, just like you might see at high altitudes on Earth, but it is getting very dark. You are also being whisked along horizontally by winds reaching 200 m/s (450 mph, 720 km/h), but you barely notice as they are not very turbulent.

15 more minutes go by, and you are now at a pressure of 10 bar, or 10 times normal sea-level atmospheric pressure. At bit before this level you should have changed the mixture of air you are breathing; if you breathed normal air at a pressure of 10 bar or more, you would suffer from acute [oxygen toxicity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_toxicity), which can be quickly fatal (oxygen is actually toxic at much lower pressures, but it would take much longer than our quick decent through jupiter). At the same time, you can suffer from [nitrogen narcosis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_narcosis), which has similar symptoms to inhaling nitrous oxide initially, but can quickly progress to severe symptoms like coma or death. So as you dive deeper your magic space suit also changes the mixture of air you are breathing, so that the partial pressures of oxygen and nitrogen remain the same as you are used to breathing, with the rest filled with helium or neon, which are the only known gasses which don't exhibit a toxic effect at high pressures. But provided this is all taken care of, you are actually quite comfortable, as the temperature has risen back up to about 23 C (73 F).

Another 25 minutes pass, and you are starting to realize you're in trouble. You are in complete darkness now, and the temperature has been steadily increasing as you go further down: now over 100 C (212 F) and still rising fast. Your spacesuit's systems are starting to fail. Within a few minutes, the temperature is over 200 C (392 F), and you don't have much longer to survive. Not wanting to endure a miserable, burning death, you take your conveniently placed cyanide capsule and end your interplanetary adventure.

**But your body keeps falling**.

Down into interior regions where we have little ideas of the exact composition. Pressure and density are increasing drastically, slowing your descent to a crawl. The atmosphere of mostly hydrogen is actually a liquid now, and is now several thousand degrees, but with essentially no oxygen around your body turns into a charcoal-like substance. Your parachute cuts away, but your spacesuit remains intact because it is convenient to the story, and your compressed, dead chunk of bodily substance slowly sinks, beyond 1,000 bar, beyond 10,000 bar...

Until finally, at an insanely crushing pressure of 2,000,000 bar (and a temperature of 5,000 K, about the temperature of the surface of the sun!), you stop sinking. Because your super-spacesuit is conveniently still intact, your body is still mostly water, which is essentially incompressible, even at these incredible pressures. As such, at this level, where the density is about 1 g/cm^3 or about 1000 kg/m^3 (this is approximately the density of water) you and the surrounding atmosphere are the same density, so you will no longer sink! So there your carbonated corpse floats, for all eternity, until the heat death of the universe.

True,pathein_mathein,male,,"Girl and I are in a more than FWB, less than dating relationship. She's got an incredibly bitchy, tough-as-nails demeanor, namely because she works in an incredibly demanding job that more or less requires her to act that way and doubly because she's a woman in what's very much so a boy's club. Naturally, in the bedroom, she's as much of a sub as a girl can me (funny story how I figured that out, but I digress). Get past that and she's incredibly intelligent and sweet. We spend most of the time we're talking arguing. Not fighting, but in some sort of discussion of politics or philosophy or something else high minded. We pretty much see eye to eye on alcohol and sex, the rest we disagree about, but it's all respectful and all with a sense of play, and have some really contentious but interesting discussions.

One night, we went out for some theater. After this weekend we were going to be apart for a while, so there was a lot of sort of expectation built up around it, but I pointedly did little flirting. More pointedly, where we normally went out for drinks and desert afterwards where I would really lay in hard on the teasing, sly dirty talk, and getting her worked up, this time, without discussion, I just lead her to the car and drove home. All this time we're still having a pretty intense discussion about the play, and while she's keeping up, I can tell her sense of expectation and anticipation about what's going on is starting to get to her.

We get to my apartment, continuing the discussion all the while. More or less mid-sentence I pinch her wrist in my fingers, and doing what's an incredibly forceful act in what amounts to slow motion, pull it behind her back, push her to the wall, reach under her dress to pull down her underwear, and finding her more than sufficiently ready for sex, undo my fly and take out my cock. Then things get fast as I grab her hair with my other hand to pull her face to the wall and start to fuck her from behind, both still otherwise fully dressed in opening night theater-going attire. The sex is explosive. She's more or less howling with pleasure from the moment of get go, and the dirty talk is dialed way up to eleven immediately. It didn't last long, but it was crazy intense.

The moment I'm finished, I let go my grip and step back, whereupon she just collapses, crumples down to the floor. I take a step back, thinking to walk off all cool and proper and realize that I need to have a lean on something before collapsing myself. For a good minute we're there, in the near-dark of the apartment, panting in silence as she eyes me with this odd look that seems a mixture of a sense of utter surrender with a predatory gleam.

Then she starts to stand, and once up immediately jumps right back *to where the conversation stopped*. Like, she starts by stating how she thought that I'd finish the sentence I was saying, then goes into her rebuttal. It's just like we just walked in.

""Oh,"" I think, ""this is going to be a fun new game.""

True,smile_e_face,coei,Anglican Communion,"Look, man.  I'm sorry that I snapped at you.  I've had a truly terrible day, but that's no excuse.  I really wanted to write a nice, long response, but I've been trying to write this for over an hour now, and I don't think I can write it in a way that you'll understand.  I don't mean to insult you.  Let me explain.  

Disclaimer: I'm...fairly intoxicated right now, so I may be more open than usual.

I'm colorblind.  Completely.  Some people can't distinguish red and blue, or green and yellow; I see everything in various shades of black, white, and gray.  The concept of ""color"" means nothing to me.  I mean, I understand it on an intellectual level - different frequencies of light or concentrations of ink - but I don't really grasp it.  Explaining color to me is like explaining music to a someone who's tone-deaf.  He'll get that the notes change and that you like it, but he won't understand the emotional pull of music or why everyone gets so excited about it.  I feel as if I'm having the same problem with you when I try to explain why I believe in God.  

You want me to give you a concrete reason, a distinct series of statements leading to a rational conclusion that, Q.E.D, God exists.  You want something real.  But people are strange when it comes to the word ""real""; they apply it differently to positive and negative situations.  When you tell someone that you've practiced for months and you're ready for your concert, some jerk will always say, ""Wait until you get up there under the hot lights and in front of all those people.  Then you'll know what it's *really* like.""  Here, the important, ""real"" thing is the emotional turmoil you'll go through when you get up on stage; the physical facts - that you've practiced a great deal, know the piece, and know the stage - don't matter.  But, when you tell people that you had a spiritual experience while walking through the woods under the sunrise, they say, ""All that *really* happened is you heard some wind through the trees and say some pretty lights.""  This time, the emotional aspects of the situation don't matter,  but only the bare physical facts.  Heads you win, tails I lose.

Spirituality is real to those who feel it.  Call it crap if you want.  Call it evasion or intellectual laziness or ""settling.""  But I assure you that, to believers at least, it is real.  It is not something that we feel when we read warm, fuzzy stuff about Jesus and Heaven.  It is something that we feel every day, all the time, the same way that most people can see color and hear music.  It is what made St. Francis of Assisi spend hours contemplating birdsong.  It is what drove Mother Theresa to spend her entire life ministering to the sick and the downtrodden.  It is what allowed a poor, uneducated man like John Bunyon to write a book that astonished the whole world.  But some people, including many, many of the members of /r/atheism, are either consciously or unconsciously closed off from it.  They claim only to want evidence to believe in God, but they will only accept evidence on their terms and in their way.  They rightly deride the close-mindedness of the Fundamentalists, but they refuse to open their minds to the slightest possibility that we humans cannot reduce the whole universe to mathematics.  If God Himself were to appear before their eyes and speak with the voice of thunder, they would be more likely to find a psychologist than a priest.  Not all atheists are like this, but a lot of them are, and that's what makes it hard to explain faith to them.

You know what the sad thing is?  After all this, you're probably still going to think that I'm an idiot.  I don't really care - no offense - but it would be nice to be able to deal with each other on terms of equal respect.  There was a time, not so long ago, when intuition and heartfelt sentiment were thought to be an integral part of good judgment.  Those days are over, though.  It's all cold reason and calculus now, and all the blood is drained from our minds.  I don't meant to complain.  It's just hard sometimes to be thought inferior every day by these men who may as well be machines.

True,PluffyNupkins,,,"Don't know how you went about processing / making your wine, but that looks like lees. Lees are sediment made up from different things. Mostly it's from dirt that's collected on the grape skins and particles from the skins themselves, in addition to dead yeast. Vineyards that are in dusty areas will have more lees, as there will literally be dirt in the wine. This is why you ""rack"" a wine, or siphon off the wine into another container at different stages depending on varietal and/or style. It's perfectly natural and nothing to worry about.

There are 3 different patient id's and each has a different number of medical records.

This counts the number of times that particular patient id has showed up. Note the use of absolute references ($) in the formula.

[Step 2 - Create new columns](http://i.imgur.com/dSPYg.jpg)

[Step 3 - id column and vlookup](http://i.imgur.com/eeEsz.jpg)

At the very left, create an id column that is patientid&amp;count. This is a unique identifier that allows the vlookup to get the info. The vlookup for each new column section gets the associated medical record count. So, notice the 2 at the top, it gets the id&amp;2 record.

## Initial concept

Imagine you're at a table with some friends. You come up with a set of rules to create a type of money that you can only use between each other. You decide that math is really hard, but doable, given enough time and energy. You decide that there's a certain math problem that you all like to do, and you know you can find ways to do it faster and faster as time goes on. You set how many times you want to try to solve a really hard math problem as the basis for work.

## Mining

Every so often, when someone in the group solves a that really hard math problem, that person tells the others of their triumph. The others can quickly verify that the solver is truthful, so after checking their work, they all write down that that person has gained some money. When someone lies about solving a problem, everyone knows and ignores their claim. This continues until we've solved the math problem the number of times we've set (this will take more than 100 years).

That briefly describes ""mining"". Now, transactions. 

## Transactions

A transaction is when someone sends money to someone else.

When someone in the group spends money, they tell everyone else in the group to whom they're sending their money. However, it's done in a way that makes it really hard to actually tell who is sending and who is receiving. It's not 100% impossible to tell, but it would take someone a lot of time to figure out.

When that someone sends money, everyone can check to ensure that that person actually has enough money to send what they claim to have sent. This is especially important to the receiver. If enough people say that the sender doesn't have enough money to send, the sender's transaction is ignored. He'll be able to try again in a little bit (and hopefully he'll be more honest or careful this time!).

The really cool thing is that everyone who wants to send or receive money knows how much everyone else is sending or receiving, even though they can't really identify a person behind the transaction. Plus, a person can look at the history of every transaction since the beginning of this fun system. This is called the public ledger.

Whenever someone sends money, they send a little bit extra along with their amount. This is called the transaction fee, and it's kinda like a tip. It's given as a reward to the person who solves the really hard math problem as an extra bonus! Over time, the reward money the solver earns will go away. Eventually, this transaction fee reward will be larger than the reward for solving ever was! So, this transaction fee gives people a reason to keep solving math problems forever.

## Blockchain

Whenever someone sends money (creates a transaction) and their send is truthful, there's a hash created. A hash is like a secret word that you can only remember if you combine a few other words you always know. By combining some of the information about a recently solved math problem and some information about the current transaction, you can ensure that no one can fake our transaction again - not even yourself. Each transaction is contained within some notes about that recently solved math problem - these notes are called ""blocks"". 

When we hash the blocks and the transactions together, it creates a chain with links that are impossible to replace without going back and doing all of the math problems again *and* convincing all of the other people that your new, replacement work is the real work. This is virtually impossible, so transactions and blocks are not able to be faked or undone. 

## Getting Bitcoin

When someone new wants to join in so that they can use the money, too, they request a copy of all of the notes -- the blockchain -- and thus have their own copy of the public ledger. They can look at everyone's transactions and add their own to the mix, as long as they adhere to the rules we've all agreed on.

If they want to get some money to spend for themselves, they can try to solve math problems (mining), exchange some valuable item to someone already in the group in exchange for some money (exchanges or stores), or do something to help someone in the group so that they can earn the money, like mowing their lawn or cleaning their room.

It used to be really easy to do the math problems, but it's getting harder and harder daily. Soon, the amount given to someone when they solve a problem will halve! They'll get only 25 coins instead of 50 coins. There are some good reasons behind this, but they're a little hard to explain to a five year old. So, people are looking to buy into the group's money or do something in exchange for money they can spend within the group.

True,AsiaExpert,asia,"China, Korea, and Japan","Sorry for the MASSIVE post but it's a good chance to talk about ninja in general haha!

**Sengoku Era**

**Ninja and Kunoichi**

**Iga and Koga** were the two regions that were notable for their systematic training of ninja. This is not the only thing they did, nor were they the only regions to train ninja, but there is a fair amount of records of them putting significant resources and manpower into training ninja so while it might be ignoring the other characteristics of these two regions, they were indeed famous, or rather, infamous for their ninja.

So no the Iga were not a **ninja clan**. They were a clan and region like any other and their worlds were not some mystical secret ninja society. Coincidentally, the two different schools of thought on ninjutsu are named after their respective regions, **Igaryuu and Kogaryuu**.

There is a lot of mystery and exoticism surrounding ninjas and their secret arts. **This is not by accident**.

One of the ninja's greatest advantages was that **no one knew anything about them** and they had no idea how they managed to accomplish amazing feats.

Sometimes people would hear of their accomplishments and really embellish the story. Other times the ninja communities **themselves would spread insane rumors**. This was obviously great for business.

When you advertise that you essentially employ supernatural killers who can't be seen or heard and then be long gone before anyone's the wiser, you're going to get a lot of offers for work.

The things that they actually did are based on three things: **extreme physical conditioning, mental conditioning**, and **training with specialty weapons and tools**.

Not everyone could become a ninja. Firstly, **all ninja were also samurai**. There were some who were not samurai and still engaged in espionage and maybe assassination but they **were not recognized as true ninja**. It required insane amounts of **balance as well as strength and endurance**. The biggest thing that ninja trained would not be how to disappear in smoke or create illusions, but **upper and lower body strength**, especially focusing on the core and building a supreme sense of balance.

Then they required a great deal of **intelligence and patience**, probably much more than they needed physical strength. Their **understandings of military strategy** and **how to gauge military strength** were naturally developed and honed. Their main job was not to assassinate but to **gather information**. Sometimes it was their job to stake out or follow people and places for days or weeks at a time. Other times they would be required to arrive ASAP, get as much information as they could in a short time, then return before dinner got cold and report. 

Other times they would **infiltrate institutions** or courts. Obviously not everyone was cut out for this, but ninja were expected to be able to be samurai and **double as hidden spies**. 

Finally, we get to the secret techniques, weapons, and tools or **'ninjutsu'**. Often they were **not fantastical things** but very practical set of teachings and tools.

Their secret arts and 'ninjutsu' did *not* teach the ninja how to do superhuman feats like jumping over buildings or creating illusions at will. In fact, a lot of their more flashy 'ninjutsu techniques' actually rely on the fact that there would be **several ninja seamlessly working as a team**, but would make it seem like there was only one. 

Ninjutsu written in scrolls and ninja primers consistently talk about how to accurately gauge an enemy's military strength, overall war preparedness, how to move across borders and towns undetected, intelligence and counter-intelligence techniques in depth. In general, ninjutsu teaches how to fight an **information war** as well as **control of information**, which are essential to war planning. Physical techniques such as 'disappearing' and 'wall scaling' are definitely in the minority of the teachings. 

Ninja consistently had a huge list of accomplishments because their leaders consistently **employed amazing people**. Just like how the Special Forces in a military don't become living embodiments of death because of what they learn in training. They simply **only recruited the best of the best**. 

Sure the training helped but them develop some new skills but **even without it**, they would still be some of the scariest people you could meet in a dark alley. Same for any ninja. The ninja schools merely gave structure to a profession that already existed. 

When revealed, their more physical techniques and ninjutsu arts are tricks that play on the flaws of how the human mind tends to view the world. If anything, ninjutsu is an in depth study, **an inside look at how the human mind** works as the ninja understood it, and how they exploited it. 

For example, they did **NOT** wear completely black tight fitting body suits. When they were in regular samurai gear ( the gear they normally wore, as they *really* were samurai), they often wore lighter and plain kimono. 

They would wear **monk outfits or disguise as beggars** while traveling or escaping to avoid detection. Other times they would pretend to be **traveling performers** and actually attract as much attention as possible on purpose, in a sort of reverse-psychology. The idea is that a samurai would never fall to such lows so they would never imagine in a million years that the smelly hobo monk is actually carefully gauging their military strength. 

Other famous techniques include **jumping great heights** (boosted by teammates) **creating illusions to escape** (throwing rocks/ debris to make sound plus the presence of *actual* teammates throws off the enemy when they're trying to get an accurate head count), and **disappearing from plain sight** (ninja's would have made very good sleight of hand magicians). 

While this may sound intuitive and obvious as hell, it has wide implications. 

Just like how perspective and complexity of art has changed throughout history, tactics and thinking have grown in complexity as well. These *seem simple* but I'm sure it could be **just as effective** as it was hundreds of years ago. 

Ninjas were sometimes employed as **warriors on the open battlefield**. Those that were trained to fight were naturally just as well trained as any samurai **because they were samurai themselves**. They honed their bodies as much as any warrior and practiced with their weapons religiously as well. They would not be at some sort of 'genre' disadvantage because they were ninja. 

The idea of ninja out in the open sometimes hurts people's sensibilities of a secret agent killer hunter-of-the-night batman illusions. But the matter of fact is that ninja were warriors just like anyone else, with more responsibilities and talents expected of them. In essence, ninja **should not be thought of as separate from other samurai**. **Ninja to samurai** are what **Special Forces units are to the regular infantry** today. They had much more in common than anything else. 

They earn their distinction not with some inherent stealth powers but with their **reserves of experience and talents** earned through thousands of hours of training. 

The main reason to hire a ninja was **information collection**, since assassinations were much harder to ensure, and even if assassination were possible, it was **rarely the ideal choice**. The reality is, assassinations often never happened because killing people is 

#1 **expensive and time consuming** 
#2 **not nearly as effective** as some people wish it were, then and now.

Ninja school of thought was also very deeply rooted in Sun Tzu's Art of War and Zen Buddhism. They considered the battle won **without fighting** to be the greatest achievement. It is said that the ninjas who did assassinate and fight all the time as the **lowest ninja**. They were probably considered less valuable, perhaps even expendable (to a point) and not as skilled in information collection as their higher ranked comrades. 

On the other hand, the **threat of assassination** was an effective tool that many would press to their advantage. Ninjas were much more likely to be used to **prevent assassination** by means of **counter-intelligence and surveillance**. Their greatest advantage would be that they would be **hiding in plain sight**, making no sign that they are watching for assassins or even other ninja. 

Ninjas were indeed the badasses of the night because they were the Sengoku Era versions of SAS or Spec Ops. They were the **masters of their chosen fields**, whether it was **information collection, sabotage, or assassination**. They were feared for their prowess in battle, not simply because they were ninja but because the fact that they were ninja meant that they trained their minds, bodies, and technique as much as any regular samurai. But they were definitely feared a great deal more off the battlefield, where they were the eyes and ears of their **patrons**. 

In this respect, that's why **kunoichi** were that much more amazing. During this time period, Japanese women lived in a definitively patriarchal society where most women were hardly expected to be able to write, nevermind fight and kill. Their place was in the field and at home taking care of many children.

True,xiaorobear,,,"**EDIT for new viewers **: I'm in the middle of revamping everything to take Heart of the Swarm into account. A bunch of stuff has changed. Feel free to ignore this old version.


So, here's my project of all the Starcraft units to real-world scale with each other. Take some of it with a grain of salt (i.e., don't expect measurements to be accurate down to the foot, because that foot could just mean that the proportions of my drawing are off), but it's as good as I could make it based on all available information (new HotS cinematics may alter some of my estimates when they come out). Some sources from the games themselves are contradictory of course, and sometimes designs change— sometimes I've just picked one, sometimes I've averaged them. But, here it is.

If you want to look at an album of the units individually, [here you go!](http://minus.com/m9jqcQIbjHCqe) Each of the photos there are only 1000x1000, though, so it's only an improvement from the poster for the smaller units. I recommend checking out the [Zergling,](http://i.minus.com/i1VQ3uzRszisv.jpg) [Vulture](http://i.minus.com/iZReuNUOcNAzH.jpg), [Spectre](http://i.minus.com/ivYO4SrJQOK1I.jpg), and [the tiny little broodling that Queens spawned in Brood War](http://i.minus.com/ibuSH7e8XBRjUe.jpg). Some of the other drawings of little units really aren't that great, since I knew they wouldn't ever be seen at that size.

**FAQ:**

* You should make a poster! Can I buy a poster?

&gt;Selling this would be a tricky thing since I don't own the designs. I was actually contacted by someone at EG about making a poster out of it, but they stopped responding to my emails? (Waiting for a response was most of the reason I delayed posting this for so long.) I don't know if they could have gotten away with offering it either— if you look at, say, TeamLiquid's merchandise, it's original artwork that's just Starcraft-themed (like their horseheads), not just outright pictures of marines and medivacs and stuff. If you want to print this version out for now, go ahead.

&gt;(An official poster could be nicer, though, I would put in some more effort.)

* How big are the drawings in real life? Did you draw them to scale, or are they all scaled on the computer? What did you draw them with?

&gt; Each drawing was done on a normal, 8.5x11"" sheet of printer paper, in pencil (except for the archon, which was in pen), then colored digitally. Some took most of the page (the carriers), some took up an inch or less (the spider mine). All of them were scaled in relation to each other after they were scanned. The biggest drawing was the mothership; I drew half of it covering one whole piece of paper, then flipped the other half on the computer.

* How do you know how big the units are supposed to be? Obviously the in-game ones are nothing like this.

&gt; The pre-rendered cinematics are my ultimate reference, they're done in a completely realistic style, and a couple dozen units have actually appeared in the cinematics together: mutalisks, battlecruisers, marines, zerglings, lots of things. After that I look at the campaign and cutscenes from SC2 (like the Hyperion's armory, where you see the viking and marauder), and Starcraft: Ghost (vultures, tanks, etc.). Sometimes these sources contradict each other, but, oh well.

&gt; If a unit doesn't appear in any of those, I can look at concept art, sometimes a blizzard artist drew in other units that I can use for scale, like, there's a picture of a colossus battling vikings, or stalkers with marines, that are done by official Blizzard artists, those I'll use. Then if there's really *nothing* left, and a unit hasn't appeared compared to any other unit in *any* of those places? Then I guess. So, units like the Void Ray, Broodling, Brood Lord, Raven... Yeah, those are just me making stuff up. :( The rest are accurate, though!

&gt; Some of the large spaceship sizes are pretty rough estimates, too, because they don't have official stated lengths. But they are based on something, even if it's just estimating based on window-size. Except for the void ray and raven.

&gt; Mostly the contradictions, inconsistencies in the game, and my rough estimates don't bother me: Zerg strains could come in different sizes at different times, bred for different purposes. Terrans have many iterations and versions of the armor, weapons and ships. Just go with it.

* Why not imgur?

&gt; Too big for imgur! I could lower the quality, but nobody wants that.

* Wait a second... This isn't all the units!

&gt;You're right. It's 85 of them. I didn't do quite a few:

&gt; * Unique hero units (with the exception of Kerrigan): the Torrasque, the *Void Seeker* (Zeratul's ship), the *Hyperion,* etc.

&gt; * The hybrid units. It's just Protoss, Terran and Zerg.

&gt; * Cancelled/upcoming units, like the Soul Hunter, Nomad, the Hydrolisk (an underwater hydralisk variant that was only in concept art back when SC: Ghost had underwater stuff), the Brain Spectre, etc. I *almost* did the HotS units when they were announced, but I'm glad I waited, since the Shredder got completely cut and repurposed.

&gt; * I also only included different versions of the same unit when they had a significant difference in size or design (ultralisks, battlecruisers, carriers). So, for example, the Zergling pictured is a hybrid of the Ghost and SC2 zergling designs, while the wing-upgraded version, SCBW cutscene version, and SCBW in-game version are just excluded, sadly. I didn't do all the different civilians, scientists, infested civilians, etc. either, because, again, all the same size.

* Wait... [Grizzly](http://starcraft.wikia.com/wiki/Grizzly)? [Stinger](http://starcraft.wikia.com/wiki/Stinger)? [Vindicator](http://starcraft.wikia.com/wiki/Purifier)?

&gt; Yeah, they were originally from Starcraft: Ghost, I put links to their wiki pages above. The Stinger is basically Halo's Warthog, in Starcraft.

* SCG but no HotS?

&gt; When HotS comes out, I'm positive that the in-game and prerendered cutscenes will contradict a bunch of my guesses for units like the roach and infestor, so the whole thing will need a revamp then anyway. Then I'll add the new units, and the Zerg Leviathan!

* Why isn't the firebat the same size as the marauder? It's pretty clear in SC2 that they are.

&gt; I drew the firebat from Starcraft: Ghost, and old firebats were marine-sized. Actually, here the marine is actually wearing SC2 armor, the medic is wearing SCBW armor, the firebat is wearing SCG armor, and the ghost is male while the spectre is female— just my way of representing all the different designs. 

* Why do some of the drawings look crappy/different?

&gt; The quality and style actually varies quite a bit. When I started, I was much sketchier and more original ([check out my old, super-cool original carrier design](http://i.minus.com/ibwgngzrAOuPJN.jpg), and the Void Ray), but I got more diagramlike as I realized the sketchiness wouldn't look good at poster-resolution. Some units are from the sketchy phase, some are from a super-faithful to the in-game units phase —compare the Brutalisk to the Ultralisks next to it to see the difference. I like to use the battlecruisers' style the best.

&gt; Also, not all of the drawings look the way I'd like. I'd actually redo a lot of them, and they'd look a lot better. But I could do that forever, and it would take forever, so, we're left with some of the sketchy ones.

* SCVs have legs?? They hover.

&gt; Yeah, they tuck them up and hover in game, but, yes, if you look at the artwork. On the SCV: mine's mostly combining the [SC2](http://www.sc2blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/scv-art.jpg) and [SCG](http://www.starghost.com/images/art/art16.jpg) designs.

True,fauxmosexual,civilian,,"I can't be bothered to address each of the terrible human beings in this thread individually so I'm just gonna do one big one for the lot of you.

We understand that when you call something gay you aren't referring to it's sexual preferences at all and to you the word probably doesn't have any sexual connotations in that context. In fact you're probably a really cool guy who has a gay friend who you're totally ok with and that one time you and your straight mate went to a gay bar for a gawp and were TOTALLY not creeped out. But regardless of how you mean it, in a small way we're reminded that we live in a society which is completely OK with the HOMOSEXUAL = BAD idea to the point where bad and gay are literally synonymous. We're reminded that we're a minority, an other, a byword for weak and unmanly, something that was okay to hate.

And if you did use it, I probably wouldn't even call out out on it. As a stranger at a social gathering I might give you a dirty look and not talk to you. I get it, you're not a bad person and you don't mean to offend and as minor discrimination goes it's not even that huge a deal. I'd probably think more of you as a human being if you didn't, but I'm not about to cry myself to sleep over it.

But all of you who are explaining why it's right, how it's not the same word anymore, who have by the power of lexicographic logic explained away my feelings of offense as wrong, are shitlords. It's a problem that can so easily be fixed just by choosing one of the many thousands of words you could use in that sentence whose meaning *doesn't* directly stem from the ""gays are disgusting"" attitudes that were dominant in this country within living memory.

I can quite easily forgive tongue slips or using a word without thinking about how it effects people. I understand there's a time and a place where you can use that language in a context that doesn't cause harm - if you and your mates are of the maturity where you can make funny gay jokes without furthering homophobia or alienating anyone, more power to you. I get that there is no malicious intent at all.

But when you come out actively arguing that to be offended is illogical and wrong, when you refuse to do so much as even recognise that just maybe the offense I feel has some validity to it, or when you argue that there's nothing wrong with using the unspoken feeling of dislike towards gay people to make your meaning clear, you're being a dick. Stop being a dick. Nobody likes a dick, you dick. Maybe exert a tiny amount of effort in expanding your vocabulary and make the world a slightly better place instead of being a dick.",0,1352093676,,0,False,1,c6wlkap,t3_12mxlr,t1_c6wlkap,t3_12mxlr,,1430323199,582,False,newzealand,t5_2qhma,582
True,Kanilas,,,"Here's the rundown as I understand it, keeping in mind I'm a graphic designer with an interest in a surplus AKM, not a political policy expert:

Technically, exports from Russia are still covered under the Jackson-Vanik amendment. It's a really old 70's law that bans normal trade relations with any countries named in it, which the Soviet Union was one of those.

When China joined the WTO back in 2001, the law was amended to exclude them, as the law was now in conflict with the WTO regulations in regards to China. To avoid more problems, the same will likely happen with Russia after the election in the lame duck session of Congress. Joe Biden's also been pushing for just scrapping the whole thing, so that's a possibility too.

The reason we're not getting any more arms from Russia's surplus stocks is because of the voluntary ban Bill Clinton negotiated with Russia in 1996, keeping Russian surplus arms out of the US. (That's also why Russian SKS's command a bit of a premium, there's only a certain number in the US.)

When joining the WTO, the US and Russian both are allowed to keep one control on imports/export to grandfather in, in one industry. Most likely, the US will use theirs on Chemicals/Technology, since that's what we want to protect the most. Keeping out SKS's, AKM's and other stuff like that is probably pretty low on the list, because that one exemption is potentially worth billions of dollars when applied to the right industry.

If you read deeper into the situation, the Russian Izmash plant has been struggling lately, as the Russian military has downsized from it's old Cold War days (unlike the US military) and there's such a surplus of AK rifles across the world that last forever, that it's hard to move product. They sell a good number of guns to the US market, and may be busy making AK-12's soon. Russia will have to keep Izmash on life support, as it's a key part of their Defense Industry, but it'd be a lot more advantageous for them to clean out their old warehouses full of AKM's, SVD's, TIGR's, AK-74's, SKS's, MP-443's, etc, and lots and lots of ammo, which would help Izmash pay for itself. It's not a permanent solution to the plant's financial troubles, but it could infuse a ton of cash into it.

So yeah, hopefully in a year or two there will be crates of SKS's, AKM's and all sorts of other fun Russian surplus being unloaded at American docks. It took China 18 months, I think, to start seizing the benefits. So, soon hopefully, especially since the Russians absolutely realize how popular the SKS was in the 90's, and how popular the AK platform is in the US.",0,1352137076,,0,False,1,c6wsfxp,t3_12n06g,t1_c6wsfxp,t1_c6wo814,,1430326595,3,False,guns,t5_2qhc8,3
True,zeplikescrewed,,,"Ah, Rawls. I'm taking an exam for my senior seminar on A Theory of Justice in two hours.

I think that within the constraints of Rawls' theory, the difference principle is excellent. It is a huge component of his idea that justice is fairness. If it is just to be fair, then the difference principle, in order to be in line with Rawls' ideals must promote fairness (and of course, uphold the most extensive set of basic liberties as defined in his first principle of justice). It is easy to define fairness for an egalitarian point of view, so as to say that for things to be fair, all members of societies must be equal, socially and economically. Rawls recognizes that it is just not practical or even possible to make everything equal, so strict equality is not his goal. So, in a society, there will be inequalities. His difference principle serves to ensure that when those inequalities arise, they must benefit the least advantaged members of society. ""Least advantaged"" can be defined in many different ways, but all ways suffer from some arbitrariness, and for the difference principle to be applied, it is not necessarily important to closely define what least advantaged means. Anyway, the reason I think the difference principle is so brilliant (not to say it's perfect, but it's damn well thought out) because if it is in effect, it makes a great difference in how much wealth a person can gain, because the only just distribution of wealth is that which benefits the least advantaged. 

So, when you consider that the point of Rawls' theory is to establish justice as fairness, and that fairness cannot, in practice, mean perfect equality, the difference principle as well as the principle of equal liberty and the fair opportunity of equality work together to ensure the next best thing. That, being inequalities that are fair because they are to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged persons, and attached to the offices and positions open to all under conditions of equality of opportunity. 

Sorry, that probably doesn't flow too well or make enough amount of sense, I have way too much information jumbled around in my brain to answer a vague question. Basically, I think his argument is great when viewed in line with his theory as a whole. Still, it is flawed, and isn't too clear when it comes to applying his theory to an actual society. Whether he's right or not, I think Rawls' Theory of Justice is an incredible work.",0,1352147736,,0,False,1,c6wvgng,t3_12mm6a,t1_c6wvgng,t3_12mm6a,,1430328024,6,False,PoliticalPhilosophy,t5_2qn9g,6

True,Wattsherfayce,,,"&gt;Totally false. A simple and earnest question of ""how was your day?"" is a form of support. How does virtually everyone answer that question? ""fine.""
Imagine what might happen if the answer was ""you know I'm a little sad and I'm not entirely sure why.""

More often than not people ask how you are doing out of habit, not out of true curiosity or coming from a place of heart. Answering truthfully only lets people realize how much they don't want to be around anymore because you are such a downer. Not only that, but it makes the person who was asked how shitty and pathetic they are because they will go through all the shitiness of the day and make them feel worse. Maybe for some people asking them how they are and letting them vent might help a little, but it's the least amount of support a person can give other than not bothering at all.

Now it seems like your just trolling now. Your attempt at correlation made no sense. If you made them a healthy meal they would eat it (if they are hungry). If you made a fat person get off their buts and work out and eat right then they will usually get better, but no one ever wants to bother to help someone in need. For many reasons... Either because its too much time, they have other people like their family to take care of, too hard, they don't have the patience or they don't have access to the healthier food and a gym or whatever it is.

A few months ago, I had driven to my parent's house pretty late in the day. After leaving, I'd noticed a dog had been hit and was lying in the middle of the road. So I parked my car and put on the emergency lights, with my headlights clearly illuminating the dog. I put on a pair of gloves (I'm an EMT, I always have a box of gloves in my car, not only because it's always a good idea to have a pair just in case, but because I often do this with animals that have been hit, out of respect) so I could move it to the side of the road, where it wouldn't be hit anymore. When I finally made it up to the dog, it had lifted it's head, and was breathing normally. Turns out, the car had only hit and broken the dog's back legs. The dog was fully responsive and didn't seem to have lost a lot of blood. Thinking this meant that the dog had a chance of living, I went to spread out a couple plastic bags in the back seat of my car. as I was doing this, I noticed a car speeding down the road. I had rushed to the side of the road, directing the car to move to the opposite side, to avoid hitting the obviously visible dog lying in the road. Instead though, the driver ran right over the dog, right in front of me. Now, as an EMT, I've seen some pretty intense things, but I'm always just there for the aftermath. I was pretty freaked out to have watched this dog be brutally run over by a speeding car. I just stood there motionless, staring at the dog's remains. However, I noticed that the car pulled into a house only a couple houses down from my parents'. Being blinded by a mixture of rage, shock, and disgust, I decided this dog needed a proper burial. It was about 1 in the morning by this point, so I went into my parents' back yard and grabbed a shovel and a wheelbarrow. I lifted the dog's body (it was still intact, the car was moving so fast it basically just squeezed out its insides) into the wheelbarrow, and wheeled to the drivers house, where I started to dig a 3 foot deep hole, and lowered the dog's body inside and proceeded to bury it. I placed a large stone on top of the hole, and left a note on the  driver's door. The note said ""Hey, I'm sure you feel pretty bad about killing that dog last night, so I'm sure you won't mind that I buried it in your front yard. It's what she would have wanted."" It was about three in the morning when I finally finished everything, and I left home feeling nothing but defeat afterward.

**TL:DR - Some guy killed a dog that I was trying to save, so I buried it in his front yard.**

The best analogy I can make that Reddit might empathize with would be being an atheist in a very tight-knit religious community. You're a member of a minority that a majority of people will distrust, shun, and condemn for no reason other than you're atheist. And each time you try to point this out unfair treatment, a Christian jumps out of nowhere and starts crying about how Christians are persecuted because there was once some kid somewhere who was told they couldn't pray in school - and ""What about the rights of Christians?"" they'll ask. And when you politely try to turn the conversation back to the topic of you being discriminated against for being atheist, they talk about how discrimination against atheists shouldn't be made a separate issue because it's just another form of religious discrimination and if you were *really* for equality, you'd stop singling out discrimination against atheists only and include discrimination against Christians as well, which completely ignores the fact that one happens more often than another. Maybe they'll come out with an anecdote about how they once they got called a Bible-thumper, so if you're constantly harassed for being atheist, you should just learn to deal with it like they did. Or they'll suggest you deserved it because you let others know you were an atheist.

True,Meeea,s2games,Viole,"Regarding your two points; whisper harassment is indeed taken seriously, however, GMs do -NOT- have the power to read whispers or review the whispers of any player. If you take a screenshot of the whispers (including your responses, so the full un-edited chat log) and send it to Feanux or Vorador, it can be handled as a verbal abuse report. Regardless of if it's during the match or after, player harassment is not encouraged in any sense. 

Your other point is also iffy, as it does not matter which team reports a player. That is not taken into consideration, ever. There is nothing wrong with reporting an enemy who went 0-37 intentionally feeding, the outcome would be guilty regardless of which faction had submitted the report.

However, there is something to be taken away here, and that is that reports on players who do not break the rules will obviously not be suspended. Knowing the rules and guidelines helps both you as a reporter, and as a player to avoid such situations so you don't get suspended as well.",0,1352396906,,0,False,1,c6ydfka,t3_12uw4d,t1_c6ydfka,t1_c6yc9dj,,1430354021,3,False,HeroesofNewerth,t5_2r497,3
True,UsedToHaveAJob,,,"We were at our favorite Mexican restaurant when I bet my friend Mark $2 that I could drink his margarita without touching the glass or using a straw. My other friend, who was in on the bet, told Mark not to take the bet because I would just touch the glass AND use the straw, or just slurp it up without touching it thereby winning on a technicality.

I acted like I was caught, then told Mark that I would make it easier on him. I would bet him $1 that I could drink it without touching it in any way, with any part of my body or using any implements. Mark really wants to see this now, so he agrees.

I pick up the margarita and drink it down through the straw. Mark gloats ""What?! You lose! You lose!"" I hand him the $1. Best deal on a $6 margarita I've ever gotten. ",0,1352397610,,0,False,1,c6ydmv3,t3_12un5k,t1_c6ydmv3,t3_12un5k,,1430354147,805,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,805

True,ambermanna,,,"I'm not a bartender, but I work in a bar/diner that's open 24/7. We had a banker staying at the hotel across the street, who drank vodka like it was water. Seriously, ordered tall glasses of vodka. Drank about five of those a day while he was in town. The craziest thing.

Anyway, one night he's there from 3am until morning, when the hookers stop working and come in for food and drinks. He starts chatting with one of them and he's... Smitten. Like a schoolboy crush. Eventually he asks her if she wants to go back to his hotel room and snort some coke. She says sure, he says I don't have any coke, but here's $500. You go get some coke, I'll wait here for you.

The poor guy waited for eight hours. It took us hours to convince him she wasn't coming back with a bunch of coke. He just kept saying ""She was very nice. Very nice."" Drank enough vodka to believe a hooker would keep her word and come back to hang out with him.

True,GrabAColdOne,,,"I worked at a 10 seat bar at a French Restaurant in the Massachusetts Suburbs. I mention this only because in the Massachusetts suburbs, people talk. Anyway, on a particularly busy Friday night, two ladies walk in early and immediately order two martinis and a bottle of white wine simultaneously. 

Gonna get paid tonight, I'm thinking. 

About half-hour later, in walk two well dressed men. Salt and pepper hair, scumbag-looking but suave. They order 2 manhattans. One guy orders his shaken not stirred, a outrageously douchey homage to James Bond. I feign a hearty belly laugh, and get to work. 

Gonna get paid tonight, I'm thinking. 

Both parties start drinking. If I knew how to do italics, drinking in the previous sentence would be in italics. One of the guys starts reading the menu and, perplexed, asks me what sweetbreads are. The ladies, who had been talking closely in each other's faces, overhear the inquiry and look on curious. The other man, Mr. Bond, answers before I have a chance - ""Sweetbreads are the thalamus gland of the cow. A Very delicious and challenging dish."" My god. One of the girls, nay, ladies goes, ""Are you a doctor or something?"" ""A dentist,"" he replies. Then he winked. He fucking winked at this woman. But alas, she laughs, and he's in. 

They start talking about whatever and I go about my work making drinks for the restaurant, etc. After about a half hour I hear, ""Barkeep! Barkeep!"" Barkeep? Seriously was this guy locked in a room that only had James Bond movies and films noir? Whatever. Gonna get paid tonight, I'm thinking. ""Can we get 4 shots of patron."" Keeping in mind we're a small French Restaurant in Suburban Massachusetts, we don't have shot glasses. ""No bother,"" the winnie the pooh inside me says, and I pour 4 enormous shots of patron into a few rocks glasses. 

Bam. Eventually the dentist convinces these women to make out with each other at the bar. Which they do. For like 5 minutes. By the time they are done, the entire waitstaff, horny kitchen staff, and most bar patrons and people waiting for tables are looking on. Some with smiles, some with death stares of suburban shame. The kitchen cheered. The dentist clapped and rubbed his hands together the way movie characters do when they are looking at a stripper in a club. One lady across the lobby goes, ""Jocelyn???"" Jocelyn quickly dips. The other lady follows. The dentist asks for the ""both tickets,"" and pays. Tips like a motherfucker. My man. 

A few days later, it's tuesday. I'm working as a waiter and a new bartender is training, as it's a slow night. The only guy at the bar was one of the waitress's dads when in walks Jocelyn and The Dentist. The stones on both these people is massive. They're flirty. Dentist tries to get a shot but new guy tells him ""we don't have shot glasses."" 

Oh new guy. 

Dentist orders 2 glasses red. Romantic. They start talking with the new guy about bartending and the restaurant business.  The dentist asks, ""What's the craziest thing you've ever seen as a bartender."" New guy goes, ""Well I personally haven't seen much yet, but apparently last friday some skanky ladies tried to impress a 1950s dentist?""

 Jesus H Tapdancing Christ new guy! He had a lot to learn. 

Jocelyn turns white as a ghost and the dentist emits a curt chortle. I hide in the side room and send a ticket to the bar that just reads, ""That's them."" He reads it, makes an excuse, and runs into the basement. 

When we come back to the bar, all thats left is a $50 and a business card that reads, ""Dr. Nameomitted, DDS.""

Nope.  Got a link?

When I created reddit gold, here was the vision:

1. No existing features would be taken away from non-gold users
2. Some new features would be gold-only (e.g., new-comment highlighting; the servers couldn't handle that at reddit-wide scale)
3. Other new features would start out as gold-only, but eventually get rolled out to everyone (e.g., sorting of userpages)

If we can support great causes, why cant we support the site that brought us together. It honestly sickens me to see so many comments bashing on the admins trying to promote gold.

True,tibieryo,twilight,,"Read a popular fanfic that had, as one of its background details, that there's a 6:1 ratio of female to male ponies in Equestria. As in for every seven ponies born, one is male and six are female.

I don't know how widespread this idea is within the fandom, but it hit me in the face when I read it. *Lawrence of Arabia* is set on Earth, and thus we know that there's a 1:1 ratio of women to men despite there being no female speaking parts. *Reservoir Dogs* takes place in contemporary Los Angeles, so we know there's a 1:1 ratio of women to men despite there being no female speaking parts.

But there moment there's few to little *male* speaking parts in a fantasy universe meant to reflect Earth? **It must be because there are far fewer male ponies.**

I just felt like writing to the author and saying ""Now do you know what it feels like for a little black kid to grow up watching *Batman* and *Superman* and *Spider-Man*? You assumed that because you weren't shown men that they were actually *not there*. Bravo.""

True,yishan,,,"Actually, reddit is NOT one of the most profitable sites on the web at all.

In fact, we are not profitable.

This is because increased traffic results in more server usage, which primarily increases costs, not revenue.  In theory advertising revenue should/could scale with traffic, but since we never tried very hard to sell our advertising inventory, we only run ads on a relatively small percentage of our pages and they do not cover our costs.  When Obama comes to ""chill on the weekends,"" that increases costs, not revenue. 

It is true that given our massive pageview count, we could theoretically load up our pages with ads and probably make enough to cover our costs.  However, that would significantly degrade the experience of using the site.  Before joining this company, I was a redditor too, and if reddit had done this I probably would have stopped using the site.  

Because the site is not profitable, we have a choice to make about how to cover the increasing costs of our skyrocketing traffic.  We can run a lot more ads (interestingly, the spammiest and most annoying ads pay the most) or we can create reasons for users to pay for the site.

See, the problem is that if your site is funded primarily with advertising, then you are beholden to your advertisers.  If your users choose to post something politically or culturally controversial, you come under editorial pressure from advertisers to remove or modify it, because advertisers like bland, well-lit spaces.  This eventually results in a watering down of the true, authentic content on the site (remember Sears?).  It's one of the reasons Digg failed.  And personally, I feel that's not the best way to serve the community.  It's not the right thing to do for the users who have faithfully contributed to reddit all these years.   

Rather, we should be beholden to our users.  That is, if most of the money is coming from users, then we'll answer to the users.  So this means that yes, we are asking you for money.  If you choose to pay us, if you're the ones keeping us afloat, then when you yell at us and want us to do something, we'll do it.  THAT is why we're promoting reddit gold, and that is why the reason we're doing this is not just to make money to cover the costs, but to do so in a way that benefits the community.

True,Mithryn,,,"&gt;This material comes from 

&gt;(1) Mormons who produce both nonsense as well as some solid historical studies and some decidedly uneven work, 

&gt;(2) anti-Mormons who produce nonsense, and unfortunately far too often 

&gt;(3) Egyptologists.

Point 2) is poisoning the well.  Anti-mormons cannot be Egyptologists?  Can the produce nothing good?  Could point one be shortened to ""Members who produce nonsense""?  Why didn't he use that term for ""uneven work"".  Has no anti-mormon ever produced a historical study?

&gt; The nonsense from Egyptologists is not the mistakes made in Mormon history and belief, which is outside our range of interest, but rather the numerous Egyptological and historical errors we make in our treatment of the Joseph Smith Papyri. 

This sentence is superfluous.  How about ""Egyptologists are wrong about the Joseph Smith Papyri, despite being right about the rest of egyptian tanslation"".  There, was that so hard to say?

&gt;Professor Robert Ritner has commented on the low standards of some of the material on the Joseph Smith Papyri, particularly the ""apologetic"" material,2 and I am inclined to agree with his comments.

Apologetics on this are nonsense.  See my issue with point 2 above.  maybe the anti's didn't produce nonsense, but instead were just pointing out these same flaws, eh?

&gt; But we should remember that the principal definition of apologetic is ""defense of a point of view""3 and thus includes Professor Ritner's work on the subject as well.

Absolutely unrelated and unnecessary sentence.  ""SEE YOU'RE AN APOLOGIST TOO!"" has nothing to do with the credibility of an argument.

&gt; In over two decades of dealing with constant inquiries about the papyri, I have learned that the only disinterested parties are those who truly have no interest in the matter. 

In other news Tautologies are tautological.

&gt;Everyone who writes about the papyri has an agenda and a bias even if unwilling to admit it. 

Again, I'm not sure why this is relevant.  It should be assumed that everyone has bias, but if we can sign and measure that bias, it can give us a good picture.  Simply because someone has bias doesn't mean we should ignore it.  Otherwise this line simply means ""Stop reading now, I'm also a biased source"".

&gt;My stance on the matter is scarcely a secret. In the interest of full disclosure, I note that I am employed by Brigham Young University, which is owned by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, of which I am a believing and active member; I am a member of the board of directors of the Aziz S. Atiya Fund for Coptic Studies; and I am a previous employee of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. I have a personal interest in not besmirching the reputation of these institutions. 

He states his biases.  Good for him.  So we know that if he says anything AGAINST the papyri, it's probably pretty credible.  But anything for it, should be viewed skepically.  Make sense?

&gt; I note that in my capacity as a professor at BYU I do not, indeed cannot, officially speak for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 

In other words, there is no reason to give my answer any more credibility than any other joe-blow who comments on the subject. I'm adding to nonsense, except where I have professional experience and where my arguments stand on their own.

&gt;This shows two things: first, that the museum knew exactly what they had, and second, that no one had read the museum acquisition list.

What the hell?  Okay so it wasn't rediscovered, even though no one read the list?  I'd say calling ""Reading a list, and saying 'oh, I have this?'"" a ""rediscovery"" as pretty accurate.

&gt;Even Klaus Baer, an Egyptologist working at the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago, knew in 1968 that ""the Metropolitan Museum was fully aware of what the papyri were when they first saw them in 1918, and they knew what they were doing when they acquired them. I saw photographs of them for the first time in 1963, I believe, and was asked at the time, on my honor not to tell anyone where they were and to keep the whole thing confidential.

Okay so the museaum knew they had it, but no one read the list?  I think the ""rediscovery"" isn't so much about the museum, but the lengthy list of apostles and general authorities who stated the fragments were destroyed in a chicago fire including [BYU](http://rsc.byu.edu/archived/volume-11-number-1-2010/egyptian-papyri-and-book-abraham-some-questions-and-answers)  and the desert news ( on Nov. 27, 1967, the Deseret News announced that the ""collection of pa[p]yrus manuscripts, long believed to have been destroyed in the Chicago fire of 1871, was presented to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints here Monday by the Metropolitan Museum of Art.""

&gt;""Let's face it; it was [Hugh] Nibley and not the Egyptologists who noticed that the sensen fragments were not from the Book of the Dead.""

Wait, read that paragraph again.  So the museaum said 'These are funerary texts, and we have other copies"", and then it was Hugh who ultimately identified them as the Book of the Dead.  Are you sure you're not stretching things here a bit, to fit your re-write of history?  Seriously?  Maybe they identified them as funerary texts... coming from the book of the Dead.

And Hugh Nibley was not an Egyptologist at this time.  That should be mentioned.  

&gt;Also, when one compares Quincy's account of things Joseph Smith said with that of Quincy's cousin, Charles Francis Adams, one finds that the latter account is closer to what Joseph Smith published on the same subject.20 Quincy thus becomes an unreliable witness—one writing forty years after the fact.

Ah yes, the ol' apologist trick of ""years after the fact"", and ""We found some small discrepancy, throw it all out!""  Let's do the same with another document written years after the fact, where discrepancies are found: The first vision.  No? Why not.

&gt;As John Baines has written, the typical Egyptologist ""tends not to be very open to issues of theory and methodology, and at the level of interpretation he will often work without an awareness of the presuppositions he applies.""

Poisoning the well... Egyptologists are stodgy old fools who refuse to see things our way""

&gt;""On the other hand, Mormon studies, particularly since the 1980s and the exposure of the forgeries introduced by Mark Hofmann, have produced an extensive literature on the subject.""

Ah yes, extensive literature production is always based in truth and value.  That's why anti-mormons are so prolific, they are always true... wait, no.  Why is this sentence even  in there?

&gt;The most helpful method of sorting through the various accounts and claims about historical events is to use those sources that are eyewitnesses to an event, whether they are Mormon or not, and exclude those that are not eyewitnesses. 

That's why we reject the four gospels, having no eyewitnesses to the account.  Why Paul of Tarssis is given no credibility.  And why we reject Hugh Nibley, because he wasn't there for any of it, right?

&gt; For history, hearsay sources are irrelevant. 

Like Josephus.  The testimony of anyone except for Oliver Cowdery and Martin Harris on how the plates were translated.  And let's just say anyone who claimed that William law was at Carthage jail.

&gt; Larson might have included more eyewitness accounts had he actually read some of the sources he cites in his bibliography.

ZING!  Ouch.  If only he read books.  By the way, anyone reading this, you should read all the sources you quote.  That means next time you're in gospel doctrine, read not only the manual, but all the sources in the bibliography, and their sources.  Then, let's talk again about this kind of poor citation and not including everything, okay?

&gt;ad he read the accounts, he would not have needed to ""only imagine."" 

How about instead of attacking the man, you just say, ""There is an additional source which cites this info"".  It's very unscholarly to attack the man.  Ad hominum it is named, and it really has no place in a scholars paper.

&gt;One does not need to imagine how much damage the fragile antiquities suffered. In a forthcoming publication, Michael Rhodes shows that an 1835 copy of a fragment now part of Papyrus Joseph Smith IX contains thirty-four lines of text as compared to the current fragment, which contains only about twelve. The length of text preserved in each line is also reduced to about one-third its original size.

The origin of EDM genres and sub-genres is generally pretty fluid and hard to pinpoint. But if you had to pick something as being the first successful 'dubstep' song, a good argument would be ['Skream -  midnight request line' from 2005](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6pTSGvp7T8).

A year later Skream released the self title album 'Skream!' which feature that track as well as dutch flowerz, and [rutten](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEmM6vVFrao).

Another early dubstep producer Benga (friends with Skream) released tracks such as, [Benga ft Coki - Night](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKg5IfQ9IaU), and [26 Basslines](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNoj2Y0iHxw) around that same time.

Early dubstep came out of dub and 2step. The tracks were typically around 140 BPM with a half-time feel, the snare on the 3rd beat, and a 'break beat' rather than 4 on the floor. 

The tracks tended to have a lot of sub-bass  (such as in dutch flowerz) as wells as modulated ""wobble"" or 'wub wub' bass (as can be heard in  rutten and 26 basslines).

In 2007, Rusko released [Jahova](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qe4f1ZL8kew). In 2009 Rusko released [Cockney Thug](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwfWSX0FYlI). 

In both these tracks you can still hear a lot in common with songs like dutch flowerz and rutten. The dub horns, the drum sounds, the basslines, etc. Though the emphasis on the midrange wobble bass is more pronounced.

Consider now the [Caspa remix of Cockney Thug](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2WuAPfaapY). Here the emphasis on the in-your-face mid-range bass is far more pronounced. 

Around 2009 we started to see a stronger turn towards the harsher dubstep sounds with the release of tracks like [Sweet Shop by Doctor P](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZkzcm7ubQg) and [Swagga by Datsik &amp; Excision](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVZJb4zbms0). In these tracks we not only hear the harsher sounds, but the a shift from the classic 'wub wub' bass to the more talky 'ya ya ya' bass sound.

In 2010, Skrillex released [Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSeNSzJ2-Jw). More than anything else, this was the straw that broke the camel's back and fractured dubstep into the dubstep vs brostep camps. This song features extremely harsh, cut up, and chaotic basslines, etc.

During 2011 brostep blew up huge. But having already reach the limits of in-your-faceness, there was no where left to go, and so in 2012, many producers have moved onto a variety of post-dubstep genres.

Anyway, I skipped a bunch of stuff, but if you listen to those tracks in that order, you can see how dubstep progressed from 'midnight request line' to what you have heard.

There's no way this game was commissoned without some Sony executive, at some point - saying the words ""Make Super Smash Bros"". There have been interviews from people involved with the game claiming that it started out more as a capture-the-flag type game with combat, but it was later changed to a more traditional fighter.
The Final Smash-only mechanic (which the game is built around) seems like a flawed attempt to distance the game from it's obvious roots, and results in the game as a whole feeling unbalanced. Only three moves matter in the end game, and there are going to be certain characters with a distinct advantage since they have better super moves.
Finally, I say it feels rushed because I honestly think this is Sony trying to pay the bills. They're in a hard financial spot, and this seems like an idea that they assumed would allow them a guaranteed hit for the holidays (since every Sony fan would want to support a game based on the ""Playstation Legacy""). My assumptions are embraced by the fact that multiple characters seem like they've only been included to promote upcoming games in the Spring (Bioshock Infinite, MGS: Rising, DmC).

True,twerps,,,"No program can say what another will do.   
Now, I won’t just assert that, I’ll prove it to you:  
I will prove that although you might work til you drop,  
you can’t predict whether a program will stop.  

Imagine we have a procedure called P  
that will snoop in the source code of programs to see  
there aren’t infinite loops that go round and around;  
and P prints the word “Fine!” if no looping is found.  

You feed in your code, and the input it needs,  
and then P takes them both and it studies and reads  
and computes whether things will all end as they should  
(as opposed to going loopy the way that they could).  

Well, the truth is that P cannot possibly be,  
because if you wrote it and gave it to me,  
I could use it to set up a logical bind  
that would shatter your reason and scramble your mind.  

Here’s the trick I would use – and it’s simple to do.  
I’d define a procedure – we’ll name the thing Q -  
that would take any program and call P (of course!)  
to tell if it looped, by reading the source;  

And if so, Q would simply print “Loop!” and then stop;  
but if no, Q would go right back to the top,   
and start off again, looping endlessly back,  
til the universe dies and is frozen and black.  

And this program called Q wouldn’t stay on the shelf;  
I would run it, and (fiendishly) feed it itself.  
What behaviour results when I do this with Q?  
When it reads its own source, just what will it do?  

If P warns of loops, Q will print “Loop!” and quit;  
yet P is supposed to speak truly of it.  
So if Q’s going to quit, then P should say, “Fine!” -  
which will make Q go back to its very first line!  

No matter what P would have done, Q will scoop it:    
Q uses P’s output to make P look stupid.    
If P gets things right then it lies in its tooth;  
and if it speaks falsely, it’s telling the truth!  

I’ve created a paradox, neat as can be -  
and simply by using your putative P.  
When you assumed P you stepped into a snare;  
Your assumptions have led you right into my lair.  

So, how to escape from this logical mess?  
I don’t have to tell you; I’m sure you can guess.  
By reductio, there cannot possibly be  
a procedure that acts like the mythical P.  

You can never discover mechanical means  
for predicting the acts of computing machines.  
It’s something that cannot be done. So we users  
must find our own bugs; our computers are losers!

True,[deleted],,,"No, they were told their expenses would be covered, regardless of the outcome that night. The Romney campaign went back on its word. Plain and simple.

One of my friends worked for the campaign. Her credit card was turned off well before midnight. In fact, it was deactivated after Pennsylvania was called, well before the end of the election night. She ended up leaving early and flew back to Minnesota that evening, on her own personal credit card. She also noted that most staffers were unable to book flights back to their home states on the cards, despite being told only hours earlier that the campaign would pay for it.

This was her 3rd presidential campaign job and says she's never been more disgusted by Romney's treatment of his staff in the final hours. She also said the McCain campaign not only paid for her flights home in '08, but she was offered a job in McCain's congressional office after the election. Most of Romney's staffers will likely be unemployed until Inauguration Day. 

EDIT: She's just told me that the hotel rooms were NOT prepaid and many of the younger intern staffers, some that were paid minimum wage, were frantically calling their parents from Boston, post election morning, asking them to pay for the rooms! 

EDIT 2: Just to clarify for those who messaged me... Yes, she basically was given her pink slip halfway through
election night. When her card was deactivated, she knew she was unemployed at that point. It's why she flew home so soon. She was at the airport waiting to catch a redeye when Romney gave his concession speech.

&gt;""These associations are not just culturally learned, they seem to be fairly common across other cultures as well. There's something unique about these particular relationships between the notes that makes them important for expressing emotion.""

It was a short lecture. He also explained one method of inducing certain emotions through music by the use of consonance and dissonance. Notes that are similar in pitch, or length, or follow a pattern, are grouped by the brain, and we pretty much have instinctive expectations of what notes might be coming next. If notes played together are dissonant, it can be disconcerting or jarring. To try and get some better answers to you ahead of me talking to my lecturer on monday, I decided to read this

True,Spring_Break,,,"edit: may be too harsh. good and valid points made here.

Sorry duder, but this isn't correct.  You should read up on Carol Krumhansl's studies on this topic. she is the leading expert in this field and was my thesis advisor at Cornell University (until she resigned from my board because I took too much of an ""art"" approach) . A lot being said here has validity, but consonance and dissonance as well as scale is not wholly natural. The majority of what we perceive as ""good"" or ""bad"" sounding is encultured or ""learned"" at a very young age. The harmonic progression of Western music  is completely different than that of Balinese or Javanese music--even that of hindi music. Basically everything we learn is either passively or actively learned; Tonality being passive (at least most of the time). In certain cases, one can re-learn tonal structure, such as learning perfect pitch, but after the age of 7 this is almost impossible to do...most asian cultures have high rates of perfect pitch because of their tonal languages. 
I currently do not have any of my university books with me (just graduated and moved back to my parents :( ...) , so citing will be a problem, but several studies on infants and pitch perception do show a greater comprehension of seemingly ""consonant"" pitches rather than dissonant pitches after i believe 10 months. This is mostly due to the overtone series you are referring to--but more than that, it is thought to be the relative complexity of the pitches-- i.e. it is easier to deconstruct a major third than a minor second because the pitches are further spaced apart.  Actually i may have fudged that last part....I just woke up and not sure if my mind can handle this at the moment, but if anyone is reading this and wants me to continue, I'll be glad to in about an hour.",0,1352474091,,0,1352474819,1,c6yt5g1,t3_12wpsy,t1_c6yt5g1,t1_c6ys3w1,,1430361568,40,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,40

True,happybadger,,,"It's shit. Granted we weren't as flashy like that, but replace everything immaterial in your life with something material, remove all of its value, and convince yourself that being surrounded by worthless baubles makes you happy- there's the key difference there for the inevitable ""LOL I'D SURE BE HAPPY IN A PRIVATE JET"" comments, we're hunter-gatherers at heart and the pursuit will always be more rewarding than the meal.

Replace all of your friends with gimme-gimmes. If they aren't, their families are. You go to hang out with them and their uncle comes along. He educates you on his business idea and you compare it to everyone else's. Your friend is visibly embarrassed and won't speak to you again, but that doesn't have much of an impact because you've gone through so many in the past year alone that you've made a game of guessing what they're going to say. If they don't have an uncle, it will be their business idea and all hell will break loose if you don't believe in a fourteen year-old's vision for a nightclub *on. a. zeppelin. mate.*

Replace the women you meet with gold diggers. Gold diggers are different from gimme-gimmes because gold diggers aren't bought by object, only by status. They've fetishised money and caste to a religious level and if you don't bring them both their eyes shut off and their exit will be marked with such a profound 180 in personality that you'll incrementally lose the ability to trust people. Either you'll give up and accept hollow relationships with women who love your name but don't know the person behind it or you'll take to dating crazy women, as they're rubbish at bluffing. 

Replace parents with staff and parenting with bribes. Congrats, you have someone washing your clothes and cooking your food. They're not allowed to look at you or speak with you unless it's in a tone that's incredibly demeaning toward themselves. They wouldn't want to anyway because they too know they're cooking and cleaning for you and they hate that. They didn't want to grow up to have that job, but they do and their best response is to take it out on you. You'll overcompensate, cook fucking feasts before you hit age ten just to say ""you don't need to do this for me"", but if they don't they'll be punished so they do. You're left with five mums and five dads, none of which would bat an eye if you were to choke on the sandwich they made for you even though you've made it as clear as you can that you too can and would like to make a sandwich if they wouldn't keep locking the kitchen doors.

You can go anywhere in the world and see nothing at all. Travel is a hotel room, and the only thing separating Paris from Beirut is the kitschy shit on the walls. If you go outside, you risk being kidnapped. That's not paranoia, that's a thing. It's a thing you actually have to worry about because someone who isn't you has made you a target of people you don't know so that they can feel good about their own choices in life. If you do manage to get away from the hotel, every single person you meet sees you as a foreigner no matter where you are or what language you're speaking. Again, Paris, Beirut, your own city. You are different and they will let you know this in more ways than Disney has dalmatians. 

Life is meaningless. You can be anything you want or nothing at all. There's no challenge, there's no game, there's no ""if I do this and this and this I'll have the biggest damn boat EVER ^^^inadecade "". If you want a boat, you buy a boat. If you want to be a doctor, you become a doctor. If you want to suck dad's money teat, drink your fill and you'll become whatever he wanted you to become when he planned your birth for the explicit purpose of carrying on his name and his business and has made this very clear in his only real interactions with you.

But if you want to be anything *but* what he wants you to be or something equally prestigious, god help you. Be a doctor but no hospital will take you if you go into public medicine. Psychology is fine but if you work with crazy people you'll be disowned. Animals, lovely. Work with cute ones and have someone under you to clean up after them because if they shit you'll find them dead the next morning. 

Only have an abstract view of family, of worth, of ethics, and of normalcy. Hesitate before you say anything to anyone who isn't of the same background because at best you'll come off as either a compulsive liar or nutter, and at worst as someone different. Consider every action from a dozen different angles before you undertake it because on some level your brain doesn't quite understand the idea of consequence and you don't know if something is wildly risky or just fun.

Keep a spare change of clothing in your backpack and duck behind a tree every time you're out of sight from your house. Change your accent, it's as telling as anything. Change your vocabulary, your interests, your hair, your name if you can pull it off. Walk through the field to get to the council homes to get to the shoddy street to get to the better street to get to the school, even though you'd otherwise just walk down the street to the school from your own house. If ""friends"" follow you home, you'll be outed the next day and have to take another year of boarding school because they'll make your life hell unless given time to forget you.

Escape your family, escape your childhood, escape your country, escape you. You're still branded for life and anyone who is the least bit perceptive can smell you from a mile away. Have your failed relationships because you wanted love and she wanted a steady cheque, your failed friendships because you wanted acceptance and they wanted insurance, and your failed life because no matter what you end up doing the voice in the back of your mind says ""Do it well, do it shit, you're covered."" 

Break out entirely, burn every bridge you've ever crossed, sweep that one girl who's just warped enough to not get blood on her teeth off her feet, run away to a city where you can guarantee no one will ever recognise you, and maybe just maybe you'll have a place and a person and a purpose just tangible enough to let you breathe for the first time in twenty-one years and think, ""What now?""

True,permum,,,"Two things about coal are true right now. First, the U.S. coal industry really is in decline — the nation is burning far less coal to generate electricity than it did five years ago. Second, the Environmental Protection Agency under President Obama really has enacted a bunch of new rules that will require coal-fired power plants to curb their pollution. Those rules will cost money, and some utilities are now retiring their aging coal plants rather than installing expensive new scrubbers.

But the main reason for the decline of coal Coal’s is the recent influx of cheap natural gas in the United States.

The coal industry hoped that Romney would have won and eased the polution rules and that would have helped, slightly, coal's postion in the market. 

Would have a Romeny victory meant more coal workers would keep their jobs? Yes but only a tiny percentage of the workers who have and will be laid off as natural gas gains market share. ",0,1352477762,,0,False,1,c6yu2ey,t3_12wtr5,t1_c6yu2ey,t3_12wtr5,,1430361984,69,False,politics,t5_2cneq,69
True,BruceLeeXIV,,,"The backup was easy for me.  The 500GB disk that is now in my caddy was my main HD before the upgrade.  So when I moved it to the caddy, all my info was still on the computer.

I then installed OS X to the newly installed SSD using a USB stick.  Once that was all done and updated, I moved things from the HD in the caddy to the SSD.

I'm not sure why you would want apps to install on the HD.  I put them on the SSD (the main applications folder) and just let all new stuff I get install there.  128GB is pretty big for just OS X and apps, so I personally don't have any danger of it filling up soon.  Having all the apps and the OS run from the SSD makes things a lot faster

All my docs and files and libraries (iTunes, iPhoto, Aperture, etc) are on my slower HD.  The consensus on the web seems to be to keep your apps and os on the fast drive, and other stuff you more rarely access on the slower one.  Unless yo want to keep a special folder on the SSD for big picture projects that you want to open and access and manipulate with maximum speed, then I don't think you'll notice much difference by pulling your date from the HD when you need it.

Now, setting up the OS so that everything runs smoothly is a bit tricky.  I have OS X 10.8 looking at my slower HD for my Documents folder, but the Application, Library, and System are all on the SSD. This involves going into advanced settings in System Preferences.  The following article gives a general idea:

http://chris.pirillo.com/how-to-move-the-home-folder-in-os-x-and-why/
If you read that, be sure to go through the comments and get the newest info, about OS X 10.8, because the original article is a bit dated.

I also consulted these for info:

http://damieng.com/blog/2010/04/09/macbook-pro-upgrade-to-crucial-256gb-ssd

Also, do some searching and, depending on how comfortable you are with advanced stuff, learn the best way to organize your system using both hard drives and symlinks and other command line stuff.

Oh, and this is helpful once you have the SSD and HD set up in there:

True,justaverage,,,"Mormon here who voted for Obama. Let me shed some light as to why (not only why *I* voted for Obama, but also why I think Obama grabbed 20% of the Mormon vote).

1. Many Mormons felt disenfranchised by the Republicans and Tea Partiers attacking Obama as a 'socialist'. Forget about the fact that Obama *ins't* a Socialist, nor has he instituted any policies that could be construed as Socialist (at least by anyone who understands what Socialism means). That didn't matter. What really stuck in my craw about that, is that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints teaches the [Law of Consecration](http://www.lds.org/ldsorg/v/index.jsp?hideNav=1&amp;locale=0&amp;sourceId=8a909207f7c20110VgnVCM100000176f620a____&amp;vgnextoid=32c41b08f338c010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD) and Stewardship. That is, everything they own, everything they have acquired, can be called upon to be used by the Church at any time. We, as mortal beings do not *own* anything, rather it is the property of the Lord, merely under our temporary stewardship. And the same people I would sit in Sunday School with, nodding their heads along with this doctrine and saying that is *how it is supposed to be*, would later on attack my President by calling him a Socialist. Unbelievable.

2. Caring for the sick and poor. There is an oft quoted scripture in the Church that reads [""When you are in the service of your fellow man, you are only in the service of your God.""](http://mormon.org/service) I would like you to note that it does not read ""When you are in the service of your fellow Christians..."" nor does it read ""When you are in the service of those who are trying, and not being lazy"". Nope. We believe that when you help others you are serving God. Full stop. Again, the same people would sit in Sunday School nodding along and boasting about they time they brought dinner to the woman who was just widowed, and then they would turn around and tell me how my President is *The Welfare President* who just wants to oversee a nanny state. 

3. Free agency. We are taught in the Church that the greatest gift that God granted to us is our free agency. Again, head nodding in Sunday School, and vilification for any politician that might suggest that a woman has a right to choose. They could not wrap their head around the idea that, yes, *you personally* view it as morally wrong, and that is **fine**, but your personal views do not trump someone else's free agency.

4. Not so much a doctrine reason here, but the whole ""Romney is a 'money man', so I think he can get us out of this recession argument."" No one could ever answer the questions ""What do you mean 'money man'? Do you honestly believe that Mitt Romney has some insight on what the World economies are doing that top economists don't? Yes, Mitt Romney has been very successful in his career. I have no ill towards him for that. But honestly, you have to see the fact that he was born into wealth, *given* stocks and cash worth more than the average American made in 20 years? It would be quite hard for someone *not* to be successful if they were given investments totaling $800,000 (roughly 20 times the average income in today's dollars) don't you think?

5. Telling me, as a member of the Church, that it was my 'duty' to vote for a Mormon. I want to be clear here, no Church leader, acting under the authority of the Church, ever said this to me or to a congregation. The official stance of Church Leadership is that they have no political stance and do not endorse any candidates. But other members, telling me that I *had* to vote for the Mormon candidate. And then turning around and giving me the stink eye when I would respond with ""I find it just as bad to say you would vote *for* someone based on their religion as it would be to say you would vote *against* someone, based simply on their religion. You have justified the logic of  all the Evangelicals who said they will *never* vote for a Mormon candidate. Good job.""

6. The LDS Church has what are called [The Articles of Faith](http://mormon.org/articles-of-faith). 13 points that briefly ouline what we believe and what we stand for. The 13th Article of Faith reads...""We believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and in doing good to all men; indeed, we may say that we follow the admonition of Paul-We believe all things, we hope all things, we have endured many things, and hope to be able to endure all things. If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these things."" Personally, from what I saw of Mitt Romney, I had a very difficult time finding things that were ""honest"", ""true"", ""of good report or praiseworthy"" in him or his words.

There were several other factors, but these are the ones where I found Mitt Romney and his supporters at direct odds with what I have been taught my whole life and testify to. ",0,1352481897,,0,1352483568,1,c6yv7r5,t3_12wxnx,t1_c6yv7r5,t1_c6yuh82,,1435670208,475,False,politics,t5_2cneq,475
True,acog,,,"Most people point to fracking and the decreasing price of natural gas. But equally important, perhaps more so, is that in the 1990s a new type of gas turbine became widely used that was dramatically more efficient at converting natural gas to electricity: the natural gas combined-cycle (NGCC) turbine.

&gt; Gas didn't pose a threat to king coal ... until the arrival in the 1990s of the natural gas combined-cycle (NGCC) turbine: like the classic turbine, it drives a generator, but instead of blowing the “waste” heat out the exhaust, it uses the energy to generate steam that, as in a coal plant, drives a steam turbine that powers another generator. Like their old-fashioned brethren, NGCC plants can be brought on line quickly, but when used for base power, their efficiency can exceed 60%—much higher than that of a coal plant.

&gt; A game changer. With natural gas prices as low as they’ve been over the past years, operating costs for power generators have plunged. It doesn’t hurt that NGCC plants have lower capital costs than coal plants—$600 to $700 per kW versus $1,400 to $2,000 kW—relatively short construction times, and environmental benefits.

For attaching the legs, I would advise adding additional fastening if you're only planning on putting a screw down through the top of the plywood. You'll likely have legs that wobble a lot. Some background:
 
Not sure if you know engineering terms, but in statics you have two types of forces- linear and rotational. We talk about rotational forces as ""moments"" about a rotating point... and by virtue of geometry, the table leg has a huge mechanical advantage on the joint because it's ~30"" away. The top edges of the table leg in your hypothetical screw-through-the-top-assembly are at most 1.75"" (table leg thickness) away. Same principle as a crowbar, or fingers getting smashed in the gap next to a door hinge. All are levers enabling transfer of huge amounts of force. People can lift tons of stone using long wooden boards [using this principle](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCvx5gSnfW4)

Not many people know that screws are designed to hold the **2nd** piece of wood... basically you're pulling the second piece tight to the first piece. The screw is somewhat ""loose"" in the first piece, as the threads begin farther down the screw. So in this case, the screw would easily grip the insides of the table leg and pull it towards the plywood, while spinning in the plywood as you assemble. Later, when the table sees sideways forces (leaning on it while typing, laying the table on it's side when moving it, wiggling etc.) the hole in the plywood being loose (by design) will enlarge just a little bit more. Remember you've got a 30"" lever from the table leg. Every time it sees sideways force it will get worse and worse until your significant other tells you your beloved table is a piece of crap and needs to go.

So what to do? The apron helps, it will reduce the lever by 3-4 inches and there is additional area to add fastening and gluing bonds. (2-4 screws plus glue over 11 square inches vs. 1 screw and glue over 3 square inches). You can see this in chairs which have to deal with constant stresses of ~200 pounds which is probably worse than a typical table would see.

I HAVE done the research (wrote my MA thesis on Venezuela), and I can tell you with a high level of certainty that almost none of what you say is supported by the facts as I've come to learn them. But I don't expect anyone just to take my word for it. It's important to cite sources for one's claims. You need to do that. I'll show you how.

I'm not sure how to prove that the ""standard of living"" has increased. Doesn't inflation factor into that?

**Inflation** 

It is true that Venezuela has high inflation, but critics of Chavez's economic policies usually fail to mention that [inflation levels were much, much higher under the neoliberal policies of the 1980s and 1990s](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_policy_of_the_Hugo_Ch%C3%A1vez_government#Consumer_prices_and_inflation). [Here's a handy graph of the history of Venezuela's inflation rate, from 1987 to 2012](http://imgur.com/8PquD). And [here is another](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=venezuela+inflation+history). Compare the *highest inflation rate* under Chavez, *30.4% in 2008*, to the inflation during the decade prior to his presidency: 30% in 1987 and 1988, **84.5%** in 1989, *40.7%* in 1990, 34.2% in 1991, 31.4% in 1992, *38.1%* in 1993, *50.85%* in 1994, **59.9%** in 1995, **99.9%** in 1996, *50%* in 1997, 35.8% in 1998, and 23.6% in 1999. 
 
**Minimum wage**

[Venezuela's minimum wage](http://venezuelanalysis.com/tag/minimum-wage) is *[the highest in the region](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_minimum_wages_by_country)*. The government [*has raised the minimum wage--between 20% and 30%--every year without fail*](http://venezuelanalysis.com/news/6914) since Hugo Chavez was first elected President in 1998.

To be fair, the actual purchasing power of workers is not, in fact, growing as significantly as it might appear, judging from these annual minimum wage increases, due to the country's rising inflation. But, so what? Even if the Chavez government has been merely adjusting the minimum wage for inflation, that is still better than most governments! Moreover, *the minimum wage was FROZEN throughout the 1980s and 1990s*, when inflation rates broke the ceiling of 100 percent annually! It should also be noted that, under the Chavez government, the number of workers receiving the minimum wage has fallen from 65 percent in 1999 to 21 percent in 2010. ([Source](http://venezuelanalysis.com/news/6914))

**Poverty**

&gt;During the past decade under Chavez, **the income poverty rate in Venezuela has dropped by more than half**, from 54% of households below poverty level in the first half of 2003, down to 26% at the end of 2008.* *""Extreme poverty"" has fallen even more - by 72%.* Further, ""these poverty rates measure only cash income, and doesn't take into account increased access to health care or education."" ([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_policy_of_the_Hugo_Ch%C3%A1vez_government#Income_and_Poverty))

**Inequality**

&gt;*Venezuela has the lowest percentage (0.38 percent) of social inequality in Latin America*, according a report released by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) ([Source](http://venezuelanalysis.com/news/6388)).

How about:
&gt;Look a the GINI index

OK, let's do that.

&gt;*Venezuela’s social inequality index (also known as Gini coefficient) this year is 0.42*,where on a scale of 0 to 1, 0.49 is low, 0.49-0.70 is medium, and 0.80-1 is high inequality, making it **the lowest in Latin America**, including Chile and Costa Rica, which had the least inequality in 2007. ([Source](http://venezuelanalysis.com/news/4064))

**Illiteracy**

You write:
&gt;look at the number of illiterate people (it stayed the same, despite a claim of hiring 1M people to teach--the government records show no records of any expenditures for such a program).

Pardon me if I do not take your word on this.

[""Mission Robinson""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_Robinson) is one of the Bolivarian Missions (a series of anti-poverty and social welfare programs) implemented by the Chavez government. The program teaches ""reading, writing and arithmetic to the *more than 1.5 million* Venezuelan adults who were *illiterate prior to Chavez's election to the presidency in 1999""*. In 2005, Venezuela declared itself a **""Territory Free of Illiteracy""**, having raised the literacy rate to ""99%"". ([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_Robinson))

Juanzen's claim--that ""poverty went up from 1998 up to 2005 then Chavez himself ordered the methodology to be changed""--is **100% FALSE**. The claim is, in fact, **refuted by [the very CEPR report](http://www.cepr.net/documents/venezuelan_poverty_rates_2006_05.pdf) that he provides as a source** (oh no)!

True,observing,,,"It has to do with proprioception, which is our ""sense of position"" in space. All of our muscles and joints have proprioceptors (receptors that detect muscle stretch/tone) so your brain knows exactly how your body is positioned at ALL times. This is how we can walk, jump, lean on one foot, reach for something, bend down, etc etc without falling over. Our brain is CONSTANTLY receiving inputs from these proprioceptors and then changing our muscle tone to keep us upright and in balance.

Because this sense is SO important, these sensations get higher priority in the brain. The nerves fibers are typically bigger and also covered with a special sheath that makes them reach the brain faster. This is especially the case of someone hurting themselves and then rubbing/pressing the area to relieve pain. Although pain is important, it is MORE important that we can get away from the pain. So when pain and proprioception race for the brain, proprioception gets there first and is given a higher priority.

This might explain the rocking back and forth. Especially with babies, activating proprioceptors (they also play a part in the inner ear or vestibular system which helps with balance) sort of nullifies the other ""stuff"" going around. The brain gives balance &amp; equilibrium number 1 priority.

I did not care at all in high school. High school is linear: 9th grade to 12th grade. There is nothing you can do but get a ""higher diploma"", if it means anything. The person with straight D's and who goes to detention every single night will earn the same privileges the person with the 4.0 who does everything under the sun in terms of a degree. I did not see any point to do so and therefore I was not competitive for college. On my SAT which I took multiple times, I got less than an 1800/2400. It was a joke; my parents basically broke down and cried at my scores, and I couldn't care less. My friends and classmates scored similar to yours and had attitudes of hard work and success. I was in fact lectured by a student who went above and beyond and took so many classes and stuff like that on how much of a slacker I was. I'm Indian, by the way, since you have a racial paragraph in your post. I should also mention that at this time, I had long hair, wore all black and band shirts, was heavily into death metal, rarely ever spoke, perhaps smoked on a regular basis out of aluminium pipes, drank at a store I worked at until I was drunk on the job, and worked about thirty hours a week all while in high school. We're in an upper-class town as well somewhere in Long Island. 

So I scored less than an 1800. I had no future in my parents or classmates minds, though my friends  and teachers knew I had potential. I applied to schools across the country, not really sure of what I wanted to do. I was thinking business, my parents wanted me to--of course--do medicine or finance. I eventually got into a pharmacy program directly out of high school. Do you know how ridiculous this is? My application was blank, and yet they accepted me. It was monumental. During our orientation, our assistant dean went through the stats. The **average** SAT grade was 1400/1600. Let's pretend my statistics work in the following example: if the mean is 1400 and each standard deviation is 100, and my score was somewhere around 1200/1600, my score is two standard deviations below the average. I was ranked in the bottom 5% of my entire entering class. I mentally gave up; I thought they let me in to take my money and then cut me off. 

I applied the same tactics in high school education to college education: whether I get straight D's or straight A's, I will be a pharmacist. Why bother putting effort into something that will be basically given to me? It wasn't until I realized just how free you are in university. One day I can be in the pharmacy program, the next day I could major in philosophy, the next day political science...it is truly freedom. I started to take my grades more seriously, I rose in the ranks quite fast. I earned a reputation for being somewhat smart, and by the time to enter professional years I was in the top 10%. I explored so many fields of pharmacy, research, working, I was doing it all. It was as if a fire was inside of me; I experienced freedom and just how powerful and influential life outside of high school really was. There is no more high school mentality.

I've pushed pharmacy to the boundaries so far that I'm done. I'm basically done with pharmacy. I took my MCATs and I'm in the cycle for being an MD/PhD, that is, a physician scientist. My parents were against this, they still want me to stay a pharmacist and get a job directly after graduation. I know this is not the path for me; I've pushed myself academically and intellectually and now I am in the position to demand things of myself rather than other people.

I was subpar in all accounts from high school to college, in the beginning, but it didn't matter. None of that matters. No one cared that I didn't have anything on my application, no one cared that I had nothing that stood out in the positive light. They only saw my potential. Like a fish on a hook, I grabbed it and gave it my all. And that's all you should do. If you're given an opportunity, capitalize on it, because it may really save your entire life. Life is hard, it's purely suffering, and people like me believe there is no real happiness....but there always comes a time where we have the opportunity to fulfill a desire and lessen this suffering on not only ourselves but those around us.

True,Chazzbo,,,"&gt;You experience a model of the world in your brain. This is a form of virtual reality. I don't think it makes sense to call it an image, because it contains many things you have never seen, like black holes and Robin Hood, as well as things that you have seen, like coffee mugs.

This paragraph makes very little sense. ""I have never seen it, therefore an image of it cannot exist / cannot be imagined."" is a confused and naive argument in it's own right, but even if it was valid it would only be nitpicking at my choice of label. I don't see where you're going with this.

The rest of the post you seem to be misinterpreting either negative effect or the exact scope of what were talking about. The visual data can indeed act negatively on the *assumptions* about what you're looking at but what you're saying is that vision data acts entirely negatively for the entire vision process which simply isn't true. 

&gt;For example, it can't be a grapefruit, because it is the wrong colour.

To know the colour of the ""something"" that you're looking at, you're brain incorporates the data it is receiving to correct it's model of the outside.

&gt;It is not constructed from sense data, nor is it deduced from sense data.

This sentence is nonsense. It IS deduced from sense data. If not there would be NO NEED FOR SENSE DATA.
Even if the sense data was a purely negative influence on the mind's model, it would **still** be using the data to deduce the nature of reality. You can't change the definition of deduce to suit your needs. 
The entire comment is explaining how you believe visual data is used to deduce the nature of reality by using visual data negatively, but you start it off by saying the very opposite.

&gt;OK, here’s the analogy with science again, Feynman sums it up:
“First you guess. Don't laugh, this is the most important step. Then you compute the consequences. Compare the consequences to experience. If it disagrees with experience, the guess is wrong. In that simple statement is the key to science.”

This is a nice quote, but is Feynman explaining that the **positive** data collected from experience to **correct** the model that was initially based on guess. 

&gt;Your perception of the mug on top of the microwave is a guess as to what is there. It wasn't constructed from sense data. It was selected from your pre-existing worldview.

This argument does not hold up when people are introduced to things that are entirely novel to them. I understand what you are trying to say, but you're extending it further than it reaches. It was not constructed *purely* from sense data but the sense data also plays a role in correction as you have yourself said.

This discussion only shows that you either have a fundamental misunderstanding of both the homuncular fallacy and negative representation or are confused as to the way you are going about explaining them. Either way, I don't see the point in continuing the argument any further as you have already argued for the fact that there **is** a stored, encoded image (or model, or representation, which ever word you feel like using), that your brain uses to interpret the environment.

True,[deleted],,,"I feel like I want to explain the opposite side. Where you come from poverty but managed to go somewhere with it.

Growing up in poverty is shit. Granted everyone knows that, but poverty is rarely rewarding and it ruins most people. If you're one of the harder working, lucky, individuals then you may find your background humbling, but that's unlikely. To most of us who have come from poverty into wealth, our backgrounds are just a burden and a tool. 

Yet some of the things you say about being rich remind me of how it is to be poor. While you can travel anywhere and experience nothing, I couldn't travel anywhere and still experience nothing. When I was at home, I stared at the same blank 4 walls daily, and when I went into the world I was a foreigner to the majority of the population. You see, being poor has a stigma. Everyone else with a basic level of perception can tell you're poor. You have an aura of being lower than them. 

Similarly you mention that relationships and the like become abstract and meaningless. When you're poor it is the same. Those gold diggers and gimme gimmes? They're the people us poor people also grow up with. The exact same people. They don't just do it to you. The second you show any level of wealth as a poor person they will be there as a ""mate"" or friend to suck it all away. You just got your welfare or benefits? Bam, they're around for a beer, or to go out, or something similar. You earned some money via a back alley odd job or won a small lottery? *Let's go celebrate with champagne at the pub!*. While it may be tiny amounts you earned or won, it will go very fast with these people around. Not only do they ask you out, no, they will enter your home and eat the little food you have, but when you visit them they have none. ""I forgot to shop"". No they didn't. They either never had any to begin with, or they hid it from you. Poor people are very cunning at saving every little bit of wealth. It gets very petty very quickly and becomes a series of mind games to see who you can fuck over the most. Family, friends, colleagues, whatever. You, and the rest of your poor family and friends, are in a game of trying to take the most from each other while losing the least. Everyone will be very diligent about debt, tabs and claiming benefits, credit and the like, but will *never* remember their own debts. 

Then we have the issue of future. You say you must take a specific job or type of job? So must poor people. Why you ask? Crabs in a Bucket. If you aspire to be more than them they will either drag you down by peer pressure because of jealousy, or they will drain every penny you earn because they are vultures. Either way they will beat you down and force you back to their level. You must either be one of them, or not. You cannot be on their level while earning enough to be ""normal"".

Let's discuss ""normal"" now. When you're poor as a child you cannot have everything the other children have. A car? Good luck. The newest games console? Those are for rich kids. Regular food? Going out for a meal? Trips to the cinema? Christmas presents? All for rich kids. A coat in the winter? Sometimes. New shoes when the soles of your old ones fall through? Perhaps, but you'll have to spend a few weeks with your feet getting wet in negative (Celcius) temperatures. As you get older you realise the importance of stealing. You have to steal to get by. What do you steal? Anything, everything. From who? Everyone. Of course, most aren't daring enough to steal something big, but anything from a few pounds on a friends table, to a keyboard from your school/ workplace, to a pair of shoes from a shop will do. Want a coke? Too expensive, let's just steal it from Woolworths. ""Does anyone need a drink? I'm just gonna steal some from that place"". Yes, this was a normal statement between my friends when we were younger.

Everybody sees this. The fact you are poor is clear. You are different, and everyone who isn't poor can tell. This is a major point, so I'm mentioning it again. The feeling that you are less, that you are worthless and that other people are looking down on your is very very real. When you're much younger it is a different story. The middle class/ working class kids don't understand why you're so poor. Why do you only have one parent? Where is your car? Why don't you have a PC? You don't have a maid? As a child you repeat the mantra ""That's for rich people only"", further cementing your differences.

As for ethics and normalcy? You don't have either if you're in poverty. ""Normal"" is what rich people are. ""Rich people"" is anyone who can afford basic living standards. Ethics are obviously out of the window. It's a competitive environment where you're all lions trying to tear the throats out of each other. You all know it, but you must cooperate to survive, but if you can just get a *little* bit more by being uncooperative, you will.

Now, I mentioned I left poverty? To be normal now hasn't solved the problems my childhood wrought on me. I'm still very competitive, I see everything in terms of gain and loss, people are still very abstract, relationships are tenuous and my culture does not match the people I am working with, and yet because of my success I can no longer return to my past people and integrate with them. This leaves me between a rock and a hard place. I cannot integrate with the ""normal"" people, nor the people I grew up with. Remember you said that you feel like a foreigner? I do more now than ever, and similarly I only socialise with the international community, further isolating me from my home culture. If I grew up normally I'd be a typical xenophobe.

Also, you sound British. I am too. I have to change my accent when I go from place to place, people from my home consider me ""posh"" if I speak as I would away from them, and ""normal"" people consider me ""chavvy"" if I speak as I would at home. Poverty is shit. Growing up poor is shit, and becoming middle class after doesn't undo it. You're left with the scars of being poor, one of those being your family that you left behind because of their constant begging for money.

The good news is that the competitiveness and lack of ethics and care for others has allowed me to be very practical in how I deal with people, and allowed me to further excel where others would not. There are *some* upsides, but I'd rather have had a real childhood and become a well rounded adult than a power hungry, money grabbing, borderline sociopath that I have become. Perhaps one day of my life I'll be able to sit back and think ""I've succeeded"", but until then I will keep doing whatever it takes to get there.

True,[deleted],,,"The evolution of line combat with musket weapons occurred during the 80 years and 30 years war in the first half of the 17th century (these wars both ended with the peace of westphalia).  Prior to the development of line warfare, the dominant military formation of that time was the spanish square, more commonly called the tercio.  The tercio was a block of about 3000 men, half of which were pike and half of which were musketeers.  The pike men stood at the center of the formation and formed a square while the musketeers were organized in groups of four ""sleeves.""  The sleeves of muskets had no more that 20 files, this put all of the musketeers close enough to the pikemen so that in the event of a cavalry charge the musketeers could take shelter in behind the pike square.  Despite the relatively slow speed of the tercio on the battlefield (it only moved at walking pace and could not run and stay in order), it was deadly on the defense as well as the offense if the enemy did not get out of the way.

One of the most fascinating aspect of the tercio was how self organizing it was.  The massive square block of pikemen could be lead by relatively few experienced soldiers and the musketeers had essentially two orders; fire at the enemy and stay close to the pike.  Since both of these orders contributed to the survival of the musketeers, they had a lot of incentive to follow them.  It's important to note that at this point, the musketeers in the tercio did not use organized fire.  They mostly just fired as fast as the could.  I would also like to point out that musketeers of this time only carried about 12 rounds with them.

During the 16th and for most of the 17th century, everyone used the tercio, but the spanish were the masters.  Their tercios would frequently blast through enemy formation, causing routes that their cavalry would exploit.  In the event of resistance, the spanish tercios would withstand incredible fire and allow an orderly retreat from the battlefield.  The problem was that the spanish were Hapsburg and staunchly catholic.  This means that they were not only fighting all of the protestant nations, but also the catholic countries that hated the Hapsburgs (France for example).  So there was an enormous incentive to come up with a way to counter spanish infantry superiority.  

The first crack in the invincible tercio came at the hands of the Dutch commander Maurice of Nassau during the battle of Nieuwpoort in the 80 years war.  Maurice drilled his musketeers on two main points; countermarch and the line formation.  The countermarch was actually an idea from a roman commander named Tacticus in 106AD.  The countermarch consisted of the first rank of a musket formation firing in a volley, then retiring to the rear to reload, while second rank would step up and repeat the process.  The countermarch allowed a well drilled formation to keep up a steady rate of fire.  Line formations allowed you to focus much more firepower on the enemy than the scattered sleeves of a tercio.  The problem with line formations was that it required highly trained soldiers in order to maintain.  Deep formations gave enormous morale to the unit, and it helped prevent soldiers from fleeing on first contact with the enemy.  With line formations, you no longer had the morale boosting effects of deep formations so you had a much bigger risk of your musketeers being routed.  Pikemen were frequently mixed with the musketeers, but these formations were also thin and prone to routing.  

Despite these innovations by Maurice, he was very nearly defeated at the Battle of Nieuwpoort despite the fact that he was holding an extremely defensible position.  Clearly something was missing from linear formations.  Enter Gustavus Adolphus, the king of Sweden.  Gustavus realized something that every other military commander of the time had apparently missed; the most important part of combat was morale shock.  As long as a formation kept its order, it was very difficult to kill the enemy.  If you could give an enemy formation a massive enough shock to their morale, their formation would break, the soldiers would flee, and they could be easily killed by pursuing cavalry.  Gustavus realized that he could use gunfire to deliver such a shock, if ALL of his musketeers fired at once.  To accomplish this, Gustavus used linear formations in order to bring more firepower to bear on the the enemy.  Gustavus didn't just use volley fire with his infantry, but with his cavalry as well.  His cavalry were drilled to meet enemy formation by firing a massed volley from their pistols then charge all at once with sabers drawn.  With this maneuver, the Swedish cavalry could repulse charges by other cavalry.  The combination of massed fire and linear formations came together beautifully in the Battle of Breitenfeld where Gustavus Aldophus crushed Johann Tserclaes, the count of Tilly, one of the greatest commanders of his age.


Summary

It's important to remember that volley fire did not necessarily cause more casualties than fire at will methods, in fact it probably produced fewer.  This didn't matter though, because the shock of a thousand men simultaneously firing muskets at close range could shatter the resolve of all but the most determined of enemies, leaving them open to charges by cavalry.  Consequently, troops had to be trained to maintain formation even under heavy fire, or else they would be destroyed by the enemy's cavalry.  After the death of Gustavus, other commanders had difficulty repeating Gustavus's success.  However, linear formations became more and more important to warfare, and volley fire almost completely replaced fire at will.

Once last note, during the Napoleonic wars, Napoleon actually started using square formations like tercios again for rapid assaults and moving his men. Columns move much faster than lines do, and they're easier to to maneuver over terrain.  When exchanging fire however, the Napoleonic columns would revert to line formations.

True,shadywack,,,"As far as mercury output goes, it's simple.  It's called a zero discharge policy.  Facilities have to apply for the certification, and the requirements are zero discharges of chemicals or water of any kind.  The facility I work for has that certification and requirement as part of its title 5 operating permit.  Depending on the regulatory requirements in the area a facility was built and the timeframe in which it was constructed a zero discharge may or may not be applicable.  

Granted, it's not many plants that operate this way because its rather costly.  It prohibits slurry storage for coal and ash, and requires dry storage.  Our coal is stored dry and its a requirement we do dust control.  Ash is stored in silos until it's transported back to the mine where it joins the land reclamation project.  It's sequestered there and overlaid with about 5' of clay.

Again, most plants don't operate this way because it's a bit more costly.  

As for cap and trade, my employer abhors it, but I love it.  Just because I work there doesn't mean I won't testify before a committee extolling its virtues, because it actually is a good idea.  Coal industry executives just see it as something that cuts into their bonuses and attempts to price them out of competition with natural gas.  There are a lot of things that can be done to compete such as goal gasification, converting to a fluidized bed boiler, and even CCS.

As for your question on CCS, there is no large scale operating facility.  Right now it's only at a proving facility and their output is in the ballpark of 75Mwh.  The problem is that it reduces net generating output by up to 50%.  The point that it will be feasible is when they can get that percentage down to 25%.  The fear, at a corporate level, is that at some point there's a policy change coming that will be to the effect of ""it is now illegal to have carbon output"" so there is a colossal effort to go in the direction of CCS.  My particular employer is funding a geological survey to see if the CCS system can store the carbon nearby or if a transport system will need to be arranged.  There's also various coops partnering up and throwing serious cash at the engineering side, so the momentum is already building and there is real resources going to this effort.  A few facilities are in the preparation stages to accommodate the equipment and process.

Anyhow, no offense taken from the snarkyness.  I'm seeing this happening inside the industry, and quite frankly I'm thankful Obama is forcing a reaction out of it.  There are so many plants that have a high NOX output and a great deal of SO2.  Where I work the removal requirement is 90% of all the SO2 and a stack opacity of no more than 3%.  However, I've seen many places that operate under a byzantine title 5 permit that only requires a 50% removal rate and a stack opacity requirement of 30%.  At that stack opacity those things are belching out a ton of mercury right into the atmosphere ontop of contributing a ridiculous amount of acid rain (think, sulfur dioxide plus water equals sulfuric acid, breath SO2 and with the lungs being quite moist you're burning your lungs from the inside out).

I've testified before my state's PUC, and in doing so I invite many people I see there to come and check out our plant for themselves.  Clean coal can be done, and I'm honestly proud of how we run.  Our skies are clear and our water is clean.

True,Irish_Whiskey,,,"&gt;I as a mormon and hopefully 100% of the others of my faith (pretty sure they think the same) believe that #1 we shouldn't force our beliefs on others ever because of this same burden of proof. This is why I can say pretty easily that Mitt Romney probably would never outlaw abortion.

You're funny. You're a funny person.

This is clearly nonsense. Such a principle of 'agency' may exist in Mormonism, but the church from it's early days to today has made a concerted effort from the text and control of the church, to change laws to limit the rights of non-Mormon individuals. Both in Utah, where many limits on consumption of pornography and alcohol exist (even though it's the leading consumer of online porn), and nationally in terms of things like gay rights, secular government, and in science and sex education.

Mitt Romney couldn't have outlawed abortion, because the Supreme Court ruled it a fundamental constitutional right, and because it's supported by the majority of the country. On the other hand there's tons of other issues where Romney would impose religious principles onto others, and he's specifically pledged to do exactly that in the Mormon ceremony which was leaked online. Not to mention he promises as much directly at rallies (usually leaving out Mormonism and just mentioning ""God"", so those listening will think it's the same God, when it's actually defined radically differently).

I know plenty of Mormons, most of them moderate and non-imposing. But just like other Christians, they see no problem voting and acting on their views. And you know what? **They're right.** Because if you actually think abortion is murder and homosexuality angers God, you should act based on those beliefs. Even when it means forcing rape victims to carry the fetus, and shunning your gay child.

That's why we tend to challenge beliefs, even when the moderates in the faith claim they as individuals do no harm. Because beliefs control actions. Mine do as much as a religious persons, but since I have to justify beliefs I act on with reason, and they justify themselves to millions on the authority of books written by ignorant men containing evil commands and untrue claims, the latter is the main problem. Secular government should be a check on that but it's clear the majority of Mormons, and the church in particular, don't respect that notion.

&gt;turns out the experiment of pretending i believed in god set in motion the events that in the end convinced me 100% of its reality.

And if you'd started to convince yourself of Buddhism or Sikhism, then you'd have been convinced of that reality. Particularly if you lived in a culture which supported and affirmed that belief. 

It staggers me when religious people make the argument ""If you have faith, you'll see it's true!"" Well, yeah. That's true of any claim. Because having faith means convincing yourself, regardless of it's actual truth. Obviously all the other mutually exclusive religions have adherents who feel the same way you do, which is a massive clue your feeling isn't reliable.

Also, we can go into the whole history of Joseph Smith and his claims if you like. I'd be hard-pressed to decide whether he or L. Ron Hubbard was the more obvious con-artist, since both made provably false claims about themselves to sell a story about aliens and gods to their own material benefit. Both of them having a reputation as con-men who told similar fictions (alien military vessels, magic seer stones) as ordinary scams prior to starting their religions, both of them using that power for money and young girls before dying ignominiously.

&gt;so to answer your last query i believe that human beings were created in the image of a god. a being that has a perfected human form.

Really? The most perfect being who created the universe built his excretory functions into the same orifice as his pleasure and reproduction centers? If female, she has a constricted vagina that tears during reproduction due to evolving to walk upright? If male, he has nipples? 

Honestly, this is a silly tangent, but I think it's just another example of how the same religions that claimed the God created the universe for humanity, earth was the center of the universe, God only cared about one particular backwater tribe, God cares massively about their sex lives, the Garden of Eden was in Missouri, and God looks human, all because they naturally were self-centered. The Mormons Americanized Christianity, for the same reason there are Japanese people who think Jesus lived and died in Honshu. 

Humans probably aren't objectively the most important things in the universe. To think that whatever group you're in is correct in judging your group as the most important beings in existence, based on geography, gender, race (which until federal order in 1978 didn't include black people, and still doesn't include Native Americans), and time, isn't insight or exploration of the supernatural, but extremist narcissism.

True,CaspianX2,,,"Starting in 2014, large businesses (businesses with 50 or more employees, 100 or more in some states) will be required to either provide health insurance or pay a fee ( [Citation: Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act Page 174, sec. 4980H](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=174) ). Switching to part-time only won't help, as the Affordable Care Act counts the hours worked, not just the number of full-time employees you have. So if your employees worked an equivalent of 50 full-time employees' hours, the requirement kicks in. Also, this includes businesses with multiple locations (chain stores, etc.), but *not* independently-owned franchises, as franchises have a separate owner (however, if an individual franchise employs over 50 employees, they *do* fall within the requirement) ( [Citation: Baker Law, a legal website discussing the implications of the bill](http://www.bakerlaw.com/alerts/special-health-care-reform-series-special-focus-on-the-employer-employee-relationship-part-i-8-15-2012/) ).

If an employee has 120 hours in a month, that counts as one full-time employee. If two employees each have 60 hours in a month, that counts as one employee. The number of full-time employees doesn't matter. Only the number of hours worked.

So yes, they will either still be required to provide coverage or hit with the penalty, unless reducing employees' hours gets them under the *equivalent* of 50 full-time workers' work hours.

So really, the only businesses for which this would be a viable strategy are those who have slightly over 50 employees (or the equivalent thereof), can still operate at under 50, have no desire to expand, and are not a part of a large chain. The vast majority of businesses are not likely to fall under this description. According to [entrepeneur.com](http://www.entrepreneur.com/blog/220616), businesses making between $10,000 and $10 million of revenue account for just 17 percent of business income, and of those, only 23 percent actually *have* employees.

In addition, while large businesses are hit with this requirement, small businesses are actually given a leg up. While employers with fewer than 50 employees  are not required to provide insurance, employers with 25 or fewer employees who *choose* to do so will get a tax credit to pay for 50% of the cost of insurance. ( [Citation: Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act Page 157, sec. 1421](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=157) )

Long story short - this is a political statement. Nothing more, nothing less.

**Edit**: As others here have correctly pointed out, even though lowering hours won't likely get an employer out of the 50+ employee requirement, it does mean that that they'll be able to get out of the requirement for that individual employee. So if a company were to lower all its employees to 29 hours/week each, yes, that *would* be a way of getting around the requirement in the ACA, although if even one employee went above 120 hours/month, that employee would need to get benefits or the fee/penalty would be enacted.

So in this respect, I suppose this *is* a valid approach, although not until 2014 (because this section of the ACA doesn't kick in until then). And even then, there's an argument to be made that an employer only offering part-time work with no benefits is far less likely to attract quality employees than a competitor who *does* offer those things.

**Edit 2**: Kaiser has a flowchart [here](http://healthreform.kff.org/the-basics/employer-penalty-flowchart.aspx) that explains things a bit better.

In reality, they should have been terrified that their campaign plans were blowing up in their faces left, right and center.

True,mayonuki,,,"Everytime you make a decision to do something and don't follow through, you weaken your self-control and will power.  It's just like a parent constantly bending to a child.  The child will know what it can get away with and how to get the parent to always compromise.

Stop compromising with yourself.

In order to do this, set small realistic goals and rules to follow that are very very concrete.  Instead of saying, I'm going to start cleaning more often, or even I'm going to start doing the dishes right away, it is much better to say 'I will not go to sleep with dirty dishes in the sink.'  The first two goals are vague and that makes it easy to compromise.  The third policy is discreet so you cannot simply negotiate out of it with semantics or something like that.

Start With only a few of these, like three at most.  Something like

*  No sleep until dishes are done.

* Make the bed every morning.

* Put all dirty clothes in the hamper in the morning.

 
And maybe give yourself a day off like Sunday to ignore them.  This day is a chance to break the habit without establishing a pattern of compromise.  These habits don't have to be household chore related.  They are just simple examples.  If you want discipline in a specific area of your life, like studying, then set these three goals in that field.  Again, be as specific as possible in creating EASY goals to achieve on a regular basis.  Daily is ideal with as strict a schedule as is logistically possible as that will make the habit stick fasted.  After a few weeks of following these to the letter, add one or two more according to how much time/energy you can afford to give.  Do not over exert yourself.  It is better to do one thing every day for a year than five things for just a few weeks. 

You should not think about what you will do if you break these habits, because you do not want to create alternative options.  For example, if you say 'If I don't do A, I will not watch TV that day' it leaves a lot of room for you to bargain with yourself.  These policies should not be negotiable at all.  A punishment will simply provide you with an alternative.

I do recommend, however, that if you should fail at something, to quickly do something symbolic to motivate yourself.  Again with housecleaning, maybe scour the entire house to refresh things.  You'll enjoy the cleaner house and you will want to keep working hard to keep it that way.  Determine a large individual task to complete as you break habits, not before.  Never think I am willing to clean my house house tomorrow so I will just leave the dishes for tonight.  But if you get home drunk and pass out before washing, think of something in the morning and do it as quickly as possible.  The sooner you get back on track the easier it will be to reestablish the good habit.

It is really hard to keep even a simple habit up for a week or more.  Harder than simply studying for a single test, or preparing for a single occurrence.  So that is the focus early, to set achievable habits that will improve your life.  As you develop this habit building muscle you will be able to start new good habits more easily.  You will stop indulging yourself.  You will have more self-respect for it.  And you will have self control.

True,historyisveryserious,,,"Well, I'm not sure anyone can give you a perfect answer to a question like this but I'll give it a go. First off I'll simply note that all of Einstein's contributions predate quantum mechanics as we know it and for the most part predate even the old quantum theory (what you might call BKS, short for Bohr Kramers Slater as they co-authored what might be called the most representative paper of the old quantum theory, although it was hardly as cohesive of a theory as matrix mechanics or wave mechanics).

So back to why Einstein is famous. Now clearly there are reasons outside of the science itself: his uniquely disheveled look, his demeanor, his involvement in certain political endeavors, but I'll limit myself to his physics. First I should mention that Einstein gained worldwide celebrity status after the eclipse observations of 1919 confirmed some of the more bizarre aspects of General Relativity. This is all well and good but I'm going to talk about what it was about Einstein the scientist that made him so intriguing, to other scientists and to the public.

Einstein possessed a very special sort of creativity and self confidence in his physics which allowed him to entertain promising ideas despite an onslaught of initial problems. He wasn't the best mathematical physicist (although you shouldn't believe the myths about his first wife doing the math for him), nor was he uniquely gifted in the aspects of physics that border on the discipline that is now called the philosophy of physics, namely picking out subtle misapprehensions and concerns that lie at the heart of a theory and/or its often less than explicit assumptions, and then expressing with clarity the implications of these issues. Einstein's good friend Paul Ehrenfest was certainly of the latter type, and as Einstein mentions in his eulogy for Ehrenfest (who tragically shot himself and his mentally handicapped son Vassik after a long battle with depression) these impressive ""...critical faculties transcended his constructive capacities. In a manner of speaking, his critical sense robbed him of his love for the offspring of his own mind even before they were born."" Einstein was Ehrenfest's polar opposite in this regard, and perhaps that is why they were such good friends and why Einstein found Ehrenfest's input so valuable.

Another contributing element of Einstein's approach to physics (and what might be most significant in explaining his fame) was his preference for developing principle theories versus what we call constructive theories. I apologize for what is about to be a rather long quotation but I think it would be best if we let Einstein explain the distinction in his own words: 

&gt;""We can distinguish various kinds of theories in physics. Most of them are constructive. They attempt to build up a picture of the more complex &gt;phenomena out of the materials of a relatively simple formal scheme from which they start out. Thus the kinetic theory of gases seeks to reduce &gt;mechanical, thermal, and diffusional processes to movements of molecules -- i.e., to build them up out of the hypothesis of molecular motion. When we &gt;say that we have succeeded in understanding a group of natural processes, we invariably mean that a constructive theory has been found which covers &gt;the processes in question.
 
&gt;Along with this most important class of theories there exists a second, which I will call ""principle-theories."" These employ the analytic, not the synthetic, &gt;method. The elements which form their basis and starting-point are not hypothetically constructed but empirically discovered ones, general characteristics &gt;of natural processes, principles that give rise to mathematically formulated criteria which the separate processes or the theoretical representations of &gt;them have to satisfy.  Thus the science of thermodynamics seeks by analytical means to deduce necessary conditions, which separate events have to &gt;satisfy, from the universally experienced fact that perpetual motion is impossible.
 
&gt;The advantages of the constructive theory are completeness, adaptability, and clearness, those of the principle theory are logical perfection and security &gt;of the foundations.  The theory of relativity belongs to the latter class.""

Einstein was talking about general relativity here in 1919, although it would apply equally well to special relativity. In any case Einstein's preference for principle theories lies at the heart of his reputation and fame. With just a handful (or in the case of special relativity just two) of basic principles Einstein would deduce a wonderful theoretical framework out of thin air. Naturally a sort of mystique and popular appeal builds around the individual who seemingly revolutionizes his field merely through deep contemplation (I'm fully aware this is a bit hyperbolic although Einstein was famously disinterested in experiment).  I might add that this sort of work will also necessarily appear more spontaneous than the typical cumulative narrative that we can weave about scientific development, and this only adds to the legend (I say appears because in the case of special relativity Einstein was truly sitting atop Lorentz's shoulder's)

I'll make a final slightly more obvious, but nonetheless crucial point. The breadth of Einstein's work is truly awe inspiring. In 1905 alone he published five crucial papers in five fairly divergent fields of physics. Even when some of his papers weren't well received (no one was buying into light quanta until the Compton effect) his vindication through later discoveries only made him seem even more prescient. I'm not going to summarize all of his work but take a look [HERE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein#1905_.E2.80.93_Annus_Mirabilis_papers) and scroll down a bit and you'll get a sense of just how influential he was in such a wide range of fields.

Ok Ok one last bit. Einstein can be viewed as coming down on the wrong side of the shift to modern quantum mechanics, after all he famously asserted ""God doesn't play dice"" and as he makes clear in EPR (Einstein Podowlsky Rosen) he believed quantum mechanics to be incomplete (ie there was a hidden variable unaccounted for). Nevertheless, in spelling out the reasoning for the incompleteness of quantum mechanics Einstein and his co-authors made clear the choices that could be made, namely one could pick non-locality or construct a local hidden variable theory. Now even though Bell's theorem would prove Einstein's preferred choice to be wrong, the EPR paper was nonetheless a seminal work as it made explicit ideas of non-locality that lay at the heart of quantum mechanics (and indeed would pave the way for numerous interpretations of quantum mechanics). Even when he was wrong, Einstein was still pretty damn impressive.

I hope this was somewhat instructive. I apologize about the ridiculous length.

Change the box shadowing on the linkinfo pane for the light theme.
&gt; In my opinion, the shadowing on this specific box is odd in comparison to the rest of the theme, which comes off as sleek and polished, where that div comes off as windows 98.

Add a more elegant design to the submit a post button in the light theme.
&gt;Compared to the theme selector below it, it looks very plain. It does grab attention, so maybe this point is moot.

Change the text-alignment on the moderators pane to left or right alignment.
&gt; it personally irks me to see that box with no real pattern to the character length inside that box.

Add some form of border to the Moderator pane and the Recently Viewed Links pane in the light theme.
&gt; It feels detached from the rest of the sidebar.

Change the footer for the light theme to better fit the skin thematically.
&gt;It feels jarring to go from a light theme and see a black banner.

Add more distinction between posts in comment threads for the light theme.
&gt;Only having a minimal indent between posts makes it a bit hard to find the parent only through visuals. A left-border on each comment should solve this problem.

Change user flair color in the dark theme, or add a background to user flair.
&gt;The contrast ratio is not enough for text.

Slightly reposition katarina in the header further right, to fit with the logo repositioning
&gt;She feels too close to the logo and snoo.

True,[deleted],,,"Uh, yeah. I'm quite worried, really, that everyone seemed to be agreeing with diemockingbirddie. okcupid is a dating website, duh. Of course there are going to be a lot of people on there trying to hook up. I think it's wrong for him to go on there, lie about who he is by making a fake profile all in an attempt to be judgmental about other people, and then instead, he gets different results and finds another reason to be judgmental in some other shallow way. Yeah, some guys aren't beautiful, dude. Ya can't just change that. If you're not into someone, (and obviously you wouldn't be, because you're a guy with a fake, trap profile) just turn them down. But they're not all the same as you. 

And it's not wrong to be enthusiastic about video games. Not everyone is into that, but some people are. If a guy wanted to talk about video games, that would probably be a good conversation starter with lots of women, who by the way, also play video games. Look, not everybody is going to be fucking suave and shit! Some people are gonna be like ""let's get high and fuck and play video games!"" ""yea okay, yey!"" and there's nothing wrong with that. This guy, though, is just deriding people he doesn't even know, based on the assumption that they're just like him; turning his own insecurities about himself onto other people who he believes to be like himself (but may or may not be, really).

My point is, let's not praise this guy as though he made some kind of profound epiphany and now he's going to change his life for the better because he learned from his mistakes. It's fucked up to go on a dating site and make a fake profile to try to trick guys into wanting to fuck you, and then when they do want to fuck you, you deride them for looking desperate. Fact of life: guys want to fuck. Let's not make fun of people for wanting totally normal things, but not being alpha-as-fuck, confident, beautiful social butterflies.

True,bluecoconut,physics,Condensed Matter Physics | Communications | Embedded Systems,"(Really long post, answer to question is simply stated in TL;DR - but is unsatisfactory without background)

So, lets approach this a few different ways. First with the simplest, and then to increasingly more accurate descriptions.

So, as theduffer said, according to the laws of electricity and magnetism, the speed of light is related to these two variables, permeability and permativity of the material its going through. Now, why is that? That is because following the classical derivation of electricity and magnetism, we come up with some differential equations which describe the proegation of a wave. This wave is what we call light. This light is self perpetuating, just the same as a pendulum is self perpetuating. A pendulum will continue to swing forever as long as there is no friction or drag. This is also in the same way the fact that earth is self preptuating around the sun, it is in an orbit. In the same way, as light is traveling, the electric and magnetic fields are oscillating back and forth, necessitating that the light continues flowing forward. A good way to understand that light is just due to this oscillation, we can just look at a radio antenna. Radio waves are light, as is all electromagnetic radiation. We make radio waves by literally pushing and pulling electrons to one end of the antenna, and then back to the first end Doing this creates an electric field which is oscillating, this in turn creates a magnetic field that is oscillating, which makes an electric field that is oscillating, each one extended in space a little, creating a wave that physically moves and travels. 

So, what describes the speed of that light? Well, we have equations which describe if you put an electron at point A, and another electron at point B, and we can measure how strong those two things pull on each-other. Likewise we can do this with spin and magnets. With these measurements, we find out that nature itself has a fundamental strength when it comes to electric and magnetic fields. And, there is a physical response of the universe to these things, that just always is the same no matter where and how we measure it. We have overtime determined that this fundamental and universal thing we keep seeing is also the same limit of the speed of light. 

So now, we have determined that the fundamental speed of light is due to the medium through which it travels, and in a vacuum, it still has a characteristic speed that is not infinite. This is to say, space itself and electric and magnetic fields in space cannot respond instantaneously. Then we must ask, why not? What is physically stopping us here. And this is where we must get into relativity. 

As it turns out, the universe itself has some fundamental relation between the dimension of time and the dimension of space. This is to say, space and time can be turned into each other (in a sense). If you were to start moving very very fast the distances you are traveling and the time you experience will be different from someone who is stationary. This ability for us to transform from time to space is contained within the math of ""Lorentz Transformations"" 

So, this is to say, nature has a specific way for us to change physical dimension, length into time. These things as it turns out are necessarily directly related. These things are two heads to the same coin, except that time itself is always propagating in one direction, and the spatial dimensions are things we are free to roam around in. (That is a much harder question and concept to try to tackle, and up to much debate)

So! Now we have made mention that space and time are actually connected, they are actually fundamentally related somehow. Well, we measure time by counting essentially. We find a pendulum and count how many times it has ticked. We assign an arbitrary number to that and say ""15 ticks have passed, and it ticks once every millisecond, therefore 15 milliseconds have passed""  That is how a second is defined. And now, we have space, how is space defined? Well, we used to have a stick on the ground and said, this stick is ""1 unit"" length, and people called it a foot, a meter, whatever they wanted. And with these two variables, we are able to measure what the speed of light is, as a length over time. Some 3*10^8 meters per second. However, as it turns out, due to relativity, meters and second should be the same thing in some way. They are both measurements of length in their dimension. So, we could have just as easily stopped at the definition of 1 second, and then said that c is the speed of light, and called that ""1"" At this point, we would say that the stick you placed on the ground is actually 3 nanoseconds long. In this sense, nature actually specifically relates these two dimensions and defines C in such a way that that is how the two dimensions talk to each other.

So now, I have two last points to make. 

One: That in fact, speed of light is less of a ""speed"" and more of a conversion factor between time and space. For this reason, when we are wondering why you cannot go faster than the speed of light, why isn't speed of light higher, etc. what we are really asking is why is the ratio of time to space defined as is? Why can space not be longer for the same amount of time? Now that is the hardest question to answer, as we are getting deep into the fundamentals of general relativity, and the limits of modern physics. As it stands right now, its almost taken for granted, that... space itself is all wibbly-wobbly, and the amount of bounce and shape and cushion that space itself has fundamentally is described by some physical _constants_ and in that sense, the speed of light is one of them. In some way, space itself has some built in number that explains this, and all we can do is measure it. This is the same way as asking about the other fundamental constants, which as it is understood are fundamental descriptions of the universe. One possible interpretation is that there is some symmetry group which describes the universe, and under this symmetry there are constants, and from these constants come other constants such as the speed of light. (Noether's theorem) 

And Two: just a small side comment / joke: When I saw your question about ""c+1"" I actually read that as is twice as fast. It turns out, when you write down the math, if you measure length in seconds, and time in seconds (or length in meters and time in meters. (I'm 7 parsecs old!)) then c is just equal to 1 exactly. In this sense our notion of ""3*10^8"" is almost arbitrary. And that is why we have defined it precisely (for the sake of the definition of the meter) as being: 299,792,458 meters per second _exactly_. But we could have just as well defined it as 17 potatoes per hour. And then measured our lengths in potatoes. 

So... **TL;DR**: Sorry for just going on for so long, but I felt like a lot of background is needed for this unsatisfactory sounding answer... As far as we know, light goes as fast as it does because it simply is the constant in the universe that is the ""fastest"" anything can go. And therefore, it cannot go faster because the concept of moving faster than that simply does not exist. Also, yes, light is truly self perpetuating.

True,gloomdoom,,,"I disagree with the idea that ""nobody wants a recession."" Sure they do. Plenty of people have dug in to try to make this recession last as long as possible. 

Why? I'll tell you. At least beyond the obvious obstructionism and party battles in the House/Senate.

Why republicans are more than happy to extended recessions whenever a recovery may be possible is because these economic conditions allow corporations to make record profits. We know that and we can prove it with data from the past 5 years.

And here's how it works...it's actually rather simple: Companies and corporations use the 'recession' as an excuse to freeze wages, cut back on benefits, vacation days, sick days...you name it. They slice, they cut, they gut everything possible on the *worker* side of the company. That includes, of course, layoffs...or rather, allows them to *justify* layoffs even when none are necessary.

What happens to a company of 120 workers whenever the CEO announces layoffs? ""Well, you'll have to pick up the slack of those we've lost or we'll go out of business and you'll all lose your jobs.""

You *do* end up with a work force of people who are working much, much harder (sometimes doing the work of *three* employees) with threats over their heads of more layoffs. It is a literal cracking of the whip. You get a work force who is more productive and cheaper than ever, you have your choice of the best workers (from job losses and companies closing) for the cheapest price imaginable and your profits go through the roof.

Why? The economy is bad, right? There is a recession! How are they making these gigantic record profits? They have cut the shit out of their operating costs by using subtle threats, freezing wages, demanding higher worker output, eeking by with the lowest amount of staff possible. Meanwhile, the higher ups give up nothing and the employees sacrifice everything to keep the company going and to create those record profits.

So don't tell me that the republican world of 'job creators' doesn't *love* a fucking recession. They do. The workers will probably *never*  make up that ground lost as employees and even as things improve and wages finally do start to raise a little bit, they will still be doing more than their share for much less of their share of the profits.

That's a business model that goes back a very long time in company history and IT WORKS. It obviously doesn't work for all companies because sometimes it's more than the economy that is causing a business to tank...it can simply be horrible management or shoddy financial management. Not every business that closed in the past 5 years did so because the economy was the main reason.

So let's lose this notion that republicans don't want a recession or want to help us get *out* of a recession. As the recession *lifts*, there is more opportunity for workers, more competition to get the most skilled workers (which means higher wages and having to lay out more money for things like basic benefits to attract the best workers) and they will see their profits stagnate as a result of paying very basic operating costs that they should have been paying all along.

They *do* like recessions and, as we've seen, the republican party will fight tooth and nail to keep us in one because it means much higher corporate profits and much less money and benefits to the employees.",0,1352583190,,0,False,1,c6ze42f,t3_12yyz9,t1_c6ze42f,t3_12yyz9,,1430371701,80,False,politics,t5_2cneq,80

Your self-worth in life isn't based on what you have or what you look like. Humans aren't flowers, nobody respects you because of the shape of your god damn jawline. Nobody gives a damn if you're a genius. Nobody gives a flying f*ck if you're talented. Nobody gives a crap if you're rich.

Do you think people respect Nelson Mandela for his IQ?

Life is like poker, you're dealt a hand and you work those cards to accomplish whatever you can. Life is about tearing down obstacles, no matter what they are. Stop trying to get attention -- why the fuck do you need attention from other people? Why the fuck do you care what I think of you? I'm some fucking douchebag that goes home and masterbates to midget porn just like the rest of these degenerates. I'm not special. Stop giving a fuck what I, or anybody around you think. I'm nothing. This is your life, so live it how YOU want to live it.

Life isn't about impressing other people. You don't need good looks, or money, or genius or talent to have a good life. Be kind, be compassionate, be hard working, be assertive, and be principled. Then I'll respect you. I don't give a fuck about anything else.

Now stop fucking feeling sorry for yourself. Every time you cry you're reinforcing that there's something wrong with you. Get up off your ass and start building your life. You really want people to respect you? Work harder than everyone around you.

Just look at Jay-Z. He's not good looking. He grew up broke. He's not a genius. He wasn't the most talented emcee growing up. He worked his f*cking ass off and didn't give a rats ass what anyone thought of him. Now he's worth $500 million and married to Beyonce friggin Knowles.

True,whitbyrudie,,,"I'm a carpenter and contractor of 10 years, and I think that this is actually a fairly easy build, I'll try to lay it out for you as simply as I can here.

Materials:
1 8 foot 2x10 
4"" screws 
3"" screws
one sheet of drywall
drywall screws
Mud
Finishes (chains, countertop, sink, faucets, lights, etc)

1. First off, you're going to need to get your wood. You could go and cut down a tree, season it, and then try to cut it to shape yourself but that's going to be a nightmare so you're best bet is to print out your picture, head over to your local saw mill, point at the picture and say 

""i'm building this, got anything that might work?""

Shy of that, ask a lumber jack.

Before you set off to source your wood, you'll need your dimensions though so keep that in mind, write down your width and length of your bathroom countertop so you don't end up buying something to small.

2. Next, is prep.  Those big ass chains are what's supporting the countertop's weight, as opposed to it sitting on the floor, which means you can't screw a couple drywall plugs into the wall and secure it up, you're going to need significant backing in the.  So let's do that.  First figure out where you want the brackets to be, they'll need to be somewhere near either end, but after that you'll need to determine the height, this is mostly an asthetic choice but it looks like the source material is a 45 degree angle so I'd go with that, a quick bit of math and you should determine your height.  Mark the rough location of each bracket on the wall.  Now to install the support backing

3. You're going to need to open a large hole in the drywall to get your backing in.  So where your marks for where those support brackets are goign to go, I'd roughly measure 8 inches above and below the mark giving you a sixteen inch sized hole.  The width will need to be three stud cavities.  The middle cavity will be where the backing goes, the ones to the left and right you need open to face screw your backing inside.

4. Okay, next cut up your 2x10 to fit in the stud cavity's for each bracket, this is likely going to be about 14 - 3/8"".  you need 4 pieces cut, two for each bracket.  screw two together with the 3"" screws, if it were me i'd put 9 screws in.  After you've screwed them together you should have two sets of double 2x10.  This is your backing.

5. Go back to that hole in your wall, on the left and right studs of your center cavity, mark the center of where you want that bracket to be, measure up from that center mark 4 - 5/8"" this will be the top of your backing.  Slip your backing into the cavity lining the top of your double up with the marks you just made. This will be a bit easier if you cut your piece just a little bit big so it's held in by pressure while you screw it.  Now screw it in using the 4"" screws, screw from the opposite side of the stud so the screw go through the stud first, then into your backing piece.  I would use about 16 screws for each backing piece, 8 screw per side, 4 screws into each 2x10.

6. Now that you've done this for both sides, you can drywall it back up, mud it, prime it and paint it.  You're a DIY'er so I'm assuming you know how to do this, if not just ask and I'll sort you out there as well.

7. Next you need to cut and finish your wood piece. Take it to the shop, take lots of measurements to ensure it will be an exact fit (do not assume your corners are 90 degrees, I guarantee they're not, use an angle finder and get them precise, this is very important for counter tops, I would even recommend cutting it on a piece of plywood first to use as a template and make sure it fits awesome.  Then cut out your sink hole (just about every sink you can buy will come with a paper template, so just put it on and cut it out, if it's a very thick piece of wood, I'd recommend using a beam cutter attachment for a skill saw, just be careful and remember it doesn't have to be the prettiest cut, as it will be hidden by the sink, just make sure you don't cut it to large as there's no way to hide this.  Don't forget to cut the holes for your faucet as well, again most faucets will have a template for this) 

8. After cutting it and checking to see it fits, you need to finish it.  The top surface will have saw marks from the mill you need to take these out, use a belt sander, starting with 50 grit and working your way up to 180 grit paper.  Be VERY careful with 50 grit paper that you don't put a big bowl in the piece and it's very easy to do this.  After you use the belt, finish it with a palm sander, starting with 100 grit and working your way to 400 grit.  

9. Stain and Urethane that shit! I won't give a how to on this as you can find it on you tube and it will be more clear.

10.  build a temp stand for the counter top that you can set it on in order to install the brackets and chains.  I would simple make two frames out of 2x4 and set them on either end, making sure they're perfectly level.  Again, don't assume your floor is level here, it probably isn't so build one, then use a level to get the measurements for the next, then build that one.  Once this is built you can set your counter top on it.

11.  When you purchase those chains and brackets, I'd likely get it done at a custom shop, have them assemble it and paint it for you, so that the chain is already connected to the wall and counter brackets, this will save you A LOT of grief.  Install the wall brackets first.  You'll need to pilot hole (pre drill) for the big lag bolts that will be needed.  Use a torpedo level here to make sure they're nice and level.  Also, use a level to make sure both brackets are at exactly the right level otherwise it'll look weird.  measure how far from the corner the bracket on the wall is so you can measure this distance off the wall and make a mark on your piece to ensure the chains look straight.  Pull the chains tight, and set the bracket on counter top, lining it up with your pencil marks, mark the holes, predrill, then screw the lags in.  It's okay if the chains are slightly loose here as when you pull the temp supports it'll tighten up.

12.  Pull htose temp supports and put a 90 degree bracket on either end of the counter at the back on the bottom so that it hits a stud.  This is not going to support weight, but this will hold it tight in place and prevent it from moving on the chains.

13.  Install all your finishes, plumbing, etc, 

That's pretty much it in a nut shell.  Iwon't lie it's going to be an assload of work but i think you'll be happy with the result at the end of the day. Just remember, this is a center piece, so make sure you don't cut any corners, if you do, people will see it and it will look a lot worse.  Take your time, acknowledge it's going to take a long time, and just do it right, you'll be happy you did in the end.

A launcher is a custom homescreen, that allows you to customize it to however you want. With Apex and Nova (and others), you can literally start with a blank canvas. Get rid of everything on the screen, and add only the stuff you want. Apex and Nova are also based on the stock launcher, so if you leave it the way it is, it looks exactly like the stock launcher. 

Now about this ""pure Android experience"". Any device can install a launcher to make it look like the stock Android launcher. But manufacturers put their own skins onto their phones. These skins appear to be just the launchers, but it actually goes a lot deeper than that. TouchWiz (Samsung's skin) has it's own framework. Meaning apps built for TouchWiz will not run on anything else. It also skins the messaging, clock, settings, contacts, etc. All the features like Pop-up video, S Beam, and stuff like that are also built into the manufacturer skin. A ""pure Android experience"" means that there is no manufacturer skin. Benefits of it including a better UI (to some people), and most importantly, faster updates. Because updates to Nexus devices come directly from Google, you get the fastest updates to the newest OS version. Meanwhile, Samsung is busy putting TouchWiz on this new version, and HTC is putting on Sense. This takes a while. Getting direct support from Google also means third party devs will be able to get a working ROM out faster. Google has already released the codes made for your device, so ROM devs just have to add in their stuff to make it ""custom"". For other non-Nexus devices, they would have to first port the AOSP (stock Android) code to make it work with other devices, before they can add on their stuff. Again, this takes a while. 

So, while it is possible to get ""pure Android experience"" on another non-Nexus device, it's generally faster and better on a Nexus device. A launcher, in my opinion, doesn't go against the idea of a ""pure Android experience"", but instead adds to it. After all, isn't customization what Android is all about?

My pup was also unadoptable.

Max was severely beaten, had a broken nose, jaw, his two front legs were fractured and one shattered, and his ear nearly ripped off. His only saving grace was when he dragged himself to the door of the shelter and one of the staff came to the door he perked up his good ear and tried to wag his tail. 
After surgery to remove his shattered hind leg, and a ton of money spent by my local animal shelter Max became a healthy, playful, and loving dog. But because of his lack of leg, the bumps on his face from where he was broken and the fact he looked a little patch workish since he had no fur in some places where they had to shave for his surgery, no one wanted to adopt him. 
I went there with my grandmother one day to play with the kittens, and saw Max, looking defeated and heart broken after having been there months with no one to claim him. I asked to see him, and the shelter staff seemed surprised but excited, she then explained what happened to Max, showing me pictures of what he looked like when he was ""Dropped off"" at the shelter. She also explained that tomorrow at noon he was scheduled to be put down. So that night I went home and talked to my boyfriend. He didn't want to take on something that we couldn't afford financially in the first place let alone if something happened to him. I went and bought him the next day anyways. 
After having him these last few months and watching him run and play, I couldn't have made a better decision. He is my best friend and has a seriously soft coat!! :)

1) Adjust your expectations. Don't think that you're going to get a new car, or even an iPad, or even an iPod, or even a hand knitted pair of Batman socks. Some people who participate are incredibly generous, or creative, but many are not. Don't go into this thinking this is your chance to score free loot. Your reward is a surprise from a mysterious and unknown person you may never meet. 

2) Give what feels good to you, and let that feeling be your reward. You may be one of those generous/creative people who wants to spend lots of money and/or time giving someone an amazing gift that you are sure will brighten their world. The recipient, however, may never post that they got it, or is bad with words and will only say ""Thanks,"" and nothing more, or in some other way not express the joy and gratitude you think you deserve for whatever you just did. Don't sweat it. And if you are going to sweat it, don't do it. Give that awesome gift to someone you know, who you can watch enjoy it, or you can guilt trip into giving you the recognition you think you deserve.  Don't give because you're looking for validation.

We dont really worry about minute by minute fever progression most of the time, if that helps. In most coughs and such mild deseases that parents can treat at home, we just tell them that fever may last for a couple of days, i think watching those charts will bring them unnecesary worries. Although you may have a niche for VERY clingy parents (Just dont tell them what ive told you).",0,1352625125,,0,False,1,c6zmhmz,t3_1302t0,t1_c6zmhmz,t3_1302t0,,1430375730,2,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,2
True,wolfbaden6,,,"They're equal. Let's assume you have 1 gallon of each and they're both homogenized. 1 gallon of liquid is equal 768 teaspoons. Knowing that:

2% milk contains 15.36 teaspoons of fat by volume (FBV) and whole milk (4%, in this example) is 30.72 teaspoons FBV. Also, a single teaspoon of each milk would have to exist in the same ratios, so a teaspoon of 2% milk would contain .02 teaspoons of fat per teaspoon of milk while the whole milk would contain .04 teaspoon of fat per teaspoon of milk.

Now, let's take a teaspoon of the 2% milk and add it into the whole milk. Now your container of 2% milk is still 2%, but is now 767 teaspoons. This means 15.34 teaspoons of your 767 teaspoons of 2% milk is fat.

Your whole milk is now not actually 4% milk as the addition of the 2% milk has lowered its average fat content, but we'll still refer to it as whole milk for the sake of simplifying. It is 769 teaspoons and thanks to our handy numbers from before, we can simply add the original amount of fat in the whole milk (30.72 teaspoons of fat) with the amount of fat in one teaspoon of 2% milk (.02 teaspoons of fat) for a total of 30.74 teaspoons of fat.

At this point in time, our milk looks like this:

2% milk: 15.34 teaspoons (of fat)/767 total teaspoons (of milk) = .02 or .02 of a teaspoon of 2% is fat

Whole milk: 30.74 teaspoons (of fat)/769 total teaspoons (of milk) = 0.039974 or .039974 of a teaspoon of whole is fat


And now for the second half of the question. We're obviously going to be left with 768 teaspoons in both, so that's not too difficult to figure out. As with the first half of the problem, the milk we're taking from will not have its percentage of fat affected, so our whole milk will remain at .039974, or 3.9974%, but the overall amount of fat will decrease by .039974 teaspoons of milk to 30.700026 teaspoons of fat.

Our 2% milk is now going to increase its fat percentage. Before, we were left with 15.34 teaspoons of fat in our 2% milk. Now, we simply add .039974 to that because one teaspoon of the whole milk now contains .039974 teaspoons of fat. This leaves us with 15.379974 teaspoons of fat per 768 teaspoons of 2% milk.

What we're left with is:

2% milk: 15.379974 teaspoons (of fat)/768 teaspoons (of milk) = 0.0200260078125 or the milk is now 2.00260078125 % fat

Whole milk: 30.700026 teaspoons (of fat)/768 teaspoons (of milk) = 0.0399739921875 or the milk is now 3.99739921875 % fat

Now that we have these new percentages of fat, let's look at the differences from the original to the new:

2% milk: 2.00260078125 - 2 = .00260078125

Whole milk: 4 - 3.99739921875 = .00260078125

Oh look, they've increased and decreased by the same amount! There you go.

True,AsiaExpert,asia,"China, Korea, and Japan","Dear lord, where to start. 

How about the fact that **instead of Tom Cruise they should have casted Arnold Schwarzenegger** as Algren (the main character in the movie). 

During the time period, while Americans did establish trade relations as well as favorable trade deals with Japan, the Meiji government did not really rely on the Americans for nation building. For that they notably relied much more on the **British and Germans**. For military advisers, as well as the development of modern medicine, they relied heavily on **Prussian advisers**.  While they did buy a large amount of American weapons and other goods, especially with the **surplus at the end of the Civil War**, we would be hard pressed to find an American adviser like in the movie. 

Another note should be that it makes **no sense that the Americans would be negotiating sales** of Gatling guns and the like because trade deals had been worked out long before this. The Japanese, while not nearly as bad as China, were in **no position to negotiate with the Westerners** on what deals they would and wouldn't take. Japan was still woefully weak militarily and had **no power with which to resist the unfair treaties** thrust upon them. 

Now that our new lead Arnold has arrived in Japan, he has to get to work training all the Imperial recruits who've never even seen a firearm in their lives, never mind understand how to fire and reload properly. Those poor savages. Right? **Wrong.** 

As some may already know, **firearms had already been a central part of Japanese warfare for over 250 years** by the time of the Satsuma Rebellions. Japanese people knew full well what ~~rifles~~ firearms were and the Imperial army did not have trouble training their raw recruits in using their firearms. 

Our brave Prussian adviser Arnold would not have been among the troops, but **at Central Command**, where he would have been the consultant for the **organization of the new professional army**. See before this, Japanese armies with samurai and footmen were feudal armies, which was up to par in the Sengoku Era but wouldn't cut it anymore. They needed to transition to a **nationalized professional standing army**.

Arnold would have been helping draw up plans on battalion, regiment, and Corps sizes, not teaching men how to shoot. His main job as a Prussian military adviser would be to **build Japanese military doctrine from the ground up** to organize the new army to be fit to fight a modern war. 

Next, the samurai and the conflict itself, the Satsuma Rebellion. 

So firstly, the samurai by this time, had been completely transformed from the gritty war hardened soldiers of the Sengoku Era. Arnold would have found **samurai working as officials, tax collectors, landlords, and even industrialists**. With the centuries of peace, the samurai were out of a wartime occupation and so they moved into other work. Those that didn't remained as **farmers**.

Also, the whole idea that samurai were these completely noble and honorable protectors of Japan is an *extremely romantic* take on samurai. There are plenty of examples of **corrupt, abusive, and generally asshole samurai** who took advantage of their class privileges. This doesn't mean all samurai were terrible people. Just that samurai *were* people too, and they were just as likely to be nice or mean as another person. 

Samurai culture and life in general got a very weird work over in the film but not enough room to discuss it here. 

Ken Watanabe's character is based off of Saigo Takamori, who was the man who would eventually be the leader of the Satsuma Rebellion. 

So the short story would be that Saigo was a **lowly samurai that rose up** after his master was killed in a politically motivated execution. He would go on to **lead the victorious Imperial Armies against the Tokugawa Shogunate** in the Boshin War, where the reigning Shogun was overthrown and power was returned *symbolically* to the young Emperor. 

Saigo was granted a high position in the new Meiji government but he is unhappy. One of the major calls of the Boshin War was to **'expel all barbarians'** and by that it meant the Western influence that was seen as intruding. **Instead, Westernization and modernization are taking Japan by storm**. Dissatisfied with the situation he resigns and **returns home** to the southwest province of Satsuma, where he is still top gun. Some samurai follow him, sharing his thoughts. 

Now seeing how Saigo's biggest problem with the Meiji government was that **they didn't kill or expel all the Westerners**, it is **highly improbably he would have entertained a foreigner guest**, even if it was our beloved lead Arnold. 

The Satsuma Rebellion itself was **not a war of samurai vs imperialists** nor was it a war about **tradition vs progress**. I cannot stress this enough. The reasons for the conflict was indeed partly because of the **gradual revocation of samurai privileges**, most importantly because samurai who participated in the Boshin War on the Imperial side **thought that their place in society was secured**, having fought for the winning side and all. But it was also because of the **government's heavy cooperation with foreigners**, and the radical changes society saw in the short span of time. 

The last straw, the spark, was when the government, fearing the Satsuma region would rebel, **sent forces to forcibly disarm them**. Ironically, this actually starts the rebellion when the samurai fear that they were going to be **purged by the military**. **Saigo never intended to fight at all** and was merely planning to withdraw from politics entirely **but with his vassals and home apparently threatened, he had no choice**. 

But when war came, it was **not swords, spears and arrows against firearms and artillery**. Both sides were armed extensively with firearms and artillery pieces, and with the Americans, British as well as Prussian **weapon dealers selling to both sides** while profiting handsomely, there was **no shortage of guns** for the conflict. And it was one hell of a war. 

EDIT: I should mention that the movie is not *totally* inaccurate with the use of melee weapons, as during the last battle, the rebels had been already low on supplies. **As they ran out of bullets, they switched to good old spears, swords and bows**, many making desperate charges that were ultimately futile in the face of superior firepower and disciplined lines. **No massive showdown of bayonets vs swords even remotely happened**. 

In the film, the events that Tom Cruise witness are based on the famous last stand. What we see of the war is two battles separated by Tom Cruise being samurai-ified. Life seems peaceful and all in all very Zen. 

Arnold's view however would have been very different. The Satsuma Rebellion was known as the **most intense challenge of all** that the Meiji government faced. In the film it seems like the end of the samurai is inevitable, as they were attempting to draw comparisons to the fate of the native americans and the fatalism associated with samurai. 

But in history, the **Satsuma Rebellions rocked Meiji Japan** to its core. Victory was anything but assured and every resource the government had was called on to fight the rebels. It was truly a test of Meiji Japan as a modern nation. **Railroads** were used to **move armies and supplies** around, the military put its shiny **new Prussian inspired military doctrine** to use, and the infrastructure that was used to **recruit soldiers for a national army**, rather than a feudal army provided by vassals, as well as paying for the whole war with salaries. 

It should also be noted that while there were about **50,000 samurai** who participated in the Satsuma Rebellion, there were around **250,000 ~ 300,000** who loyally served the Emperor, so it was definitely **NOT a samurai vs the world** deal. 

That being said, the rebels fought ferociously and many saw them as 'preserving the samurai tradition', even other samurai. Even back then the conflict was **heavily romanticized**. Saigo had more than a few fans in Japan at the time. 

Finally, **the ninja scene**. Why. Just why. 

Ninja would not have been used that way and certainly would not have been attacking in black pajamas. 

**Even if we accept a ninja assassination attempt at face value**, there is **no tactical value** to attacking a target in full view of all his followers, especially his *armed followers*. In their defense, there was an actual assassination attempt on Saigo but it was not at the same time as the movie (it happened before the rebellion, not during), and ninja were most certainly not involved, at least not directly. 

EDIT: The scene with the Emperor? **Never would have happened**. It was rare even for a Japanese citizen to meet with the Emperor, government official or not. Slim chance they would have left a 'barbarian' in. 

There are a ton of other cultural and minor time period inaccuracies but I've covered all the major ones I can remember without actually watching the film again. If I do rewatch it I may add to this in the future.

True,ethan_kahn,Camera,,"Dunnottar Castle has played an important role during many crucial episodes of Scottish History, however, it was originally known as a Pictish fortress, and its greatest hour came during Æthelstan 's invasion of Alba 934AD.

The castle is probably the most dramatic historical site in Scotland: a formidable castle rock, surrounded on three sides by the North Sea and accessed only by a narrow isthmus of land with a steep, stone-cut path leading to the top of the rock. For over 1000 years it played a crucial role in Scottish history, occasionally as Scotland’s last bastion, and has housed some of the nation's greatest historical figures: Constantine mac Aed, Sigurd the Mighty, William Wallace, Mary Queen of Scots, and the Marquis of Montrose.

We know Dunnottar was a Pictish fortress of strategic importance, set on the frontier between north and south Pictland where the Grampian mountains come close to the North Sea.

Its early appearances in history are some what mysterious. In 681 and 694 AD the Annals of Ulster simply record ‘Obesessio duin Foither’ - a siege at Dunnottar.

The 681 AD siege happened in the reign of King Bridei, son of Bili, who was attempting to unite the Picts by force against the overlordship of the Angles. Bridei attacked Orkney in 682 AD from his bases north of the River Tay. Either he attacked Dunnottar as the opening move in his northern campaign or his later attack on Orkney was in reprisal for the Orcadian Picts' siege of Dunnottar.

After Bridei’s death in 693 AD a power struggle, unsurprisingly, ensued in Pictland. His successor, Taran, was expelled only three years later, suggesting he wasn’t very popular. So, the second siege of Dunnottar, may have been part of a bitter Pictish civil war.

Over thirty years later Dunnottar was the scene of one of the most important battles of the Dark Ages - one which could be looked upon as the first ever big battle between the Scots and the English, as the British Isles started to split into two major power blocks. In this episode Constantine II (Constantín mac Áed) defied the conquest of Æthelstan, King of Wessex, by surviving a month-long seige at Dunnottar. Read the story of Constantine's defiance of Æthelstan

In the late 13th century the oldest part of the present castle, a stone church, was constructed and dedicated to St Ninian, who was believed to have converted the Picts to Christianity - this seems unlikely however, as when St Columba visited Pictland at a later date the Picts were still pagans.

During the Wars of Independence the castle was garrisoned by Edward I, King of England, after his crushing defeat of John Balliol, King of Scots. A year later, in 1297 AD, none other than William Wallace, laid siege to Dunnottar, burning down its wooden walls with an English garrison inside. The Scots makar, or poet, Blind Harry, wrote an chilling account of the struggle for the rock in his epic poem ‘Wallace’:

Therefore a fire was brought speedily:
Which burnt the church, and all those South’ron boys:
Out o’er the rock the rest rush’d great noise;
Some hung on craigs, and loath were to die.
Some lap, some fell, some flutter’d in the sea;
And perish’d all, not one remain’d alive.
Extract of Blind Harry ‘Wallace’ c1470’s
Harry, seems to be familiar with Dunnottar, and may have visited what had become the Renaissance home of the Earls Marischal.
Dunnottar Castle

In 1651, Oliver Cromwell’s army laid siege to the castle for eight months attempting to steal the Scottish Crown Jewels, however the jewels were saved, smuggled out by Mrs Grainger, wife of the minister at Kinnef Kirk - a village a few miles south of Dunnottar. Here they were hidden at the old Parish Church. 

The castle never recovered from the damage inflicted on it by Cromwell’s cannons. In the late 17th century it lay mostly derelict but was used on one infamous occasion as a prison for radical Presbyterians, or Covenanters, who refused to accept the king as their overlord in matters of religion. In 1685 in the midst of what is known as ‘the Killing Times’, 167 Covenanters were imprisoned in what is known as the Whig’s Vault at the far end of the castle.

Dunnottar Castle was the home of the Earls Marischal of Scotland, who oversaw all ceremonial activities in the Scottish Court, including the coronations. They were also responsible for the security of the Scottish Crown Jewels, known as the 'Honours of Scotland'.

The castle’s active history came to a close when the last Earl Marischal was executed for his part in the 1715 Jacobite Rising and the castle was confiscated by the government. It remained neglected until 1925 when the 1st Viscountess Cowdray started its restoration. It remains in private ownership today, but is open to the public.

True,psychiclemonade,,,"This happened to me in 2006 and I am just now feeling like a normal person (but I am! It can happen!) I'm going to tell you the things that worked for me that I wish someone had told me about so I didn't have to blunder around for 6 years trying to find solutions. 

For the first two years, I was on medication, and it did halt the multiple daily panic attacks, but I also never cried, and you don't realize how your body uses that to purge itself until its gone. There's a fine line between leveled and blocked there. So these are solutions that have helped me come back without the medication, because I gradually stopped taking it. (Which I do not advocate until after you speak to your doctor and family and feel it's right for you.)

1. Exercise. It sounds stupidly simple. Psychiclemonade, you say, you don't get it. Walking doesn't help a fucking panic attack. I also used to think that. BUT. This is what helps me the most day to day, and also what really kick started my recovery. It doesn't have to be at the gym, or on your street. Try to outthink your anxiety to create a new safe spot. I found a backwoods trail across town that I have fallen in love with. No one there but trees and the river. I run a half hour out to the very back of the park where I found a bench in the woods. I meditate for a while, and then come back. Instant better feels. You cannot fight those beautiful workout endorphins. SCIENCE!

2. Which brings me to breathing and meditation. What a bunch of hippie bullshit, you might think, what is this lady trying to sell me anyway? You don't have to meditate, but try to be mindful of your breathing. Think about the physical ramifications of stress and fear. Your brain needs all the oxygen it can get to be rational and deal with what needs to be dealt with. This was another one that seemed too basic to make sense, but made a tremendous impact for me once utilized.

3. Outlets. I started keeping a journal. Everyday I try to write three pages of whatever-the-fuck I want. So much of it was worries and disappointments, but also it was goals and what I wanted. It helped me sort of drain out needless things, and also to form a path to being better. It helped to keep me mindful of who I wanted to be, and what I wanted to do and my progress (which was often two-forward-one-back). I made list after list to help me break down tasks. You will literally have to take things one at a time, one day at a time. But you know what? That's what everyone has to do.

4. Diet and Vitamins. Just two things- don't eat Shit, and supplement your levels. That was my final adjustment.


To be more specific, your two things you need to do- 1. You CAN do it. You just have to find the right way. So let's think. The dentist. Waiting room, people, waiting, dental tools. The Suck. Here's what I would do to get around the anxiety, although you will have to confront it a little. Set a date. Know it's coming, but think of it as your first step towards making things right. Battle Day. Push away your doubt. There's no room for doubt in battle. Go for a run that morning. A hard run. Find that burned-out, clean feeling. Do you have a favorite t-shirt? Wear that shit to the appointment. Take your lorazepam to help. And bring a book. Lose yourself in that book. Give your mind a script to follow so it can't run away with you. 

Then you're home free. Once you get in the chair, they'll knock you out and you won't know adam from eve until you get home.

Now you've got some momentum. 


I recommend the same for your DL. If you can set an appointment for the test, do that to minimize waiting. Use your momentum from having crossed that huge other thing off of your list. This one will be harder. Know that, but hang on to the fact that the pay-off is bigger, and THOSE TWO THINGS WILL BE DONE! You'll never have to think about them again.

Funnel that strength into the next thing, and the next. Fake it 'til you make it is real, and works, but you will have to push yourself. Know that it's ok to fail sometimes. It happens to absolutely everyone, whether you know it or not. The most important thing is to keep on keepin' on.


There won't be a quick fix to what you're going through. They don't exist. The medication helped me get my bearings, but what I've found is that by shoring myself up with these practices, I am able to deal with the anxiety of anything that is thrown my way now- because I am able to be steady even if things around me get rowdy. That is not to say I don't feel anxious at times, or have bad days. I still tend to avoid crowds, and sometimes I still hide for a whole day if I can get away with it, but I am never paralyzed anymore. And I used to be. For years and years. 

I also worried that my life was ruined, that nothing would ever be right again, that I was falling behind, that I was a failure, and would always be one. Kid, that's bullshit. It takes work. Real work. Painful work, sometimes, but it's just a lock. All you have to do is find the key. You already have it, all you have to do is make it.

True,Thrasymachus,,,"Good question! This isn't a direct answer, because SunySideOut has done that quite adequately. But I really think this can add to your understanding. 

You see, what you have to understand is that from a life history perspective a baby that is born normally is also developing as though it still were in the womb. 

When we discuss life history of animals, we discuss them as altricial or precocial. Altricial animals produce large number of offspring with a relatively small energetic investment in each one; therefore, the offspring are born pretty weak and many will probably die. Cats, mice, dogs - any animal that produces a litter is probably altricial. Other animals are precocial. That means a large energetic investment goes into each offspring; they usually reproduce one at a time and their offspring are born pretty ready to handle a lot on their own. Think of elephants, horses, whales, and so forth: long gestation periods, and offspring born capable of pretty full locomotion.

Humans are the odd case. We are secondarily altricial. Our reproductive strategy looks like that of a precocial species - one progeny at a time and a substantial resource investment in each - but our infants resemble altricial infants much more than precocial ones. 

Human life history only make sense if you look at human infants as fetuses that are continuing to develop outside the womb, and happen to have been born prematurely. In fact, up until it reaches eight months to a year of age, it is much more consistent with developmental understandings to see any baby as a prematurely born infant. 

Therefore, *most* of the development that you see in an infant is that which would ""normally"" take place in the womb. This is because, quite frankly, our large brain size prohibits birth at full brain weight. Most precocial mammals are born with brains fairly close to adult brain size; we do most brain development outside the womb that other precocial species do inside.

There is some speculation, by the way, that this is crucial to the uniqueness of our intellects: we are the only species which accomplishes most of our brain growth in an active and stimulating environment.

Hope that adds something to it!

True,LifeFailure,,,"I know I'm probably gonna get shit for this, but I'll bare myself and my thoughts here: The very top comment gives context. I think that was sufficient for people to form their own opinions on the video/piece in general. Your comment, while a valid critique, comes off as somewhat pretentious in light of the fact that people were given the resources with which to form their own opinions. It feels, in many ways, as though you are expecting others to apply your values as a person who is ""more knowledgeable"" about art to the piece, with your ""credentials"" (as posited by your follow-up comments) being that you frequent a more niche subreddit like /r/art, going on to devalue general subreddits because, *in your opinion*, more niche subreddits are better (particularly concerning the people who frequent them as a better or ""more decent"" crowd). Personally, I think niche subreddits that take themselves too seriously are far more full of pretentious and often very rude, holier-than-thou people than of ""decent"" people. Again, this is just how I see it/my general experience with reddit so far. 

As for the top reply to your comment, which you apparently took offense to, it was a joke. And if you're so stuck in wanting to be lauded for your analysis or wanting to spark serious discussion that you can't appreciate it, then I suppose you simply should avoid subreddits that will expose you to off-color humor and stick to those you feel comfortable with. You can't, and won't, change ""reddit"" (or rather the amalgamation of people, values, and thoughts it encompasses), and complaining about it with a ""*sigh*, you immature kids, you don't appreciate x, y, z like ***I*** do"" sort of attitude isn't going to warm many people up to you. 

The thing I, personally, appreciate most about a lot of the frontpaged content is that I can head to the comments for both context/knowledge and humor (regardless of how appropriate that humor may be). People who try to devalue that based on how *they* think it should be, I think, are missing the point of reddit, where a conversation regarding a valid, serious critique of or thought on a piece of content can be juxtaposed with a layman's view/ humor/values and whatever else you can think of and more.",0,1352696170,,0,False,1,c701fkf,t3_130hqp,t1_c701fkf,t1_c701419,,1430382957,9,False,videos,t5_2qh1e,9

True,el_muerte17,,"1987 Camaro Z-28, 1989 MR2 S/C","The car forums I frequent have rules limiting pictures of cars to those owned by the users, and only in specific sections (virtual garage, classifieds, and paint/detailing areas).  This is very typical and conducive to maintaining high quality topical posts.

You might think banning contextless image posts is a bad thing; there are people on the other side of that fence (enough people that the decision was made to change) that think those image posts themselves are terrible.  Back when I first subscribed to /r/cars, ~80% of the content was news, discussion, technical questions, and user build posts, and the remaining 20% or so was comprised of image posts of extremely rare cars, and were usually high quality staged photoshoot type pictures.  It was great, there was plenty of meaningful discussion.  Then, people started posting pictures of their favourite cars with titles like, ""Any love for ____?"" and ""DAT ASS"" using photos found with Google.  It didn't take long to devolve into shitty cell phone photos of random slightly-uncommon cars in parking lots and people getting offended when their beat-up '94 Tercel didn't get upvotes, as everyone and their dog was trying to get on board the karma gravy train by submitting anything even peripherally automotive-related they could get their hands on.  It got to the point where the post title would be the only thing even remotely auto-related; one post I remember seeing was a bunch of fishing reels that someone figured looked like wheels, and another was a push-style lawnmower.

You might like seeing the neat cars other people photograph as they go about their day-to-day business, and there's nothing wrong with that... but as mikasaur wrote in the new rules post, and as people have been saying for months in comments, there are more appropriate subreddits for that, and hell, you can go to Google and punch in whatever pretty car you want to see and get thousands of image results.  These [spotted] posts are rarely about truly rare and interesting cars, and even when they are, the sheer volume of them just numbs any enjoyment I might have derived looking at 'em.  Yeah, an M3 is awesome and I'd like to have one, but that doesn't mean I need people to submit a picture, daily, of one they saw or rode in.  Even exotics become tedious when there's one every few days.

Keep in mind, the new rules don't completely disallow [spotted] posts; if you truly believe that it's something special that needs to be shared, feel free to prove it by creating a self.post linking the image.  This is, in my opinion, the best possible way to handle it, as it filters out the karma whores by removing their incentive to post, without actually preventing someone who genuinely wants to share from doing so.

In short, the changes this subreddit is experiencing are for the good and will improve post quality and return the type of content to the subreddit's roots and original intent.  If you like pictures of cars other people saw on the road, there are subreddits that cater to that, and they'll be seeing a burst of growth now if all you haters would get on over and start submitting there instead of complaining here.",0,1352708404,,0,1352708591,1,c703qns,t3_131ql6,t1_c703qns,t3_131ql6,,1430384038,49,False,cars,t5_2qhl2,49

**#2: Drop the ""Smart but unmotivated"" bullshit.**

-----------------------------

Because ultimately, it doesn't matter how smart you are if you can't bring yourself to do something.  You could be Stephen Hawking, but without the motivation to stare endlessly at the stars and perform feats of physics while simultaneously being effected by a crippling chronic disease, you're the equivalent of those theoretical kids who get D's and F's because ""They just don't get it.""

**Fun Fact:**  Public High school and Middle School work isn't meant to be hard.   People that fail them are most often irresponsible rather than stupid, and it's still a reflection of yourself.  Don't disassociate yourself from your grades by feeding the delusion that you're ""smart and unmotivated.""



**#3: Acknowledge what is causing your problem, then deal with it.**

--------------------------

Professional writers are notorious for having procrastination/distraction problems.  They overcome it by acknowledging what is causing the problem, and then dealing with it.  This often means doing things like disassociating themselves from their vices(gambling, drinking, gaming, internet, etc.)   

Video games causing you a problem?  Uninstall them from your computer.  Thinking about not uninstalling them?   Uninstall them anyway.  Still not sure? Do it anyway.  Fight it.   Got a console?  Unplug it.  Put it in your closet, preferably in a box or multiple boxes.   Make it harder for you to start a game than it is to start your work.   Take the game discs and put them in a single case, and give them to someone you trust to keep them away from you.

Internet got you down?   Disable your access in your computer.  Can't do that?  Uninstall your preferred browser or delete shortcuts to your browser from your desktop and menus. Block Reddit. Filter Imgur, Youtube, and Facebook, and social media. Make it harder to procrastinate.  

No, this is not easy to do.  Do it anyway, because you have something to prove.


**#4 Swallow your pride.**

------------------------------------------

Because you really don't have anything to be proud of right now.  You're a C/D student who is easily distracted.  Congratulations, you're 60% of lower to middle class males in that age range.  Quit telling yourself your smart, or ""you could do that if you *really* tried.""  No one cares about 'what ifs'.   They care about what it is you've actually done, and whether or not you're fit to do it again, or do something more.  

Someone with cognitive disabilities who simply tries is more impressive than someone who doesn't want to do the work.  These days, people aren't limited by their intelligence or education as much as they are limited by their drive.

He just smiled, and now there definitely were tears in his eyes. He said, ""Please choose that this weekend.""

Many of you brought up some excellent points that I overlooked in my original post. The current reddit we know and love, although very user-friendly, isn't a great revenue source due to its unobtrusive advertising. The price reddit pays for maintaining such a low-key advertising model is that they're not nearly as profitable as their traffic would indicate.

True,Standgeblasen,,,"I'm 25 and in the same boat.  But I am going to fucking change this!  Here's how.

I have been overweight (5ft 7in tall 220lbs) my entire adult life.  I have had one real girlfriend, and that was when I was 18 and it lasted for 3 months.  So here is my journey over the last year:

At the beginning of the year, I was lazy, apathetic, and spent most of my days going from bed, to work, to whiskey, to video games, and to bed.  I too had given up on the pursuit of a female companion. One day I woke up and realized that the pants I had bought from the thrift store 2 months ago no longer fit around my waist.  That was my wake up call.  

I decided it was time to take control of my life, and stop drinking/smoking/gaming away the best years of my life.  I ended up trying the HCG diet for the 12 week program, and started forcing myself to just get out and walk for 30-60 minutes each day.  I ended up losing 30 pounds in 12 weeks and started to feel good about myself for the first time in a very long time.  I decided that I needed to chase that feeling!  When my diet ended, I tried very hard to keep up my healthy habits.  I can honestly say that forcing myself to do a vigorous 30-60 minute workout 5 days a week is the biggest self-esteem boost I have found.  I am finally starting to feel comfortable in my own skin, and I notice the difference around women.  More importantly, *THEY* notice too.

I am still overweight (5ft 7in 190lbs), but I feel better and more confident. 

Confidence is the first half of the battle... the second half is fear.  Fear of rejection, fear of humiliation, fear of inadequacy... fear is what is keeping you in your shell.  I had an epiphany about a month; I was tailgating a football game and talking to this gorgeous girl.  We ended up talking for 3 quarters of the game and I started to realize that if I didn't step up, I would never see her again.  At that moment, I realized, the worst outcome of that situation is INACTION.  Sure I was afraid that she would not give me her number, but I was more afraid of not knowing for sure.  

This sudden change of perspective has changed my outlook immensely.  I am still a virgin, but 2 weeks ago I went on my first real date since high school, and guess what?  It wasn't that scary, and I actually had a lot of fun.

Lots of rambling, and I'm sorry if my story doesn't make sense, but basically OP, just keep telling yourself this.


""I am fucking awesome. I am fun, intelligent, and kind.  Anyone who doesn't appreciate me for this is not someone I want to be around.""

There are plenty of women out there who are wanting someone to take them out.  Do you have the balls to swallow your fear and take the first chance?  Worst case scenario is you get rejected, in that case... I refer you to you're previous mantra...

""I am fucking awesome. I am fun, intelligent, and kind. Anyone who doesn't appreciate me for this is not someone I want to be around.""

**TL;DR**: Overweight is a state of mind.  Confidence is King.  Fear is just a little bitch.  Women are people, treat them as such.  Take chances... fuck bitches (citation needed).  

You are awesome, if someone can't see that... YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW THEM!

Chlorine and fluoride are the two most abundantly added chemicals in our tap water, one for bacteria, the other for our teeth (TY gov't).

Now almost all of the NYC tap water comes from the [same resivouirs and watersheds up north](http://www.nyc.gov/html/dep/images/legacy_images/gif/map.gif).  However thanks to the recent storm most of this area hasn't had power for weeks leading me to think that rather than queens' usual water filtration plants and pipelines perhaps it was rerouted our put through different stations due to power shortages.  So we could in fact be tasting Manhattan tap water rather than the usual Queens route, and therefore it strikes your palette as unusual.

2 cups canned pizza sauce 

2 cups ground tomatoes 

2-3 tablespoons fresh ground up garlic (put in blender, add olive oil, blend) 

half cup water 

half cup olive oil (one that is dark in color, usually more flavorful)

I used to live in South Africa Yes the crime rate is as bad as everyone say's.

So one night as i am driving,I took a turn of the highway, came to a set of lights and stopped, a car next to me i think it was a Datsun or a Mazda with rust all over it , seriously there was no colour, drives through the light.

Two people were in the car a guy probably in his 70's and what looked like his wife. So they merrily drive through the red light without looking to see if anything is coming, which is obviously not how you are supposed to do it. Along comes a Mercedes SLK with two middle aged men in it , probably in the early 40's, they collide with the side of the Mazda and all eventually come to a stop. The Mazda is damaged rather badly but the Mercedes looks like a right off, seriously i thought they were stronger than that, it looked like the engine was pushed way back and the doors were all twisted. I was a bit surprised. So as any good citizen i get out and go to help the people in the Mazda, seeing as they were closer to my car and they were sitting in the car not getting out meanwhile the 2 guys had climbed out of the Mercedes. I asked the occupants of the wreck if they were ok and the old man climbed out the woman had a cut on the head and the old man found a cloth she could hold against it. Meanwhile the driver of the other car is going nuts. He starts screaming about insurance, you did not have to have by law at that stage in SA. and he is almost in tears, it just happens to be a few weeks since he picked the car up new, it was top of the range and fitted with all the extras, this is what he is saying to me as i try to calm him down. The old guy them walks over and say's sorry and no he does not have insurance, the Mercedes driver loses it, he lifts his pants leg and pulls out a 38 from an ankle holster and starts pointing it at the old guy , cock's the gun and is getting ready to shoot, And this is where i do the craziest thing i have ever done in my whole life. I jump in-between the gun wielding guy and the old guy and talk him down, talking about it not being worth shooting someone over a car and probably spending a long time in jail. I talk about his insurance probably giving him a brand new car and how he does not want to spend time in jail because of some idiot. He then slowly puts his gun away, i get in my car not thinking of being a witness or anything and drive away back onto the free-way. About a mile down the road i again take an off-ramp and pull over and started crying, litrely shaking and sobbing, dont know why the tears but seriously , that was me putting my life on the line for someone i did not know, because they had an accident. I think one of the things the mind does in most people is instinctively tells us to help prevent death, it think it is built into us, that is why most people that put themselves into dangerous situations say they did not even think about it they just did whatever they did by instinct and don't feel like heroes. Oh and something that made it even worse was the fact that the guy with the gun was covered in gang tattoos and looked like he was a black panther.

No. For most people, it often is. For the OP, and other asexual folks, it isn't. OP was not interest in sex. That's fine. And he made it clear that he wasn't. That's fine too.

&gt; He IS sexually interested because there is attraction

No. He wasn't. He's said that. How fucking dare you decide for him that you know him better than he knows himself. That is super-not-okay.

&gt; problem is that he finds sex repulsive because of something traumatic from his past, most probably.

What the fuck kind of identity policing bullshit is this? So you're the orientation police, and you get to declare others' attractions valid or invalid? *That's* cool. So like, gay guys, they're only *not* attracted to women, and find vaginas repulsive, because of ""something traumatic from their past"", right? And for that matter, *straight* dudes find the idea of sex with *men* repulsive because of ""something traumatic from their past"", too! Of course, why didn't I think of this? We're *all* pansexual, and quote-unquote ""monosexual"" people just become repulsed by the thought of sex with one gender or the other due to past trauma - and asexuals too, only they go further and end up repulsed by sex with people of *either* gender! It's so simple!

&gt; I'm not saying that what his friend did was right

Actually, what you said was this:

&gt; IMO the problem here is you and your asexuality, not him.

THE PROBLEM HERE IS YOU, **NOT HIM**.

Yes, you said that what the other guy did was okay. That was what you said.

&gt; What I'm saying is that there is no need to bury the guy in revenge

Straw man, try again. Nobody here has said *anything* about ""revenge"".

&gt; just cause you have a weird aversion to sex. That's where the problem lies, and that's where I would start working on.

True,munificent,,,"&gt; Yeah that's something that's done in C++ as well and I'd much prefer it not be part of the core language with additional keywords. Basically with boost::context, you can save the current execution context into an object and switch to another execution context.

No, that's different too. `boost::context`, as I understand it, is a wrapper around the [`ucontext`](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setcontext) system calls. That's reifying the entire callstack, locals, registers, etc.

Async/await is best understood as a source transformation that only reifies just the pieces of the stack that you are actually capturing.

Here, I'll run through my understanding of things. I'll use JS here because it's easiest to express this in a GC language with closures. And I'll be using lots of made up APIs. Bear with me.

So let's say you have some `readFile()` function that reads a file and returns its contents. This function is ""slow"" where ""slow"" means something appropriate in each of the paradigms we'll consider.

You want to get the length of the file. Here's how you could do it:

## Old school

    function getFileSize(path) {
      return readFile(path).length;
    }

    console.log(getFileSize('myfile.txt'));

This is how you'd do it in vanilla Python, Ruby, shell, etc. Just block the whole damn program until the file's loaded and then print the result. This is dead simple and actually (despite what node.js acolytes might tell you) is good enough for lots of problems.

## Threads

But lets say you don't want to block your whole app and have the entire UI freeze until you've read the entire way. Threads were the dominant way to do this up until recently. First you try:

    function getFileSize(path) {
      spawnThread(function() {
        var size = readFile(path).length;
      });
    }

    console.log(getFileSize('myfile.txt'));

Here, `spawnThread` is some made up function that spins up a new thread and runs the given function on it. It returns immediately, which is kind of the problem here. Because how do we return the size back to our main thread? So you do something more complex:

    var size;

    function getFileSize(path) {
      spawnThread(function() {
        size = readFile(path).length;
      })
    }

    pollOnUiThread(function() {
      if (size != undefined) console.log(size);
    })

    getFileSize('myfile.txt');

So you spin up the thread and then it writes its result to some variable that's also viewable on the main thread. Then you have to like poll or something on the main thread to see if it's done yet. You've got shared mutable state so you need some synchronization. If you don't want to poll you need some sort of signalling mechanism. Before you know it you've re-invented all of the threading primitives we know and love. And by ""love"", I mean ""hate"".

This is Java, C# until recently, and a lot of C++. It's complex, hard, and error-prone. But, hey, it works!

## Coroutines

So you think, hey thread synchronization sucks. Let's use coroutines!

Coroutines are awesome! But they are not a concurrency mechanism. They're a control flow tool. They aren't for ""do other stuff while stuff is happening"", they are for ""switch between doing different things"".

Coroutines/fibers are no help here. Maybe they would be if your language's IO library was async and deeply integrated with them. I'm too far into my beer to think that through.

## Callbacks

So then node comes along and is all ""let's add IO and networking to JavaScript!"" (of all things). But JS has zero concurrency support and blocking IO doesn't fly if you want to serve more than one-request-per-embarrassingly-large-unit-of-time.

Their solution: callbacks. Here's what you'd do:

    function getFileSize(path, callback) {
      readFile(path, function(contents) {
        result(contents.length);
      });
    }

    getFileSize('myfile.txt', function(size) {
      console.log(size);
    }));

Now you see why I wanted closures. This is closure soup. Functions taking functions taking functions. Now `getFileSize` doesn't *return* the size, it invokes `callback` and passes the size *forward* into that. And, in fact, it doesn't *return* anything. Instead, every function is a procedure that invokes one of its callback arguments, marching ever onward.

Organizing your code like this is called [continuation-passing style](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation-passing_style). Some compilers have an intermediate representation like this. In other words, they parse your nice human friendly code, mangle it into this weird style, and then use that to emit nice friendly machine code.

Node just makes you write out the mangled code by hand. It's extremely confusing, and gets exponentially worse if you want to actually do any error-handling. Also, you don't get to use any of the nice built-in flow control constructs of the language anymore (especially loops and exceptions). Instead, you have to re-invent those things, painfully, at the library level.

But! If you can do this, your code can run in full non-blocking glory without having to deal with threads. Also, these closures are only closing over just the pieces of state you need to keep things going, as opposed to copying the entire callstack. So that's a worthwhile trade-off.

## Async/await

If only there was a way to get the performance and semantics of callback-style without having hand-write continuation-passing style code. Wait, didn't I say that compilers do that transformation?

Why don't we just let the compiler transform it for us? That's `async` and `await` in C#. With that, we write code like (semi-made up syntax here):

    async function getFileSize(path) {
      return await readFile(path).length;
    }

    console.log(await getFileSize('myfile.txt'));

You write this, and the compiler translates it to *exactly* the same callback-style code we had before. No complex threads. No callstack reification. No coroutines. Just some callbacks and closures.

Now look at that code and compare it to the awesomely-simple-but-too-slow blocking code in the first example. It's virtual identical. We've just sprinkled a couple of `async` and `await` keywords in there.

In this trivial example, it's not a huge improvement, but try getting some complex code and see how it transforms.

- The Nile is a fast-flowing river (2-4 knots) which is bad for algae blooms.  They grow best in stagnant or standing water.
- Oxygen levels low enough to kill fish would have killed the frog eggs.
- Lice don't inhabit corpses.  When an animal dies, lice desert it.

- The bluetongue virus was discovered in 1908, but wasn't found in Egypt until 1965.  It is also primarily a sheep disease and has a morbidity in cattle of less than 5%.
- Flies don't spread glanders.  The disease is spread to humans by touching boils on glander-infected animals, who get the disease from ingesting contaminated food.
- The fly that DOES cause boils or myasis, the tumbu fly, is not found in Egypt. 
- The darkness plague came *after* the hail and and fire plague.
- Sandstorms do not make ""darkness"", just ""brownness"".
- Egyptians would call a three-day sandstorm a sandstorm, not ""darkness"".
- A sandstorm with both hail and red lightning is plausible and do happen.  Electric sandstorms are neat.
- Cold fronts generally move from northwest to southeast and would likely drive Ethiopian locusts *away* from the Cairo area, not *to* it.
- The Egyptians carefully stored their grains in covered silos.  The locusts wouldn't be able to poo on the stored grain, and the hail wouldn't ""wet"" it.
- If crops were unharvested, locusts would EAT it, not poo on it.
- Mycotoxin poisoning is plausible.  But it would also be more likely to affect the elderly, people with lower body weight, anyone with a weak immune system, and anyone unlucky enough to get a particularly bad batch of bread.  It wouldn't kill just the ""first-born"".

True,zeptimius,,,"This reminds me of a famous Dutch poem, based on a Persian story. It goes like this: 'My gardener came to me, looking pale, and said that he had been threatened by Death in the garden. He asked me to borrow my horse so he could flee to the nearby city of Isfahan. I gave him the horse and he sped off. That afternoon, I ran into Death in the forest. I asked him why he had threatened my gardener that morning. Death answered that he hadn't threatened anyone, but that he had been surprised to see this man working calmly in the garden in my city, the same man he was supposed to collect in Isfahan that evening.'

&gt;The Gardener and Death

&gt;A Persian Nobleman:

&gt;This morning, with a face turned pale from fright,


&gt;My gardener rushed in, ""Sir, if I might!

&gt;""At work, just now, I stopped to take a breath,

&gt;When he just stood there in his cloak of grey,

True,fatperspective,,,"Scarecrow wanted to show people what they become when they are free of courage and resolve (or more accurately, when they lose the ability to recognize and control their fears).

Joker wanted to show the people what they become when they are free of inhibition.

Bane wanted to show the people what they become when they are free of punishment.

What all three of these men had in common is the belief that there is a very thin barrier that separates the best of the human condition from the worst of it. It's interesting that it goes from internal to external as the movies progress, for instance, Scarecrow thinks that this is an internal barrier, and that once people let fear take over they are capable of committing the most indecent acts. Joker believes that this is conditioned inhibition: that people learn to behave a certain way in order to function within a society and so he works to sever that relationship and force people to behave in a way inconsistent with their learned social relationships (trying to convince one ship full of people to blow up another, for instance). Bane believes this barrier is entirely socially constructed: that without the legal and political structures and institutions humanity would exhibit its worst properties and destroy itself, so his goal is not to get people to struggle internally but rather to destroy the institutions that allow them to effectively organize.

The thread tying these evil men together is Ras al Ghul, because again, he believes in some combination of all of these, but most fundamentally that good people are really just a stone's throw away from being terrible people and he is set out to destroy Gotham, even conspiring with Crane to prove his point. His work inspires the Joker and his teaching inspire Bane.

Three movies, three evils, one common philosophy: that humanity doesn't deserve to exist, and that they intend to prove this fact to justify their genocide.

EDIT: This is why Ras works as such a good archnemesis to Batman. If you think about it, Ras believes that humans invite corruption into their lives and that Gotham is at the tipping point, just waiting for that seal to burst and that evil to take over. Batman agrees with the first part, but the key difference is that Ras believes humanity is *irredeemably corrupt* whereas Batman believes in the possibility of redemption for (almost) everyone... this is why he doesn't kill anyone.

I say almost everyone because there is one person Batman has let die, the one person in whom he recognized irredeemable evil: Ras al Ghul.",0,1352817721,,0,1352979361,1,c70pdjt,t3_13488c,t1_c70pdjt,t1_c70o3o0,,1430394463,333,False,batman,t5_2qqt8,333
True,EventualCyborg,alliance,,"&gt; So... 8 years ago when you had to farm for hours for various resist gear, when you could kill a boss for months and not see a single item (never mind gold), when you had to farm for hours just to have 20 different elixir buffs up and a stockpile of potions... THAT was way ok. But doing dailies for 2 hours every day for a month until you reach revered to get all VP gear killed the game now?

Since I'm in a similar situation to OP, let me tell you how it was for me.

8 years ago I was still in college.  Lots of bits and spurts of free time.  My GF-turned-fiancee-now-wife attended a school that was 60 miles away (this was at the dawn of AIM, no skype, no webcams, and cell phone minutes were precious, limited, and expensive).  Needless to say, I had a lot of time to fill.  It wasn't all that difficult to have 3 level 60s and an army of alts by the time AQ dropped, two of which raided MC and BWL regularly.  

Your accusation that because this kind of a ridiculous grind was OK 8 years ago but not now is somehow hypocritical fails to acknowledge the fluidity of life and that time does not stand still.

True,zil-horrorshow,,collared slave &amp; sadomasochist,"With the usual prefaces of ""to each their own"" and ""do what makes you happy,"" and an additional note that this is not a personal criticism of anyone, I'll be honest and say that I don't really like the term ""subspace.""

The idea that there's some sort of superior state associated with bottoming implies a notion that if you don't get to that state, you're somehow not doing things as well as you could be or that you're somehow incapable of ""doing it right.""  This very thread supports the idea that this so-called subspace is different for everyone, and if that is the case, then how is it a well-defined concept?  It doesn't sit well with me that someone might say (and I have actually heard things like this) ""I had a really good time, but I don't think I reached subspace, so I'm still disappointed.""  If you had a good time, why is that not enough?  Furthermore, it's not a well-defined concept, so how do you even know when you've found it?  Sometimes (it seems to me from reading and talking to people, anyway) people chase it like it's a unicorn and are dissatisfied when they don't feel like they caught it.  That seems pretty counter to the goal of enjoyment to me.

I've never thought to myself ""this is definitely subspace"" or ""damn, that failed to get me to subspace.""  Does that mean I've never reached subspace?  I don't know, because there's no metric by which to determine that.  It makes me wish there weren't a word for it.

I definitely enjoy submission to my Master and pain in general.  These experiences can be drug-like or feel transcendental, but not always in the same way.  Maybe I'm being burned and laughing like a lunatic, high and manic.  Maybe I'm being fucked slowly and reminded who I belong to and why I exist until I'm in tears with how strong the feelings are and how deeply aroused I get.  Maybe I'm being beaten so brutally that I'm screaming and hanging on for dear life, mind shattered, but riding it in a way that makes me feel simultaneously superhuman and like nothing at all.  Maybe I'm blanked out and brainless, physically limp and utterly tranquil inside while I'm used like a toy and not acknowledged because what's to acknowledge about an inanimate object?  Maybe I'm giving a blowjob and zoned out on the sense of Master's cock and the love of his pleasure.  Which one of these is subspace?  All of them?  None of them?  There's no way to know.

I don't want this critique to sound rude or like I'm putting down OP or anyone who replied.  If you like naming your experience, then do.  Go forth and do what pleases you.

True,NoFilterInMyHead,,,"Damn dude. Story time.

One of my best friends is an incredible guitarist. When I hear him play, I hear the future of guitar. We tried to make a band, but there is a problem, he has NO SENSE OF TIMING. He throws the whole band off. Drummer and bassist get mad, I get mad, he gets mad. As a result, I don't really hang out with him anymore, and our potential as a band has gone to zero. Don't be that guy. Learn how to stay in time.


As far as all your questions go, I will try my best to answer them now.

The best way to start I think, is with an example. We are going to use gangnam style, and this online metronome so that we are both looking at the same thing:

http://a.bestmetronome.com/

Ok now. Load up the metronome in a tab, and this song:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bZkp7q19f0

Ok, here's the answer to how to find the bpm. Do you hear the kickdrum going through the whole song? Its that thud. 

I want you to go to the metronome, and click on TAP, then hit the spacebar with every thud. You are now tapping along to the tempo of the song. Practice with your foot. 

What tempo did you get? The answer should be around (43.3 * 3). Find the tempo before doing the calculation!

Ok, so the reason I started with a dance track is because a lot of them use a house beat, four on the floor, which is just a kick drum for every quarter note. This leads into your next question... time signatures.

The time signature for this song is 4/4, which means that there are 4 quarter notes per bar. You figure that out like this. 4/4 means 4 * (1/4) . the 1/4 represents quarter notes, and the 4 means four of them.

So most rock songs don't use a house beat. Most do something else. Check this song out:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEgUUTkqRRQ

First off, note the 4 hits the drummer does at the beginning. He is setting the tempo. DONT BE THAT GUY that counts down at one tempo, and then starts playing at something completely different ok?

So for this song, it uses a standard 4/4 beat, which goes kick SNARE kick SNARE. Listen to it. Boom CRACK boom CRACK. This is VERY common. You will hear it a lot now. The snares highlight the backbeat.. the 2 and the 4 (from 4/4). so its 1 2 3 4. And the snares are on the 2 and the 4. The kick usually hits the 1 and 3

To tap along to this song, you have to tap at the first kick, and then at the snares. He doesn't hit the third kick, but you should still tap it. See what tempo you get. Should be around 100.

It helps to think like a drummer as well. The snare (crack) is used for the backbeat, the kick is for the downbeat, and the hi hat (tap tap tap) is to keep time by hitting in between the beats (the AND of the beats). When you are playing with other musicians you should focus on the drums, and not on yourself. Don't be that guy. 

Ok, so 4/4 is great and whatnot, but here are more examples that are pretty crazy.

There is 3/4, which is 3 quarter notes (waltz time).
6/8, which is 6 eigth notes.

As far as knowing which songs are using which time signature, you have to listen to hear when the musical ideas complete. AKA how long does a bar last for. 99% of songs in the pop, pop/rock world are 4/4.

But check this song out

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwEY_X5nSy8

If you try and tap along, it might be different than if you follow the boom crack thing I told you about earlier.

In fact, this whole song is in HALF TIME. It's a typical dub beat. The kick is on beat 1, and the snare is on beat 3. Its still 4/4 (or 8/8) but in half time. You gotta watch out for things like this. So try and get the tempo? Be careful, its 140, not 70. 

So, as far as playing leads to a click. I think you have the background now to understand what I am about to say.

You can set up the metronome to click at different beats.. say you are in 4/4? If you want to play at 115 bpm (beats per minute btw), then you can set the metronome to 115, and set it to 4 beats.

You are now getting this count : 1 2 3 4

or you can set the metronome to half of 115, and pretend that you are only hearing clicks on the 2 and the 4, or the 1 and the 3, etc.

When you play with a click track, you wanna be locked in to the click. You wanna be able to hit a note right when the click hits. But to be honest, the only beat you really need to NAIL is the 1. Hitting the one is important. You can fuck up everything else, but as long as you hit the 1, people feel like you are a boss.

Check SRV

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iPUZSEFb7E

No matter wtf he is doing, he ALWAYS comes home on the 1, and hits it solidly.  

So i think I missed some stuff, but that should get you started. Remember, don't be that guy. K?

True,small_trunks,,"Jerry in Amsterdam, Zn.8a, 35yrs exp., 300+ trees","I am one of the people saying it really IS *that hard* and that you simply can't learn the rules as you go along. I say this based not only on the experience I have personally gained over the last 35 years growing bonsai but also from discussions I've had with genuine masters in the field. The amount of forward planning you need to do is huge and the chances of success are minuscule, so to make a go of it you need to plant literally hundreds of seeds at a time AND know what you are doing from the very earliest stages.

Ignoring the BONSAI aspects, you'll still need to do these things to have any chance at all:

* you need a *solid* horticultural background - sufficient that you can keep dozens/hundreds of plants alive from seed to semi-mature tree (so that's a good 10 to 15 year period). 

* you need appropriately positioned semi-permanent outdoor growing facilities (ideally level ground, full/partial sun, right part of the country!, good soil, availability of water). This includes over-wintering (potentially poly-tunnels or a greenhouse, with or without heating) and over-summering (automated/manually arranged watering systems) with or without some level of sun protection.

* you need to make available time and energy to do the weeding, potting, repotting, cleaning, turning, moving and all of the other horticultural chores. This might mean being there *every day* in the first months, including weekends and in *your* vacation periods otherwise they die...

* you need resources (money, yard/gardens) to enable the above.

I'll throw the BONSAI skills in, that you need to know on DAY 1 MINUS 120 (because you need to know what to do to get the seeds to germinate):

* choose the right tree species for your available growing facilities (taking your current climate and any potential future climates into account - let's say you don't see yourself living in Chicago forever but fancied California in 10 years when you start a family).

* getting your soil/substrate ready

* choose the right quantity of seeds to start (based on known/expected die-off) and the right source of those seeds.

* choose the right month to sow the seeds taking into account any months/years required to correctly stratify (and knowing if you need to stratify each species and how to do it).

We're not doing any BONSAI stuff yet...*nothing*, we're still doing specialised gardening. Now come the specialised BONSAI techniques you need to know in order to apply them *in the first month*. If you get any of these wrong, the tree you have at the end of YEAR 1 will be wrong and the tree you have in YEAR 10 will be useless as a bonsai:

* choosing the seedlings to allow grow on based on correct seedling characteristics (knowing what the correct characteristics are for each tree sort: health/vigour, leaf size, root position, branch positions etc).

* knowing when and how to treat the seedlings to achieve good nebari. Different per tree sort. Knowing when and how to root prune.

* knowing if, when and how to apply wiring to achieve appropriate lower trunk movement. Knowing when to remove it or whether to leave it on.

* knowing if, when and how to appropriately prune the seedlings to achieve taper and/or lower branching and/or trunk movement (you need to know what constitutes a well/correctly proportioned tree and how to achieve it).

* applying correct levels of sunlight/water/fertiliser/wind protection/heat/cold per species throughout the year appropriate to your climate

* dealing with fungus, pests and diseases

So we're still in the ground or a large box from YEAR 1 to say YEAR 8 for a small tree or to year 15 for a large tree:

* creating vigorously growing trees with appropriate light, water, heat, fertiliser 

* knowing when and how to potting up, do root pruning and nebari development

* knowing when and how to do branch and trunk development using chopping/growing techniques (or whatever else is necessary per tree sort).

* primary branch selection - potentially wiring

...and so it goes on.

At the end of, let's say, 8-15 years you have a PRE-bonsai upon which you can finally *start* to practice actual bonsai techniques of ramification development, branch placement, trunk angles, detail wiring, pruning, pot choices etc etc etc 

You can go to any number of places in the US and Europe and buy such raw-material TODAY and start doing and learning about bonsai TODAY. 

Can you honestly say you had any idea at all that you needed to know all of these things on day 1? No...and that's where the experience comes in.

True,Mohgreen,,,"Wow~ so My story isn't that bad, but here it is anyway. So this goes back, almost 20 years.  I'm out to see Rocky Horror Picture Show, and I get to chatting with a couple of girls in line next in back of me. Somehow I end up with one of the girls number, we go to a party the next weekend. We keep going out on dates, but its not DATING yet. Well I'm starting to fall for her, we mesh pretty well, its looking like this friendship thing can go somewhere! So one night she asks if I want to go with her to a local show, a tribute band for the Beatles thats playing at the local college. Sounds good right?

Yea. She brought someone else. So here's me on one side. Her in the middle, another dude on the other side. He and I are both giving each other the eyeball, lookin at her, and both wondering WTF?

So concerts over, we head to the school cafe.. where she sits us both down for ""The Talk"".  She likes us both as friends (oooo friendzoned early in the conversation, this isn't good)..  Doesn't want to ""Date"", has to finish school, needs space, the whole spiel. Basically, a ""You can keep taking me out to dinner and we can be friends, but its not going anywhere"" to two guys at the same time.  Remarkably efficient of her.

True,IceRay42,,,"Fun story time!

I'd been seeing this girl for a few weeks, and it wasn't exactly fireworks, but we got on all right, and it was the first time I'd actually tried dating someone after breaking up with my ex-fiancee, so I wasn't looking for a home run. She'd told me she was pagan at the outset and I assured her I didn't mind, as long as she didn't try to force it down my throat. For her part, she was true to her word, but it should've been a red flag from the word go. So anyway: She tells me she's leaving town for the weekend to go to a pagan convention (or gathering or somesuch) a few towns over for the weekend and she was excited about it. For my part, I wanted to try to be supportive and non judgmental about her beliefs, so I offered to accompany her, but she said she'd be fine and would call me when she got home.

So I'm at home, playing internet video games in my underwear Sunday afternoon when I get a call from her (a day early) and she's panicked and sobbing on the other end, and it's only after much bleating and confusion that she's able to get out that she needs to see me ASAP. So I go full hero-boyfriend mode, immediately drop what I'm doing (I even put on pants!) and race over to her place thinking something awful has happened.

I burst through her door rapid-firing questions like ""What's wrong?"" ""What happened?"" ""Who did this to you?"" and ""How can I help?"" and she eventually tells me that she ran into an ex-boyfriend (also pagan) while at the convention, and that they'd had sex. I felt my gut drop out. Rape. One of my closest friends had been raped a couple years prior and it was a nightmare I had no desire to witness again.

""So you were raped?""

""Well....no.""

""But you had sex with him?""

""Yes.""

""&lt;Hername&gt; I know it can be scary to admit, but I'm not going to think less of you if you were raped. You can tell me.""

""Well, I WANTED to have sex with him.""

Cue palpable confusion pause. I had to not only try to parse this new bit of information, but also shut down the Rape Reactions going on.

""You...wanted to have sex with him?""

""See it's like this. I like you a lot and I don't want to hurt you, but you have to understand he POSSESSED me.""

""He...he what?""

""He has a strong dark magic aura that I succumb to whenever he's around. He makes me not myself.""

I'm pretty hopelessly lost at this point. I've tried to respect her beliefs up to this point but this is a bit of a tough pill for me to swallow. I tried to gain solid footing one last time.

""Possession sounds like it was against your will. If that's the case, it was rape, and we should go to the police department.""

""No no. It wasn't rape. It's just that the dark magic clouds my mind with desires.""

""...So, basically, you're openly admitting to me that you slept with another guy, and you're trying to rationalize it with something you know I don't believe in.""

At this point she blew up on me. She was furious that I wasn't more sympathetic to her dark magic plight, and couldn't believe I could be so callous and selfish. After about ten minutes of cyclical yelling. I just turned to leave and told her to have a nice life. I'm not normally this witty, so you'll pardon me for including my snarky exit one liner. As I opened the door she screamed at me

""What, you don't even LIKE ME anymore?! Just ALL OF THE SUDDEN?!""

Calmly, I turned around, gave her a sarcastic grin and made jazz hands and said

""It's like magic."" and then left.

**EDIT**: Okay obligatory ""let's nip this misconception in the bud"" thing. Addressing the ""You kinda jumped the gun on rape."" thing. Yeah. Yeah I did. I want you to take ""crisis level panic inducing racking sobs"" and add in ""I had sex with someone but clearly dont' look happy about it"" and see what your first assumption is.

Again, it's something I have experience with, and it's not an easy thing to admit happened. Think long and hard about whether or not you'd rather be the guy that's overly worried it's rape when it's just a stupid cheating space case (the conclusion I *settled on anyway*), or if you want to risk being the person yelling at someone who has just been raped for cheating on you.

True,Flubb,technology,Reformation-Era Science &amp; Technology,"You have a particularly blunt understanding of what constitutes evidence to a historian, but I'll address that in the responses.
&gt; 1. Why do you think that so many people trekked across the Sinai and there is no evidence of it?

This is based on the assumption that 603,000 people actually traipsed across the desert.  There is an ambiguity about *'eleph* as it can mean (depending on the context), a thousand, a group (tent), or a leader.   I won't crunch through all the numbers and textual reasoning unless you want it, but the actual number of people leaving is probably about 22,000 (603 families/groups/tents).  This is a much small group of people to move about, and better fits the subsequent evidence in the following books in the Tanakh, especially with the numbers of Levites required.  The other issue is that evidence quickly disappears - it's even quicker going up to moisture-rich Canaan, so the trail of evidence would naturally trail off.

&gt;2. Do you agree, then, that there is NO EVIDENCE whatsoever that the Hebrews were in Egypt?

There is no **extant** evidence of either the Israelites being specified as group in Egyptian records, no specific evidence of 'Moses', and no evidence of Israelites at Qadash-Barnea.  

This is where most internet atheists and non-historians stop, because in their minds they have solved the issue and start shouting about 'No Evidence!', but this is precisely because they're not historians and are stuck in a curiously anachronistic understanding of evidence.

There is a large body of neutral and positive evidence  that the Hebrews were in Egypt:

**Neutral:**

1. There is a massive defect in ancient documentation- 99% of all New Kingdom papyri is irrevocably lost, and no buildings at Pi-Ramesse are above ground level- so it's peculiar to demand that a group of migrant slaves leave enough evidence behind in the alluvial mud, *and* carry enough ostracons and rock carvings to justify their existence on a one year journey to Canaan.  This is ignoring the fact that they left in a hurry, not even enough time to leaven their bread.
2. It would be silly to demand that Egyptian kings leave proof of their defeats, especially as a defeat was a sign of divine disapproval - nobody is going to crow about that on a mural somewhere, so you won't find it in Egyptian sources.
3. The usage of slaves in the New Kingdom is a documented fact, and the facts are very similar to the accounts given in Exodus, including the forced making of bricks, the Egyptian overseers, and the usage of straw and bricks together.

**Positives**

1. Exoduses took place throughout the second millennium - what is recorded in Exodus is not out of place for the time period, and it was/is such a significant event for Hebrews throughout their existence that it would seem perverse to deny it happened.
2. Israel and other groups such as Edom and Moab are mentioned in Egyptian sources around 1200.
3. The cosmopolitan nature of the Ramesside 19th dynasty included Semites, at all levels from court to slave.
4. The post-Exodus accounts are not written in the same fantastical manner as contemporary accounts were, but were rooted in historical place and local knowledge.  The quail for example, do migrate across the Sinai, and the Israelite accounts refer to this.
5. There are examples of other Semitic tabernacles, that closely correspond to the ones described in the Tanakh, that show that the concept was certainly of the time period of the Exodus.
6. The language, linguistics, and law codes indicate both the correct time for when the event was alleged, and the complexity of the law systems indicate that it would require someone with knowledge of the law courts - which means that Moses would have to be fabricated if he wasn't real.
7. The actual route of the Exodus corresponds with avoiding the known Egyptian fortresses and military enclaves that were the immediate route into Canaan.

There are more, but I won't belabour the point.  There is also the question as to whether archaeology has found everything that does and can exist.  There is no reason to doubt the possibility that something might be dug up in the future, but as I've shown, there's plenty to go on before that happens.

People are getting smarter at the rate of about 3 IQ points per decade. How could a person in his position not be aware of the Flynn effect?

There are two separate selective pressures: survival and mating. Only a certain amount of intelligence is necessary for survival, and that that pressure peaked thousands of years ago, as Crabtree, if that is truly his name, has stated. I would bet that most of our intellectual development as a species has developed as a means to attract mates, not find prey, and there is no reason to believe that reproductive pressures have abated. In fact, there was more pressure on communities to maximize fertility in the past, and now with less pressure to maximize fertility, there may even be *more* selective pressure on mating.",0,1352917959,,0,False,1,c71bv1v,t3_136kza,t1_c71bv1v,t3_136kza,,1430405341,3,False,cogsci,t5_2qh0k,3

You know something dark has made this cave it's home, and it's big. You drop to a crouch and draw your bow. sliding along you find some bones, a journal. 

""They took us when our torches ran out. We were so lost. Never should have came....stay in the light"".

You fear no dark and as such you melt into it, allow it to cloak you and embrace you. Sending a prayer to Nocturnal, you knock back that special potion that allows you to see the very essence of life, knock an arrow, and set out to find whatever it is that lurks here in the dark.

You find a side tunnel and decide to follow it. Moving silently and crouched, bow drawn, eyes searching for any sign of movement. That's when you see it. At first a faint glow, then as you move closer a dark violet light, and it's moving toward you. Your muscles tense, you stop and wait. The light is approaching the bend in the tunnel, and within seconds it will be right in front of you. Here it comes, ten feet now five, You draw back, take aim...It's gone. The potion wore off. You hold your position waiting, but it never comes, maybe it turned back you think and take a step forward.

Right into a pressure plate. You feel it as soon as it depresses, rolling backwards just as a ten foot stream of flame engulfs the space you were occupying. The heat is intense and you can feel it on your face. The flame stops just as it rounds the corner. The trap must have alerted it. It's big. Really big, covered in thick white fur and full o' fury it bears down on you, crashing it's way with abandon through the tunnel. It hits the ground with a thud, a fresh Dragon Bone arrow between it's eyes.

You let the breath out you've been holding and go to check the body. It's a frost troll an ugly one at that, and you thank the gods that your a master archer. You hear scuffling down the tunnel from where the troll had came, just as you remember the journal said ""they"".

or do you save your art for after you've been totally emotionally drained by the eight hours spent at school, plus all the lesson planning, marking and human emotion which you have to fit into the time you're not passed out from exhaustion?  
  
The thing with art is it takes a long time to get the physical skills, the knowledge and know how but also it takes the right creative mindset to make something worth while; to really put energy into something.  You can't make a successful art while working enough hours to pay for living and you can't ear enough money to get your art off the ground until you've been doing it ages....  
  
so sure, stay at home and work a low paid job and steal as much as your time for yourself as possible, then watch as you life slowly passes by and all your options dry up (this is what i did, but also my brother and he's genuinely a successful artist so 50/50...) or live a normal life with regular relationships and a house to bring kids up in; in today's society those are your only two options, unless of course you're already rich then well you ain't really got no option but blandness.

Burning the candles at both ends, drinking hard, doing drugs and advancing really, really quickly in a career and at an organization I believed in very deeply.  By 26 I was definitely a rising star.  People always talked to me about how far I could go and how much I could accomplish.  Then, I flew too close to the sun and it all came crashing down.  

Now I live a quiet life.  I work a quiet but challenging job with fewer hours (and much less money) for the same organization I still believe in very deeply.  I have no desire to advance any more.  I've quit drugs.  Moderated my drinking.  I bought a house.  I get up crazy early in the morning to take my dog on long walks and bake muffins to share with my coworkers.  Sometimes I stop by friends houses on the way to work and bring them breakfast and coffee.  I cook big brunches and dinners and invite all the people who matter to me to my house.  I read.  I chain smoke cigarettes.

True,notsarahnz,ORANGE,ADHD-C,"So, I'm on risperidone. The official thing that I'm on it for is ""irritability in autism spectrum disorders"", which can be things like aggression etc, although in my case, it's anxiety.

Or, ""Treatment under the supervision of a paediatrician or psychiatrist, in combination with non-pharmacological measures, of severe behavioural disturbances in a patient aged less than 18 years with autism."" (except I'm over 18)

Anyway. As far as treating depression and anxiety goes - antidepressants are the first drug to look at. SSRIs or SNRIs or whatever. I've tried a few different ones and they were all very very awful, for me, so my psychiatrist decided to not go down that path.

Also important with depression and anxiety is counselling/therapy/etc, and I've had many many many years of that, so I've learned a lot of coping mechanisms and tricks and things I can do... but on top of that, I was still having severe anxiety, so we decided to look into medication.

So, with that in mind, the risperidone is quite good at ""making the world scream less"", is how I usually describe it. I have sensory integration problems, where basically my senses are always turned up to 11 all of the time and it's really difficult for me to be able to modulate the input and to process it all and deal with it all, so I spent a lot of time being totally overwhelmed by everything that was going on around me - like, being in ""panic mode"" I guess.

So, having the world ""scream less"" means I don't have to constantly be ""on edge"" or on the borderline of having a panic attack all the time - which makes everything easier to deal with, and now I can use all of the things that 10 years of therapy have taught me, and they actually work.

I guess the other thing that I've been noticing is that it's been improving my ""grasp on reality"" - before taking it, I would often have periods where I could not tell what was real and what wasn't, which also caused a lot of my anxiety - I would be scared of totally and utterly unrealistic things, for example, that the earth might break open in front of me and swallow me whole... so I'd have to put a lot of conscious effort into reminding myself ""no, this is reality, those things don't happen in reality"". (I've always had an ""overactive imagination"", so to speak). So anyway, now that I'm taking it, I feel a lot more confident about what reality is and what's real and what's not, and I'm a lot less freaked out and having to consciously mind that all the time.

One last thing I've noticed - usually I would have to take stimulants after waking up when I wanted to be able to do productive things. Now, I am actually capable of waking up and tidying my room and making breakfast without being on stimulants - so the risperidone might be doing somethig helpful for the ADHD. I still need stimulants to actually ""get work done"", though, which is okay.

Also, an antipsychotic is used to make people not psychotic, in general - where psychosis is things like in schizophrenia.

That was a massively long essay... but I figured I'd write it and you can read it and if anything's resonating in there with your experiences, it might be worth talking to your psychiatrist about it.",0,1352930760,,0,False,1,c71fr77,t3_13652c,t1_c71fr77,t1_c717psn,,1430407177,4,False,ADHD,t5_2qnwb,4

I love my tattoos (and have plans for many more!), and my children love my tattoos, but if/when they come home with tattoos, there will be a part of me that is sad. I would never shame them or act like it is any of my business, but I get the sadness.

 It's just that I see their bodies as perfect. I've kissed every toe and cherished every inch of them. I held each of them over my shoulder as they vomited down my back (because I'm a nutjob who thinks this is more comforting for them). I sacrificed caffeine and wine and went organic to give them the best chance of healthy bodies while I was pregnant and nursing, I feed them crazily healthy, whole, organic foods, (which DESTROYS my tattoo budget)and there isn't a tattoo in the world that is worthy of marking their bodies. Your parents probably made far, far greater sacrifices for you than I have made for my kids, and, unlike me, they probably don't even LIKE tattoos. So to see one on your body probably hurts. 

By all means, get tattoos. Get good ones, please, but go out and get all the tattoos that you love and want. But please try to understand why everyone doesn't love it the way you do. Because chances are, your parents will see even the most beautiful tattoos as marring something that, to them. was already perfect.

Long but bear with me:

I went on a date with a guy who I THOUGHT was really cool, but in reality I was just an idiot that was taken in by his strapping good looks.  Our date was originally meant to be dinner and a movie but about half way through dinner I realized there was no wayyyyyy I could handle being anywhere near this dude for another 15 minutes. (total douche, thought everyone was in love with him...even made comments about the waitress probably wanting to bang him) The dumb part was he had picked me up in his car, however, I only lived about a few miles from the movie theatre. Knowing full well I was about to ditch him at the movies, I offered to pay for my half of the dinner. He refused, wouldn't let me, made a HUGE deal to the waitress and even the lady next to our table commented, ""honey, if he wants to pay let him pay. It's so hard to find a gentleman these days"" I felt pretty mortified, and went to the movies with him, (he had already bought the tickets). ... and I realized I would feel bad if I ditched him after paying for our pretty expensive dinner and the movie so I decided to rough it out. We sit down in the theater with about 25 minutes left until show time. Im looking for anything that will distract me, when lo and behold WHAT do I notice I have in my purse... A HUGE BLACK DILDO. you see, my roommate and I play this game where we place the dildo in unsuspecting places (backpacks, purses, cars, fridge) to incur extreme embarrassment.  I casually throw my purse down on the floor of the theatere so all the contents spill out over the floor.  Dude sees huge black dildo.. I calmly laugh ""oh haha, how'd that get in there""...He tells me he has to go to the bathroom. NEVER RETURNS. Never in my life was I so grateful to see that black dildo.

edit: OF COURSE my black dildo story gets me the most notoriety. I assume he ran away because he felt extremely uncomfortable - most likely because the size of his penis. also he was probably a racist asshole and thought it meant I was into huge black cock or something.. who knows. I ran into him at a bar like 7 months later and he wouldn't even look at me.  I had a good laugh at his expense, yet again.

We were about to do a man overboard when we got a call from the Lutjens, a German warship that was moored ahead of us on the pier in Plymouth, England. While in port, the Winston S. Churchill (us) and the Lutjens got together for a sports day/cookout on our fantail, and we made some pretty good friends.

Now at sea they called over on bridge-to-bridge, requesting to pass us close up on our port side, to say goodbye. We prepared to render them honors on the bridge-wing, and the Captain told the crew to come topside to wish them farewell. As they were making their approach, our Conning Officer announced through her binoculars that they were flying an American flag. As they came even closer, we saw that it was flying at half-mast.

The bridge-wing was crowded with people as the Boatswain's Mate blew two whistles- Attention to Port- the ship came up alongside and we saw that the entire crew of the German ship were manning the rails, in their dress blues. They had made up a sign that was displayed on the side that read ""We Stand By You"".

Needless to say there was not a dry eye on the bridge as they stayed alongside us for a few minutes and we cut our salutes. It was probably the most powerful thing I have seen in my entire life, and more than a few of us fought to retain our composure.

True,sbetschi12,,,"Preschool teacher here.  I have an idea about what to do about our educational system.  I brought it up once in r/politics, but it got no attention.  Maybe somebody in this thread want to look at my thoughts and give their opinion.  I really think it could work (I just have no way of making it happen):

The American public education system definitely needs to be reformed, but opening more charter (read: private) schools is not the way to do it. First of all, the government should not be forced to pull taxpayer dollars out of a public system that offers to serve everyone in order to support a private system or school which is only available to a few. This has already happened in PA: every charter school is considered its own district under state law.

One large change that needs to happen is the way in which certification works for teachers. States offer their own certification, which is often invalid over state lines. For example, a teacher certified in MD cannot work as a teacher in PA until they take redundant classes in order to earn a PA certification. Because MD and FL have reciprocity, a Maryland teacher may transfer his/her certificate and seek out a teaching position in FL. The problem: look at a map. What are the practical chances a family from the mid-Atlantic region will relocate to FL (e.g. if the spouse of the teacher finds a new job over state lines)?

Another problem with our educational system is the disconnect between the treatment of preschool teachers compared to primary and secondary. I will continue to use MD as an example since that is the state with which I am most familiar. MD has a great preschool curriculum. The problem is that the vast majority of preschools are private enterprises. While the state does offer both Head Start services as well as vouchers for families who cannot afford to pay the entire cost of a private preschool, the state does little to nothing to protect teachers' rights.

The MD State Dept of Ed determines the basic curriculum guidelines to be followed by preschools. They also require a high-level of ongoing certification in order to remain a senior staff teacher (I think it's still 12 credit hours per year). The problem is that, although the teachers must follow the guidelines set forth by the MD Dept of Ed and they are given an OCC qualification card issued by the MDSDED, they are not actually recognized as teachers in MD. This means that, if they received the HOPE scholarship (which has now been phased out anyway) for two years, they must work at at least the primary level in order to avoid having to pay the scholarship back in full and with interest. They do not have the option of joining a union, and there is very little they can do to combat unfair treatment by their employer.

There are many MD preschools which are run based on for profit business models. This often results in low wages for teachers, which--of course--can result in unmotivated, uninterested, over stressed, and over worked teachers. It also means unsafe conditions for the children. For example, if a child is sick, the director of the school will often choose to allow the child to remain at school for the day or to return to school before the required 24 hour absence because they do not want to upset the parents. I have often seen this happen. The parents are the clients, and if the clients get angry, they may pull their child (and hence their $$) out of the school. There is nothing wrong with making a profit, but when the CEO of a preschool (yes, preschools are often run by CEOs) has three houses while the teachers who work at the schools can barely afford to make enough to send their own child to the school at which they work, there is an obvious misunderstanding of the goal of the school. Schools are supposed to prepare children to become contributing members of society, not to line someone's pocket with silver.

Another problem with our system can be found in our expectations. We now expect everyone to get a college education. Not only has this led to universities being forced to lower their standards because they are now filled with average-level students and kids who are only in school because their parents said they must go, but it has also caused us as a society to undervalue blue collar workers.

Teenagers, especially boys, tend to have a disdain for school. This means our high-schools are filled with kids who have no interest being there and don't want to learn. The kids who are interested in History, English, Science, Math, etc. end up being surrounded by peers who do not value this sort of education. This does not mean that these peers are stupid. They just have different interests. My brother, for example, is extremely intelligent, but he hated school so much that he ended up ""dropping out."" (He actually ""attended"" one of PA's online charter schools for two years and graduated. I cannot tell you how much of a joke of an education that was!) Why wasn't there another option for him?

My proposal is this: we introduce an apprenticeship system into our secondary education. Now, I know some school districts still have Vo-Tech schools because I attended school in one such district. The problem is that, by the time kids reach the age to attend one of these schools, the cultural mindset has introduced and reinforced the idea that these schools are for ""dumb kids"" or ""under-achievers"" or are really only for poor kids whose families can't afford college. We need to re-learn, as a society, that the labor done by blue collar workers is absolutely necessary for our nation to function and that it is extremely valuable work.

Here's what we do: children should be able to perform at a certain level in order to enter high school. Everyone can take the test, but students must meet a certain standard in order to enter high school. This way, our schools are filled with children who are interested in an intellectual education, and we can begin to raise the standards expected of our students. If, prior to ninth or tenth grades, students show that they have been under-performing consistently, or if their teachers notice that they have absolutely no interest in education, kids should have another option.
These children should be able to spend a few weeks experiencing different jobs which require specialized training. A teen could, for example, spend one week with a painting company helping with the little tasks, spend another week in a bank observing the duties of the tellers, and spend a third week with a mechanic to see just how that business runs. Eventually, the teen will have to choose which profession they would like to learn. Then, for the next three to four years, the teen works as an apprentice for a company learning the tricks of the trade. The student should, for the first two years, attend a school three times a week where they will spend two days learning subjects such as math and English and the third day will be spent with other students apprenticed in the same field, learning a skill that is specific to their apprenticeship. For the last one to two years, the student should only spend two days a week at school while spending the other three working for their mentor company.

The companies which take on apprentices will have to have earned a certification to do so. When they have an apprentice or two working for them, they should receive a bit of money from the government, not only to show appreciation for the time they are taking to skillfully train another young American, but also to support the company financially for the time it takes away from business to train the teen as well as to give the teen a small paycheck.

That's right, paid apprenticeships. Not much at first, less than minimum wage. Pocket money, really. As the teen learns more and is able to be an active member of the team, their pay should increase. By the time they graduate from their apprenticeship program, they will be an adult (18 or 19) and should be earning just a bit less than what they can expect to earn when they use their skills to gain an entry-level position with another company.

Not only would this system provide a constant flow of low-wage employees for employers who choose to take part in an apprenticeship program, but it would also provide a steady stream of highly-skilled employees for those companies who are ready to hire young workers. It will also provide an alternative education for those kids who have no interest whatsoever in a classroom education or who are not able to perform at the high school level.

Because workers will be highly trained in their fields, they can expect to earn a higher income. Because they are earning a higher income, they will be in a higher tax bracket and will also be able to contribute more to social security (supporting older Americans). Because American workers will be well trained and highly skilled, American products will begin to be of a higher quality. If we produce higher quality products, then our products will be more desirable and out production rates will go up. We will have trained construction workers building our roads and bridges, and those roads and bridges will have been designed by a person who was able to achieve a very high level of education in a classroom that was filled with students excited to learn rather than students who would rather be anywhere else. Also, our society will begin to recognize the role played by both white and blue collar workers as extremely important. Maybe then we can get over this ""us &amp; them"" mentality. (Bonus: the wage gap will shrink.)

**tl; dr American Ed system is broken. More private and charter schools is not the solution. We need more cooperation between state certification programs for teachers. Preschool's should not be run as corporations. An apprenticeship system will give us a more skilled workforce.**

True,cheefjustice,,,"Your headline is totally misleading!  And it could really hurt Applebee's business, which would be unfair, because they're on the right side of this issue.

The statement critical of Obamacare **was made by a guy who runs a company that operates some Applebee's franchises, not by the CEO of Applebee's.**

Applebee's publicly distanced themselves from his statement.

[Here](http://applebees.mwnewsroom.com/Home/Statement-From-Applebee%E2%80%99s%C2%AE-President-Mike-Archer-R) is what Applebee's said about this issue.

Excerpt:

&gt; Recent public comments by one Applebee's franchisee about the possible implications of the ACA on jobs within his individual company were not the views or opinions of either Applebee's or other franchisees, although we respect his right to speak freely as an American.

And 

&gt; Because final regulations and guidance are still pending from government agencies regarding the Affordable Care Act (ACA), exactly how our franchisees will implement the law when it takes effect in 2014 is still uncertain. However, we do know that our franchisees will comply fully with the law and take every measure possible to continue doing right by their employees -- the lifeblood of their businesses. 

And 

&gt; Importantly, it is also worth noting that [the franchisee who made the critical statement] opened a new restaurant last week that created approximately 200 jobs, and will be opening another restaurant next month with a similar number of positions. 

The last part is important because it totally takes the wind out of the sails of the franchisee's criticisms, implicitly saying: If Obamacare is so crippling, how exactly is it that your business is growing like this?

2.  Student carjacked, tied up, and murdered a teacher from another school.  This made national headlines because she had a pocket tape recorder and recorded herself begging for her life and this ultimately led to his capture and arrest.  I knew the murderer's gf at the time and like a complete gentleman, I tried to sell her out to the Jenny Jones show for $150 dollars lol.  Google ""Michael LaSane"".

3.  Student got into a fight with another kid and used brass knuckles.  The person on the losing end of the fight got a brain aneurysm and died.  I was good frieds with the kid and visited him in jail for a few years after.  He's still locked up to this day and won't get out until he's in his 40s.  

4.  Student got pissed off that lady at pawn shop wouldn't take his Playstation and murdered her.  They caught him on camera and arrested the wrong kid and held him for 2 days until they caught the right person.  I knew both kids (real killer an the falsely accused one) decently well.  Google ""Derick Lecompte"".

5.  Each year a student's artwork is chosen for the back cover of the yearbook.  The artist selected my year was a complete stoner and included hidden pictures of blunts, bongs, bowls, weed leaves, and other things all throughout the drawing.  

6.  During a fight downtown (we used to walk downtown for lunch, since it was only a few blocks away), someone got stabbed in the ass and, in turn, shot the stabber in the leg with a crossbow.  

7.  Our school superintendent recently got busted by the feds for racketeering, accepting bribes, and money laundering.  Google ""Michael Ritacco"".



Welcome to NJ, motherfuckers!  

EDIT 1 - Since this is getting popular and people are asking the same questions, I'll just respond here.  


**Q** - Please elaborate on the stabbing/crossbow situation?

**A** - In a nutshell, it was two people fighting and each had a crew behind them. This was common for most 1-on-1 fights at the time, because this way, nobody would jump in. During the fight, my friend landed a good shot and it knocked the kid over. While he was on the ground, he pulled out a hunting knife and stabbed my friend in the hip/ass/thigh area. Right after this happened, someone in his crew pulled out a mini crossbow from under his jacket and shot the kid in the leg.


**Q** - Can you post a picture of the album art?

**A** - I just dug around my garage and found a copy of my yearbook.  It turns out, this artwork wasn't on the back cover.  This drawing was on the back cover of a student newsletter seniors got right before graduation.  It was where we left our ""senior wills"" and stuff like that.  I'll try to find it, but the chances are slim to none.


**Q** - What school/area is this?

**A** - Toms River High School South / Toms River, NJ.  Home of the past Little League World Champions, 5 minutes away from where they filmed ""The Jersey Shore"", home of former UFC Lightweight Champion Frankie Edgar, and home of MLB players Todd and Jeff Frazier.  


**Q** - What type of school was this?

**A** - To be honest, it was a normal high school.  Yeah, we had some real craziness that took place over the years, but it wasn't like a ghetto or anything like that.  It's a mostly white, middle-class school with cultural diversity . You also have to remember that most of this stuff took place in the late 90s, which was when being ""bad"" and ""gangsta"" were considered ""cool"".  I'm not making excuses for this crap, but a few years after I graduated, they really cleaned things up (with the exception of Ritacco).  

**Q** - What were your relationships like with the murderers? 

**A** - Eddie was a close friend.  He was at my house 3 days prior to this and my mom really liked him.  This was an example of really poor judgement made by a freshly turned 18 year old.  Brass knuckles are far more dangerous than most people care to think.  This wasn't a cold-blooded act really. Just two kids fighting and Eddie made the idiotic choice of using brass knuckles and hit the kid a certain way that ended both of their lives, figuratively.  I'm not making excuses for his behavior one bit and he most certainly deserves to be in jail, but I'm just trying to give some background.   Derick I knew from Gym class and because we both liked to hook up our cars.  He was far from a close friend, but I can tell you that I never would have expected this from him in a million years. I ran into him at McDonalds (I worked there in high school) about a week prior and he showed me new rims on his car.  Michael I didn't know at all.  What he did is horrible and I hope he rots in hell for it.  His case wasn't an instance of an otherwise good person making a horrible choice.  He did something ridiculously bad in cold blood and ruined a family forever.

EDIT: the other thing that bothers me about this show is the fact that the vast majority of child sexual abuse cases involve someone the child knows.

I went to a private European high school, where entire grades generally capped out around 85 people. As such, everybody knew everybody else's business.

There was one teacher who EVERYBODY loved--he was young, hip, and handsome. He talked straight to the students, treated us like we were adults, and was funny and open. All the girls had little crushes, and most of the guys thought he was cool.

Can I make it any more obvious what happened?

Because it turns out that he was REALLY good at treating students like adults. After nearly an entire year of being engaged in a sexual relationship with a senior, someone told the administration. I was in his class on Wednesday, he came in acting completely harried and distracted, ignored our questions, and spent the entire period handing back old work and prepping us (briefly) on the final exam.

The next day he was gone. It was shocking, but not surprising. We all knew what happened (small school, remember?) and it was all anyone could talk about for days. The administration kept the whole thing very ""hush-hush"" and under wraps. I don't think he was even officially fired (although that may have something to do with French labor laws), but instead was asked to leave.

So whatever, right? Upsetting, but not that unbelievable. Scummy douche preys on vulnerable young girl, it's a tale as old as time. 

It comes out later that she got pregnant, and her friend's parents found out and exposed the affair once she asked to borrow money for an abortion. Absolutely vile and abhorrent, but unfortunately this kind of thing seems to happen a lot.

BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE!

Flash forward to 2011. My friends and I from high school keep an ongoing email thread going, to stay updated in each other's lives. One day, I get this message.

""Has anyone heard about Mr. X's book?""

What? He wrote a book? Let's google that! What do we find?

"" NOVEL TITLE is the harrowing story of a popular and adored teacher at a private international high school, who becomes involved with one of his students blah blah blah IT'S THE EXACT SAME STORY""

Gross. Beyond gross. I find a copy in a bookstore and read it, and have to sit down because I'm shaking so much. (Not exaggerating.) Nothing was fiction. Everything was true to life, down to the physical description of the school. Characters were given different names or hair colors, but otherwise were drawn completely (and I mean COMPLETELY) from life. I can tell you who every single person in this book, down to the ancillary characters is meant to be. Like, he lives with this young, equally hip female teacher and they have sexual tension? My 11th grade English teacher. The blundering, blustering older teacher who addresses girls as ""gorgeous"" (something that Mr. X somehow thinks is just as bad as his affair? IDEK)? My 12th grade IB History professor. I've been to the bar in Paris where he and the girl first begin their flirtation, as it was a popular hangout with students. Everything is based in reality.
 
The only thing that's not true to life is how every single character is either obsessed with the Mr. X avatar (including this super-offensive Middle Eastern character he writes about who says that Mr. X taught him how to be a liberated thinker and free) or is an insensitive, unintelligent, jerk incapable of understanding his true Camus-like depth of existential angst. It reads like Mary Sue fanfic of what happened--where he is always justified in his actions (she seduces HIM! He's helpless before her wiles!) and everyone worthwhile adores him.

He even writes about her pregnancy and abortion. In HER voice. 

That's right, he writes one third of the novel in her voice, and it is the most fawning, sycophantic thing ever. At the end, after the ignorant school psychiatrist who can never begin to understand their love leaves her alone (this is how he portrays it), adult Girl ends the novel by saying ""Sometimes I still dream about him.""

Horrible, horrible stuff. It gets a good review in the Times. Fuck the Times. Facebook is exploding, people can't believe his gall. I get into a couple really heated arguments with people about the line between fiction and reality. Most of us are FURIOUS that this dick has exploited this girl's pain (Oh yeah, she is NOT happy. Feels violated all over again, according to her friends) for his own literary advancement. I see it under OUR PICKS selections in bookshops, and I get all rage-y and roily. But what can you do?

APPARENTLY SOMETHING. About six months after this all happens, my roommate (who knows the situation) says, ""I think you should check Jezebel.com"". I go, and the top story is an expose of this creep. This girl's best friend from high school, like a fucking Valkyrie avenging her wronged friend, contacted a journalist who launched an investigation and revealed that his fictional novel was anything but. The Amazon review page is now nothing but accounts of this guy's lies, and one of the first hits when you google his name is this Jezebel article. Justice is tasty.

True,MisterMan92,,,"Mr. Gore,
Thanks for doing an AMA. I’m writing this because a little more than 12 years ago, I met you and it changed my life. I was 7 years old at the time and my father was a photojournalist traveling with you. He had been on the road with your team for weeks and I had not seen him in person in quite some time. I sent him a [letter](http://i.imgur.com/a7cwO.jpg) with a picture of a telephone, pager, and computer with a short note underneath reading “These are the only ways I can talk to you. I want to talk man to man!”

A few days later, my Dad received the letter while on Air Force II. Your daughter Karenna happened to see it and she told my Dad that she wanted you to see it. A bit later at a photo-op, you approached my Dad and asked to see the letter.

That night at an off-the-record party, you and my Dad were talking over a beer and the letter came up again. My Dad then asked “If I call him right now, would you get on the phone?” All of the sudden, my Dad calls the house and tells me Al Gore wants to talk to me. Being 7 years old, I was not nearly aware of the magnitude of the situation, and treated it much like any other phone conversation. I don’t remember most of the conversation, but I do remember you telling me that I was a ""very bright young man"" and had “great handwriting for a second grader.”

A few days later, when we went to greet my Dad at Andrew’s Air Force Base, you came up to me and said “Are you Mr. Man to Man?” You introduced yourself to the rest of my family and we chatted for a bit before you left. From that day on, my Dad said that every time you guys saw each other you would ask him “How’s Mr. Man?”

So while I do not have question for you Mr. Gore, I just wanted to take my first opportunity since then to say “thank you” for that. You didn’t go out of your way to talk to a 7 year old on the phone as a political act or to win over voters, you did it because you are a genuinely incredible person. To this day, whenever anyone tries to talk down or make fun of Al Gore, I tell them my story and they are blown away. So once again, Mr. Gore, thank you. [You are the man](http://i.imgur.com/2cSZy.jpg).

True,NorthSideSoxFan,,"MS, RN, EMT-B","This probably isn't what your instructor intended, since ED nurses often develop a different view of death from other nurses, as many of the patients who ""die"" on us are unobserved field arrests who really died an hour or so prior to arrival, but haven't developed dependent lividity, rigor mortis, or other obvious signs of death and thus have to be worked a bit before being pronounced.  That said, here goes:

This past summer we get a telemetry call (actually a cell phone call, since most of our catchment area is out of our EMS region) saying that EMS in bringing in a respiratory distress patient.  I had an open room at the time, so, I get out my paperwork and watch as EMS rolls through the door, bagging an easily 500+lbs patient.  We start to assess the guy and...he has no pulse.  Crap.

Begin CPR Data Sheet #1.

After a few rounds of CPR, we actually get a pulse and BP back, without any pesky v-tach or v-fib that would trigger the therapeutic hypothermia protocol.  However, as the minutes ticked buy, my pt's pulse went from tachy to brady and the BP went from normal to....wait, there isn't one!

Begin CPR Data Sheet #2.

After reviving the patient for a second time, I remarked to the ED Attending, ""We're going to be doing this again.""  This is because I could already see the pattern: the patient's VS were being maintained by the code drugs, and after they wore off the patient crashed.

By now, the family had started to arrive.  Department policy is that a family member is allowed to observe codes and other intensive interventions; actual practice is that they're generally not brought back.  However, after the prophesied appearance of CPR Data Sheet #3, the ED Attending went out to talk to the next of kin to explain that the patient was trying his darnest to die, and that each time through the cycle made the patient's prognosis worse.

With their blessing, there was no more charting on the patient after CPR Data Sheet #4.

In the immediate aftermath of the final round of CPR, we realized that we'd never gotten the temperature of the patient when they were first brought in, having stopped at ""Crap, no pulse!""  We whip out the rectal thermometer and found the remains to be hyperthermic...at 107.9°F!  Not only was he dead, he was also toast.  Literally.

Now that the pt had been pronounced, death care began.  Since Cook County got a new (and apparently competent, for a change) Medical Examiner, the ME's office wants all interventions (foleys, ET tubes, IV lines, etc) in place at the time of death left intact on the patient; I wasn't sure whether or not this patient would be an ME's case, so we didn't d/c anything.

Regarding another commenter's thoughts on leaving foleys and the like in: the culture in the community surrounding my hospital is that, following a death, the deceased's family (out to second cousins, I swear) all descend upon the hospital and insist on seeing the body, with at least three family members wailing and generally making a scene.  Because the body will be viewed near-immediately rather than at a wake later in the week, we try to make the body look generally presentable if it's not an ME's case- d/c obvious interventions, hide the body bag under the sheet beneath the pt until the family's done viewing, place another clean sheet over the pt, etc.

The problem with this particular body, though, is that it was 500+lbs, and possibly an ME's case.  As getting enough manpower to maneuver that large a corpse is hard to muster in an ED on even a light night, it was unanimously decided by the three techs and myself (since I'm a believer in pitching in to help my techs with the shittiest of work) that the patient would be going straight into the body bag, and we'd do our best to hide the bag with the sheet when the family came to view the body.

If you've never had to move a morbidly obese corpse, you do not truly understand the meaning of the term *dead weight*.   There was a lot of awkward and incredulous snickering and giggling amongst the four of us as we manhandled the corpse onto/into the body bag over the course of about 20 minutes, as making light of the situation was the only emotional response which was remotely productive at the time.  The snickering only increased when we got the corpse onto the body bag...and realized we'd misaligned it, and had to shift the bag under the corpse.

Once we'd move'd the half-bagged corpse on its cart to the Decon Room (which is where we put bodies during the impromptu wake that invariably happens, which our hospital doesn't get paid for), I called the Tissue Bank and the ME's Office, neither of which wanted the patient.  I then called the police, who sent an officer to do their paperwork, and who as also rather helpful in rounding up information like the patient's Attending Physician, whose answering service I was able to contact in order to get him/her/it to come in and sign the death certificate sometime not the middle of the night.

Thankfully, before Security had to take the patient to the morgue (which requires transferring the body onto and off of a metal gurney obviously not made for persons of size, something Security wanted to avoid doing with this corpse), the funeral director for the patient's family showed up, so that the body could go straight to the funeral parlor and not linger any more in the department.

I think that covers all of your points.  Any questions?

Remember Google's free [automated directory enquiries service](http://venturebeat.com/2010/10/08/google-411-shut-down/) that everyone wondered about (""why would they do that?  What's the benefit?  Where's the business model?""), that they cleverly used to *quickly and effectively build a vast corpus of spoken word queries in a variety of accents, and to train the voice-recognition systems that subsequently made it into Google Voice and Android*... and then as soon as it was built, they shut down GOOG-411.

Now note how Ingress is specifically geared to:

&gt; Users can generate virtual energy needed to play the game by... traveling **walking paths**, like a real-world version of Pac-Man. Then they spend the energy going on missions around the world to “portals,” which are virtually associated with **public art, libraries and other widely accessible places**... **Outdoor physical activity is a big component of this**, though driving between locations isn’t banned

I.e., it's *very, very much* about walking places... while carrying a GPS-enabled mobile device with a camera and accelerometer and wi-fi and mobile data connection built into it... while running their app that can report whatever it wants back to their servers *and has to* for you to be able to play the game.

Players walk around footpaths and pedestrian routes that Google Maps currently doesn't cover well, and then as a reward they get to... walk around art installations, libraries and other large, pedestrian-only public areas.  All the time the game client is reporting back to Google their position, speed and the like, so Google gets to build a massive database of popular pedestrian-accessible areas and common routes between and around them.  It's genius.

I'd also be very surprised if Google didn't manage to factor in taking geotagged photos of these various locations into the game as mission objectives.  After all, if you've just managed to convince thousands or millions of people to build you a massive GPS-tagged pedestrian-accessible location and route database essentially for free, you'd have to be pretty stupid not to *also* get them to take geotagged photos and similar media for you while they do it.

(Edit: Fucking **hah** - [called it](http://support.google.com/ingress/answer/2808254?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=2799270)!)

Then whenever all of us were stuffs in a car at night and calming down Elephant Shell would play on, Tessellate would make us all try to act introspective.

Your six year old daughter might lose you for good.

Your six your old daughter might be exposed to things she ought not to be exposed to.

Your relationship with your girlfriend is broken, because you can't communicate and you can't come to an agreement about parenting.  Communication is a *key* element of any successful relationship, and you two aren't communicating.  If communication is busted, it's likely there are trust and possibly respect issues as well.

Hard truths:

1.  The daughter knows how to use sex to get what she wants.  She's setting up a sexual situation with you as a means of asserting control.  She doesn't need the sex to happen to have control, though.  She just needs for it to have been plausible - *which is already true*.  When she gets in a tight spot, she's going to point a finger at you and say you abused her.

2.  When she points a finger at you, her mother will side with *her*, not *you*.  This has happened more than once already, so you know I'm right.  Not only do *you* know I'm right.  The *daughter* knows I'm right, and that's the scariest part.  She's already in charge, and you're not.  Proof: She can walk through the house naked and you can't challenge her.

3.  With the mother and daughter both pointing a finger at you and you having no alibi whatsoever, you're either going to jail as a registered sex offender or you're going for a ride you'll never forget that will include losing your family, temporarily or permanently losing your daughter (depending on whether her mother is in the picture and could/would spin this with child services), ending up in the paper, and losing all of your money in legal fees - and that's if you're exonerated.

These young teenagers are pushing boundaries, testing limits, and trying to assert control.  Some of them lack the wisdom and life experience to understand that what they do can ruin lives.  A very small proportion are sociopaths who don't care.

Either way, **you and your six year old daughter are in the line of fire.  Get out, get out, get out, get out NOW.**.

Notes for critics:

-  My advice is extreme, because the situation is already too far gone and I've got red flags popping up all over the place.  The girl appears to be setting up, to me.  Setting up for what, I don't know, and I don't want OP to be around to find out.  She's already got him over a barrel and she already controls the house.  If he had even one thing going in his favor (the mother's trust, a united front, a working relationship, the daughter's respect, control of the house as a parent), I'd say he might be able to hash it out.  As it is, I'd run like hell.  Trying to fix this would be like trying to pick up poo from the clean end.

- This is not true for all stepfathers, because other stepfathers don't have a broken relationship with the mother and can present a united front to the children.  In this case, the balance of power has already tipped in the daughter's favor, and she rules the house.  This guy is hosed if he challenges her.

-  I don't think the daughter is necessarily a bad person.  Teenagers like to explore boundaries, and will do this sort of thing without understanding the consequences.  They'll also drive at 120 MPH and dive into shallow pools without understanding the consequence.  It's just an occupational hazard of being that age for some of them, and has to do with [brain development](http://www.ted.com/talks/sarah_jayne_blakemore_the_mysterious_workings_of_the_adolescent_brain.html), at least in part.

-  I absolutely agree that any allegations of sexual abuse ought to be taken seriously.  This is an indisuputable truth.  No victim of sexual abuse should ever be ignored or turned away.  It is an unfortunate side effect, though, that people who don't understand the seriousness of the situation can exploit this dynamic for personal gain, which is what's going on here.  I wish we lived in a world where we could have our cake and eat it too.  We don't.  OP needs to protect himself and his daughter first.

But here is my small perspective. 

&gt;How come Kurloz can take control of Meulin? And... why? I thought he loved her? Why would he manipulate her? Seemed... out of character for someone who seemed like somebody filled with deep regret... yet he bends her will to help Gamzee.

[1](http://i.imgur.com/tWiA1.png) [2](http://i.imgur.com/k97FZ.png) 

Now, remember who is telling us that Kurloz is supposedly ""undou8tedly devastated."" Areana is a very useful resource for collecting facts, but for some reason her personal conjectures are often misleading without being incorrect. 

A perfect example is that she calls the clown faith ""harmless superstition"" despite the fact that several people were killed and/or wounded over it. While true on the surface (the actual doctrine is probably harmless and stupid), the real threat isn't from the doctrine, it's from the raging psychopaths who believe it. 

This pattern couldn't be clearer when she says that Kurloz was devastated with deafening Meulin. I'm sure he was, it was probably very hard for him to bring pain to someone he loved, but it's implied elsewhere that that isn't why he sewed his mouth shut. 

[3](http://i.imgur.com/GCAFu.jpg)

He would have bitten his tongue just for thinking some motherfucking heresy, so what level of devotion would cause him to chew it off? What would drive him to take a needle and thread to his own face and lose the use of his mouth forever? The faith, obviously! There is a reason, as yet untold, for him sewing his mouth shut. However, we know it has to do with the nightmare. So what was it he saw that caused such a dramatic change? From someone in love and (moderately) happy to a devout lunatic? What was it that really caused him to take away his own power of speech? Is it a secret? As he said, secrets are his favorite things, ""the answers to riddles that no one ever asked!"" Unfortunately, all we have right now are theories and speculation. But as for your other question, ""How is he able to control Meulin?"" I may have already answered a bit.

We already know that he loved her once. The nightmare changed him, or it changed something. But that love he had for her probably didn't just die. It was most likely twisted. Convoluted and corrupted by the influence of the faith, in my guess. In my theory, Kurloz uses his chucklevoodoos to brainwash Meulin to protect her without having to give up his religion, it's probably a really good idea in his mind. Killing two birds with one stone and whatnot. Even though he is unable to love her like he used to, he still does his best to protect her even through the corrupting influence of his demonic faith.

True,mediaboy,,Not a mod. Honest.,"I wrote this out in the original comment, then realised it wasn't positive and you may not want to hear it. Hence relatively fast response.

The treatment is better than it used to be, but it can still make life hell. In the worst cases, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, combined with all kinds of drugs, will change a lot of things about the people you care about. They will be in pain, lots of it, and the longer it takes for the cancer to go away completely, the more likely it is that the pain can get to levels that just aren't manageable without drugs. They may lose their hair - it's a potential side effect of chemotherapy. Their bone structure may start to deteriorate.

When it starts to get like that, you start to be terrified. Even if the doctors say it's going to be alright - and they give everyone a rough guestimate of the likelihood of the treatment working (my mum went from 80% survival to 10% survival in the space of 4 years. The last time it came back, she got us together and told us that she would be dead within 12 months. She was right) - you still have irrational fears that it might not be. The first two times, the doctors told us we could probably relax. The third time they were more grim. The fourth time they told us to prepare for the worst. (I think it was three then one. It may have been two then one. This is 3-9 years ago, and I don't dwell on the past that much).

When they beat it, you feel safe. It's gone, you can relax. You no longer have Death looming his ever-cheery grin across your dinner table, sharing your food and standing next to you, hand-in-hand. At least, so you'd think. My parents shielded us from it to some degree, in some ways, but the doctors also told them, quite bluntly, that cancer was not that simple. Getting rid of it is not the simple thing that people would like it to be. It can come back, and you have to start looking more carefully. The faster it's noticed, the more likely it is to be non-fatal. Suddenly breaking into coughs, or getting a stomach bug, takes on a much more serious note. What if it's the first symptom of the far more serious reality of cancer returning?

She battled it on and off for several years, maintaining a senior management job in the NHS clinical libraries for the hospitals that helped to treat her and that she later died in. The running joke became that if not for the cancer, she would be running the NHS by now, and probably be doing a darn sight better than the people who ran it into quite so much debt. Coming from a council estate and the first in over a hundred years to get a degree in her family, her life story is, in some ways, inspirational. Certainly, she inspired me - as all good parents do - and I could go on at great length in the ways that, during illness, she supported me in all kinds of ways, and helped me to become the person I am today.

To cut a long story short, about nine years after her first diagnosis, she started coughing up blood over dinner, and died in hospital 24 hours later of a heommerage, surrounded by her family and dearly beloved of all kinds of people. There is nothing that the doctors could have done better in the circumstances, and we donate substantially to the cancer research funds and the cancer care funds any time we have the money or are doing anything for charity.

To speak of what happened after she died, my mother's death had me numb to the world for a few days. I rebound from emotional trauma somewhat easier than other people - I'm very good at compartmentalizing and just getting on with things - but for a few days I lay in bed and cried, and stared at my ceiling and let it sink in. She wasn't going to be coming in and cooking dinner, she wasn't going to be telling me to go and chase the girls (which were literally her last ever words to me), she wasn't going to be the terrifyingly accurate voice of reason who would stand between me and my father when we argued. 

Eventually a very close friend told me to come over to her house and that was the first time I left the house. She was the first person not to try to be sympathetic and just let things be normal between us. It was the start of a journey that I'm still travelling on today.

A few years on, it's not quite so bad. She's been gone just over three years (about three years and a month I think actually) and the tree we planted in her memory is still growing strongly. I still get the awkward moments from people that expect me to be an emotional wreck, and there are still very few people who will ever see just how much it affected me, and how much it still does affect me.

How can you deal with cancer, and the potential that they might not be here tomorrow? Make every moment that you spend with them an amazing one. Tell them that you love them, that you care for them. Get all the life advice you can from them, because the harsh reality of cancer is that even when they say it's gone they can't be certain. Share jokes and laughter with them. Spend time with them. Even small things - like going to the shops with them and helping to carry stuff around or in from the car - will be appreciated, and will help you to appreciate just what you have.


Introduce them to your friends, tell your closest friends what is going on. At times when the world is dark and you cannot see the light, it is nearly always friends who have turned up and taken my hand and led me back onto the road. It is the friends who have talked me away from the edges, metaphorical and literal, and the friends who have laughed and joked with me when I needed to get away from it all. I could not even begin to tell you just how much some of those friendships are valued, nor just how much I would do for them to repay them for their kindness. People sometimes say they would die for their friends. I would do it without a second thought if there was no other option. They guided me through the most difficult time of my life, and continue to help me through the bad patches to this day.

As for my mum, there are still moments when she walks alongside me, even now, telling me that something is wrong, or that she would disapprove. It sounds crazy, perhaps, but the people that you love never leave you, not really. Life moves on, but memories live forever.

They will stay with you to the end and beyond, for as long as you let them stand by your side to guide you.

And, for once, I am not going to put a tl;dr. I do not think I could sum this up in a way that would convey it properly without selling her short.

- [Productivity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_(linguistics\))

Additionally, it is commonly a requirement as part of being considered a language that this system of communication have the ability to become varied among isolated but genetically-identical populations, which aids in the argument that it is acquired through behaviour, not genetic inheritance. Although, it should be noted that [genetics plays a major role in the ability to have a language at all.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_grammar) And again, even that has been called into question in [the debate over higher primate cognitive similarities in their language abilities,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washoe_(chimpanzee\)) suggesting that the parameters we use to define language might be anthropocentric.

**TL;DR:** The parrots could theoretically communicate rudimentary ideas with each other in a *call system*, transmissible through learned behaviour with the ability to be sustained over several generations, and possibly become a unique set of calls between genetically similar parrot populations. However, it is highly unlikely to happen and would never qualify as an actual language.

True,mauxly,,,"OK, you've gotten a ton of advice and this is gonna be buried OP, but I hope you read this entire thing. I used to be your step daughter. I pulled the exact same shit. Well, not exact same, no diddlin' in a movie theater with guys I didn't know....but I was sexually/physically and emotionally abused at home and school and other places. The sexual abuse never occurred at home, so my family wouldn't have known. But I quickly determined that my sexuality was the only card I held. I knew that men wanted something from me, it was the only power that I had. And, I had feelings of lust, and a need for acceptance, especially from those that I respected and who seemed dismissive of me. This all eventually led me to try to subtly seduce a really inappropriate person. And it almost worked. Actually, it did work a little...I'll get to that. 

It wasn't a step dad. It was my big brother's best friend, nearly married best friend, nearly married best friend who was almost 30 while I was only 12. 

My brother took me in because my mother was super abusive and neglectful. I immediately turned my sex beam onto his roommate/best buddy.

I knew that straight up coming onto him wasn't going to work. So I made sure to wear sexy underwear and 'fall asleep' on the couch with my skirt 'accidently' hiked up (like it could have happened in my sleep) so that he could see some indiscretion. Not full ass/beaver, but something I knew he'd notice. I'd also make sure that I was coming out of the bathroom/shower right when he was around and scoot to my bedroom in a towel that barely covered me. 

This guy, he knew something was up. Not sure if he knew how intentional it was on my part, but he wasn't an evil predator pedophile or anything, so he'd avoid me. The more he tried to avoid, the more I made sure he saw. 

Then, one night, he came home from the bars drunk off his ass and went into his bedroom. I built up the courage and crawled into bed with him. Shit went down. We made out, heavy sexual forplay, but...thank god for both of us...right before he entered me he asked if I'd ever done this before. My answer, was, truthfully, ""NO"". Despite the sexual abuse and the promescuity, I'd never gone all the way. Some logic, some reason, at that moment snapped in him and he said that I had to leave. 

The next day I was sad and hurt. He spoke one sentence to me before moving out, ""I...I'm so sorry that happened...I....you are too young...oh god...oh god..."" He packed his shit and was gone. My brother was really upset because his friend had just cut him off without telling him why.

I never told anyone. For a few years my young mind was pissed that he'd rejected me. But I can honestly tell you that if we'd actually had sex, and he didn't make me his girlfriend, I would have been a million times more pissed and I don't know what my young/demented little head would have prompted me to do. 

The whole fucking thing was sick and unfortunate. I don't blame myself too much because I was a stupid child who was megafucked up emotionally. But I have a really hard time blaming him, well, at least now...

I know, I know that this all sounds like the scene from American Beauty or something, but it's real it happened. 

I guess I wanted you to hear it from the other side. She might actually have feelings for you, at the very least, really inappropriate lust. 

And if there is a chance from hell that you are battling your own urges....you are in deep shit. You can't win. 

So I'm going to agree with the top comments in this thread, ""GET THE FUCK OUT OF THERE NOW!!!!"" But not because I think she's evil and trying to set you up, more likely it's that she's got power she's not nearly mature enough to control right now. And if you do, your fucked, if you don't, your fucked, and if you sort of do...your fucked.

True,deruch,,,"Qassams are the only ones locally produced in Gaza, as far as I know. these are low tech munitions that have a range of between 4-7km.  Basically just very large pipe bombs with an attached rocket motor.  In fact many of them never even make it into Israeli territory but land near the border but still in Gaza.  I've seen figures listed for those costing between $400-1000 a piece to manufacture.  The larger rockets/missiles with much longer ranges, like the Grad/Katushya or Fajr, are smuggled in to Gaza generally through Egypt/Sinai.  Though some interceptions of arms shipments via container ship have been highly publicized, e.g. the Karine A in 2002 and Victoria in 2011.  There's a lot of speculation that the recent explosions at a Khartoum munitions factory were a result of long-distance Israeli airstrikes on shipping containers there (Israel has not commented on the accusations).  It being part of a Iran-Sudan-Egypt-Sinai-Gaza smuggling route.

But, whether locally produced or shipped/smuggled in the truth is that almost all of weaponry fired out of Gaza is paid for by third parties.  Mainly states like Iran and Syria, but also certain ""Islamic charities"" that act as fronts for terror fundraising.  Iraq under Hussein was also a large supporter of various Palestinian terror organizations, but I would imagine that's changed some since the US invasion/occupation.  


**TL;DR- The smallest variety, the Qassam, cost between $400-1000, and are made locally.  The rest come from Iran via tunnels from Egypt/Sinai, and I don't know that they cost them anything because Iran makes them and gives the munitions.  As well as the explosives for the Qassams.**

They would fly about 10-20 feet down, land on the rotting corpses of other baby girls. Hopefully they would die on impact, but if not they would starve, or bleed out, or get a disease from the other rotting babies in the basement.

True,DrStephenPoop,,,"Why would you want to be friends with someone who terrifies you? The answer is you probably don't, and you already know this. So why tell him you're fine being friends?

Half the threads on this sub I just want grip the OP by the shoulders and shout: ""IT IS NOT YOUR OBLIGATION TO BE NICE!! STOP IT!""

(Granted that would itself be a creepy thing to do!)

But honestly, STOP BEING NICE.

This guy terrifies you. Why not say something like: ""When you continue to text me like that, I feel terrified because my need for personal space feels threatened. My life will be better if you stop trying to get in touch with me.""

This is an example something called ""nonviolent communication"" which breaks down to:

1. State the behavior you don't like without making a value judgement of the other person. 

2. State your feelings that follow from the behavior.

3. State your need that causes the feeling. (All feelings are caused by our own needs most directly, not by other's actions.)

4. Tell them a behavior that you'd rather have them do, stating that your life will be better if they do it.

Why this works is because:

1. You're not arguing that they are bad (you do not make value judgments). No one will listen if you start by judging them. 

2. Because you are mostly making I-statements, you give them nothing to argue against: they can't say they didn't text you, they can't tell you you're not feeling what you feel, they can't tell you what your needs are, and they can't tell you what will make your life better. (Of course, this falls apart if they are truly crazy or unreasonable, eg, ""You don't feel terrified! I know what you need!"")

3. At the end you are stating what would make your life better rather than asking for something. Asking for things puts them in control. Stating your needs keeps you in control.

4. Don't allow them to argue or bargain. Just keep stating your needs and feelings. 

GOOD LUCK! And if you want to learn more about nonviolent communication, google it or read the book ""speak peace in a world of conflict"".

That quote is a load of malarkey. Utter hogwash.

1. MP3s are infinite goods with 0 marginal cost to production of new units. Coffee is not.

2. Absolutely no one is saying that artists shouldn't make money. That is a straw man. Similarly, no one is saying that music, per se, should be free. Simply sitting down and listening to a song - that makes sense for it to be free. However, I'm willing to pay for all sorts of stuff, including going to see shows, having special experiences, merchandise, custom goods, etc. 

3. Musicians have made a living for the entire history of humanity - all before recorded music. There was about a 20 minute historical period, from ~1930-1990, in which a *tiny* percentage of musicians managed to make absurdly huge amounts of money because of distribution through recording. That was never the norm. We are returning to the norm, which is that artists have to go out and play shows all the time to make a living. Also, guess what? Many very wealthy people were minted selling whale oil, typewriters, and horse drawn carriages. Technology changes industries. You either adapt, or you get left behind. 

4. The vast majority of artists always have, and always will have, make their living from touring. Accordingly, for the average artist to defend the elaborate (and increasingly technologically dated) copyright and distribution system in the hope they one day make it big is the equivalent of a middle class job-holder voting for tax breaks for the 1% - the odds are exceedingly low that this will ever, ever apply to them, and, in doing so, they are actively fucking up their own lives. The most important thing for artists is *notoriety* and the worst thing is *obscurity.* If you can get a thousands of people to hear your music without having to pay for it - and let's be serious, I'm not paying for music from someone I've never heard before - then you vastly increase the chances of these people showing up to your gigs. 

This is all quite simple and I'm really pretty sick of it. 

**Tl;dr Music is not a tangible good, artists absolutely do deserve to earn a living, historically, and currently, that is best done by performing, not relying on a historical, technologically enabled oddity.**

Edit: wrote this in response to someone below. I think it is worth adding to the above post.

I understand your frustrations, and you are putting a lot of words into my mouth.

I don't think that music, books, movies or tv shows *must* be free - but that is how a lot of them are going to get consumed. I still pay for all of the above when I want ease of access on my iPad or so I can play it in HD on my TV, or so I can play it on my iPod in the car. However, I rely very heavily on free media when I'm at my computer. The point is that a multi-tiered approach needs to be taken - in some circumstances, music should be free, in others, you pay for it. For instance, when I buy an mp3 vs. listening to a song through grooveshark. They are different experiences with different value propositions. I am 100% comfortable with ""free"" coming with less rights and less ownership than when you pay for content.

The problem is that copyright maximalists insist that *all* enjoyment of media *must be paid for at all times.* **That** is an absurd position. It's unreasonable. And 'pirates' - at least the smart ones - are not saying that everything should be free. No, the key word is **freemium.** I still spend thousands of bucks a year on media, by going to movies, by purchasing them through amazon, by buying mp3s. However, I sample even *more* media, for free, constantly, via pandora, hulu, youtube, grooveshark, the radio, on other people's televisions, by borrowing books from friends and libraries... the list goes on. Importantly, however, note, **none of the activity I am describing violates copyright law.** In fact, quite on the contrary, open source movements, tiered licensing based on granting different copyright rights, i.e., pandora being free but itunes/amazon being paid -- these are only defensible by the **application** of currently existing copyright law. I'm not saying throw it all out the window - I am saying use it creatively, and stop insisting that maximalist application of copyright law is the only proper way. Copyright law is like a swiss army knife, and maximalists insist with religious fervor that to use this swiss army knife as anything than a blunt object is a sin. It's just sad. And obviously naive and shortsighted to anyone who actually knows the nuances of copyright law.

And yes, I still insist, actually, the period of paying monopoly prices for distributed music *was* a technological oddity, because for the last say, 10,000 years, there was no distribution, for 50 years there was **analog** distribution, and for the **rest of time** there will be **digital** distribution. The technological oddity was that I could buy a recording that was unique and not reproducible without effort and without degradation. Digitalization has changed this forever. So in 200 years, in 500 years, in 1000 years, the brief period in humanity where people *made money by selling individual copies of files because it was impossible to get files in any other way* is going to look as strange as a world economy based on tulip speculation or the global energy industry fueled by whale blubber-- and just as historically brief. Yet, at the height of the whaling industry and at the height of tulip speculation, people viewed these economic establishments as fundamentally necessary, unthinkably irreplaceable and quite obviously natural and permanent.

I do. We need a social movement towards obesity the same way we've had against cigarettes. You're socially shamed for the choices you make that are actively killing you. There are no slower metabolisms/faster metabolisms (the largest difference is about 200 calories per day), there is no lack of time for exercise (do push-ups every time you're in the bathroom), and there is no healthy food is too expensive (maybe organic, but not your typical, fresh vegetables).

The comparison between cigarettes and obesity isn't quite a good because second-hand fat doesn't kill anyone. However, it *may* increase health care costs for everyone.

True,BillyBuckets,,,"From the source material:
&gt; While most humans are clearly “behavioral” omnivores, the question still remains as to whether humans are anatomically suited for a diet that includes animal as well as plant foods.

No, this is not in question. We are suited to eat meat. When we eat meat, we get nutrients from it, a benefit which far outweighs the cost of eating meat. Thus, we are suited for it. This isn't hard.

&gt; The masseter and pterygoid muscles hold the mandible in a sling-like arrangement and swing the jaw from side-to-side. Accordingly, the lower jaw of plant-eating mammals has a pronounced sideways motion when eating. This lateral movement is necessary for the grinding motion of chewing.

We don't really grind side-to-side like dedicated grazers. Our incisors and canines prevent it (try it right now: separate your molars a tiny bit and see how much lateral movement you have). An herbivore like a [horse](http://www.britannica.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/horse2.jpg) doesn't have this problem, as the incisors/canines don't interlock as arcs at the front of the jaw.

&gt; [In herbivores] The temporalis muscle is small and of minor importance.

haha. [Gorillas are herbivores](http://www.flickr.com/photos/24704473@N07/5880477367/), you big dope. What muscle do you think goes up in that pocket on the side of the skull? The *giant* temporalis.

&gt; Many of these herbivores increase
the sophistication and efficiency of their GI tracts by including carbohydrate-digesting enzymes in their saliva.

common misconception. Salivary amylase doesn't noticeably affect digestion. It prevents the buildup of insoluble polysaccharides in the mouth, which would otherwise cause tooth decay.

&gt; Bears have not, however, adopted the flattened, blunt nails seen in most herbivores and retain the elongated, pointed claws of a carnivore .... An animal which captures, kills and eats prey must have the physical equipment which makes predation practical and efficient.

Sure, but what about non-predatory meat eaters? Bears can hunt and kill prey (even deer!) and thus have claws and teeth capable of subduing large, living animals. Other omnivores (many rodents, raccoons, skunks, etc) do not have ""killing bodies"". They scavenge, eat defenseless young of other animals, or eat invertebrates.

&gt; The [Human]  canines are neither serrated nor conical, but are flattened, blunt and small and function Like incisors.

They are not quite pointy, not quite flat. They are thicker, so they can take more lateral stress than incisors and shear better than molars. Give someone a big piece of tough jerky. What will they almost always do? Put it in the side of their mouth, bite with the canines, and rip it away with the hand. Our canines still tear well. They aren't made for punching holes in the neck vessels of prey, but they aren't reduced to grinding surfaces or missing altogether. They're between a typical herbivore's and carnivore's. ...shocking...

&gt; Human saliva contains the carbohydrate-digesting enzyme, salivary amylase. This enzyme is *responsible for the majority of starch digestion.* [emphasis added]

As above, this is demonstrably FALSE. Our pancreatic amylases do that work. Salivary amylase is destroyed by the stomach proteases. If the claim was true, potatoes would dissolve in our mouths. They don't. They dissolve in our intestines.

&gt; There is also extensive bacterial fermentation of fibrous plant materials, with the production and absorption of significant amounts of food energy

Citation needed. I am not medically aware of any substantial caloric gain from the large intestine contents. By the mid-ilium, most of our nutrient absorption is done. vitamin B12, bile, and a few bacterial products are absorbed in the distal small gut, but the colon is pretty much there for water balance.

&gt; In conclusion, we see that human beings have the gastrointestinal tract structure of a “committed” herbivore. Humankind does not show the mixed structural features one expects and finds in anatomical omnivores such as bears and raccoons.

LOL. He just discounts the evidence that we ARE a hybrid form between dedicated carnivores and herbivores. We can't digest cellulose unlike the grazers. We can't bring down large prey with only our bodies like apex predators. We have teeth both for shearing and for grinding. We have reasonably close herbivorous cousins (gorillas) with vastly different anatomies suited for fibrous vegetable food. We have close omnivorous cousins (chimpanzees and bonobos) with dentition and GI tracts much like ours. 

TL;DR: the source material ignores all of the omnivorous adaptations we have, falsely dichotomizes the world into predators and herbivores, and is flat out wrong many times. It's pure bullshit. The guy is cherrypicking and distorting evidence to support his beliefs much like a creationist.

True,MittRomneysCampaign,,,"Most people who aren't staunchly right-wing are pro-feminism by default until they become exposed to feminist subcultures or more intense feminist groups on the internet. When  you start hearing that rape jokes trivialize rape because patriarchy and the kyriarchal elements of society prevent ""dick"" from being a ""gendered slur"" but saying ""she's a bitch"" contributes to someone's oppression, you realize the rabbit hole goes a lot deeper than you initially thought.

Truthfully, I had *rarely* heard anything critical of feminism on reddit prior to SRS showing up. I was banned from /r/MensRights once by kloo2yoo for saying that feminism is compatible with MRAdvocacy, and this caused something of a controversy because a lot of people turned against kloo2yoo for this. Until then, most of the feminism reddit saw was relatively moderate feminism on places like /r/TwoXChromosomes. SRS completely changed the way reddit views feminism.

As a side note, I think SRS's popularity is symptomatic of larger militant feminism resurgence on the internet. SRS's arrival on reddit coincided with Rebecca Watson's ""elevatorgate"", the Julian Assange rape accusation, and the popularity of blogs like I Blame The Patriarchy / Shakesville. There are parallels here: few people in the atheist community had strong opinions on feminism one way or the other prior to Elevatorgate, but after these events a lot of people started to take sides, usually against feminists.

True,tameimpalea,,,"&gt;But I do know what your face looks like, and if you spend one more second of your life worrying about it you're acting like a vain, self absorbed, narcissistic, attention seeking, little shit. And since that's the problem, not your actual looks, you'll get further focusing on why you hunger for affirmation so much rather than worrying that your very pretty, young, white, healthy, privileged face isn't pretty enough.

I wish you hadn't of gotten downvoted for this, because it's completely valid; I myself had a similarly worded monologue in my mind after I realized, or rather questioned, why I was trying to hide.  I have come up with somewhat of an answer, since I believe the reason will expand in understanding as time keeps going:

I am an only child.  That means for 18 years of my life, I lived with only my mom and my dad.  I don't know if there is a legitimate correlation between only children who don't go to daycare and children with siblings or daycare, but I believe that being the only child in the house with parents constantly either monitoring you, talking to you, or talking **about** you, can give you a warped idea of socialization.  

When I went to pre-school, the amount of children overwhelmed me initially, but that feeling quickly died down and was replaced with a similar desire to one I had at home with my parents: **I want to be liked.** However, I didn't care about ""everyone"", only the children whom I wanted to be friends with.  It's kind of funny, actually, how that by proxy still became everyone, because who knows who I realize I like?  With 7 billion people in the world the possibilities are literally endless. (but only because we haven't discovered such a high number yet.)

So why did I somehow how connect the dots of my own understanding to create the idea that how I looked played the main role in having people like you?  I'm not exactly sure why, but maybe a middle school teacher will discover the meaning while reading my auto-biography, if that is in my future.  I do have wobbly theories of why that is connected with my nurture.  One is an idea that I had observed that it seemed I had to do so little for my parents to dote on me.  There wasn't much practice for me to learn how to receive affection from peers and I had only so much to reason with as a 4 year old.  My parents had to be seeing something to give me so much love, what were they seeing?  All I saw was who stared at me from the mirror.  I was not friendless during my time in pre-school, or any time after that, so there was something else being seen, but unfortunately (and this applies to everyone on earth) it is not reflective.  Instead, you have to be reflective to see it, but I can never use the adjective ""clear"" to describe the result, because no human ever had or ever will possess all understanding in their self.  ""Smudged"", maybe.  Maybe.

To avoid making this a full page of notes after a session, I will try to sum this up as best and as short as I can, though my thoughts about this could fill up a good portion of a notepad.  The idea of how I looked (as well as how I acted, but not nearly as bad) kept manifesting itself as I got older.  At 13 I developed an eating disorder.  At 15 I was in remission.  I had not been able to let myself be cured, because what I thought was so real to me.  I stopped the behaviors, but not the mentality.  I had looked at myself in the mirror, and based on my personal preference of the definition of attractiveness, decided I wasn't good enough.

The only friends I have ever made have been pursuer in the relationship, since I was shy and timid and did not usually approach others.  After I graduated high school and left all of my girlfriends, I only made new guy friends, because they started talking to me.  Yes, I'm the dreaded, mystical creature called ""friend zoner"", but here is a possible side to the story:  

the girl would love to make friends and meet people, but her confidence won't let her initiate anything.  So, when someone comes up and starts talking to her, she latches on to that as making friends.  She was never a flirter anyway.  

I can't think of a time I made a friend by taking the first action.  I'm sure there are because I have random bold spurts (let's hope this one is permanent).  Drugs help.  I didn't say that.  I totally said that because it's the truth and I thank god I don't have an attention span long enough to ever be psychologically addicted to something.  Oh, well, you know, I am actually high typing this and have forgotten my point.  I do not feel like re-reading.  I'm going to cut this **super** short now:

I grew up with the idea that the world spun around me, possibly because at home the sun did actually spin around me.  Everyone was either talking to me or talking about me.  I was constantly being judged.  These are the illusions in my head.  They has made me paranoid, silent, and obsessive, because if I thought I looked good, everyone thought I looked good.  It's so stupid.  It's so very stupid.  What kind of life can I experience if I come out of my fetal position?

I realize this.  I am working on it.  Already I feel better, because I'm usually wondering if my roommates are judging me when I stay home on weekend nights, but right now I don't give a fuck.  Do you know why?  Because they have better things to think of and talk about then a girl they don't know very well.  And I can enjoy my alone time just that much more because dammit I like being in my room, doing whatever I want to do.  No paranoia while in session?  It's particularly nice when a smoke is involved.

I'm really happy I am finally able to change this because I see this for what it truly is, and I truly appreciate the encouragement I've received; I was not expecting so much.  To the comments about my appearance, and I'll type this, while biting my tongue because of lack in humility:

I am cute.  Thanks.

True,Brian,userflair,atheist,"As others have mentioned, you want ""strong atheist"" here, rather than anti-theist.  There's also the matter of what you mean by ""All Gods"" - ie do you mean ""any definition we might attach to the word 'God'"", meaning I can't disprove it because if we call this pencil ""God"", then there's a God who exists.  Similarly with naturalistic pantheism which attaches the label to ""the universe"", which certainly exists.  Or do you mean ""The general monotheistic creator God concept, but without religious specifics like omnipoence etc"" - ie the basic deist God with nothing else asserted.

I'm assuming the latter, since this is what I'm referring to with the ""God"" concept.  To spell this out, I mean by this something like:

  1. A powerful being (not neccessarily triple omni-)
  2. Who is a psychological entity of some kind.  (Ie. this is some kind of *person*, not a natural force, law of physics or 'the universe itself')
  3. Who created everything else.

The argument against this is a fairly straightforward one:

 1. We have no evidence for such a being
 2. Therefore it's an unsupported guess.
 3. There are vastly fewer things we can conceive of that exist than that we can conceive of.  (Ie. most random guesses are going to be wrong)
 4. Therefore this guess is pretty unlikely.

I'd refine this a bit by pointing out that the likelihood of being wrong is dependant on how *specific* the guess is.  If guess that I'll meet a man called Joe tomorrow, that's more likely than ""I'll meet a red-haired man called Joe tomorrow"".  The notion of a psychological *being* however, is a really specific property to ascribe to ""the first thing"".  Imagine I'd made the assertion that ""The thing that created everything else was pink with yellow spots, and shaped like a 3"" tall teapot"".  That seems a pretty unlikely guess.  But *person* is an even more complex assertion - to describe what we really *mean* by a person, you need vastly more complex properties than those simple ones of colour and size.  It's thus a vastly less likely probability, and so one I's conclude is almost certainly false, unless some evidence is presented for it.  I don't see sufficient evidence to elevate this likelihood out of such an unlikely starting position of ""Having randomly guessed a really specific property about the nature of first thing and been correct by pure chance"".

True,UnreasonablyHostile,,,"The Welch et al. paper found that they couldn't actually prove beyond a doubt that the raise in the minimum wage accounted for teen unemployment, considering that teen unemployment did not rise in every case and:

&gt; It follows that the cases in which employment responses are not surprising [ie. where employment fell] ought also to be considered for alternative causes. The most likely candidate is the **recession that began in 1990**. (emphasis added)

Dube et al. is a response to Neumark, whose data is used on the Welch et al. paper; I did not use Neumark's 1992 paper because:

&gt; Neumark and Wascher (1992) are at odds with the rest of the new research in that they find a significant negative effect of increases in the minimum on teenage employment

This, from Currie and Fallick, whose study was then considered as part of Zavodny (1997) who found:

&gt; Individual-level employment regression results suggest that affected teens are about 2.2% less likely to remain employed a year later than unaffected teens; however, low-wage workers are equally less likely to remain employed than high-wage workers during periods when the minimum wage did not change.

2.2%, which is fairly similar to the range suggested by Brown; but also:

&gt; Low-wage teen workers are less likely to remain employed than high-wage teens regardless of whether the minimum wage rises, *and real minimum wage increases do not appear to have a disemployment effect among low-wage workers.* (emphasis added)

Which is important because income at the 10th percentile tracks with the minimum wage: if minimum wage increases have no disemployment effect at the bottom of the wage distribution *except for a controversial 2% change in teen employment*, then changes in the minimum wage are likely to be a net positive.

Maybe you should have spent your two minutes of searching *also reading* papers.

True,BillyBuckets,,,"I'm sure non-smokers know *why* smoking is so addictive, but this might help them understand what it's like to be physically addicted to nicotine:

Our brains, and more specifically our brainstems, have control over our trends of higher function in ways you might not notice much. Normally, if you're thirsty, you get up and get a drink. You don't think about it much but you do it. The water you drink isn't anything special and you don't down it too fast. 

But what if you just spent a day out in the hot sun doing yard work? You come inside and you think immediately about getting a glass. You down a glass full of water in huge gulps. The water feels *good* even though there's nothing special about it. You fill the glass again. You take it down in a few seconds. Your belly feels awkwardly distended and perhaps even a bit uncomfortable right under your center-left ribcage, but you feel so relieved. Drinking all that water might even make you feel sorta ill for a bit, but you're sooooo glad you did it.

If you take this to an even further extreme, say you went a day or more without water and were becoming dangerously dehydrated, your water seeking behavior would become overwhelming. A parched person will drink almost anything (including toilet water^seeMyNoteBelow). Part of the brain, specifically the hypothalamus, is hooked into the blood supply to in a way that lets it sample the salt content, which gets really high when the body is dehydrated. In response to life-threatening dehydration, the hypothalamus will cause the ""higher"" parts of the brain responsible for our actions to engage in activities that are likely to result in water at almost any cost. Your brain associates the sensation of drinking with the feeling of relief in the high-thirst state. This is a reinforcement loop.

Now back to cigs. Nicotine hits receptors all over the central nervous system. A smoker's brain has literally been reconfigured to circulating nicotine much higher than that of a normal person. The reward networks, the attention-arousing networks, etc. These are the networks that guide our higher behaviors. To a smoker, a cigarette can give the same relief after a two-hour flight as a glass of water will give you after a day of yard work, or a rich meal will give you after a 36-hour fast. And nicotine is almost perfect at hitting the receptors, and cigarettes are a VERY rapid way of delivering it. 

So, non-smokers, think of it this way: trying to quit smoking cold-turkey feels about the same as trying to stop drinking (water) cold-turkey. This is why Westerners keep doing it: they get roped into trying it enough (marketing), their brains demand it from then on. A moment of weakness can lead to a lifetime of vice.

Does that do it justice, theorial?


my note on thirst: certain psychiatric pathologies, e.g. schizophrenia, can present with *polydipsia*, a term for when a person seeks and drinks water to a pathological level. Patients with uncontrolled polydipsia cannot be allowed into a normal bathroom alone, as they will resort to drinking toilet water. They simply cannot resist the urge to drink.",0,1353197700,,0,False,1,c72yrwb,t3_13cnjq,t1_c72yrwb,t1_c72xgcb,,1430433708,500,False,technology,t5_2qh16,500
True,smokeinhiseyes,,,"When I was younger I did the vagabond thing for a number of years. I travelled a lot, loved it, and eventually did decide to settle down in one spot (where my family is). I started my own business and love the work I do and though periodically I miss that wandering life, I don't ever think I'd trade what I have now for what I had then. I love that I've done a bit of both in my life.

I remember once in particular, I was about twenty two at the time, I was on an extended back-packing trip on the Pacific Crest trail in the Glacier Peaks Wilderness area in Washington state. I had failed to acclimate and had a bad pair of boots (which lead to some really swollen feet and the eventual loss of three toenails). To top it off I got sick. I was with a couple of seasoned backpackers at the time who really made sure I was doing okay as we pushed on, but despite the beauty of the PCT I was suffering a great deal through about the first four or five days of the trip. 

Anyway, I remember coming to the top of this place called Red's Pass and looking out over the mountains as far as I could see in any direction and thinking to myself about how miserable I was despite being surrounded by such beauty. I had sort of an epiphany at that moment in the midst of my fever and realized that so much of my travelling hadn't really been about finding beauty or adventure as much as it was about escaping some vague shapeless feeling of hopelessness or misery. I realized that I was somehow more defined by what I was running from than by what I was looking for.

Ultimately, the asshole in my life that I was trying to escape was really me, and of course, everywhere I went, there I was. What poisoned my experiences wasn't so much where I was, who I was with, or what I was doing, but rather who I was being in my experiences. At that moment, on top of a mountain in the middle of no-where I realized that if I wanted to be satisfied that somehow that satisfaction had to come from me, rather than the location. Ironically, I'm not sure whether or not I ever would have recognized that without having left home. Maybe somehow leaving it all was necessary to see that it didn't matter where I was.

I didn't stop travelling for a number years after that (and I still like to get out of town on a regular basis), but something changed for me after that experience at Red's Pass. After that I stopped holding the world, others, or my circumstances responsible for my experience of the world and decided that if I wanted to be reasonably happy that it was going to have to be something I create and maintain myself, without waiting for the world to contribute.

One of the most amazing misconceptions I think we all hold, is the idea of the importance of safety. I'm not suggesting that we should throw caution to the wind and risk our lives or livelihood doing stupid things, but I think to a certain degree we have a tendency to seek ""feeling"" safe as an alternative to trying out new things. We hold back because we're afraid of what might happen if we do. We like the appearance of safety created by things like working for a salary, staying in one place, keeping the same friends, and doing the same activities. 

There's a risk in staying safe sometimes too though. Firstly, as someone who owns a business, our profits fluctuate and change all the time. The people I employ may not feel it (because their paycheck is the same no matter what happens), but I know as the owner that it's always uncertain. Their feelings of safety are created by the apparent consistency in what we do day in and day out. What many of us take for granted as safe or guaranteed is actually neither. The world can change fast and the career we think is solid today might not be there tomorrow and being lulled into a false sense of security we may find ourselves unprepared for change when life forces it upon us.

There's an emotional risk too. Especially if you feel like you're sacrificing a dream for that feeling of safety. This is the risk of hating ourselves or our lives because we failed to act when we had the chance, when failure might not have been as catastrophic because we were younger and could bounce back a little easier.

From an even wider perspective, we do a great deal to insulate ourselves from suffering (and to some degree death itself) but no matter what course of action you take, you aren't immune from either suffering or death. Unless you happen to have the fortune of dying quickly in an accident, your death is quite likely to be a slow process which includes health that fades over time and pain and suffering that increases. Even the greatest wealth, insurance, and job are no insulation (in the long run) against the conditions of being human. 

So then, I think on some level the question we have to ask ourselves is, when I am dying and looking back on my life (wherever or whenever that may occur), what do I want to be able to say about it? Is playing playing it safe okay for me? Will I regret not having acted? What can I live with and what am I unwilling to live with?

Ultimately, just like the experience at Red's Pass though, I don't think it matters what we do. I think what matters is who we get to be when we're doing it. Was I filled up by me life, even when I made shitty choices, or did I cower and make great choices but remain miserable in the process? Did I like who I was in all of this?

What decision do you most want to make in your life, even if you were to fail doing it? Can you be someone you like and respect even if the circumstances of your life go in a direction you didn't anticipate, plan, or want?

I don't guess there's any right answers to any of these questions, or that there's a right choice to make, but maybe we can at least achieve some level of satisfaction in how we answer them.

True,Thehealeroftri,,,"When I was in love with my now wife of 7 years me and her father didn't exactly get along very well.

He was Mormon.  I was Atheist.  He was Pro life.  I was pro choice.  He liked Battlefield.  I liked Call of Duty.  (OK, not that last one)  and etc.

But anyways,  me and his daughter had been together for 3 years when I finally decided that I wanted to marry her.  I knew that her father might reject me, but I had to try anyways.  Besides, I wasn't asking if I could marry his daughter, I was going to do that anyways, I was asking if he wanted to be a part of our family.

I came over to his house unannounced and awkwardly brought it up after a short conversation about something, I don't remember what.  Of course, I was rejected.  After that I was sent out of his house and asked to never go near his daughter again because he didn't like me.

I was more heartbroken than I thought I'd be.  I expected his answer, but didn't fully realize how much it would affect me.

A few days went by with me mourning, I'd already bought a ring and was going to propose and then tell her what her father thought of me proposing.  I was worried she'd get upset and decide that her father was more important than me so I was extremely nervous beforehand.  

I planned to take her on a date skiing and then propose to her at the top of the ski lift, where there was a beautiful view of the valley we lived in.  

I went to her house to pick her up, praying that her father wasn't home at the moment.  I walked up to the door, knocked, and unfortunately... her father opened the door.

""Umm, hi, sir.  Is (name) here?  We were going to go on a date.""

He sternly looked at me, his facial expression didn't change for a few seconds (which felt like several minutes...).  Then he said, ""Yeah, she's here.  I need to talk to you though.""

Great.  What's he going to say?

I'm invited into their house and saw his daughter sitting on a chair putting make up on.  She looked at me, smiled, and I told her to wait out in the car for a moment because her father wanted to talk to me.  

Her facial expression went from smiling and happy to, ""Oh, shit.  What happened?""

She agreed and went outside to my car.

When her father saw she was in the car, he looked at me and said, ""I've been thinking about what you asked me awhile back.  About.. marrying her.""

""Yes, sir.  I really love your daughter and I'd like to marry her.""

I was surprised because I expected him to be angry about me arriving at his house. But he seemed... sad, instead.

He looked at me and replied, ""I know you do.  I'm sorry I turned you down.  I know we may not get along at all, but you're still a pretty good guy.  You have my permission to ask my daughter to marry you.""

Wow.  I was relieved.  I was not expecting this at all when he invited me in.  ""Umm, thanks sir!  You don't know how happy I am to hear that.. I'm going to go on that date with her now. Thanks again!"" I said, then I started to walk out the door.

As I was about to open the door he said, ""Wait, stop.""  I was nervous... I thought he had changed his mind, I turned around and looked at him.  He said, ""I need one more thing...""

""What do you need?"" I asked.

""I need about Tree Fiddy.""

It was around this time I realized that my girlfriend's father was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era. That goddamned monster had gotten me again!  ""Goddamnit monster I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!"" I screamed.

So there's my story.  I'm happy that I could end my story with a happy ending instead of some of the stories here... haha.  

I haven't really seen him since.

TL;DR: Rejected by father, then he changes his mind.

I'm saying that producing beef, pork, etc. is inherently more resource-intensive, and thus more environmentally damaging, than producing beans, bread, etc. It is indeed inherently negative for the environment.

You may be correct that the way humans kill animals causes less suffering than the way other predators do. However, the cruelty of factory farming is not constrained to the method of killing the animals. Furthermore, the alternative to raising cows to slaughter isn't raising cows to be naturally preyed upon by wolves (or whatever predator goes around killing cows). The alternative is not raising cows to slaughter at all.

I don't see how our position of dominant animal has any bearing on the discussion. We won't stop being the dominant life form on earth just because people stop eating meat. And it doesn't have anything to do with ethics anyway.

True,SeraphMSTP,med,Microbiology | Malaria,"Selective IgA deficiency is thought to have a genetic basis and can be inherited in an autosomal dominant or recessive manner. The cause of IgA nephropathy on the other hand, is still unknown, although theories propose that it arises from deposition of an unknown antigen in the glomerulus that attracts IgA and/or abnormal function of the immune system.

That being said, it would seem possible for a child to inherit the gene(s) responsible for IgA deficiency and somehow accumulate IgA antigens in the glomeruli. However, since the child produces no IgA, it will not accumulate in the nephrons and IgA nephropathy will not result.

True,Cuntius,,,"Sometimes I think of a world where there's been some horrible disease that killed almost all the men in the world only and there's something like a 10:1 ratio of women to men including men being born and all that cause the disease is everywhere.  Also, the disease has reduced greatly the sex drive of all men on earth.

Imagine being a man in that world.  Now, you lock your doors at night because you don't want a cohort of women breaking into your apartment and beg for sex each night but they are not rapists because that's still not cool but the noise wakes you up anyways.  Now in the morning your job is pretty easy you go down to a sperm bank and get paid like a king.  You obviously can't masturbate because your urges are basically non existent so they have to stick a needle into your scrotum and pull out the sperms one by one and put them on ice where they will be sold to the highest bidder at a cost many times greater than the price of crude oil per volume.  This is basically your job which you only have to do like once a month because of the low supply you get paid pretty damn well.  Sometimes rich women will approach you with a contract stating that if you have sex with her she'll give you tens of thousands of dollars.  It's pretty mechanical but the money allows you to spend more time in the library working on your historical studies which at this point is your main hobby because all professional sports have long ceased to exist as well as most television shows, movies, and video games.  You don't dare venture out of the country into some of the less safe regions of the world where if you are a man they will on sight taser you, tie you down to a board in the public square and force you to copulate to exhaustion and eventually death.  

There is a great demand by the men for the UN to send rescue squads but there's a growing sexually frustrated extremist faction in western europe and the united states that wants to round up men and put them in camps where they would be subject to such similar treatment albeit in a more sterile and more humane environment.  Protests are picking up every day and even in the ""safe"" districts you can't walk a block without various women physically harassing you.  Grabbing your arms, shoulders, crotch.  You start to carry a gun because the creepy looks of women on the other side of the sidewalk looking at you while licking their lips and tongue down their pants starts to make you uncomfortable.  You are in the middle of characterizing baroque architecture but are constantly disturbed by the ever increasing more violent women trying to break into your house with pumps and vials and rope.  You buy a gun but because gun sales are down mostly it requires a lot of money to get guns and bullets so you sell yourself to a local bidder who albeit would have been considered a model in the old world, the act disgusts you and you can't barely complete it.  The loaded guns are kept with you, and you have long since moved our of your apartment to a community with a lot more men who work the rubber mines to harvest the much more valuable rubber because of the massive demands the dildo factories face, which has almost become the de facto currency at this point.  The shape of the dildo is most important determining his values but at this point most people have a good feel for worth.  

As the months go by the climate gets progressively worse as the extremists are gaining traction in the UN and congress with protesters becoming more violent by the day, throwing large stone dildos through your windows and at UN headquarters.  It is only a matter of time before the UN is overrun by the extremists and they cave in to public pressure.  It has only been a decade since ""the change"" but the time has come.  You and your male comrades, while hoping to have spent the next few years completing the cataloging of pre-columbian olmec art and dance records, you all grab your guns and huddle down in the lobby, with it's security door and no windows being the safest part of the building.  The second the legislation passes the onslaught begins.  The security guard who dared brave the initial wave kills a few, but is quickly swallowed by a sea of horny women brandishing weaponized dildos.  You can only hear his scream for a second has you see his shredded clothes thrown into the air before the frenzy of the crowd drowns the noise out.  The door is a good stopgap but can only handle the blows from so many of these hammer dildos before falling down.  At once you spray into the crowd as flustered woman after woman runs through the doorway, some throwing their dildos at you before you take them out.  A combination of blood and ripped up dresses everywhere, the feminine crowd is getting harder to control and a few of their lobbed dildos have taken out the eyes of your comrades, sending them to the floor writhing, and some unlucky souls being dragged into the swarm by their feet.  You cannot hold your ground and you and the remaining men progressively retreat into the stairway, reloading while keeping enough distance to avoid being clubbed to death by a particularly long dildo from the recently weaponized factories.  However, the effort is futile.  More and more of you are being snatched up by the invading group and you are running lower and lower on ammo.  Eventually, you are backed onto the roof and in the corner with nothing left but a .50 cal which you promptly start firing into the frenzy.  As they get closer, you can see the cocklust in their eyes as they approach.  Having firing your last bullet, you shut your eyes in anticipation of being taken any second now.  You feel all is lost as their polished fingernails start to graze you, when suddenly out of nowhere, a masked figure wearing a jetpack flies over, and scoops you up right as the frenzied fairer sex was about to put a purse over your head and drag you away!  The group with the dildorangs throw them at you and the flying figure, but to no avail.  You look up at this masked figure as you both fly over the battlegrounds and profusely thank them for saving your life, while also asking who they are.  ""I'm just here to help.  The war has just begun, but I think I have a solution"".

Much cheaper build, saves cash up front. You could even drop it by another $100 by removing the SSD.

If you were in the UK, I promise you one thing. As a human being, we would help you with as much as we can, whether it is housing, support, etc. We have a LOT of women in our group, and they will understand your situation in ways men may not be able to. I don't care if you are muslim or exmuslim, we don't care. The issue is that you are going through shit no one should, and we know how shitty it is. We are helping each other here, and you're one of us.

We are indeed the underground railroad for exMuslims, in fact we are modelled around much of those principles.

I will be honest with you. Totally so. My SO and I have problems. Major ones. We are polar opposites who are absolutely perfect when we are on but are dis functional to the max when we are off. He leaves me with no contact for days/weeks/almost months at a time because he has commitment issues and because I have trust issues. And because he knows the absolute worst thing to do to me is ignore me. It destroys my self esteem worse than anything. Past relationships have been violent (to the point of my ex trying to kill me) verbally, emotionally, mentally, and physically. But to me there is nothing worse than being ignored because for me it says I am not important enough to engage. (He has rather serious emotional issues. He can NOT speak of emotions. He detaches himself. I feel unworthy/unloved due to this. Its a major roadblock because im very open) He knows this. He uses it. I am not perfect. I'm jealous. But I'm trying. He is insecure and doesn't believe that ""someone like me"" could love ""someone like him"" (whatever that means) he seems to think he's unattractive. (Most women wouldn't find him attractive. He is short. Super chubby (I love that!!!) gap teeth and not a GQ face but to me he is the sexiest thing in the planet. I love him. Ill fight and sacrifice for him and our problems all stem from out past issues and our current nosy intruders into our relationship. 

Bottom line is we love one another. No matter how bad we fight (we're NEVER violent) and we are opposites. 

It can be found, in the least likely of places, and it can become love, if both are willing. I am willing to do whatever it takes to make this man happy and to make him see that he's the one I want- he just won't believe it. Lol. Time. Time. I keep saying this to myself. Time. 

He's trying. Ever so hard. He is trying. He is making huge strides to show he lives me and to say it( even though its so very hard for him) 

I don't expect a fairy tale. Just to be appreciated. Shown love. And occasionally I'd like to verbally hear it. I have said this. He is trying. I am working on my issues of jealousy (not crazy jealousy or anything. Just trust issues) so again. Time.

However, my profile made it clear that I was 18 at the time, while he was 27. Not really old enough to be creepy, but mine also stated I was only interested in 18-25. So it was kinda odd...

Anyway, I didn't notice we'd been matched until I got a creepy message from him, something like ""Hey sexi gurl, u look hott in ur pics, do u like to play w/ older boys? ;)""  

And I had to respond: ""Hey Jamie, I haven't seen you in a while but this is your cousin DancesWithDaleks. I am definitely not interested."" He was like ""HOLY SHIT OMG PLEASE DON'T TELL MY DAD I HAD NO IDEA OH MY GOD."" and sent me like 5 messages explaining that he never talks like that, he was just really really lonely... and didn't know how to talk to girls and he was trying to be a cool guy... and he didn't realize it because my hair was pink and I'd changed a lot since he last saw me (which is true, I was awkward at 14 and definitely ""blossomed"" in my late teens).

As someone with a very deep economics, financial, and business background, this entire conversation is painful to read.  There are so many misconceptions about pension accounting and the bankruptcy process that I feel like reading this thread is the equivalent of seeing those videos where people at Glenn Beck rallies are interviewed spouting off about Obama's secret muslim plot to make us all gay married communists who have interracial children and cross dress while burning flags.

Instead of writing a thirty-page explanation, I am going to explain this like I would to my five-year-old niece.  I am not trying to be condescending, so I apologize for the tone.  I am trying to remain sane.

* For more than eleven years, Hostess was horribly run, including by a CEO who left earlier this year after awarding himself huge pay increases and demanding union concessions.

* The new CEO came into office back in March or April and, after discovering these large pay hikes, ordered the top four executive salaries to $1 for the remainder of the year to make up for it, before being restored next year, evening things out.

* This new CEO, with the backing of the bailout investors, went to the unions and offered them a package that included:

1. A twenty-five percent (25%) ownership stake in the business, which would transform Hostess into one of the largest partially employee-owned firms on the planet.

2. A package of bonds in the company to go to the employees with a face value of $100,000,000 that would generate interest and be repaid in the future

3. Two seats on the board of the directors, providing influence and power to shape the future of the enterprise

In exchange, the unions had to agree to:

1. Cut existing pay levels to fall in line with other major bakeries

2. Do like the other 90% of American manufacturing firms have and ""freeze"" pension plans, meaning that any new employees will have to use a 401(k) instead.  

3. Pay more out of pocket for some other expenses such as insurance

If all of this happened, the employees of Hostess would not only get to keep their job, but they would be working for themselves.  It was the best possible solution to a terrible situation caused by years of mismanagement, none of which was the fault of the current CEO who has only had the job for 8 months or so.

The Teamsters union wisely signed up.  They acknowledged that the situation was bad.  They talked about how terrible former management had been.  They focused on the future and knew that this could work out well and, among all the potential choices, was the best that could be expected.

Then, a smaller union - the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers International Union - said no. 

They (the BCTWGMIU) were warned that if the company shut down in a strike, the finances were so weak the doors would have to be closed.  Everyone would lose their job.  There would be no ownership.  There would be no bonds.  There would be no seats on the board of directors.  There would be no new employees let alone pensions for new employees.  It was a complete thermonuclear scenario that would destroy the lives of 18,500 hardworking families.

The BCTWGMIU struck anyway and the Teamsters, to their credit, crossed picket lines and remained reasonable because their actions were based on facts and analysis of what was economically feasible.  The company begged the BCTWGMIU to return to the table, but they refused, talking about the litany of abuses of past managements.

For anyone who is successful, well educated, and familiar with strategy such as game theory, the choice is clear.  When faced with a total wipeout, you take the option that gives you the greatest long-term chance of survival.  Even if the new deal had resulted in only an extra six-months of paychecks, that is six months of income for 18,500 families that relied on that cash.  When you represent others, like union leaders do, their welfare is your sole concern.

That is precisely what the Teamsters did.  However, the BCTWGMIU behaved like a father who commits a murder-suicide of himself and the children when a spouse leaves, convinced he is in the moral right and that he had no other choice because of his evil ex-wife.  He writes a long note detailing all the past mistakes she made and how she drove him to take this action.  BCTWGMIU drove Hostess straight into liquidation.  The murder-suicide analogy is appropriate because that is exactly what this was: An economic murder-suicide.  A vast majority of those 18,500 workers were innocent, behaved the best they could, and did the right thing in a terrible situation.  Their entire lives have been destroyed by a handful of their foolish coworkers who were more interested in making a point and detailing past grievances than working with the new team that had come in and offered them a partnership stake in the firm.  They were so stuck in the owner vs. employee mindset they ignored the chance to *become* owners.

The BCTWGMIU just struck a major blow to the little workers' rights power remaining in the United States and hurt the labor movement incalculably.  Even worse, they are too foolish to see it.  The ramifications have already begun.  If a new factory wants to raise money, don't you think investors are going to demand that it locate in a right to work state like Texas, so if this had happened, all of the workers can be summarily fired?  The legacy cost of this will be with us for decades.

TL;DR: The Teamsters Union behaved reasonably.  The new CEO behaved reasonably.  The BCTWGMIU decided it couldn't get what it wanted - which was not economically possible based on the numbers - and turned down the chance to own 25% of the business, collect $100 million in bonds, and get seats on the board of directors.  Now they get nothing, everyone loses their jobs, the owners get wiped out, and other corporations get to come in and pick up the assets for pennies on the dollar.

True,BrooklynNets,,,"My father, whom I hadn't seen in some ten years at the time, heard from my mother that I was a big basketball fan and that I idolised Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen. Several months later, midway between Christmas (which he doesn't celebrate) and Easter (which we don't celebrate), a package addressed to me arrived at our house with a Greek postmark. In it was an AEK Athens soccer jersey about three sizes too small that smelled as if it had been marinated in ouzo for a decade or so, along with a note saying ""Happy    !"". Evidently he'd prepared a card but had left his options open as to which holiday it would cover.

We later discovered that he had confused the Bulls with the Lakers and asked his friend if he could find a Lakers jersey. His friend, having no luck on that front, decided to buy an AEK jersey instead since they wore a similar shade of yellow. Since they didn't have a basketball jersey in youth sizes, however, his friend substituted a soccer jersey instead. Thus it came to pass that a Chicago Bulls jersey was circuitously replaced by a Greek soccer jersey.

True,BrooklynNets,,,"I was once making fuck with a very petite lady who cautioned me to be gentle with her, a request I observed as any gentleman would. She seemed content with approximately the northernmost forty percent of my old fellow invading her person, and so I went about my business with sharp, shallow thrusts. This unusual motion, however, being generated entirely by my legs and hips, quickly caused my hamstring to cramp. It just so happened that said cramp coincided with the arrival of an orgasm on her part, and so I did my best to continue until the next save point. 

My legs finally gave out as she started speaking in tongues, at which point I slumped forward and accidentally introduced the next thirty percent of my woody pal into her quivering innards, causing my five-foot fuck-friend to emit a yelp that implied that I'd skewered her internal organs like a kebab. She instinctively performed an evasive barrel roll to her right, bending my instrument in such a manner as to cause an audible pop. I mirrored her movements so as not to see my trusty chap ripped off like a raffle ticket and ended up tumbling dongwards onto the floor, my coital partner following shortly thereafter. Still in the throes of an orgasm, she landed a flying elbow to my teeth and a textbook knee-strike to my vulnerable groinal region, the point of her patella making perfect contact with my left testicle, the larger and more handsome of the pair.

Besides a tender clam, she came out of the whole affair no worse for wear. I, meanwhile, found myself the next morning with a chipped tooth, a testicle with the volume and hue of an eggplant, and a penile ligament that would, when stressed,  make a disconcerting clicking sound for the better part of a fortnight.

True,the_x_signed,minatoeyes,,"i wasn't really going into the that, just formulating a possible jutsu using nature energy. just look up ""genki dama""...

but to actually go into the topic of bijuu vs. nature energy: to go into sage mode you must remain mentally and physically at peace/silence and gather nature energy. The drawback is that this is hard during combat, that's one of the reasons why the sages merged with jiraya (they take over while jiraya gathers energy). Naruto overcomes this in the pain fight by having clones at hand who are gathering nature energy. with the kyuubi as companion, however, i don't feel it's necessary to have clones in backup or to merge with the sage toads, because as you say, the kyuubi can take over and lead the fight while naruto is gathering nature energy for his sage mode. in that aspect, the kyuubi takes over the role of the sage toads.

addressing the issue at hand in that chapter you linked: if wanted/needed, i think that sage toad could merge with naruto now, since it was apparently the kyuubi (chakra) what rejected him. So since kurama is now cooperating, this may be no longer a problem. however, due to the explanation in the first part of this post, i don't see this as really necessary or to be a power-up. if you've got the kyuubi covering for you, why would you need a sage toad?

one last thing, to come back to my previous comment about the spirit bomb. i said it as a joke, but i don't find it totally unrealistic. the kyuubi's chakra is huge, but naruto has shown that gathering nature energy is also a big chakra vault. Since the kyuubi and hachibi's chakra doesn't seem a match to the juubi, i think that: If this has to be ended by force/chakra alone, only the use of a combo of chakra's will do it. Naruto has the kyuubi and part of the chakra of 6 other bijuu, hachibi is nearby and could lend his power... add nature energy to this, you may have something that could be more powerfull than the juubi.
And what is the most powerfull technique of the bijuu? bijuudama... just infuse it with nature energy and it would get bigger/stronger, wouldn't it?

however, i can't imagine that kishi will go along that path, i suspect something smarter and less than a dbz ripoff... but you never know with kishi-troll.",0,1353312228,,0,False,1,c73lo8f,t3_13d8z2,t1_c73lo8f,t1_c73cks9,,1430444831,2,False,Naruto,t5_2quts,2

True,istara,,,"I am so very sorry this happened to you.  My heart breaks for you, because the pressure and value on us women to be ""beautiful"" is just immense and lifelong.

However, just because your husband may *objectively* perceive that you are ""ugly"" that does not mean he is not attracted to you.  It is possible to be incredibly homely and immensely sexy.  (And the reverse - there are beautiful people that can leave you cold, even make your flesh creep).

I think that what your husband really meant was:  *""I know that [my wife] is ugly according to social convention, but to me she is a beautiful person, a loving and sexy woman, and I find her as attractive as someone with slightly more even features, or longer legs, or whatever""*.  He didn't say all that because he lost his cool, and because it's hard to articulate it.

But he *loves* you.  That's what you need to focus on.

I also think that you need to differentiate between beauty and attractiveness.  The latter is far more about confidence, attitude, personality, style.  If you've been burying yourself away a bit because of your concerns, then don't.  Step out.  Fuck the world.  You have what millions of far more ""beautiful"" women and men never will: someone who loves you for you.

True,NoseFetish,,,"Women are expected by society to be demure, to be subservient, to be the supporters of men, the nurturers. They are expected to serve as objects for men, and to smile and say thank you for us objecting them. Men are in turn expected to be objectors.

I hear it all the time from women friends. Guys telling them to smile more, they would look prettier if they were happier, or that people would like them more if they were friendlier. So in /r/creepyPms on a **non stop basis** you will hear guys saying the same shit no matter what they do.

If they tell them to get lost, that they aren't interested, or react in a non nice way, they are bitches or crazy and should have never replied back. To many men here, even replying back, even though you are straight up saying that you aren't interested, is still a form of attention.

If they ignore them, then they are stuck up bitches who are full of themselves because they don't have the niceness to even reply back telling them no. 

This is the major factor in all these equations, the people involved in these messages owe absolutely nothing to the other person. Usually these messages are unsolicited, the person doesn't even know the other person, and the ""creepy"" person is usually someone who doesn't understand what boundaries are and how to respect them. So if one of my women friends gets a message from some random dude on a dating website that goes past general boundaries the rest of society can respect, she doesn't owe him anything. Not a message telling him she isn't interested, that he is a dick, or he needs to learn to improve his game.

When you are in a relationship with someone, obviously communication is key. Yes, it would be beneficial to cut contact early on if you aren't interested. No one likes being led on. That isn't the problem here, most of these women aren't leading anyone on. The problem isn't with the women's reactions, but with the people who are sending these messages. It is very similar to the idea of victim blaming, that these women could have done something to prevent these messages, or that they were somehow at fault for getting more of them. We should be placing the blame squarely on those who send these messages, and not the other way around. 

There was someone in /r/creepyPMs who actually expected one of our posters who received over 200 messages in less than a day on a dating site, to reply back to EVERY SINGLE ONE, to tell them that she wasn't interested. They actually believed she owed them some niceties because they went out of their way to send her a message and to them it was common courtesy. 

&gt;Women are expected to be nice and sweet, to make other people feel comfortable. A woman who says ‘hey, I think there’s a problem here’ is being ‘negative.’ A woman who doesn’t smile while she’s being harassed is ‘humourless.’ A woman who prefers to stay focused on tasks is a ‘cold bitch.’ Significant gendering is involved here; women have an obligation to look and act a certain way and when they don’t, they need to be hassled until they do.

The fucked up part is that men do this all the time. We feel entitled to aspects of a woman, to aspects of a relationship. We feel entitled to their attention. After so many dates we feel entitled to their body. For some men we feel entitled to have women around us lift our spirits by us objectifying them, they should smile more because it makes us happy, not because they should find something that makes them happy. If we send them a message, they should at least send us a message back. If we are spending all our time trying to date them and they only want to be friends, we are friend zoned. We have these expectations without any regard towards the other person as being just a person. Instead of what they too want out of life, a relationship, a chat, whatever else, we disregard them as people, we focus on them as objects, and we expect certain reciprocations from these objects from our actions. These ideas are taken to the extremes with PUA tactics. If I say this, do this, and look this way, it will get me this response back.

On the internet we feel entitled to look at nude pictures of women in places like GW, we feel entitled to comment on them, to ask for more, or to send them a PM. We feel entitled to shame them and show our authority when they post outside of GW, we post links to their account. There are phrases that show our blatant entitlement like ""tits or gtfo"" or ""get back in the kitchen and make me a sandwich"". 

There are societal expectations on genders, these are called gender norms. Men are supposed to be strong, never cry, make the first move on in dating, be the bread winners, go to war, etc. Women are supposed to support men, be demure, be nurturing, the home keepers. These gender roles extend into social activities, and are no where as apparent as online. Women are ""attention whores"" and many men are jealous or jaded against this, as if this gender norm makes their lives harder and has no impact on women. A woman can get to the front page because of their boobs, or having a pretty face, these men forgetting that it is other men who are objectifying them in the first place that creates this type of system. Instead of blaming it on gender roles, we blame the person who is there because it's convenient. Instead of blaming the creeps for not understanding boundaries and respecting them, we blame the only person who is available, the women who should have known better and replied back saying no thank you, or not replied back at all. 

I wrote a [long post addressing people](http://www.reddit.com/r/creepyPMs/comments/1112gv/oh_god_i_just_realized_im_the_obsessive_guy/c6igkqa?context=3) who send these messages over a span of days, weeks, and even years. The average person when getting no response back will usually give up. The people who are further sending these messages obviously aren't getting it, are possibly obsessed, are a creeper, or in some delusional world they are still holding out on the hope that the person might reply back. We can give advice to these people who get the messages, but we shouldn't expect them to act a certain way. They should feel comfortable responding in whatever way they want, or not even responding at all. Some of the reactions I've seen from the guys around here when a woman is more blunt, aggressive, or forceful in telling these people to fuck off, act as if they are the person on the other end of the message. I see hurt feelings saying that she didn't have to be such a huge bitch about it, she must be crazy, or she must be PMSing. 

Like sarskills points out, most of the people sending these messages don't understand social cues in the first place, so even responding back can make things worse in the long run. The person might become obsessed with you, even if you try to do it nicely. A lot of replies where I see people politely saying no is met with replies that are there to buffer the creeps ego. Stuff like calling them names, negging, or the frequency of messages being sent increasing. 

What really needs to be emphasized is that while it is good to give advice, we need to let go of our expectations. The people receiving these messages should be free to respond to them how they want, and we shouldn't unload on them because it isn't what we would do, or what we think is the right thing to do. If a woman feels comfortable telling them to fuck off and run their nutsack through a meat grinder, that is up to her. If she doesn't feel comfortable responding at all, this is her prerogative. The blame for these creeps should squarely be on the creeps shoulders, because the general public isn't going to reward them with attention for being creeps and they eventually need to learn this. I created /r/creepsupport to further this idea, because no matter how women respond guys are going to keep sending these messages. [I also wrote another long post about the idea of privilege](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/111gau/why_certain_ideas_get_higher_votes_than_others/) and what it means to us online.

True,thisisamatt,,,"Hey Obitual,
Here is my strategy for making conversation, not sure if it will be helpful (it is structured like this because I do philosophy...) but I find it effective in my conversations.

It's possible to carry a conversation on almost any topic by following a general structure of questions, without needing to understand anything specific about a topic (though it helps). The keys are asking questions and communicating to the other person/people that you are interested-if you seem bored people will disconnect.


*  My first step is to think of general questions I can ask that are different enough from the cliches that people don't switch off. At a wedding reception tonight it was ""What are you looking forwards to about the rest of the year."" This gives the person an opportunity to talk about something that is significant to them, without restricting the scope of possible topics. eg. asking ""what do you do?"" requires the person to talk about their work, but they may hate it and try to avoid talking about it. Some people won't have an answer, but most will and now you have a topic that engages them.


*  Now without knowing what their answer will be you can pretty much plan your next question; all it has to do is invite them to elaborate on the topic. eg. ""Why are you looking forwards to that?"" I like this strategy because it takes some of the pressure off me to drive the conversation, I have now given the other person permission to be the main contributor.


*  As the conversation continues I need to become more specific with my questions, but I can still predict some of the structure to them. So here are some types of questions: - content: get them to explain the nuts and bolts of the topic. eg. if they have said Christmas ask them what Christmas looks like for them, do they have traditions. If the topic is holidays ask them if they have already made plans. etc... What we want is for them to educate us about something they are interested in.

*  Here are some themes you can use in thinking of questions:  
  *  *attachment*: what is their place in relation to the topic. We want to find out why they are interested, or involved, or merely why they want to talk about this. If they say football then we want to know what about football interests them. Do they play football? Are they just a spectator? Is it their kids that play football? If they say Reddit then we can ask whether they like to lurk or do they like to comment heaps? Are they a daily reader or sporadic.  
*  *emotions*: we want to find out their emotional connection to a topic. Is it something that makes them happy or excited, or is it infuriating to them. This gives us an insight into how a person thinks and what they value, things that are very helpful for forming long-term friendships. In general you don't ask direct questions like ""How does that make you feel?"" (which I think is a weird question), but rather ""What do you like about Christmas?"" or ""Can Christmas be a stressful time for you?""

*  *history*: not always that interesting but it gives us context to the topic. eg. ""Has your family always celebrated Christmas?"" or ""How did you find out about Reddit?""

The next step is the harder part, but isn't a requirement when making friends. You now want to start relating to what the person is talking about, this shows that you are engaged in the conversation and also provides them the opportunity to learn about you. There are lots of different ways to do this, especially to stay appropriate to the topic.

*  Broadly speaking you can connect by sharing similarities (what you have in common or can relate to), differences (what you are unfamiliar with or approach differently), or questions (what puzzles you about something, or something you want to know. Even better is to ask them their advice). These three are the methods of connecting, to which we have to add content:

*  attitude: connect with the way they feel about a topic. You can probably relate to someone's passion for a topic, even if it's nuclear physics, or sympathize with their frustration, even if it's over the colour of nail polish, because you have attitudes towards stuff to; so you are engaging with the attitude regardless of your interest in the content. eg. So you love Reddit because of the cool AMAs, I love reading those too. Which ones have been your favorites. Or ""I find people's stupidity frustrating, I don't know anything about nail polish but I often feel that big companies can lose touch with what their customers really want.""

*  result: relate to their success/failure in an area. eg. ""I've never had a high karma comment, what do you recon is the secret to a good comment?"" - your understanding: tell them whether you understand what they are talking about or not as a means to continue the conversation. If you do understand give them a summary and ask whether that is a fair representation of what they were saying. eg. So you like Christmas because it brings your whole family together. If you don't understand ask them to explain it a different way (eg. ELI5), give a summary, or highlight a specific point they made for more information about it.

*  how does it effect me: (not for all topics) get them to explain why you should care about the topic. eg. I'm not a Christian, so do you think I can get excited about Christmas as well?

Edit: formatting


**Edit** On account of the discussion generated I wanted to clarify a few points.

1) Yes, this method is not natural. Yes, it can make you sound like a robot. However, *people who are natural and good at conversation don't need this advice.* This advice is for the people who are frustrated by their failures, often directly through trying to be natural. So your comments are true, but miss the purpose and the audience for the advice (I'm not trying to sell a cancer cure to the healthy).

2)  Yes, natural is better, so lets try to be more natural in conversation. Like in the movie Yes Man, if you are to extreme with this advice it will cause problems. But, hopefully through using the advice it will make you more comfortable with having conversations. Then you will converse more, get better at it and progress towards being more natural. IMHO I think that this kind of structure can help that progression.

3)  I am a nerd, in some ways. I can be awkward, at times. I don't have as many conversations as I would like. I often find it hard to practice what I preach. But I have improved in conversation in many ways as a result of thinking through structures like this.

4)  Use what you want, tweak it, ignore it. Your choice. Will it work for you? Maybe... I hope so. Everything is about context, who you are talking to, where, when... The structure I have formulated tries to capture some of that in a coherent way, give advice general enough to be useful. Conversation is fluid in most regards, some understand that and are comfortable with it, to others it's a dark and intimidating space to enter-I'm just trying to shed some light.


I am truly thankful for all the responses, it's exciting. Also, there have been lots of other great advice posted by others that is worth checking out, very thought provoking and helpful. Here are some of the great comments (I'll  have missed some-sorry).

First, take the time to upload the campaigns to a Cargo site. There's really no excuse not to, and it will be much easier to view the work than in a PDF.

On to the work:

Lemon Lottery: This is a pretty clever idea... if consumers get it, which I'm not sure they will. I get how clever it is because I already know about the lemon campaign. Will the average person? Probably not. 

Also, I'm not sure I quite understand how it works. If I get a lemon, I will the $15,000+ that accumulates at thelemonlottery.com? If this is an actual contest, you don't explain how it works. 

Also, I get that the design is purposely retro because you're referencing the original lemon ad, but I think you still need to find a way to make it feel a little more modern and updated, rather than just a direct imitation of the original aesthetic. 

Star Walk: I honestly have no idea what this thing does. Shows me and a partner what the night sky looks like in a given place at a given time? Or just lets me set a date and time to meetup with someone? Is this a real app? 

FIFA: You mention in the upfront that the criticism of the big tournaments is that they don't benefit the host nations enough, but it's not clear to me your assignment has answered this objective. You say proceeds from pickup games will go to local communities. What proceeds? An entry fee to the game? Merchandise? Concessions? The idea of playing pickup games while I'm there is certainly appealing, but why do I need to pay you money for the privilege? I'm already paying money to buy the ticket to the game and fly out... 

Also, executionally, your postcard needs to be way more direct. It doesn't explicitly mention anywhere that I'm being invited to play a game. That needs to be much more clear if you want me to read it and not throw it away. Also, there's a typo, as you meant to use ""It's"" for the second sentence. 

Libreria: You have many, many typos throughout every part of this campaign, some of them very prominently positioned. That's a pretty big problem. It doesn't help that I don't really understand what the campaign is. If I guess the correct sources, I get a discount on books? Wy not just give me the discount without making me jump through hoops? Is there any reason to believe stimulating consumer interaction will benefit the business beyond just offering the discount?

That's all I have time to look at for the moment. Hope that helped.

True,Xanthu,,,"**Edit: Well shit, this got bigger than I thought it might. Hi r/Bestof.
And Reddit-bloggers.**

Chess reminds me of the best teacher I was lucky to have. In high school, we had year of modern history, covering Civilization from the Renaissance to about as close to present day as they can get.  US history picked up the rest next year.

That Civ teacher, Mr. Herzig, had very inventive class projects, often involving the entire class in some sort of simulation. For the reformation era, he split us into a Meeting of the Minds, 12 students were each given a philosopher to emulate. The rest helped them research, or prepared questions for the other philosophers.

During this whole time, Mr. Herzig has also been talking up his love of chess, encouraging kids to play him. Any kid that can beat him gets a free A on *any* grade, up to sections of the Final. Of course, almost no one ever beat him, hard when you only have 10 minutes in a break to play, and he has three people trying to play him. He kept warning his class that there would be a chess test, everyone was required to pass it.

Around February, we finally got the date for the chess test. We spent a period on all the rules of chess, and a day before he posted the test right on the board. We took the test, then reviewed with the class, *then* graded our own test, in our own pencils. Eraser marks would be ignored. He congratulated everyone on Acing the test and then revealed the truth.

Next week was the Chess Simulation.

He handed out the assignment. The class was to play a 2-team game of chess, through move notations and a literal chain of orders. Three boards were set up. One on each side of the class for each team, and one board at the front, where Mr. Herzig stood with a timer. Every student was to be assigned a piece on the board. For fairness, and class size not matching the number of pieces, pawns would be assigned in larger groups, 3 or 4 I think. To move a piece, the move must be written down in chess notation and delivered by the person moving the piece to Mr. Herzig at the head of the class. Those assigned King were given the greatest duty. They were the final arbiters of what the moves were. They had to design an ""official mark,"" some stamp or their initials, and sign each notation with it before the piece delivered the move. There were even Coup d'état rules for pieces threatening the king. If moves didn't get to the teacher after 5 minutes, no move would be recorded. Moves happened not by piece color, but by whomever move was delivered first. You did not need to checkmate, you just had to take the opposing king.

This was not normal chess.

Grading was simple.  A: Your side wins and your piece lives. B: Your side wins and your piece dies. C: Your side loses and your piece lives D: Your side loses and your piece dies. F: You touch the main board, board cart, or otherwise interfere in the simulation. This was the ONLY way to fail the simulation.

We're assigned our pieces that day, I got a rook. Being the nerd I was, I suggested to our king that we go for a quick strike strategy, but he wasn't as engaged into the project as I was, so we essentially go in with little plans. No one was really sure how it was going to turn out. The day of the simulation, we get a quick review of the rules and then we start.

It was madness, both sides are trying to get orders out the fastest, getting orders written and figuring out whoever is getting moved so they can dash up their orders. Our side manages to have a clear shot in only 5 or 6 moves, we hustle our bishop with orders and they pass it off first. We're already celebrating as the other side slinks forward, seeing they're too late. Mr. Herzig announces our move. Is invalid. Our king didn't sign the notation properly, the order is ignored. The other side's move of a bishop to block is executed. We flip out at our king for a second before immediately re-assessing the board and finding a new path to victory. More turns passes as pieces flew across the board, some students indifferent or completely confused on the side, just waiting to hear if they actually had to do something. Others unclear if they were even still in the game. Incorrect moves started to mount, trying to move pieces that weren't there, or doing moves they could not.

As we argued about our move in turn 15-20, Mr. Herzig hollered and told us to take our seats. We realized the period was ending and we had no clear winner. He apologized, and explained that he had tricked us. There would be no grade given for the simulation. He would explain fully the next day.

It went something along these lines. We had just experienced a War simulation. He explained how he purposefully split the class, picked two friends for opposing kings, split friends across teams. How quickly we started clamoring to get the other team in pursuit of our own grades, even at the cost of the grades of our friends. The FOG of war in not knowing for certain if your table matched the True table at the front of the class.  Having no idea what the opposing table may look like. The fury of a team when one king screws up an order. He admitted that in years past, he would extend the simulation by faking these errors, and he fudged a few in this game, but our king's mistake was real, and hilariously poignant. He also talked of great Generals of war cursing the weather or god for bad luck. I bet he swapped some pieces around on his board too when no one was looking.

This whole explanation hit me like a ton of bricks. Realizing as a 16-year old what it's like to call for someone else to have misfortune for your own benefit.

The grade was never entered. For our class the simulation didn't exist, just a 100% quiz on how to play chess. He asked us to not share the secrets of this simulation with underclassmen, he needed to be sure future students  had a chance at the same effect. There was a rumor that one class got A's across the board. I can't remember if it was our year, or one before it, and if they were helped or not.

They refused to turn in any orders.

I didn't realize then, but I did while writing this, that if only the Pawns and the Knights refuse, the board is locked and the rest don't matter. If they still do the King's wishes, the Knights can only wreak havoc on the other team's pawns without facing certain death.

____________________________________________________________________________________________
edit1: Some people have asked how it goes. You can really infer most of it from this post, I don't think there's any real secrets that I left out/didn't know. But I'll go over it here:

Learn/teach the mechanics and [rules of chess](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rules_of_chess). Teach how each piece moves, about special situations like castling, en passant, and the knight jumping pieces. Don't worry about any kind of gametheory, early/middle/endgame. Just give them enough to be able to watch a game and have a chance at knowing what is going on. Teach the [notation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_notation) so they could understand the flow a game if they only saw a recap.

For the simulation itself, assign each student to a single piece, or a group of pawns, on either color. Knowing your class and how it interacts with itself is pretty key for the best effect. There's some nuances of chess and human psyche that I could guess at, but you'll probably find better results by trusting yourself. 

Kings write out the move orders and sign in their unique way. Pieces deliver the orders to the front of the class. Our room had the desks arranged in a U, so we could put the student boards at each corner, and the True board on a cart at the front of the room. 

Have a timer set for 5 minutes. Each round wait for both moves to arrive, then announce and execute the moves in the order you get them. Find good BS reasons to veto moves that would end the simulation (you have at least 4 rounds). For the simulation proper you just need to be the arbiter of the game, be the only one to actually move pieces. Make sure no one touches the cart. Teams are internally responsible for their own boards.

Delivering the message after is a much harder thing to coach and remember. I wish I could help, but I don't know what exactly to say beyond sharing this post.

For those that didn't get it, the offered grading system is a *lie.* It in itself is a metaphor, what the leaders say is the best path to victory, and the betterment of the team, isn't really the best idea. The whole thing isn't about the grade, it's about the lesson.

edit2:
I got an email back from him:

""Great to hear from you— I hope and trust that you are doing well.

Thanks for sending me the link to your story.  You captured both the essence of the simulation, as well as the gritty nuts and bolts of how it’s run very well— BRAVO to your memory and writing!  It’s always good to know that a lesson has hit the mark with a student; in your case, you demonstrate the most thorough understanding of the means and ends of the simulation of any participant that I’ve heard from.  THANKS for sharing your insights and thoughts with me.""

From other students, it sounds like he has not been continuing on the simulation. Most likely due to assholes like me who can't shut up about how awesome it is.

Edit3:

Maybe going through it will work out. I'll try to explain it by replicating the [Ruy Lopez](http://chess.about.com/od/openings/ss/RuyLopez.htm) opening.

Let's assign a few students to pieces.

Jonny gets the white pawns, Rick the white king's knight, Bobby gets the white king's bishop Allen is the white king.

Sarah gets the black pawns, Diane gets the black queen's knight. Terri is the black queen's bishop. Lucy is the black king.

Ultimately, the decision is to Allen and Lucy for how this game plays. Allen brings a stamp for all of his orders, Lucy has made an elaborate symbol involving her initials, and signs with a specific sparkle pen. They must write out their move in [chess notaion](http://www.chesshouse.com/how_to_read_and_write_chess_notation_a/166.htm) and place their respective mark on it.

Allen writes [e4] on a paper and stamps it. This signifies moving the white pawn in front of the king forward 2 spaces. That white pawn, Jonny, must deliver his move to the front. At the same time, Lucy has written [e5] on her paper and passed it to Sarah. Allen stamps his order quickly and Jonny is at the front first. Sarah is there a few seconds later.

On the main board, the white kings pawns moves forward 2 spaces. Then the black pawn does the same. The main board looks like [this](http://www.apronus.com/chess/wbeditor.php?m=e4_e5) and the two teams follow suit. Lucy assigned her friend Terri to move the pieces, Allen just does it himself.

Next they both want to move a knight. Lucy writes [Nc6], Allen writes on [Nf3]. Lucy wised up and did her insignia first, so when they decided their move they were ready, and Diane takes the order up before Allen figures out to hand his order to Rick.

The teacher gets Diane's order first, and moves the black knight before the white knight. Terri and Allen replicate on their boards. The board now looks like [this](http://www.apronus.com/chess/wbeditor.php?m=e4_e5_Nf3_Nc6).

The white team talks, and agree to move out the bishop. Allen writes down [Bb5] and stamps it, handing it off to Bobby. Lucy also decides to move a bishop, [Bb4], and hands that note to Terri.

Terri arrives first, but her move is disqualified since she's the wrong bishop (she's the queen side bishop, Lucy tried to move king-side bishop). Black records no move, white moves the bishop. At the end of turn three we have [this board](http://www.apronus.com/chess/wbeditor.php?m=e4_e5_Nf3_Nc6_Bb5)

It's hard for me to explain more, there's just too much that can happen.

True,Yiep,P,Protoss,"So, with pathogen glands, 8 infested terrans. Im guessing they weigh at least 200kg with that huge armour. Giving 1600kg in just pure ""skill weight""!

A body capable of sustaining such a weight, especially with what I assume is an exo skeleton would probably need to weigh at least 1,5 times of that – so another 1800kg

Not sure how to adress the gland issue, because energy determines how many infested terrans the infestor can keep up inside. And the fact that you with 200 energy always is able to chose either to eject fungal growth OR infested terrans. 

An infestor with full energy can throw 2,666.. fungal growths. A huge estimation is that one fungal growth can hit about 10 marines, and this has to be enough volume on each marine to actually not be able to move, and consider that marines are about 2 time the size in armour as a regular human. I'd estimate that the amount needed to achive this effect would be atleast 5 liters to cover the entire suit and joints, and that the liquid is very viscous. So that would be about 50 liters for each fungal (50kg), with 2,666.. amounts giving ~134 liters.

For pure anatomy, a gland with the capacity to store 134 liters, should probably be quite tough. And then with a huge muscle to be able to thrust the fungal at least about 20 meters, I think you gotta count with something weighing quite alot, like 80kg (an elefant heart can for reference weigh about 15-20kg). So another 214kg here.

Then we have the neural parasite antenna, that gotta be in a rough material, but still retractable, and also needs a range of about 20 meters. Tricky one to adress. Probably 50-60cm thick? Im thinking fluid inside to deliver the parasites. The volume in a cylinder that size is like 5000 liters, but thats when its full of liquid. So im thinking about 500 liters here to deliver the parasite in a ""flush"". Probably another 200kg for the anatomy of the tentacle. So 600kg? Internal organs should probably account for about 50kg.

Lets sum it up! 3774 kg!

True,NakedFrenchman,,,"Hey man, here's my two cents:

I quite like the lemon idea. It's clever. And I think it's less about an actual contest and more about making a statement that you are almost certainly guaranteed a quality product. I share the same concern as skepticaljesus, however; will people get the reference? At least we're dealing with a super iconic campaign. I wouldn't be too concerned about it. At the end of the day it shows you can think and build off a brand's history. But in the real world this probably wouldn't work. I'd move it down for that reason.

Star Walk - I like that you are trying to connect people through virtual star gazing. But the app is such a novelty already, the whole time I'm wondering, so what DOES this thing do? 

United Play - Pretty much agree with everything skepticaljesus said. Let me add that very few people use, or even know how to use QR codes. Especially when it is not clear where one will take you. In portfolio schools, using QR codes has become a common sin. I'd avoid using it altogether. It's a technology that simply isn't catching on with consumers (despite how often you see it). A CD might groan at the sight of one.

Liberia Canuda - To be honest I'm not loving this. For one thing, it's kind of a chore to go through; lots of text, nothing very visually appealing. Second, It feels more like a bunch of promos for a book store, and not really a branded campaign. I'd just toss it. And that's perfectly okay. Sometimes ideas don't turn out as great as they initially seem.

Diario La Verdad - Meh. Doesn't feel like a book piece to me. Magazine cutouts isn't at all new and that's pretty much all I see going on here. And it's just the same execution three times. Yeah, that happens in the real world, but your book is a whole different beast. You're trying to prove you can write, brand and think 360 degrees.

Good Bet - I think it's a nice way for people to help out communities. I'd like to see more writing for this campaign. I didn't really see any headlines that stopped me in my tracks.

The Porn Volt - Certainly a novel idea for an energy consultancy company. Props for being ballsy in such a stale category. This could be blown out more. Think more digital. You don't want a book full of banner ads. Think of other avenues, like maybe the casual encounters section on craigslist (though that may not really hit your intended target), but you know; think of less obvious ways of advertising digitally.

Overall, I can tell you can think. I'd really like to see more headlines in your book. I still think old fashion print is a great way to see a person's writing ability. Additionally, I'd like to see more 360 ideas; campaigns that lend themselves to multiple mediums. Pick some more well known brands. Maybe some that are struggling. The solution is only as good as the problem.

Definitely get a cargo. Just do it. Your competition is doing it. It's easier to update your work that way too. You're not going to want to send a PDF around all the time (but definitely have a link on your site to download one, along with your resume).

~~Hello! I have just come up with a temporary fix! I have classes soon and will work on a better fix later but for now do this. First, start TF2 for the first time (if you havent already). This extracts the needed files. Next create a file in ""~/Steam/SteamApps/cyberxzt/Team Fortress 2"" named 'hl2-optirun.sh'. Inside this file put everything from [this pastebin](http://pastebin.com/c54bxWDf). Next open a terminal and run the following commands:~~

    cd ""~/Steam/SteamApps/cyberxzt/Team Fortress 2""
    echo ""440"" &gt; steam_appid.txt
    chmod +x ./hl2-optirun.sh

~~And finally to run:~~

    ./hl2-optirun -game tf -steam

~~This was made pretty hastily and only tested once. I should have a better version sometime soon. Feel free to [add me on Steam](http://steamcommunity.com/id/CyberXZT) if you need any assistance.~~

* Tomb-ah's guide was incomplete sure, but I hardly think it was dangerous. He should have called it the rock climbing rope guide and left ice climbing out of it. Other than that he needed to clean up a few minor points but it was a decent first effort. Nothing smacks of elitism more than stating something is useless when it was written by someone with less experience than yourself. 

* The getting started guide was out to lunch for sure, but it was called out and downvoted appropriately. You can't hang your argument on what a new redditor submits to this subreddit.

* If you think /r/climbing is terrible due to the user base, I have yet to see you provide a solid example of how the user base here gets a major detail regarding climbing incorrect on a regular basis. Mostly what you are complaining about is inaccurate or incorrect titles, with most of the comments within the post straightening OP out. 

* I have argued many times that free soloing is bad and that a guy like Alex Honnold shouldnt get the camera time he does, yet he remains a god around these parts. So I will acknowledge that /r/climbing maybe has a fetish about indulging danger, but if you look in the Friday New Climber Thread for last week, you can see me get into it with a new commenter who suggested I was being ""overly safe"" by recommending that OP get in touch with a guide. So while I acknowledge your point, I certainly don't see a resolution in your post, just a statement that is makes me want to respond with, ""in other news water is wet, sky is blue.""

True,Fjosnisse,,,"I frequent SRS, SRSDiscussion, as well as SRD, antiSRS, and SRSSucks. Although my tag is in European Integration, I've had a significant amount of exposure not only to revolutionary literature but feminist and disability literature as well. 
For starters, I don't really see it as a safeplace for minorities since it is first and foremost a ""circlejerk"". They even identify themselves as a ""circlejerk"" in their sidebar:

&gt;RULE X: SRS is a circlejack and interrupting the circlejack is an easy way to get banned.

Essentially this means that dissent is not permitted and even if you are part of a minority group, if your opinions aren't inline with those of the ""SRS Hive mind"" you're essentially asking for a ban. I can't see how any place that does not allow some degree of dissent from the official ""narrative"" to be a safe place for anybody. 

On top of that, the motto ""misandry don't real"" continuously appears in their subreddit which is essentially an outright rejection of the idea that ""misandry"" can exist. To add to this they reject the idea of reverse racism, basically meaning that if you are white and a male (a member of the privileged class/gender) then it is impossible to be on the receiving end of 'racism'. The problem with this perspective is that it creates a false dichotomy, namely that there are only two groups of people in the world: oppressed and oppressor. Their fallacy is in assuming that all members of a particular race/gender automatically fit into one of these two roles and that it is not your own actions or position in society that is relevant, but your position (broadly) relative to everybody else. The logic reads something like this: if you are rich and white, you are privileged because historically whites have been/are privileged. If you are black and rich, you are oppressed because other black people are oppressed. Essentially, rather than trying to prove their conclusion through their premises, they formulate their premises based on their conclusions. 

Now a SRS retort to what I've just said would probably read something similar to: well, you're a privileged male and we don't have to organize our subreddit along your guidelines/ideas. And this is a completely fair assessment. But I think the major problem is that what SRS pretends to do and what they actually do, doesn't exactly line up. And rather than create a safespace for minorities, they use the subreddit not to elevate but to bring down.. in short, their goal is not equality among genders and races, but simply to call out ""shitlords"" for their behaviour. 

[This post](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSsucks/comments/13gp5i/inner_turmoil_in_srs_land_apparently_so_as_this/) in /r/SRSsucks shows the extent to which there is a divide in SRS itself and many SRSers have voiced dissatisfaction with the trajectory of the 'fempire'. 

As well, I think it's important to note that there is some confusion when it comes to the subreddits that oppose SRS. AntiSRS doesn't so much oppose the SRS ideology as it does its tactics and I think this is a fair stance. There is a significant amount of racism and misogyny on reddit, I don't think many would dispute that. What I think many would dispute is this idea that just because you are born white and male that you occupy a privileged position in society, no matter what.

True,turdburglersc,,,"i thought id hijack this thread to explain to people posting here who either dont understand what halo 2 was, or who never played it, why it was probably the best competitive fps game on the xbox systems.  some of these features remain in current halo games, some have gone.  all of them are missing in most cod style 'modern military shooters'.  the reason i havent played the newer halos for any length of time (i havent even bought the newest one) is because i feel like as they become more and more like cod.  they become less fun, and less competitive.

it was the last of the great 'arcade shooters'.  everything about it was designed to make it more fun and less frustrating.  its easy to truly see how great this game was by just comparing it to your standard modern warfare clone of the last 5 years, the type of games that have killed the competitive fps scene.

* your reticule doesnt adjust size as you move.  this reduces rng, is less favourable to camping and unlike in cod; guns feel truly different.  even in halo odst and similar they started introducing guns with a variable reticule, this is so un-halo it hurts ;/  i know most people will probably counter with ""but it adds realism to be less accurate when you move"", but i would ask you to consider if it makes the game more fun?  in halo you have an effective range decided by the reticule, smgs have some of the highest dps in the game but beyond 20 metres or so they suck donkey dick.  in cod every gun, while standing still can work at long range, this makes gun choice less relevant.  in halo actually landing the shot isnt any harder, but its about consistency against a moving target landing 1 pot shot with your smg doesnt matter.  in cod landing 1 random shot while run can and does kill people...how rewarding.

* you had a radar that showed you movement around you.  this allowed you to learn more about the maps and display a deeper knowledge.  and again reduced the effectiveness of camping.

* the shield health combination/dyamic.  this allowed certain guns and gun combinations to be more successful.  you could equip yourself to burn through shields faster, or to be able to land head shots once those shields were gone (or somewhere in between).  this allows you to display both knowledge and skill again without the frustration in 'cod games' where you get your head blown off in an instant by any gun in the game with a bit of bad luck.

* everyone starts with the same gun and then loots more from the map.  this stops the frustration of those 'kids' you see on halo who noobtube and/or stack explosives.  in cod you can secure a &gt;1.0 kill ratio by just taking every explosive weapon in your set up, you cant display skill because you run out of ammo so fast but you can be sure to take down 1 person, this is a low skill high reward strat and is frustrating to play against.  in halo, 'power weapons' are obtained from map control and good play, you earn the right to use them.  if you die to a rocket, its entirely your own fault for bad map awareness.

* every gun felt different.  i know i brought this up briefly before but its worth its own topic.  in cod you can get shotgunned across a large hall, you can get machine gunned across the whole map - and with 2-3 shot kills this is effective.  in halo, landing 1/30 shots with your smg is like pissing in to the wind.  each gun serves its purpose, even the smg and plasma rifle are amazing when used correctly, but even the rocket launcher has bad 'match ups'.  understanding the guns was a skill, in cod you can use any smg to the same effect, its just a case of unlocking the one with the best stats.

* no kill streaks.  apparently its the cool thing these days to not only discourage team work but reward you with arbitrary gifts.  a guy in cod can, on a regular basis, care-package their way to an ac130 or whatever its new name is this year for 3 solo kills they can earn up ~8 more kills for free, not only are they rewarded bonus points but the game subjects you to the frustration of dying to the big plane in the sky.  this makes no sense and it isnt fun for either side, if i wanted to play a point and click adventure (ac130/predator missile cams) why would i be on cod?

* no instant deaths/lag deaths.  in halo 2 you never drop dead for no reason.  even with well played snipers, your team of 4 can easily tell you where he is, and the maps were designed to enable you to avoid their line of sight.  in cod the maps are bad and people can end your lives in a variety of ways where you had no option.  the real issue though, which just adds salt to the wound (because all online games have some lag no matter what), in cod you can die before your computer even sees the guy.  if they have a faster connection than you, they can pull the trigger and you havent even seen them, multiple times a game.  in halo2 this never happens, it takes 5+ seconds to kill someone in a smg/battle rifle duel and even the more deadly weapons like the plasma pistol or rocket have a dodgeable projectile.  instant death is unfun.

this has turned in to more of an anti-cod rant than a pro halo2 one and for that im sorry, but really im just trying to point out that for a fulfilling multiplayer experience nothing recently has come close to halo2.  all these modern military shooter clones are systemically unfun all the way up from the mechanics and design.  they are designed to frustrate the player by blurring the lines between skilled and unskilled, the cynical side of me would argue they do this on purpose so that you cant settle with a game for more than 12 months, so you will always buy next years addition of the franchise.  they appeal to lowest common denominator players who want to always be able to kill people no matter the skill disparity and who can use brain dead strategy to secure instant gratification.  i havent even gone in to the pretty great (for console) matchmaking service, or bungie's amazing attitude to DLC or the lightyears ahead of its time online stats service.

halo 2 really was the pinicle of what the xbox has delivered so far, i devoted i think 18 months of my life to that game, making some great friends, and being entertained every single day.  it really makes me sad to see what has become of the fps market.  i have so much more i could rave about this game but im scared of boring everyone :)

True,SaltyBabe,,,"Who you are ""as a man"" has literally nothing to do with your penis or what kind of sex you have. Being a good man or person transcends those things. I understand you're saying this conflicts with your sexual identity or preference however there are many amazingly good, strong, masculine men who are gay or have things unusual about their genitals. 

I wish you could see that who you are, as a man, was never about your penis or who you dated and how you got off. Being a ""real man"" is about so much more than your dick and I hate seeing that you've distilled the meaning if life to mean ""I have to have a penis, I have to have kids."" Because that is simply untrue. 

You are valuable, you are worthy and deserve an awesome future, just as much if not more now that you've been through so much. Women can be pleased in more ways than just vaginal intercourse and you too could probably achieve some level of sexual satisfaction if you have an open mind. A wife and kids don't revolve around your penis and balls. Women can and will love a good man despite something like this and there are countless children in the world who would love to look into your eyes and call you Father, they don't care if you have a penis either by the way. 

I'm sure it's been a horrible ordeal but please, realize, you are so much more than what you've lost. You can have a normal and happy life. Don't give up on that.

True,pluis,,,"Let me tell you about my own experiences: I'm a smart lady with a post-grad education. I'm good at communicating and have a history of (pretty) healthy long-term relationships. Conventional wisdom makes us believe that people like you and me don't end up in abusive relationships. But we do. I spent five years in one.

We do, because we're used to being able to fix so many things. To talk through issues and resolve them. And when we fall in love and we fall hard and we find someone with whom our relationship appears unfixable, we invest in this idea that if we make ourselves small enough, we may just succeed. We may just fix it. But we can't. The only way to ""fix"" a relationship that is abusive, is to make ourselves smaller and smaller until we're pretty much gone. And then we'll still be at the receiving end of anger and insults, but we'll have started to believe that we deserve it. Because if only we could fix this relationship by ourselves, this wouldn't happen to us. We wouldn't be abused, if we were able to fix the relationship. And that's how we spiral down into guilt and blame for our own fallibility.

A relationship takes two, though. If there are two horses in front of a plow, and only one pulls, you go in circles. That's what's happening here and what happens in unfixable relationships all over the world. 

So it's not humiliating to quit. It shows your strength and your capacity to realize that something is destructive to you. It shows you have the courage to step away from a fight you can't win. It shows all people everywhere that staying with an abusive partner is _not_ what you should do. It shows others, who may also feel scared and humiliated that leaving is the _right_ thing to do.  

With regards to your concern for your ex's self-harm: he is a grown man, who is responsible for his own actions. He keeps saying you're the culprit for your fights. He then self-harms in response to arguments for which (according to him) you are responsible. 

Let's look at his statement that ""this"" is all your fault. 

Either this is true (spoiler: it isn't), in which case you leaving would have a beneficial effect on his psyche. That's what he says, right? So no more self-harm if you leave.

If it isn't true (bingo! His problems exist independent of you and he has admitted such himself), you leaving is neither the cause nor the cure for his problems. His self harm will either stop or continue, but you won't influence it. 

Let's make this clear: your ex has issues. Anger issues that lead him to abuse others and harm himself. He also has an emotionally manipulative side. It is possible that the self-harm plays a role there too, but I don't know, because I don't know him. 

Leaving him won't harm him. It may hurt his feelings (because he wants you to stay and take more blame for his issues - it makes him feel better about himself), but it won't harm him. If you're lucky (and he is smart) you leaving may lead to him getting help for his issues. 

I promise you, staying will enable him to not confront his issues and will lead to you getting hurt, If you leave, you'll certainly save yourself, and maybe him as well. ",0,1353409345,,0,False,1,c745t89,t3_13i4is,t1_c745t89,t1_c745prn,,1430454633,1006,False,relationships,t5_2qjvn,1006

Back from TechEd Madrid with answers to some of your questions...

All the existing BEx functionality will work as before when it comes to reporting from BW on top of HANA. In this scenario HANA is implemented as the database of BW, replacing oracle, maxdb, whatever is used. 

The dimensionality of the cube will technically disappear, eventhough you can still have dimensions to organize your info-objects. Master data can be shared across all InfoProviders just like before.

As for creating universes, my understanding you can do it both ways, depending on your requirement and datamodel. The neat thing about BW on Hana is that the normal BW-stuff is visible under it's own schema in Hana Studio, and you can create Hana models under another schema.  Need this stuff in BW? Create a Virtual Provider on top your analytic view and proceed in BW as you would with any other InfoProvider. Great feature if you need to combine realtime with history data in your bex reporting. 

I haven't tested the BICS connection, but my guess is that there is no limit here, as HANA is just a database in this scenario. Same goes for performance comparison when creating variables, haven't had the chance yet to try it out. 

BEx Query performance should be very good on Hana optimized InfoProviders, but to get the best out of BW on Hana, there is a lot of work in remodeling redundant infocubes, pushing calculations that are done in transformation routines to be done in the Hana calculation layer and much more...

True,Lupicia,,,"You're right, but while FAS includes a lot supports to state and local governments (public service R&amp;D, school lunch, and direct payments to state and local gov'ts, etc.), it doesn't actually count federal services rendered to citizens directly - like interstate highways, contracts to Boeing, FAFSA, military salaries, census data, flood insurance, grants, etc. 

A more complete capture of federal spending by state is to look at the Census Bureau's report of Federal Funds--Summary Distribution by State: [here is 2009's.](http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/2012/tables/12s0479.pdf)

Texas traditionally ""pulls its weight"" or just a bit more. But Texas actually got back a smidge more than it paid in taxes in 2009 - probably due to higher unemployment during the recession. **The total federal budget spending on Texas in 2009 was [$227 billion](http://www.usgovernmentspending.com/federal_spending_by_state.php?chart=Z0&amp;year=2009&amp;units=b&amp;rank=t), with [$200 billion](http://www.usgovernmentrevenue.com/federal_revenue_by_state.php?year=2009&amp;chart=Z0&amp;units=b&amp;rank=t) in taxes collected - $27 B underpaid.** 

In 2007 it was $225.4 B paid in taxes, $171.8 B got in federal spending = $53.6 B overpaid; in 2005 it was $169.4 B paid in taxes and $148.7 B got in federal spending = $20.7 B overpaid.

Texas often pays a bit more, but not nearly the huge near-200 billion overpayment you quote above.

In my opinion, and some may disagree, it is almost always better to have a single dedicated card. The only time an xfire set-up makes sense, is when you already have the best single card available in your machine and adding another is the only way to increase performance, or, adding another card is way cheaper than just upgrading to a better card, and your just trying to squeeze some extra performance out of your existing set-up. The problem is, as soon as the cost of adding a second card drops below $100,  there are going to be single cards out there for around $200 that will come close to, if not out-perform, your dual-card set-up, and with much less of the headache (game profiles, heat, power consumption, etc.).

She just was being plain selfish, she would not allow me to have the time to grieve, the time to move on from her. Basically she wanted to hang out with me everyday, do what we used to do, just not sex, no kissing, no cuddling. So heartbroken and missing her, I was dumb enough to go out and hang out with her as much as possible. 
But then I realized one day, while eating at Tijuana Flats, that I was sitting next to her and we were both laughing... I realized that someone else could be sitting there. Someone who would love me, and care for me. Someone who would not break my heart like the woman that was presently there. And if i were to spend the little free time I had with her, I would just never be able to move on from her, and find the right girl for me. 

She was a horrible girlfriend btw. She cared only about herself, she had every single mental disorder in the book, and she was depressed, and always anxious. Yet through all of the hard times I stayed by her. And now I'm glad she is someone elses problem.

True,Unidan,,,"Ecologist here!

This actually made me think about the topic of microclimates and minor heterogeneity in what many consider to be a singular, uniform system!

If these two microenvironments (frosted vs unfrosted) exist, you can expect different processes happening ecologically which are completely dependent on cars being parked there to cast a shadow.  

Areas that are frosted or shaded are going to do significantly less photosynthesis due to less light and *also* due to reduced temperatures which put the photosynthesis curve out of its optimal point.  This means that frosted areas, all else being equal, are reducing their CO2 consumption from the atmosphere compared to the areas receiving sunlight.  

Additionally, if more frost is able to stay on that area of grass for longer and percolate into the soil due to a slow raise of ambient temperature (not direct radiation which removes the frost from unshaded areas), we may assume that frosted areas have wetter soils.  Wetter soils increases the rate of denitrification in the soil (conversion of nitrates in the soil to free nitrogen in the atmosphere).  This process is not always a complete one though, sometimes producing N2O.  Soil microfauna will produce N2O (an extremely potent greenhouse gas) and N2 as they use the nitrates and other compounds as electron acceptors in anaerobic environments, such as one that may exist in a ""more frosty"" microclimate.

Dry terrestrial soils, additionally, are methane consumers.  Soil microbes may use methane as an energy source; however, they also use nitrogen compounds, as stated above.  The two processes achieve a balance, though, which means one soil that is doing one is *not* doing the other.  So a soil that is wet will produce N2/N2O and *not* uptake methane.  

What does this mean?  It means that frosted areas may produce more nitrous oxide (N2O) and take up *less* methane (CH4) than their non-frosted counterparts.  They also remove less carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere.

**tl;dr:** I hypothesize that, on a microclimate basis, areas of grass shaded, and thereby frosted, by cars contribute more to global climate change than areas that are unshaded.

I was thinking ""Man I get to see her, we are laughing, like old times"" But it was not like the old times. It was different because at that moment she was the person that took money from my account for Rent( after I had been locked out of my own home, she took rent for the full month, and utilities) She didn't let me get my things from our home, she had them packed by her family and delivered to my parents place. She was the person that said that I was her only stable Boyfriend and that She had loved me so much, and wished that I was the one for her, but she had no passion for me. She said she wanted passion instead of stability. (Granted I was a passionate man, romantic, and all. I never forgot an anniversary/birthday. I always did great things for her, bought her small trinkets whenever, bought her great gifts, wrote her some poems, I was very passionate with her physically, I serenaded her, you name it I did it. I'm an excellent Boyfriend. To attest to that, she proposed to me! I was there for her emotional, mentally, and physically.) 

Sorry for the tangent there. But it provides context to my statement. I could not sit there with a person that treated me to horribly. If it were a guy friend, we wouldn't even be talking at all if he took money from me. So I did ""nut"" up, and told her that I can't do this, I told her that I need to be able to move on. She cried and said that she always thought that I would be a part of her life. And I said ""What do you expect me to do?

True,CausaMortis,,,"&gt;Homosocial bonding is different between men and women, and this causes a lot of confusion and why it's assumed that men and women cannot be friends.
&gt;Men see their friendships as camaraderie, hanging out, occasional complaining, and chilling. There's plenty of support mechanisms in place, but they're not intimate, per se.
&gt;Women on the other hand are intimate, affectionate, they talk more about how they feel than how things happened. The support mechanisms are explicitly intimate.
&gt;So, men who are not used to intimate physical contact and discourse have to translate a person of the opposite sex being physically and emotionally intimate beyond the boundaries of relationships he is used to.
&gt;Women may say that this is really the man's fault for getting his hopes up, but it's worth noting that [1] [scientists have found that this disparity in relationships has an actual significant effect on different genders.](http://hsb.sagepub.com/content/51/2/168.abstract) Men and women are programmed differently.
&gt;As the study shows, women share their emotional intimacy through much broader networks. They don't restrain it for that one special person. They give it out freely. They take it in easily.
&gt;And also, as the study shows, men reserve their emotional intimacy for one special person. They rely on that person. They hold back until they find someone they can trust and then pour it out to them.
&gt;This actually makes male intimacy a far more dear thing than female intimacy. This is why men ""overreact."" This is why men panic. Above all, this is why the Nice Guy misreads his interactions with a woman he likes.
&gt;Of course, this has an interesting side-effect. To wit, when bad relationships end and men are single, they actually do better emotionally than single women do because what a man derived from the relationship had a higher cost for him. Men don't mind being called ""single,"" what they mind is having their only intimate outlet being in jeopardy or, worse, being turned against them, such as in a bad relationship
&gt;                 
Bad relationship - The men do better emotionally because they have already lost their only intimate partner, so there's almost zero net loss for them. Presumably the only loss is the small amount of nookie he was getting at the end.
&gt;                    
Good relationship - The men do worse, as you stated, because they lost their only intimate partner. I presume though this means when the man is satisfied with the relationship and the woman breaks it off, as opposed to the man breaking off a good relationship for whatever reason (ex. he wants to pursue other options). However, I still feel in the latter scenario they still take it harder if no other intimate partner is found within an adequate time frame.

&gt;In opposition to this, when women are single, they actually do worse than when they are in bad relationships. A woman in a bad relationship still has her emotional network intact. A woman who is single has instead had her relationship status changed.
&gt;Now you can look at the nice guy phenomenon through a sharper lens. Men are used to emotional intimacy being saved for a special person, women are not. Women find emotional stability in poor romantic relationships, while men do not.
&gt;This confuses the fuck out of the Nice Guy. None of this makes sense. A woman is being emotionally intimate with him, he thinks he's special since that's how he would act. A woman stays in a bad relationship, he thinks it's illogical since that's not how he would act. Combined, this becomes the ""I would be good to you, what's wrong with you!"" mindset.
&gt;Of course, he doesn't understand that a woman has cultivated many intimate relationships with friends and family while he has been working on the one trying to develop a romance. The woman doesn't need to get her emotional support from her romantic relationship. In fact, she can spend all day talking about how bad her relationship is -- but at least she's not single, and maybe her partner provides some other value beyond emotional intimacy.
&gt;In regard to how the nice guy is viewed, the woman sees his actions as those of just another friend, since that's how she would act toward her friends -- freely intimate, physically affectionate. When the guy doesn't get what he wants, she will sometimes feel betrayed, primarily because he has willingly integrated himself into her network and then has destroyed the status quo.
&gt;
&gt;It's worth noting that there become unspoken non-rules about flirting and relationships. If a man is physically affectionate with multiple women, it's probably safe to befriend him since he probably isn't going to balk at his intimacy not developing into romance. It also probably means that he's not going to respond to romantic advances as quickly. Interestingly enough, this may all be at the root of our inculcated romantic steps. Men are usually non-intimate, so intimacy means romantic interest. Women are usually intimate, so sexual interest means romantic interest. Oddly enough, there is still an expectation for men to make the first move in such an environment.
&gt;Over the years, a mix of misogyny, misandry, entitlement, and sheer ignorance and indifference to all parties involved have turned this issue into a point of contention. Everyone is trying to translate it through a universal precept of human interaction, often ceding to one side or the other points they have not actually managed to make out of politeness or self-loathing or whatever.
&gt;As you can see, men get over it faster than women do. Not universally, of course, but men are more comfortable being single than women are. This is where the myth of ""commitment-phobic"" men comes in. For men, advances in one's relationship are emotionally expensive, each step more costly than the next. For women, it is effectively a status change.
&gt;Like all studies, generalizations are merely a recognition of the trend in a group. Personal anecdotes and asides are all well and good and I am not trying to discount them. That said, the trends are apparent.
&gt;
&gt;**TL;DR** Male platonic relationships are friendly camaraderie, female platonic relationships are intimate and physical. When men try to be friends with women, they sometimes misinterpret each other's intent and feel betrayed when things do not go as expected.
&gt;This also has an effect on initiated romantic relationships as well, since each partner is investing and seeking something different in each stage.

*Own opinion* For me this analyse explained a lot of things about my own experiences and those of others. Per example, I know a lot of girls who are friends with guys but have the trouble that these guys ""fall in love"" with them over and over again. Which has to do with the fact they get emotionally invested with them. While at the same turn this explains why I refuse to remain friends with ex-girlfriends, because I have always had the feeling I couldn't continue my own life with them still in the picture.

True,CrazyLemurBoy,,,"You are going to need a well built bike to hold up those big boy thighs of yours. I think a more realistic budget is around $2000 for a bike and equipment for a proper touring bike (brand new). You will be shocked to find out that racks &amp; panniers (good ones) will set you back $300-400. Plus a new bike and wheels that can take that kind of abuse. 

Most industry bikes come with 32H wheels with formula hubs. These will not last for you. They did not last for me and I am 6'4"" and 215 lbs. You will need at least 36H wheels with some heavy duty hubs. I use Shimano SLX hubs but I'm a spinner, not a masher. Hadley, Chris King, Phil Wood are all names that are associated with strong hubs.  For your rear wheel you will probably be better off with 40H or even higher. Most tandem teams combined weigh as much or just a bit more than you do alone, and they need these beefy wheels. You are going to need a frame with a heavier duty tubeset. I like 700c wheels due to the versatility, but 26"" wheels are inherently stronger due to shorter spoke length. You probably want wide rims like Sun Rhyno Lites or Rhyno Lites XL for the wide tires you will be using (you will be using wide tires, right?)

True,ritebkatya,,,"Within the context of relativity, electric and magnetic fields are simply Lorentz-transformed versions of each other.  The difference between the two is only apparent in some defined rest frame.

E (electric) and B (magnetic) fields can be written in terms of the (4-dimensional) vector potential, which relates the electric and magnetic fields under Lorentz transformations.  This quantity is what is used to construct the Lorentz-invariant E&amp;M field strength tensor F.  Likewise, gravity has a field strength tensor known as the ""metric tensor"", so there are analogues between electromagnetism and gravity.

There is no a priori ""electric/magnetic field"" division for gravity (at least Einstein's version of gravity) since it was originally constructed in a Lorentz invariant way.  However lorgfeflkd is correct in saying that a varying gravitational fields can produce gravitational radiation, which is in some ways a bit like electromagnetic radiation (where the oscillating E and B fields induce each other and propagate).

Edit: Lots of other people have pointed out ""gravitomagnetism"". While this effect is real, shows up only as an approximation to Einstein's gravity.  The cool thing that I'm trying to get across is that the difference between classical electric and magnetic fields is just your velocity relative to charged particles (ie the ""creation"" of B-fields is an effect of relativity, like time dilation or length contraction!) - in point of fact E and B fields are actually the same thing just measured differently depending on your frame of reference.  Likewise in Einstein's gravity although there is this ""magnetic"" effect, it is still just an artifact of your chosen reference frame and not a real difference between two types of fields.

True,Oxshevik,,,"I worked at the Olympics this summer as an Accreditation Client Manager (Fun fact: I got sacked after heckling David Cameron http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/jun/28/david-cameron-heckler-employed-olympics) and there was some real dodgy shit going on with the provision of visas. 

Basically, the accreditation passes that we were sending out to members of Olympic and Paralympic team delegations acted as visa waivers to get into the UK. Because anybody with one of these passes could get into the country, every single person's details had to be sent to the Home Office so that the police could run automated background checks before we were allowed to accredit them and send them their passes. The Home Office had a contract with LOCOG to say they would complete each background check within X days of receiving, and as the Games drew closer, this turnaround time was reduced to one week. In other words, a National Olympic Committee would submit the details of a member of their delegation to our system, we would check that all the required information had been introduced (name, passport details, place and date of birth, etc.) and then we would forward that information on to the government for background checks. The information would then be either approved or rejected within a week and we would send off the Accreditation Pass (and visa waiver) to that person. Herein lies the fuck-up.

In a special meeting called by a senior manager, we were told that the Home Office, ever-committed to meeting target deadlines, approved massive numbers of people for entry into the UK without actually performing the background checks. This meant that we had sent out visa waivers, which were valid from the time of printing, to people who may not be allowed to enter the country. in fact, some of the passes we sent out had to be cancelled as the recipients had failed their background checks, but if they had already entered the country there was nothing we could do.
Instead of pushing the Home Office to get its arse into gear or delaying the printing of accreditation passes, we were given a blacklist of countries to whom we could not send passes until after a certain date, but most of these had already been delivered.
Unfortunately, the press were never able to get confirmation of this from LOCOG or the Home Office, so no stories were run on it.

**TLDR**; In order to meet targets, LOCOG and the Home Office allowed visas for entry into the UK to be sent to individuals who had not undergone background checks. ",0,1353456954,,0,1353609391,1,c74gzgm,t3_13j4d4,t1_c74gzgm,t3_13j4d4,,1430460014,1346,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,1346

True,[deleted],,,"Trust is a difficult thing - being one of those intangible, invisible emotion things it's hard to identify or tie down. When you start off in life (and in relationships) it's there implicitly. But with time and experience, we unlearn it. Kind of like how school teaches kids to be less creative we suddenly find ourselves unable to access it, and because we never really knew what it was in the first place and never had to work to find it before, we find ourselves completely lost.

First off - every day, every relationship, every moment is an opportunity to work on developing trust. A choice between picking up someone else's phone to read their messages, and not. A choice between entertaining those insecurities about why she's hugging that guy, and not. A choice between letting your past control your emotions, and not. You can actively change your actions and your thoughts. What's better, the more you realise and do this, the more you realise that *it feels good* to believe in yourself, your partner, your love. And the less you entertain the ideas of treason, the less they come up.

Second, it's important to be aware. Aware of your expectations in a relationship, and your partners. Aware of your insecurities, and your partners. Aware of your actions, and your partners, and how those actions and insecurities mingle. Hand in hand with awareness is communication. Making sure you're abe to convey to you partner if and when you're having a difficult time with trust, what they can do to help, where the boundaries are etc, and that they are comfortable and able to convey that to you. A heart breaking, soul destroying and life rupturing affair can be stopped at first glance just by being able to say to your partner ""Hwoar! She's a bit of alright!"" about the hot girl on the other side of the room, while putting your arm around her so she knows where your heart lies.

Third and final, things are going to hurt. Things are going to challenge your trust. Your partner is not you, and will act freely and sometimes do things that cross your boundaries. This is ok, and certainly not the end of the world. And if your partner does something unforgiveable and drops your litte red ball of trust, well, that's ok too. Because it's still your little red ball to play catch with anyone you want. 

Trust is part of the process of making yourself vulnerable to another human being. It means putting another human being in a position to be able to hurt you, but having faith (and acting with that faith) that they will choose not to.",0,1353470904,,0,False,1,c74kc74,t3_13jpz4,t1_c74kc74,t3_13jpz4,,1430461591,1,False,relationships,t5_2qjvn,1

True,AsiaExpert,asia,"China, Korea, and Japan","Excellent reference. I will have to to see if I can get some of the works that this Nieminen has put out for reading. Absolutely captured my interest. 

Your train of thought is right on the money with the idea that the vast majority of enemies that the Chinese armies dealt with were **nomadic raiders**. Europeans however, were constantly fighting one another. European kingdoms that confronted one another in their many wars were **constant and major threats** to one another, providing massive incentives to constantly continue improving their military technology to gain even the slightest advantage. 

There's also the fact that, as raised elsewhere, European battles were often **massed formations vs massed formations**. This assumption is the basis for much of European military doctrinal development over hundreds of years. In such an environment, the firearm would be quite effective, and its development was pursued to even greater effect. 

Chinese military doctrine, however, was decidedly based on the wars that they fought against the **nomadic people** that called the hilly, mountainous steppes their home. These steppe people fought primarily on horseback, **eschewing mass formations** for the tactical &amp; strategic advantages of being a **highly mobile and flexible force**. Fighting against this kind of enemy, Chinese armies and generals developed completely different military doctrines. 

They needed cavalry and mobile forces that would be able to keep up with these nomads, or else they would have to sit back helplessly as their settlements burned and their people put to the sword. **Guns of the time period would only slow them down** and simply were not effective enough to warrant the extra weight, expense, and effort to manufacture, ship and store. Bows, **especially crossbows**, which were a central weapon to many Chinese armies (a discussion for another time), were just deemed better bang for the buck. Most commanders did not place great faith in guns. 

It would only be much much later that more streamlined, efficient and most importantly *lighter* guns were being made in sufficient numbers. 

**Chinese-made firearms and artillery pieces suffered from extremely low quality**. They were notoriously inaccurate, and depending on the manufacturer (zero standardization was how things were back in the day, for everyone), were prone to breakage during the middle of battle, if not **outright exploding** and harming the soldier/crew. Even when they did not break, they were still horrendously inaccurate, usually rendering them useless for anything target smaller than *a whole freaking city*. This improved with time, especially as iron smithing techniques improved, removing more impurities and increasing the strength of pieces. 

Even then, the only thing they really used was **artillery, usually during sieges** as they were often **too slow to reach open battlefields** in time to be used. They would be used in conjunction with catapults/mangonels to rain fire down on walls and battlements. Unfortunately, because of the weak bodies of the pieces, the **caliber of rounds were too small** to be of any use in knocking down walls. Their main job was **suppressive fire** to try and cover the advance of battering rams and ladders. 

As such, the cannon was most often deployed **defensively**, in fixed positions on ramparts and walls looking outward. However it was quickly proven virtually useless against the nomads. Their riding 'formations' (or rather the lack there of) were simply too loose for cannon fire to do considerable amount of damage. The settlements would usually stand or fall regardless of whether or not cannons were present, other factors being more important. But the Chinese would learn a second hard lesson: the cannons that didn't perform well against loose cavalry was much more useful against the **deep ranks of disciplined Chinese infantry**, as shown when nomads captured the cannons and used them against relief forces. Imagine the look on their faces when they think they've arrived in time to defend the city, and then they hear cannon shots...

Even in a defensive capacity, artillery or otherwise, firearms did not reach any appreciable level of usefulness until the **Portuguese arrived with European made weapons**, which were vastly superior to Chinese made firearms. The biggest factors were the more **well developed gunpowder**, allowing for more force, meaning more range. The metalworking for the **firearms were also considerably stronger**, and much fewer casting errors owing to excellent European steel, meaning better accuracy and lower rates of 'failure', to put it lightly. The evolution of gunpowder weapons from rudimentary boom sticks to reliable human reaper had reached a turning point. 

The Chinese were not stupid, **nor were they 'too prideful' to borrow** from Western ideas. In fact they took immediately to copying the crap out of any Portuguese weapons they could get their hands on. Within a decade, the Chinese were making weapons of similar quality, albeit still coming out of the learning curve. But manufacturing was slow and arduous work. The **infrastructure was not in place** for the constant, steady production of such high quality machines. It took everything they had to just copy European works in small numbers, nevermind producing their own major advancements. Meanwhile, Europe was already improving on their own firearms, and always making more, selling a few here and there. 

Thus, the pace was set. **Europe was the forerunner in all things ""gun""** and the rest of the world could only play catch up at best, picking up the crumbs that Europeans let fall from their table. And the Europeans making some serious dough on the way too.   

How did Europe keep this lead? My answer would be that **European societies were more organized** (I know this is a very broad blanket statement, but bear with me!). They were simply able to direct their resources, manpower, and regional (national? anachronistic, I know) power more effectively. They could get more out of their people in a shorter amount of time with less effort and so they had more to work with. Their infrastructure and organizational systems as kingdoms/countries, in addition to the drive of constant warfare, or the constant threat of warfare, made all the difference. 

European countries consistently held **military development as a major focus of the country as a whole**, pouring resources and men in concerted efforts to make progress. 

China, on the other hand, was constantly suffering from **the malaise of controlling a massive empire**. The rulers had to deal with near constant internal strife, corruption, the all to always-present risk of rebellion and civil war, borders that stretched for thousands of miles, bandits, raiders, nomads as well as natural disasters like famine and plague. Their focus laid with always **maintaining the balance of the house of cards** that could at any moment, collapse. The all important 'harmony of land under heaven'. 

**Military ingenuity was not pursued as a national interest** and military doctrine suffered for it. This is where I think, ultimately, the 'gap' originates from. Of course it is not *nearly* as simple as I have made it out to be, but in the interest of the question posed, I think this is a good starting point for further research.

True,faunablues,,,"Former Starbucks barista here. I guess these are really more of ordering tips than unscrupulous secrets.

- there is an unlisted size: short (8 oz). This is most cafes' ""small,"" but Starbucks shifted the sizes up a number of years ago (which is why ""tall"" and ""grande"" weren't weird names then), making the venti the largest. You can get any hot drink short. 

- we have a number of flavor syrups that aren't listed on the menu, just ask what we have. Also, despite what many customers think, we have peppermint year round, so we can make peppermint mochas and peppermint white mochas any time of the year. Gingerbread and pumpkin spice *are* seasonal, but we may not run out of stock for quite a while, so if it's February there's still a chance. 

- bring your own cup, save 10 cents. Might have to remind the cashier, we forget sometimes. 

- you can get a drink ""for here"" and get it in ceramic/glass, feel fancy, waste less. 

- edited to add: 50 cent refills on coffee, iced tea, or iced coffee (not espresso beverages)

- iced large drinks have extra everything, on account of being 24 and not 20 ounces - extra espresso shot, extra pump of syrup. 

- it's honestly not that annoying that you have a very specific drink order. It breaks up the monotony, and it's nice not to be a vanilla latte robot. Sometimes people would ask for weird things that I'd make for myself later and end up liking! (protip: green tea latte with peppermint)

- You can get the matcha green tea as plain, non-milk tea. It's pretty cheap for matcha tea, too. 

- adding a syrup to a drink always costs extra (unless the cashier likes you/doesn't care, which is frequent), unless it's already in that drink. i.e., a caramel frappuccino with extra caramel doesn't cost extra. 

- that delicious caramel sauce is in fact real caramel. That plastic-tasting caramel syrup is not. Many people don't realize we have both - the caramel sauce is what decorates the cup of the caramel frappuccino and on the whipped cream, the caramel syrup is what flavors the actual frappuccino or a caramel latte. 

- a caramel macchiato is a vanilla latte with caramel sauce, and least (Starbucks: ""most"") importantly, the espresso shot put on top of the steamed milk. 

- infrequently ordered, but delicious drink: a marble macchiato. It's like a caramel macchiato but with half mocha syrup, half white mocha. 

- if you want a legit cappuccino and you see jugs of milk on the counter, ask for them to use milk from the fridge. Milk needs to be cold to foam that well. Likewise, if you want a soy cappuccino, you can be a pain in the ass and ask for soymilk from the fridge (they might not even have any in there), since soy will barely foam at room temperature, since the cartons are shelf-stable. 

- if you have no idea what to order, ask us. Since we get free drinks you can count on us trying every single drink in every disgusting combination. Our favorite drink will probably be something excessively complicated we'll be happy to make for you. 

- on that note, if you're like, green tea latte? disgusting or delicious? you can ask us to sample it. we'll make a whole drink and split it into sample cups. No big deal, our manager will probably like us better for promoting drinks anyways, and you don't have to spend money to find out raspberry mochas are gross and green tea is delicious.

- same thing for pastries. We'll sample it if you ask and we have enough (generally yes). 

- if you really like a certain coffee we have but we don't have it brewing, you can ask for a french press version. French press generally tastes better anyway, and iirc it doesn't actually cost any more and you can order whatever size you normally would. We'll probably sample the rest of the pot anyway. However, this will take significantly longer since, for once, we actually have to brew the coffee ourselves. 

- we often forget or get too busy, but we actually have giftwrap, especially around the holidays. Ask and we'll make that overpriced mug purty. 

- I had a few customers with impossible or silly requests. (1) impossibly hot beverages - in excess of 210F. guys. srsly. (2) people who ask for extra hot cappuccinos and are disappointed by them still not being hot enough. This is how a cappuccino is - there's too much air/surface area for the foam layer to ever be hot. If you want hot, get a latte. (3) asking for less-hot milk from the pitchers we've already made. We can't serve milk that has gone below 135, you have to have us make a fresh batch. Sucks for waste, better for you not puking. 

- in terms of dairy allergy/vegan stuff, the caramel sauce, white chocolate syrup, and pumpkin spice syrup all contain dairy. The chai contains honey. The whipped cream is 100% legit heavy cream. The caramel syrup, mocha syrup, and other syrups are non-dairy. This stuff might not matter to the lactose intolerant, but to some it does. For the caffeine-sensitive, the mocha syrup does not actually have any coffee - it's chocolate sauce, and is just named that because it's what we use for mochas. The ""creme-based"" list of fraps is usually pretty short, but there are usually more caffeine-free options, just ask. 

- edit: you can get an ""old school"" iced americano, which is espresso + all ice, instead of espresso + ice + then water to fill

- edit: you can get a café au lait, but it's called a misto (mee-sto). It's half brewed coffee, half steamed milk. Handy if you like lots of milk in your coffee and don't like making it room temperature with it. 

- edit: if you want a little soymilk in your americano, iced coffee, or regular coffee, just ask for it at the bar. I've never seen anyone charge for it. Full cup of soymilk for a latte, yes, 1"" for another drink, no one cares. 

- edit: if you want chai but no sugar/honey, get a chai tea misto. It's half brewed tea (tazo stuff) and half steamed milk. Also costs less! You will have to wait a little longer, since there is actual tea brewing happening. 

- edit: if you like honey, we have it at the bar and can make your drink with it. Works better with hot drinks.

- edit: We have two forms of vanilla - the syrup, and vanilla bean powder used for vanilla bean frappuccinos/caffe vanilla frappuccinos. You can get the powder in any drink, many people think it's tastier, and it has those magical vanilla bean speckles. 

- finally: You are probably worried about being weird, inconvenient, and an asshole. Starbucks customers are the nicest in my experience. I think it's because you're all worried about being a dick. KEEP WORRYING, THANKS

Now for the unscrupulous part:

- in terms of cross-contamination, it's pretty bad. We had blender pitchers labeled ""dairy"" and ""non-dairy,"" but no one cared. The metal pitchers and blender pitches are rinsed out with pressure, and continue to be used throughout the day. The steam wand on the espresso machine (used for heating milks) is cleaned with a rag that soaks in cleaning solution as well as using the steam to clean out the inside, but the cleaning solution is often pretty contaminated with all the milks (if you think about it, wiping off a little milk and then putting it back in the same liquid... even if you change it out frequently, cross contamination is almost immediate). 

- The soymilk *does not* cost more than the dairy. What's more, is it's shelf-stable packaging, and so there's less waste than with dairy. 

- Frappuccinos have the highest profit margin. Watch someone make the drink and it's apparent - it's mostly ice, generally more than the iced drinks (non-blended) gets. Not a real shake by a long shot, but... so delicious...

- those overpriced sandwiches below the pastry case get tossed every night. Yeah, we could take some home, but you always get tired of the food at work and none are particularly great, so yeah. Same goes for ""morning"" pastries mid-day in many Starbucks. Other pastries are given a shelf life of 2-3 days upon arrival, but generally some of those are always tossed too. Occasionally I had a whole, unopened package of something that was expired, though ideally this is minimized. These things go in the dumpster, and many people will understandably go dumpster diving for these - I mean, it's a trashbag full of slightly-dry pastries, some still shrink-wrapped. They purposely place the dumpsters somewhere more secluded to avoid this (they don't want to be liable), but apparently it can easily be figured out.

It's politics. It was never about her. McCain got confused by the mixed messages that the White House had sent out. She was part of that message. If you don't understand the message, then it's hard to trust anyone saying it.

He asked a few questions, the media repeated it a million times, they had meetings 24/7, but the meetings didn't say shit, then he took a break for a press conference, and apparently they still didn't say shit, but he got shit for missing one of them, and now he's getting a grasp of who was saying what and when. 

There we go, done and over and nobody cares, because as it turns out it was a big misunderstanding. Romney tried to capitalize on the 9/11 thing. He pressured the White House into saying something before it was ready. Words fumbled out of various peoples' mouths. Then, because our media sucks and only airs people with motives nobody said the obvious:

Spontaneous protest in Egypt, protesters scaled the walls of the U.S. Embassy, terrorists are like ""Cool we can take over two diplomatic posts and it's 9/11, let's do this shit,"" and they kill four people.

True,intoto,,,"Everyone is giving great advice, so kudos.  I would just add that there are lots of cooking resources on the Internet, in book stores, in book stores on the Internet, on youtube (that is the Internet too), and on television.  

I remember reading a story about a guy who had gotten divorced in his early 30s and in his funk, his family decided it would be a good thing for him to spend a week visiting his aunt and uncle in a different state ... He was moping and feeling sorry for himself, but on the first morning there, his uncle woke him up early for breakfast.  But breakfast was not made yet.  So, he watched and talked to his uncle while his uncle cooked breakfast.  

His uncle made cheese scrambled eggs with hash browns and onions, a side of room-temperature salsa, bacon, melon and buttered wheat toast with local honey.  He also had a small glass of freshly squeezed orange juice and a cup of brewed coffee.  When he gave his nephew the food, everything was cooked to perfection.  Everything that was supposed to be hot was still hot.  The nephew dug in and loved every bite, but at some point made some comment about his uncle not having to go all out to please him.

His uncle responded that what he made was a simple, typical breakfast, and that he had not done anything unusual ... for him.  He went on to say that everyone sets standards for themselves.  Breakfast for many people is just eating sustenance and they have never thought about how they could perfect every step in the process so that you end up making a meal that is the best that you can do.  But if they do strive for ""better"" continuously, at some point the quality of what they produce ends up being consistently very high.

It was more a statement on how you live your life.  Cooking can be a reflection of your approach to everything.  Do the best that you can and if you burn the toast, do it again, right.  Food can be both an expression of how much you care for others as well as a reinforcement for how much you care about yourself.  

For everything you want to cook, there are things you can do to make sure it tastes as good as you can imagine it could taste, and there are things you can do that will minimize the chance that it will not turn out well.  

So, let's think about that breakfast for a minute.  There are numerous videos on youtube that teach you to cook perfect scrambled eggs.  They explain the temperatures, how long to beat them and how to beat them.  How hot the pan should be.  How do you minimize the chance that the eggs will stick.  How to season them, and when.  How a heat-tolerant spatula makes the best utensil to stir the eggs.  When you add cheese and what kind of cheese at what temperature.  When do you remove them from the heat so they don't overcook.

Same with bacon.  Same with hashbrowns.  Same with everything.

If you want to be a better cook, strive to be one.  Take everything one step at a time ... you might try learning to cook a new dish every day, or a new dish every week.  Cook things multiple times and strive to get better each time.

Taste as you go, and if what you are making needs something to enhance the palette of flavor, figure out what that is. 

Flavors are much like scents and the way we perceive them is similar.  We can taste multiple things at one time ... top notes, bottom notes ... after tastes.  Pay attention to those subtle differences and learn to manipulate them to achieve blends that are more satisfying.

For all we know for sure, we live once.  There is no reason to live a life eating substandard food.  Food is important.  Food is sustenance, but a good diet can add ten years to your life, while a bad diet can cut 30 years off your life.  

We are creatures with limited means to interpret the world around us ... and Food is a sensory experience ... 

Striving to be a better cook is a noble and worthwhile goal that pays off with a lifetime of rewards ... every time you eat.  And it can be as much an expression of love as a kind word, a hug, or great sex.

It can be a gift to yourself and those around you.

But no pressure.

Just the like OP, I am totally impressed with the depth and breadth of the responses to her query, and the philosophical discussions here and in bestof.  

Cooking is an art — one that creates disposable works of art.  Those works of art not only keep us alive, they make our lives more worthwhile.  And if you can't or don't want to be a great cook, at least aspire to appreciate those who are ... and the great works they create.

True,[deleted],,,"About a year ago I got involved with this girl. She was incredible, like seriously incredible. She wasn't just smart, cute, funny, and all that stuff she was a genuinely good person. 

Her father is an incredibly rich man (CFO of a store that has hundreds of locations worldwide) yet she never let it get to her. She never flaunted her wealth or anything, she was just content with what she had. Needless to say I fell for her. Hard. 

The first month or so of our relationship was happiest I had been in years (I had severe depression and attempted suicide a few months earlier). She changed me completely inside and out. Before I would make most decisions I would think, ""How would ***** feel about me doing this?"". I had never felt such emotions for another human like this.

So we've been dating for a few months now and I am literally on top of the world. In that time span I had to put my dog down and my grandfather finally passed from dementia and undiagnosed lukemia (All the cancerous symptoms were attributed to his dementia so we didn't know he had cancer until the autopsy). If it wasn't for her being so dependable and loving I would have be an emotional wreck.

Everything is still going great 6 months down the road and we start to talk about sex with each other. Neither one of us were virgins but we both had terrible track records when it came to dating so we figured it would be best to put all physical aspects on the backburner. There's a weekend where she will be home alone and we decide that is the perfect time to move our relationship up a level.

The sex was incredible because it had actual love and passion and it wasn't dictated by physical urges, it was love. That night will forever be engrained into my memory as the best night of my life...

Or so I thought.

Fast forward 5 days later and I notice the head of my penis is a lot more tender than usual, it also seemed to be a bit awkward when I peed. 

I met with a doctor and he told me my foreskin was infected and I was going to need to have it removed. He also informed me if things get worse I might have to have a chunk of my penis cut off. Not the ideal situation but I knew I would have her to help me through it. Also I should mention she felt absolutely terrible about this.

So I wake up from surgery and everything feels fine. The doctor looks at me and says the procedure went fine and there won't be any need for another surgery. I was so relieved!

The doctor then asked if I wanted to see the foreskin he had cut off and I said sure why not. He held it up and I examined it closely out of nowhere It started singing to me, it said...

But you didn't have to cut me off

""To whom it may concern,

My child came home with a custom for our family from our teacher.  The exercise, called 'Five Kernels of Corn', which I have photocopied and attached, tells us that the pilgrims had a ration of only five kernels of corn per day during one of their worst winters, and that the pilgrims put five kernels of corn on their plates to remind themselves of their blessings:

* The first kernel reminds us of the autumn beauty around us.

* The second kernel reminds us of our love for each other.

* The third kernel reminds us of God's love and care for us.

* The fourth kernel reminds us of our friends, especially our Native American brothers.

* The fifth kernel reminds us that we are a free people.

First, this assignment seems dangerously like a school official promoting a religious activity, and promoting in specific a Christian (since this was the god of the pilgrims) worldview.  You may wish to consider the establishment clause of the first amendment, particularly as it is interpreted in Engel v. Vitale, 82 S. Ct. 1261, or the three part test as described in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 91 S. Ct. 2105, or the Endorsement Test as described by Justice O'Connor in Lynch v. Donnelly 465 Ct. 1355.  It's important to note that the original source of this 'five kernels' story is a book entitled 'The Light and the Glory: Did God Have a Plan for America', by Peter J. Marshall, who was not a historian, but a minister, and who is noted for claiming, among other things, that Hurricane Katrina was a product of God's judgement on the people of New Orleans.

Second, I find the historical lesson presented here to be flawed.  First, I wonder if it is historically accurate that 'All of the pilgrims did not die' during this particularly harsh winter.  If so, this seems unusual.  Second, I question whether the Pilgrims actually associated the meanings listed with the five kernels.  Third, I find the fourth kernel's message about the Native Americans to be problematic unless placed in the historical context of the subsequent genocide that took place.  I'd like to see some support from the teacher as to the historical accuracy and value of this lesson.

I would like a letter from the instructor who assigned this lesson with an assurance that this lesson will not be offered in the future, along with answers to the following questions, which are important to me because my child was subjected to this content:

- What is the didactic purpose of this exercise?

- Why was it necessary to choose an exercise that spoke of a specific god and asked children to participate in a ritual, rather than to present a simple history lesson?

- What is the source material for this exercise?  From what book was it drawn?

- Please identify several sources in the historical scholarly literature that support the content of this exercise, including but not limited to the claims that 'All Pilgrims did not die' and that each kernel had a specific meaning as described.

If I do not receive a satisfactory response (the most key element of which is an assurance that this lesson will not be taught in the future) within one month, I will submit a copy of this letter to the district superintendent, each member of the school board, the Freedom from Religion Foundation, the ACLU, and the local media.

True,annoy-nymous,,,"I'm not that bad yet, but physical ailments and pains hit you more often, harder, and stay with you longer. Time was, if I hurt myself (a sprain here and there) or got sick, it was just a matter of waiting a few days to heal. Nowadays even with medical assistance. it's weeks and weeks of aches and pain before something heals. (cuts and scrapes are ok, but muscles, joints, nerves take forever). It's hard to explain, but you slowly lose the illusion of invulnerability you had in your teens and twenties. Parts of you start hurting for no discernible reason. Doctors stop trying to treat or diagnose you and just say ""well you're getting to that age"". 

Losing touch with friends as they get married, have kids, move away, build lives of their own. It gets harder and harder to just hang out. I live in NYC though, your mileage may vary in small towns.

Most painful for some (and leading cause of mid-life crises) is the realization that every day your potential is shrinking. The more you live, the more you're locked into that life. One day you look at yourself and say ""well, this is it. This is all I'll achieve and be this life."" You can either come to terms with it in a healthy way or let it depress you, but it's a very different feeling from the sheer potential you feel when young. Sure, when you were young you knew on some level that your wildest dreams are a long shot, but they COULD happen. That hope dies bit by bit as you age. 

It's also depressing that the people being portrayed in TV, movies, etc as active and interesting become younger than you. When you were younger, it's easy to look at a character in fiction and aspire to be like them in the future. When you're older, you realize you'll never be that because it's already behind you. 

Sorry about the rambling, old age does that to you too. 

Edit: Wow I'm alternately depressing and inspiring people with this post. Regarding the loss of potential: It's less that you're too old, and more that you make sacrifices in what you want to accomplish for the sake of responsibilities that come with age. Supporting a family, children, ailing parents, etc. It's not a bad thing to make those sacrifices, because it means you have something worth sacrificing for.

True,elemento,,,"For a long time the hardest thing was not being pretty anymore. I mean, I was still pretty, but I was no longer the youngest and prettiest in the room. I was no longer able to make a real entrance. People no longer said, ""Who is that thin girl with the blue eyes and the short hair?"" In my thirties I became just one of the moms.

Then, groups of men stopped noticing me. First the ones in their twenties, then thirties, then forties, and as I bear down hard on sixty the group of men most liable to notice me are wearing WWII vet hats. I am dead serious about this.

It's hard to watch your body change shape. Hands, arms, legs, all different than they were--never, never to return. That beautiful young girl has vanished from the face of the earth.

Then my babies began to vanish. My boys, who longed for me to hold them, who snuggled next to me on the couch each night, went away. I felt relief. They were out with their friends, playing in a band, away at college, married. They have wrinkles, gray hair and 401K's. When I see them, they no longer sit next to me. I can no longer rub their hair, over and over; it just wouldn't feel right.

But next, a miracle. I had a grandson and loved him with a passion I never even felt with my own children. People had told me to expect this, but I didn't understand until I saw him....then I understood. But now he is out in the world, at the park, with his friends, and he no longer snuggles with me, because he's ten.

My joints hurt, my thumbs are quite arthritic, and I had an old lady fall this summer, shattering my arm. My mother is growing older and I know that she will grow truly old and ill and die someday. I know that for sure now. My career is stalled, but I do a very good job at what I do, and I find joy in my work and in my competence.

You know how they say you lose brain cells as you age? What a myth. I grow more and more wise, I learn new things every day, and one of my biggest fears is that I will die before I've read all of the books I want to read. But as I grow more wise, people want to hear what I say less and less. So I'm sitting back, taking it all in, letting the great world spin.

True,Warlizard,,,"Seriously, it's a super-long story. I'll wrote about part of it so I'll cut/paste that part.

If there were a single theme to all my stories, it’s that I took every opportunity that was presented to me.  This is the story of a time when getting off my ass led to one of the greatest experiences of my life.

My buddy “Chad” sat down across from me at the chow hall and said, “Let’s go to East Germany tonight.”

The fact he was able to say that still blows me away and probably requires some background.  My whole life growing up, we thought the Russians were going to attack us.  We weren’t sure whether it would be a ground assault like in the movie “Red Dawn” or if they were just going to fire a ton of nukes at us but we were all sure it would happen.

Magazines ran articles about the “Arms Race” and listed how many tanks, missiles, and troops we had compared to the Soviet Army.  Heart-breaking stories about courageous Russian pilots defecting with their MiGs peppered every paper in the country.  Every time someone made it out of a communist country into a free one, we cheered.  We heard constant stories of how horrible it was to live without freedom, to wait in line for bread, to be restricted to where you could travel and to live in constant fear of the secret police.

After World War II, Germany was split in two, and became the battleground between the two superpowers.  Each side was furiously spying on the other, trying to figure out what the other was doing, using wiretaps, double agents, moles, you name it.  In the meantime, people were taking every opportunity to escape to the West, whether by tunnel, hidden compartments, or even by homemade hot-air balloons.
Every time another daring escape succeeded, we were reminded of those that hadn’t and shown pictures of the bodies caught up in the barbed wire on the border.  I guess the reason I’m going into such detail is that I hope you can imagine how it must have felt to have someone say, “Let’s go to East Germany tonight”, after years of people literally dying to get out.  We weren’t even allowed to visit there without special permission from the military because of our top-secret clearances and now my buddy was saying we should just hop on the train and head over, that we didn’t even need passports or anything.

I had spent two years in training, learning German, memorizing East German military structure, listening to countless radio intercepts, and preparing for the war we all knew would come.  I’d done joint exercises with the German and Dutch military, cross training so we could learn as much from our allies as possible.  We had gone through lengthy classes on how to avoid becoming compromised by East German agents.

“Let’s go to East Germany tonight.”

How could I say no?

October 2nd, 1990, my buddies and I bought train tickets to Erfurt.  We picked this city because it was a major military center and we had several weeks of classified school devoted to its role in the presumed upcoming war.  I was pretty broke, so I grabbed the only alcohol I had, a full bottle of Bailey’s Irish Cream and headed to our train.  

The train looked just like you’d expect from the movies.  There were separate compartments with sliding doors and as we walked down to our seats, through the windows in the doors we could see that the rest of the people in the train were also drinking, probably from much earlier in the afternoon.  The mood was exuberant and infectious.

As mind-boggling as the concept of reunification was for me, it was a million times more so for the West Germans.  Their whole lives they’d viewed the East Germans as the people who they were going to have to fight.  I’m not going to go into WHY they reunified – it’s interesting but long.  

The important thing to know is that the West Germans had been afraid of the East German military for decades and that fear was suddenly gone.  The East Germans were revealed to be just like the West Germans and couldn’t wait to be part of a free country.
To understand the mood of the West Germans, imagine you’re about to get an “F” in a class and the punishment is death, then you find out you’re going to get an “A” and a party will be thrown in your honor.  Now magnify that by a million.  That was the mood on the train and up until that day I’d never seen so many people so happy.

As Americans in Germany, we faced prejudice daily from people who resented our presence.  Not everyone was rude to us, but at least once a day someone would swear at us in German, not knowing we spoke the language.  We never said anything – we just let it slide.  
That night, there was nothing but love from everyone.  It was a welcome change, so we, like everyone else, walked up and down the car, talking to everyone and asking what they thought of the reunification.  

I poked my head in one car, repeated my question, one of the guys inside saw my bottle of Bailey’s and his face lit up.  It turned out he and his friends were all fans, so we joined them, traded shots from our respective bottles and within an hour were thick as thieves.
  
When we crossed the border into East Germany everyone cheered and soon after we pulled into the train station in a border town named Eisenach.  Our new German friends got ready to disembark and we decided that as lit as we were, one East German town was as good as any other and we may as well hang with our friends.

What a depressing fucking place.  Crossing the border was like leaving Oz and returning to Kansas.  The buildings were old and run down, the cars were models I hadn’t seen in years, the people were dressed in drab clothes but you know what?  They were happy.  No, they were beyond happy, they were joyous and as we soon as we got off the train we were enveloped by a crowd of people hugging us, crying, and slapping our backs.  

We didn’t look like Germans, and we were speaking English, so people knew we were probably American.  They wanted to meet us, to shake our hands, and to see the people they’d feared their whole lives.  They pulled us to a nearby club, started buying us drinks and trying to speak to us in broken English.  

As it grew closer to midnight, people started heading to the town square and the bars locked their doors.  Everyone in the square was drunk as hell, arms locked, singing over and over again, “Deutschland, Deutschland, Deutschland, Deutschland.”  Tears were streaming down faces everywhere, unnoticed and the look of disbelief on some of the older faces was heart-wrenching.  For more than 40 years, these people had lived under the tight control of an oppressive regime.  After tonight, there was no chance of it ever returning.
We counted down together as if we were in Times Square on New Year’s Eve and when we hit “ONE!” a roar went up from the crowd, louder than anything I’d ever heard.  At 12:00:00 AM, October 3rd, 1990, East Germany ceased to be a political entity and there was one Germany, for the first time since World War II.  I was there to see it, not because I was lucky, not because it was an accident, but because I got off my ass and bought the ticket.  

That’s my life.  I always buy the ticket.

True,[deleted],,,"Mine sounds ridiculous but this bloke genuinely saved my life.  

I was very young, probably about 4 or 5 and my parents were about to take me out on my first tricycle. I was sat just outside the gate to my house waiting for my parents when I had a scumbag brain moment:  

""Hey Rael,"" my brain said, ""yo Mr Mozo, you should totally just lift up your feet. Just lift them up!""  

I did. I should probably mention that my house is on a very steep hill which leads directly down to a very busy road. It might also help to mention that the wee tricycle had no brakes of any kind. So pretty soon I was shooting down the hill like nobodies business. Straight towards the road. I was too frightened to even think straight. My parents were running after me screaming ""Put your feet down!"" but I was going too fast. I couldn't hear them and they couldn't keep up with me.  

Just a few metres from the road, a builder (I think he was a builder but it was a while ago) was loading up his van. He looked up and saw me. Without a word he gracefully strode onto the pavement and as I passed he swiftly and elegantly reached out, grabbed me and lifted me from the tricycle which then rolled over. He set me down on the ground, closed his van, jumped into the front and drove off. Neither me nor my parents ever got to thank him.

True,CasperTFG_808,,,"**TL/DR** 20 something girl saved me from being raped when I was 15, since then I can't be the onlooker. 

I was 15 years old (male by the way) waiting at a bus stop. This old guy starts chatting with me innocent enough, then the conversation turns and he asks me if I want to come back to his place for a beer. That is when I knew things were not so cool. I went to leave the bus shelter but he stood in the entrance, so I kept back as I didn't want to get into his reach. 

A young woman in her early 20's was walking by and from the look in my eye she probably saw something was up and pushed the guy aside, grabbed my hand and said, ""there you are, we thought you were at the other bus stop, c'mon Mom and Dad are just parked over there"". 

She walked me out of the bus stop and back to the restaurant I worked at. That is when I started shaking and freaking out realizing what I just escaped. We called the cops and they were there in minutes.

Some of the cops stayed with me and about 10 minutes later another cop came in to let me know they caught the guy. They said that He was known to police as a predator but they could not arrest him because he never actually touched me. They did say that they roughed him up so much that he would never be coming back out to our small town and alerted his parole officer of what happened. 

After that incident, it had a dramatic effect on my life. Obviously I check a little more often to keep myself safe, but at the same time I also keep an eye out for others and will always intervene to make sure everything is okay. 

Examples;

1. At a bar notice a girl being held back by a guy much larger than me. I stepped in between them to intervene. I ended up getting a sharp punch to the stomach and then a few kicks while I was on the ground (I'm not really a fighter or defender for that matter), but the guy was escorted out of the club by security. I talked with the girl afterwards and apparently it was her ex-bf who was on a restraining order. 

2.  Left a party to go buy smokes at the corner store. I notice 4 guys yelling at and grabbing at a young girl. I called my buddies back at the party to come quick (I'm not an idiot I would be no match against 4 guys). They arrive and we intervene. Turns out one of the guys is her older brother and they are just trying to get his drunk baby sister home (she validated that was the case) so they left all pissed at us, but I have no regrets on that one for crying wolf.

There are many more stories but needless to say, that Random act of Heroism from the 20 something girl who didn't know me but still put her own self in harms way changed me for good. I will never be that person to walk by and ignore a stranger in need.

True,crim_girl,,,"I've told bits of this before in other places but here it is. When I was 17 I was in a really bad car accident. The kind that when your parents arrive they have a slight panic attack.  I had a car try to cross a highway right in front of me so impact was at about 65-70 mph.  Both cars were totaled and had bits scattered all over the highway. My car went spinning through the median and stopped just shy of moving traffic on the other side.  A truck driver saw the whole thing happen and stopped. He came to me first and within moments someone had stopped for the other driver so he stayed with me. He helped me call my mom and step-dad on his cell phone and then helped me away from the wreck to sit. He talked to my mom for me to get her to where I was when I started hyperventilating. He called the police and talked to me in between. When the police arrived he talked to them until my parents showed up. Once my parents took over he slipped off and went back to driving his route. I know he was late on his delivery because he called them to say he was going to be and why.  I vaguely remember thanking him and I know my parents did too.  I had called my step-dad's cell phone from the truckers so my parents had his number. They later called him and thanked him for helping me and he refused any and all gifts they offered. He also helped clean up some of my blood as dangerous as it could have been since he didn't know me.

To this day because of him I stop every time I see an accident that doesn't have emergency personnel at it yet. I have a fully stocked first aid kit in my trunk and a couple towels. I've been witness to several accidents and the most awkward one I helped at I was on crutches awaiting knee surgery trying to help the victims. Once they were ok they turned around trying to help me since I was hopping around. They made me sit down and I just played with the child that had been involved.  The scariest one I witnessed was several months before that one and involved a drunk driver hitting a car full of teenage girls. I didn't know until I got to the car that she was drunk but once there it was obvious! After several minutes of talking to her several large men had to restrain her so she would stop trying to leave. Some fucking people... I still stop though.

True,[deleted],,,"Last year around August/September my mom and I went grocery shopping. We get food stamps, and when we got done filling our cart we went to checkout. They rang up about $150 worth of stuff and rung our EBT. It said we only had $9.00. I called and it was confirmed. My mom being stubborn just got out her Debit and used that. That was our bill money, now we might get something turned off. Two days later I woke up at 7 am and made up a sign that said ""I promised my mom I would help her out, please help"" and got my backpack and bike and rode out to a corner. I sat there for about 15 minutes when a guy came up and handed me a tin full of change. Then a real bum came up and asked *ME* for change and I was like, [""Thats what I'm doing""] (http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ledz2gbmC91qfu4tho1_250.png) So I sat there for 5 more minutes and he sat across the road from me. I was like ""FUCK THIS"" and got up and moved, handed him some change from my tin said, ""This is your corner man, I'm movin"" I went down to best corner. People coming off the highway and you are standing on the drivers side, I was a minute too late as I tried to cross the road another couple came. I crossed and started to head home, I was starting to cry, I wanted to give up. I then said fuck this and turned around. I head 2 blocks down to a corner by a gas station and where people drive out of Walmart. I changed my sign to say ""Down on my luck, spare a buck? Your change can make a change"" I was there for one hour. I got $2 from a guy my age in a riced out car, $5 from a nurse in a Hummer. I was sitting down with a  baggy sweater, my hair in a headband and sunglasses on so people couldn't see my eyes. It was hard, it wasn't the sitting out their begging for money that got to me, it was the looks people give you. The ones that you can see are trying not to look at you. The ones who read your sign, you see their mouths move along they turn to the driver, nod towards you talk more. The ones you look at you with disgust thinking you are trying to buy drugs or something. But as I sat on that corner willing to be there as long as it took even if it was a buck or two at a time to make up our bills, I saw my saving grace walk around the bushes. A man in tan pants and a dark grey shirt who looked like he was on his way to construction came towards me, his wallet in the air and said ""I want to help ya out"" He crouched down to me and said ""How ya doin? I'm Jim, what's your name?"" I told him my name, he asked how old I was I was 19 at the time, he said ""Ya know I was 18 and homeless for 2 years, I ate outta trash cans, slept under bridges"" As he said this he reached into his wallet and pulled out a folded up bill, I saw a 1 so I thought it was a ten and was ecstatic. He continued ""But ya know, it got better, now I have my own business and a little more money than I need"" He nodded at the bill and I unfolded it. It was a $100 bill!!! I started to bawl. I got up to my knees and gave him a hug and thanked him over and over. He said ""God or whoever you believe in loves you, and things are going to change"" He got up and left and I sat there blubbering like a baby and then trying to contain myself. I said, that is enough I am not gonna be greedy and so I got up and got on my bike and went home as fast as I could on a broken chain and chainring. I got home and went into my moms room and told her to close her eyes and hold out her hands. She was currently on unemployment due to disabilities, but didn't qualify for disability because she didn't spend enough time in the hospital. I dumped the money out into her hands and she said what is this? She sorted through and her eyes widened when she saw the nice crisp Benjamin. She said ""Did you go hooker for money?"" I laughed and told her no I went and stood on a corner with a sign. She asked to see the sign and I could just see the shock on her face. She told me thank you but I didn't need to do that. I told her I had to. We found out they changed the date we got our food stamps to 6 days later without informing us. So yea.

Out of the blue while I was walking on my way to class I said, ""You look like you need a hug.""

She was stopped pacing and stared at me for a bit, then gave one one of the most desperate hugs I have ever received. Afterwards I asked her if there was anything I could do and she said that she was having a panic attack and just wanted to go home. The problem was that her purse and all of her books were still in the classroom.

I offered to go in and get them for her, and her eyes widened like I had just saved her life. So I opened the door and the whole room turned to me. The teacher looked at me with this super-skeptical look and asked, ""Can I help you?"" 

As I hadn't really thought it through, I told the first lie that popped into my head, ""my sister isn't feeling well so I came by to pick-up her things."" He just stared at me for a while and pointed at an empty desk. I tried my best to pretend like I wasn't surprised by the purse and her other belongings, and then walked out of the room and handed her her things.

She thanked me profusely, and I told her to just take the night off and relax. I never told her my name, and she never told me hers, but to this day there are few things that make me more proud than that random act of kindness.

True,Ryrulian,,,"The rule that ""entropy always increases"" is a statistical statement. If you have a box filled with a gas, and all the gas starts on one side of the box, the particles will quickly spread out evenly everywhere. That is entropy increasing.

But the particles don't freeze in place once they spread out evenly - they are still moving around at fairly high speeds actually. So it's impossible for them to get to a ""perfectly"" high entropy state and stay there. Instead, the particles will *mostly* be spread evenly, but their movement will cause 'random' fluctuations where sometimes some parts of the box will have slightly more particles then it should (though they probably wouldn't last long).

Boltzmann is basing his statement on the idea that eventually, if you wait infinitely long, those particles would 'randomly fluctuate' to the point that every single one of them was contained on one half of the box, and the other half of the box was a pure vacuum (the starting condition). It's just really, really, *really* rare for that to occur. But if, for some reason, the organized state is the only one that can be observed, it won't matter how long it takes. Only the organized state will be observed.

Expanding to the setting of the universe - imagine a universe that has reached maximum entropy. No planets, no stars, no anything but a random and even distribution of any stable element/particle. Boltzmann is arguing that eventually, due to random fluctuations, those particles will re-arrange themselves into stars, planets, galaxies, and so on. The chance of that happening is so small it can't be conveyed in words along - but again, if you have an infinite amount of time, it doesn't matter how small that chance is so long as it is theoretically possible.

So even if the universe began with a Big Bang once, and the stars/planets came from the low entropy state resulting from the creation of the universe - it is more likely we live in a random high fluctuation of energy. In other words, it is more likely we are living in a universe that is &lt;insert large number&gt; years old, then a universe that is merely 13.7 billion years. Because the universe was 13.7 billion years old *once* - but the random fluctuations of particles will re-arrange the universe into something that *looks* 13.7 billion years old an infinite number of times.

That's the rundown of the argument. There are reasons we essentially know we don't live in Boltzmann's universe - for example, the universe looks like it is expanding (and looks like it will continue to expand forever) and it would be impossible for that expansion to reverse through random fluctuations of entropy. 

Also interestingly, Boltzmann's argument is a rare type of argument that disproves itself. If we live in a random fluctuation of a high-entropy universe, it is unfathomably more likely that the random fluctuation re-creates a universe as old as the current time, then an universe even one second ""younger"". It is unfathomably more likely this fluctuation didn't actually re-create all the stars and planets, and instead it only created our solar system. The memories we have of observing a larger universe are just a result of those random fluctuations. In fact, it's unfathomably more likely that these random fluctuations didn't create an *entire planet*, but instead just created the room you are in and the computer in front of you. Similarly, it is unfathomably more likely that these random fluctuations didn't create the room around you, but instead just created the sensory input of you being in a room on a computer on /r/askscience. It's more likely that your entire body wasn't created, and instead just a 'brain' was created in a ""very small"" section of random low entropy. The instant after you read this, your randomly-generated brain will fall back into a high entropy state, and it will be like you never existed at all. 

So this 'brain' scenario is unfathomably more likely than the entire observable universe being re-created. However - if we (you) are just a random brain with a random set of memories and sensory input, your grasp on Boltzmann's argument is also a random set of memories and thoughts. The random low-entropy fluctuations of the universe have no requirement of re-creating things truthfully or accurately, including your memories/thoughts. Those random memories and thoughts would include your understanding of physics, including things like entropy. So a result of Boltzmann's argument is that we would live in a universe where our understanding of the universe is almost certainly completely incorrect - including the assumptions Boltzmann bases his argument on. Ergo, Boltzmann's argument defeats itself.",0,1353533539,,0,False,1,c74wiui,t3_13l26p,t1_c74wiui,t3_13l26p,,1430467612,22,False,askscience,t5_2qm4e,22
True,Pardner,,,"There is no assignment, no centralized control, or anything like that. We tend to just describe these things statistically with little understanding of actually *how* they are achieved; you might say that ants of a certain age have a certain likelihood of switching from job A to job B, for example. 

But there is definitely a lot of communication going on, and the majority of it is chemical (ie, pheromones). Deborah Gordon is a somewhat famous ant person, largely because of some research she has done with Harvester ants in the southwest USA. Let's see if I can explain it coherently. She and collaborators found that workers which do different jobs, like working inside the colony versus foraging outside, have different profiles of ""cuticular hydrocarbons,"" because the molecules were being modified by the sunlight and things like that. So there was sufficient information for the ants to tell them apart. They were then able to reproduce the hydrocarbon profiles of ants of different roles and put them on little glass beads, then drop those beads in front of workers. As workers walk in and out of the colony, they're constantly touching each other with their antennae (and, as they showed, assessing the role of the workers they encounter), so when an ant touched a glass bead that mimicked the smell, it gave it some [false] information about how many workers were operating inside versus outside the colony. The ants then used this information to probabilistically change their behavior. If Gordan et al. made it look like all of the ants were working from inside the colony, then some of the workers would switch their behavior and start foraging outside, and vice versa. This showed that the ants had some idea of the ideal number workers that should be foraging versus doing stuff inside the colony. You can speculate based on this that the degree of complexity that's happening in all aspects of colony organization is probably much, much greater than anyone would have predicted (and not exactly like the totally ""instinctual"" behavior that people expect insects to have). This might exist for other jobs, for example, or colonies might be able to adjust their foraging rates based on how much food they have, or the current risk of predation. 

Jobs are (in ants, I think it's safe to say *always*) decided by age, in some unpredictable way that is best described statistically, but probably has some number of more informed, mechanistic triggers (like the hydrocarbon profiles in harvester ants, but it probably goes much deeper than that). Many species also have differently sized workers; in fire ants (*Solenopsis*) the largest worker has 20x the mass of the smallest; in a *Pheidologeton* ant it could be 500x. These workers typically assort into different roles that would be logical based on their size, as well; the big ones dig tunnels and carry heavy stuff, the little ones feed larvae and pick off tiny parasites, etc. But within each size class, there will still be the age-based progression through jobs as well. So, they're really, staggeringly complicated animals. It's just that because most of their communication happens in a statistical manner with invisible chemicals, it takes a really sharp scientist and a lot of luck to actually figure out what's going on! 

Oh and just to stave any confusion: the word ""pheromone"" is a fairly imprecise term (you don't see it in the ant literature as often as you'd expect) which really just means some chemical signal that is known to send a signal from one member of a species to another member of the species. Usually, since we only know a signal has been received if the other individual changes its behavior, this means that a pheromone is something which produces a consistent behavioral response. It's often hard to demonstrate that, and there are lots of things which seem to confer information that people aren't quite comfortable calling pheromones. So when I say chemicals and pheromones interchangeably, that's because often because I call things ""chemicals"" when they haven't been studied well enough to prove that they're actually ""pheromones,"" even though they most likely are.

True,phagocytic,,,"Hi there. I've experienced this problem for close to 18 years and have really only been actively fighting it for the past five years. I started out with therapy and we talked about the source of the anxiety. 

I've been to a couple of therapists, in which one suggested that I'm displacing the real source of anxiety onto something that I can control aka using the bathroom. Cognitive behavioral therapy was helpful to really restructure the way I handle stressful situations and to focus on the actual stressor, instead of worrying about the bathroom. 

When you start to get those thoughts in your head, ""oh God, I have to go NOW... I can't hold it!!... this is so embarrassing..."" practice some deep breathing. Figure out music that helps calm you (or use hypnosis tracks -these help me) or repeat in your head that YOU are in control of your body. YOU tell it when YOU'RE ready to go. Your body doesn't control you. You control it. 

I also make sure I have a change of pants and underwear in the back of my car. Just knowing you have that to fall back on helps. Sometimes when I'm in high stress situations (big crowds, no bathrooms), I put on a pad to catch it if something actually happens. Nothing usually happens, but it's peace of mind to know it's there. 

Finally, I read this website when I feel stress gets high, which makes my anxiety skyrocket: www.howtonotgiveafuck.com ... the main point of that website is to stop giving a fuck. You shit your pants? Yeah, it's embarrassing but it's not the end of the world. You are one small organism on this big planet - would anybody really give a fuck if you shit yourself? Or do you overthink it in your head? 

Last, and probably most importantly, don't eat junk food. Yeah, it makes you feel good at the time, but it makes you feel gross and bad about yourself. When I changed my diet, I felt better about myself which made my anxiety more manageable. Additionally, exercise releases endorphins and other feel good chemicals that makes a lot of things in your life more manageable. When I skip the gym for awhile, those thoughts creep back in my head about soiling myself. It's kind of amazing how well exercise works.

To setup proper recording for games, there are a few things:

1.  Hardware
   -  CPU - At least 4 cores/threads
   -  RAM - 8GB minimum (over 16GB has diminishing returns)
   -  HDD - SSD for OS and Applications
   -  2nd HDD - HDD must be able to sustain over 100MB/s sustained write speeds
   -  OpenCL capable graphics card (most cards made after 2011, AMD or Nvidia)

2.  Software
   - Capture Software - DXtory (preferred), Fraps, MSI Afterburner
   - Video Editing Software - Sony Vegas 12 (v12 preferred), Adobe Premier, [LightWorks](http://www.lwks.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=45&amp;Itemid=184) (free or $60 for Pro), Windows Movie Maker (free/last resort).
   - Transcoding - [Handbrake](http://handbrake.fr/downloads.php) (free/preferred), [MediaCoderHQ](http://www.mediacoderhq.com/download.htm) (Free).

**Capture Process:**

When capturing, I prefer 720p resolution for 5 good reasons:

1.  Less CPU resources to capture.
2.  Less disk space requirements
3.  Faster to work with when rendering and transcoding
4.  Requires less disk write bandwidth (1080p recording requires 120MB/s+ speeds)
5.  When viewing on Youtube it takes less time to buffer/stream than 1080 videos.  Less pausing and buffering (if not at all) than 1080.  Viewers get annoyed with slow loading videos.

I capture at 60fps.  This is for editing purposes.  It makes motion tracking and slow--motion video smoother and better for editing with more frames to work with.  Minimum is 30 frames per second to record.

Codecs are up to you to decide.  I use the [Lagarith Codec](http://lags.leetcode.net/codec.html) for high quality captures.  Almost indistinguishable from actual game play!  Files are very large ~4GB/minute of video.  Some codecs are better than others in terms of visual quality and resources taken to capture (CPU/HDD speeds).  

**Video Editing:**

There are only a few *good* editors out there.  I have a paid-for copy of Sony Vegas Pro 12.  I tested v10 and v11 and had some stability issues and the preview video was choppy and caused some of the crashes.  v12 is perfect.  Vegas is $600 for a full copy and $200 for the upgrade (what I bought).  Adobe Premiere is the most expensive at $700(full) and $150(upgrade).  There is Lightworks which is a very capable editor that is FREE, but they offer a Pro version for $60.  I played around with it for a few days and liked it a lot, but since I inherited a full copy of Vegas and learned how to use it, I spent the money on the upgrade to v12.  Lastly, there is Windows Movie Maker, which for most purposes of basic editing works well and is free.  It barely scratches the surface of features compared to the alternatives, but for ""free"" you really can't complain too much.  If you're on a budget, forgo Windows Movie Maker and get LightWorks.

There are tons of tutorial videos on Youtube to learn how to use each product and learn concepts.  No need to take classes or buy books - unless that is your best learning style.

Lastly, editing takes a lot of time and it takes a lot of patience.  You will also need to have a pretty swift PC to render the files.  The more cores and a good CPU architecture (AMD blows when it comes to this type of computing, Intel Core series si the best) coupled with a fast hard drive will still take some time to render the videos.  For my setup it takes roughly 3 minutes render time for every minute of video.  Some editors include a batch/queue function so that you can load up multiple render jobs to be done while you are asleep or at work.

**Transcoding:**

In a nut shell, transcoding converts one format to another using high compression codecs like h.264/x.264 into an MP4 format.  

I use Handbrake for transcoding because it has a lot of granular settings and features.  It also has a batch or queue process just like some video editors.  Use that to your advantage.  

The final product should be a fraction of the size of the rendered video.  Mine are 10% or less in size over the rendered version.

Once completed and you are satisfied with the final output, **that** is what you put on YouTube.",0,1353541117,,0,False,1,c74yf5u,t3_13l1et,t1_c74yf5u,t1_c74wi1y,,1430468501,8,False,purebattlefield,t5_2ujr3,8

The fat continuously renders out of the bacon, helping to lock in the moisture. Technically, since the fat can exceed the boiling temperature of water, it is still a 'dry heat' cooking method (a la *frying*) and can crisp up the skin.

Usually this process is done on smaller birds that are more likely to dry easily (like pheasant or quail), and often fatback is used since it's cheaper and just as effective.

The bacon flavor will still be present somewhat (it's like basting it in liquid smoke), and the fat will be in the drippings which can then be used to make bacon gravy.

True,ChainsawSam,,,"We've been on the supply-side kick for so long that many people don't even know what this would do for the economy.

It would kick start the shit out of it.  giving the bottom end some more disposable income means more of the goods and services that our economy is based off of being consumed.

Sort of a tricky Mitt Romney tax plan thing.  You know, ""if we remove deductions we can keep things where we are and generate more revenue.""  The same basic idea works here.  If the employees make enough to have more disposable income, they'll spend that income.  There likely wouldn't even need to be a price point increase simply because more goods and services are purchased bringing in more net profit in the end

This also, obviously, creates more demand.  More people having more disposable income to purchase more goods means more employees to meet that demand.  This means more jobs.  More jobs which have disposable income.

Unfortunately this is all a 'long term' solution.  Not particularly long term, a year out or so, but 'long term' none the less.  As a country, we fucking *hate* long term solutions.  What we need is for prices to stay the same and for employees to be paid more and then consume more, it comes out to a more fluid economy where everyone benefits in the end (especially the government who gets to tax these purchases and the extra income).  Everyone comes out ahead in this situation at a cost of what amounts to a very small percentage of most places overall profit.  Profit per unit goes down but units sold goes up.  Everyone wins in this situation, assuming we could just make it happen.

It's easy to see a scale model of this in action now.  Look at retail stores in Washington state, the state with the highest Minimum Wage.  The cost of almost all goods are fixed on a national level despite these increased wages.  Retailers in Washington aren't losing their shirts over this, most of them are extremely profitable.

True,Fire_in_the_nuts,,,"You may be thinking of selenium; Brazil nuts [don't seem to have any vitamin D.](http://www.vitalhealthzone.com/nutrition/food-values/nuts.html#3) Fish oil, OTOH, has plenty of vitamin D; this is how the Inuit (an Eskimo tribe) gets their vitamin D despite wearing heavy clothing for much of the year. Interesting paper from 1952 where they looked at the Inuit diet of 1855, and found the *average* Inuit was getting 6,147 IU of vitamin D from diet alone.

Anyway- given my druthers, I would be eating salmon and getting my vitamin D that way, along with cod liver oil. (The latter has to be purified by distillation to remove heavy metals, so make certain that's on the label. Salmon is very low in heavy metals in comparison to other ocean fish.) I think mushrooms have decent quantities of vitamin D as well.

But, of course, salmon is expensive, so I only have it perhaps once a week. As with virtually any supplement, there are little data to support the use of supplements alone; normally, our medical observations are along the lines of ""people who eat food X tend to have a better response to Y."" Of course, wanting to isolate things and put it in a capsule, we look at X, claim it MUST be compound Z, and put it in a pill. Then they run sophisticated studies on people who swill Z by the gallon, only to find out that- for some odd reason- they don't have the benefits of people who eat food X.

I'd like to think vitamin D (actually a prohormone, not really a vitamin) is different, but in reality, it probably comes down to how people who get metric assloads of sunlight and/or eat foods high in vitamin D are going to be healthier than basement-dwellers who eat Taco Bell three times a day. I mean- go figure, right?

So- my preference is always going to lean towards natural sources (sunlight, diet), but there are data in the literature to suggest supplementation with vitamin D is fine, too.

Note from the [Binkley ""surfer dude"" study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17426097) that even surfer dudes who got HUGE amounts of sunlight were largely (51%) deficient in vitamin D (&lt;30 ng/mL, average 31.6 ng/mL). Sufficiency of 30 ng/mL is enough to prevent rickets, but nobody knows what it takes to prevent autoimmune disease, or to reduce the effects of autoimmune disease- probably 40-50-60 or so. Anyway- the thought is that perhaps washing (soap showers?) removes vitamin D as it forms in the skin. BUT- current wisdom is that it forms in a deep, hydrophobic layer of the skin where this should not be possible. Quite the quandary.

But the point is that if Hawaiian surfer dudes who get &gt;20 hours of full-body irradiation (when sunscreen and clothing is factored in) are fucked, what hope is there for the rest of us?

Motherboard: I still recommend the UD3H over the Extreme4. I have both, and the UD3H is a much better overclocker (I have swapped CPUs and ram, and I get higher stable clocks on the UD3H). I understand the Extreme4 is a little cheaper, but as a overclocking freak, I think the extra money is worth it for the UD3H.

RAM: Good

HDD: Good

SSD: I suggested the Vertex 4? Interesting, since I usually suggest the Vertex 3 since it's cheaper for the same performance. But now the Vertex 4 is the same price, go for it.

GPU: I used to recommend the 660Ti, but after these recent AMD driver updates, the 7950 whomps nvidia butt. The Gigabyte version is the highest overclocker, best temps, and reliability.

Case: I would highly suggest the Source 210 if you want to downgrade. Much better aesthetics, cable management, and build quality than the HAF 912. 

PSU: ouch, the 600W used to be $40 a while ago, might want to look into a cheaper 600W psu like the CX600. You do lose the modular-edness, but its $30 cheaper for the same quality. 

CD/DVD Drive: good

Monitor: mmm, IPS. Good

OS: You could always try Win8, just a thought.

Keyboard: MX Blue isn't as good to game on, might want to try an MX Brown for gaming and typing.

True,Throawayaccount99,,,"Obviously using a throw away account.

Just wanted to share my story with you. This is long.

I married in my mid-twenties. I was a drug addict trying to clean up my life. I had low self esteem and never had much luck impressing women. I  met my ex-wife in a shady bar and the most attractive thing about her was that she was actually attractive and paid attention to me.

We got married fast, within six months of knowing one another. I had stopped using narcotics, but was still hitting the bottle pretty hard. We both were. There were step kids involved, I basically married into a family.

I kind of had an epiphany and realized that these kids needed at least one sober person in their life.  I quit drinking. Eventually she got pregnant and rather than quit drinking and smoking, she just didn't do it in front of me, even though I asked her not to. She thought I was stupid and wouldn't notice the signs.

The fights began because she was gambling all of our money away and of course drinking and smoking while pregnant. At first it was just us yelling at each other. To be honest we both said horrible things.

We were yelling at each other one day, when she leaned back and punched me square in the nose. She broke my nose and blood instantly shot out of it. Within a day both of my eyes had blackened. She was apologetic, said she was sorry and it was only a one time thing. *She lied*.

In my defense, I didn't instantly leave because of the step kids and the fact that she was still pregnant with my kid. That punch to the nose was just the start.

We got into another fight one day and I tried to leave the room. I was done with yelling at her at this point. Whenever she yelled it was one sided. I refused to be a part of that anymore. So I would just let her yell. I think me not yelling back just enraged her more. 

I turned to walk out of the room and she landed a punch in the back of my skull, hard enough to take me to my knees. The second action I remember was a kick to my back which put me face down. At this point she jumped on my back, pinned my arms with her knees and started punching the back of my head. She was strong. I never lost consciousness, but i remember my head being turned towards my step-kids room. They were both sitting on the bed watching this whole thing go down.

For some reason she stopped. I got to my feet, stumbled to the land-line and called 911.  The cops and the EMTs showed up.  She came out crying saying I attacked her, the cops believed her. The EMTs on the other hand, saw no aggression wounds on me and realized that my head being split open and the bruising on my back could only mean I was face down.  The cops ended up telling me that I had to leave, since the kids were technically hers, they wouldn't make her leave the dwelling.

I left. She called crying. Best thing in her life, yadda yadda yadda and my dumb ass went back to her.  My goal at this point was to get through the pregnancy and to get my kid and then get the hell out. I would eventually call Child Services when I was in a safe environment to get her kids in a safe environment.

The beatings continued, the morale didn't improve. There is at least a dozen more stories like this. The cops kept being non-believers. To keep this somewhat short. During our one year marriage, she broke my nose twice, broke several ribs, broke fingers, blackened eyes, drew blood pretty consistently and did enough emotional damage that I will never be completely trusting of another female in my life. She got very good at grabbing things that were around her and hitting me with them. I never once fought back.

The biggest thing she did was after one of our little ""tiffs"" , she offered to have a threesome with one of her gorgeous friends if i came back. Of course I thought with my penis. There was absolutely no brain power used in that decision, just penis power.

It started out with her and her friend making out and eating each other out. Super fucking hot. Her friend then decided to tie me up under the premise of doing naughty things to me.  At this point there should have been red flags going up everywhere, but I wasn't thinking with the big head, just thinking with my penis.

She tied me to the bedposts, basically immobilizing me, both legs and arms. At this point dildos came out. At first they were using them on each other and then they decided they were going to use them on me. I objected. I said no, they didn't stop. At this point the two of them pretty much forcibly raped me with two dildos. They were laughing mostly at the fact that I had been reduced to tears. I should of thought the situation through better.

It was about 15 minutes and they basically tore me up enough that I ended up in the hospital. Prior to them letting me go, it was basically said ""Go ahead and go to the cops, they'll never believe you."" They were essentially right.  When I was in the hospital, the police were called. I had embarrassingly told the doctor what happened. He believed me.

The cops went over and did an ""investigation"" which consisted of them asking my ex-wife and her friend if they raped me. They said no. The cops never entered the house, never went in to look for evidence, nothing. Long story short, no charges were ever filed.

I eventually filed for divorce and after a long, long custody battle, was given full guardianship of my daughter. I have *no clue* how she turned out so well, full well knowing that my ex-wife drank heavily and smoked while pregnant. There is absolutely nothing wrong with her. I am simply amazed.

My ex-wife eventually lost custody of her two kids during the custody battle. Child Services was involved. She only lost custody for about a week.

I finally broke down and told my parents the whole story about what happened. My dad didn't want to believe it. He also said ""I raised you to be a gentleman, that ends when women start throwing punches, you should have laid into her."" In the end, defending myself would have been pointless as the cops often took her side in it. I could be covered in blood and barely conscious and she could be shiny and happy and they still wouldn't believe me.

The good thing is, that my uncle on my dad's side is a member of a neighboring city's police force. He took a copy of my medical records that i released to him with all the police reports and went way over the heads of a lot of cops and went to the chief, who he knew personally and served in Vietnam with.  Long story short, one cop got fired and some of the other cops were reprimanded. It eventually changed domestic violence policy in our city. While that doesn't do me any good, it does do other people dealing with domestic violence a favor, it isn't tossed off as a bother anymore. Reports are much more accurate.

As for her family. They never believed any of it. Even after the accusations came out and were basically proven true. The ex-wife entered a mental institution and was diagnosed as biploar/schizophrenic. She cleaned up for about twenty minutes, long enough to look like the victim of a disease but has gone back to her ways.

Her family refuses to acknowledge my existence or my daughter's. (Oh no!) My daughter's mother sees her a handful of times a year. Her kids absolutely hate me. (all of them, there are more now) There was a whole lot of ""men can't get raped"" and ""can't rape the willing"" being thrown around. I had an uncle on my mom's side of the family that decided to make fun of me one time and my cousin laid him out. So it doesn't get brought up a whole lot anymore.

It's been about 12 years since this took place. I am not the same person I was. Relationships with women are very hard, mostly because of me. I found one girl that I proposed about 8 years ago, but she ended up cheating on me and stealing a lot of money from me. So that didn't really help things. I've only really told two of my girlfriends about it since then. To try to help identify why I am the way I am, but I ended up leaving the relationships.  *Therapy*, lots and lots of therapy.

There are a lot of triggers. I flinch a lot. My ego took a huge hit. My stance on violence basically did a 180. My biggest worry is that one day I am going to have to explain this to my daughter. She already knows about the domestic abuse, but not the rape.  I still blame myself. I should have never put myself in that situation. Regardless of what anyone tells me, I just shouldn't have.

Rape is just a shitty situation, regardless of who is involved. You are not alone. Don't ever feel alone.

True,Platypuskeeper,chem,Physical Chemistry | Quantum Chemistry,"It's a bit tangential to your question, but I feel compelled to explain what Evolution _is_. It's in part an observed fact (organisms change, new species and sub-species come about and occasionally go extinct), and in part a _theory_ explaining why we have the species we have, why they look they way they do, and the fossil record. (And _theory_ here as in a 'testable scientific explanation in terms of more basic concepts', not as in 'a guess' or 'hypothesis'). It's not about the age of the planet or other such geological facts, or about how life first came about (which is termed _abiogenesis_). Charles Darwin didn't actually come up with evolution, but rather the first correct theoretical mechanism for it - in terms of random inherited changes and natural selection. As his book title also put it: ""On the Origin of _Species_ by Means of _Natural Selection_"". 

It was not the age of the Earth that was fit to Darwin's theory, but the opposite. Geologists in the 18th and 19th century had started to figure out that the planet was much older than had been assumed earlier. The evidence here was based off things like marine fossils being found in high-up places, to an extent that could not be explained by any brief biblical flood. Off [erratics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glacial_erratic), post-glacial rebound and many other bits of evidence for ice ages long ago. There was debate about the age of the Earth was still ongoing in Darwin's day. Many basic facts about geology, such as plate tectonics and the fact that the earth has a molten iron core heated by radioactive decay, would not be learned for a long time. The existence of theories at the time that the world was up to millions or even billions of years old that allowed Darwin to come up with his theory, but the fact that it was well over 6000 years old had largely been established before he was even born. The age of Enlightenment discredited Genesis as a historical account, not Darwin. (And was never universally thought to be literal truth since long before that, all the way back to Christian theologists like Saint Augustine and Thomas Aquinas)

To the specifics; It was obviously not radiocarbon dating (or other radiometric methods) which caused geologists to change their ideas about the age of the Earth. Becquerel and Curie didn't discover radioactivity until around 1900, and the dating methods came much later. Radiocarbon dating is based on the fact that the proportion of C-14 in the atmosphere is essentially constant, as the rate of its creation (by cosmic rays) and decay are constant. Thus its proportion is constant in plants (which get their carbon from CO2 in air) and thus in all the other living things that get their carbon from plants. But once they die, they stop picking up more carbon, and so the amount decreases over time. Since it's a small amount, and C-14 decays relatively quickly in these contexts (less than 6000 years), it only goes back as far as there's still C-14 present in detectable quantities. In terms of chemistry, determining the amount of stuff and its relative proportion generally gets harder the less of it you're measuring. So accuracy gets worse as you go farther back. 

Since C-14 only works for organic matter (e.g. charcoal, wood, etc) and doesn't work for the distant past, it's mainly an _archaeological_ method. 50-60 thousand years is not a very long time as far as geology is concerned. Geologists use other radiometric methods with other isotopes, such as [isochron dating](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isochron_dating). (Again, just for emphasis though: The estimated age of the Earth does not depend exclusively on radiometric dating at all)

These are entirely scientifically valid methods. Claiming they're ""inaccurate"" is merely an attempt to mislead. As with every scientific measurement, isotope measurements (and thus the dates) come with an associated inaccuracy and margin of error. Science doesn't do 'exact', it just does 'known limits of accuracy'. As with every experiment and observation, you can and will occasionally get wrong results, because things go wrong. You forget to account for something, your sample gets contaminated, etc. Individual failures don't invalidate a method, because we know that kind of things happen occasionally. Sometimes a pregnancy test will give a false result; it doesn't mean that there's anything fundamentally wrong with the method - we _know_ the method isn't foolproof. This is why science is based off _repeatable_ experiments and observations. A scientific theory isn't abandoned the minute an apparently-contradictory experimental result is made, no more than you'd conclude automobiles don't work just because your car failed to start once.

We know that radiometric dating is neither exact nor foolproof. It's still a valid method, because there's nothing wrong with the theory behind it. We do not really know of _any_ method or circumstance that'd change the decay rates of radioisotopes, much less how they'd invalidate these methods across-the-board. These things have been tested, and are continually tested, against things with known age. They're tested against results from other methods. Et cetera. 

The way I see it, there are only two ways radiocarbon dating could be consistently, fundamentally wrong: 1) The relative proportion of C-14 in the atmosphere has changed over the last 60k years or so (actually it _has_ in the last century due to human emissions, but this is a well-known issue) or 2) The radioactive decay rate of C-14 has changed in that period. There is no evidence either of these things have happened, no physical theory to explain why they would, either. On the contrary, all the tests of C-14 dating against other methods are evidence that this _hasn't_ happened.

If radiometric dating doesn't work, there'd be something very wrong with our understanding of nuclear physics. (Yet the people who dispute it often seem perfectly happy to accept its results when it comes to building reactors or bombs, nuclear medicine, and the many other practical results of the _same physical theories_)

I know that Creationists try to lump everything that's at odds with Genesis 1-2 as 'Evolution' (and often go even further in pretending that it's all because of Darwin). But in reality evolutionary theory is part of biology (although a major and entirely integral part). But the fact that the world isn't 6,000 years old is much much more than just that. It's integral to geology, to archeology, to astronomy, to nuclear physics - heck, you can probably dig up some purely _chemical_ evidence. In short, it's at odds with _science_. Creationism isn't even consistent with itself (For that matter, nor is the version of events in Genesis chapter 1 consistent with that in chapter 2). Some dispute the age of the Earth (as I've focused on here) and/or cosmology in general. Others accept that, but dispute biological evolution specifically. And yet others accept evolution to some extent but deny large scale 'macroevolution', creating new species, as they call it (even though biologists make no such distinction). 

The only kind I'm missing is those who'd dispute philology/linguistics in favor of the Tower of Babel story. (Which I've always found a bit funny, since language evolution/history actually shares some deep-running parallels with biological evolution)

Anyway. the site [talkorigins](http://www.talkorigins.org/) is a good resource. It's got detailed explanations of all the many reasons for all the various aspects of biological evolution, cosmology, the age of the earth, etc and specific rebuttals of all the common Creationist arguments and talking-points.

True,tomrhod,,,"Everyone is having a fun time downvoting you, but I'm going to try to be constructive instead of destructive here.

Do you understand why people are doing this? Why you're making them so upset? 

A dear friend of mine had a gay brother. I say had, because his brother died. He was bullied, harassed, and finally decided the only way out was his neck in a belt he tied to his bedroom door. He was 14.

And you are contributing to that. You may or may not harass people for being gay, but by using that word, tossing it around like an all-purpose way of demeaning someone, you are adding to the social environment a feeling of hostility and marginalization of gay people. You are saying they are subhuman, their very existence bronzed in that word like a dagger.

I would ask that you seriously consider that your words have consequences, even if you can't see them directly. Don't be the guy who puts out fear and intolerance, or you'll get it right back. Be the guy who thinks before he speaks, and chooses his words to not ridicule, harm, or belittle. 

Be that guy, and you'll be a better person for it.

True,rvdh,,,"If you're asking about the first kiss, there is no such thing as the perfect time, it will not happen if neither of you take the initiative. Since you are asking this question I suppose you want to be leading. First of all: make sure you and her are alone. I suppose you're not too awkward so you would be having a conversation. Start lowering your voice, speak softer and slower. Look in her eyes while you talk to her (!) and glance at her mouth during pauses once in a while, don't look at her boobs. Stay classy! If everything goes right and there is some chemistry between you guys she will feel it and answer by glancing at your mouth in return. Move closer and let the conversation sloooowly die out. Take an open posture: face her and don't cross your arms. Also: smile! Not the creepy grin, not awkward ear-to-ear, just a nice, comforting smile. This will help her (and you) feel at ease (endorphins and shit).

Breathe in, breathe out, relax. This is going to be great, kisses are awesome! This girl digs you, after all you ended up in this situation. Gently end the conversation. Enjoy the silence for a while, keep looking in her eyes. There should be a few seconds of silence, not the awkward kind though, more of a very pleasant tension if you've done everything right. Kissing her in the midst of her sentence is dangerous and should only be attempted by pro's.

Now this part is scary because by now your inner monologue has morphed into a chicken. Thousands of voices will try to talk you out of it: ""Not yet!"", ""She'll push you away!"", ""You're gonna fuck up!"", ""You're breath stinks!"", ""You're a dumbass!"", ""There's always tomorrow!"", ""Cluck, cluck, bwaaaak""... Don't listen to them. No matter how appropriate the time for a first kiss, those voices will always be there, they're not a sign that you should wait, they're not your awesome gut-feeling that's always right. Focus on the rational part of your brain here, let him do the talking, he knows. If you analysed your situation correctly and you can see her signs just go for it.


There are basically two ways to go for a first kiss if you want to do it right: the cute, short one or the epic, long one. Of course there is also everything in between but this is the axis of the memorable first kiss and you should choose what suits your style and appeals most to your personal comfort level. The short one is great when you are very nervous and, if done right, leaves a greater impression. Never underestimate the power of imagination. A short kiss will leave her with a much weaker memory of the kiss afterwards, this will force her to 'romanticise' it later when she replays the kiss in her daydreams. I tried both and I'm a fan of the epic one, just because I'm addicted to kisses.

Short and cute: keep your hands to yourself, just lean in. Close your eyes and kiss ON her mouth. Place your lower lip between her lips. Since you're kissing her I think this is a bit more appropriate than placing your upper lip between hers, it's a bit more dominant. Hold it for a second or two and finish it (that 'smack' sound, keep it quiet though). Now open your eyes and look STRAIGHT in hers. Smile, whisper goodbye and leave. Don't look back! Okay... maybe a quick glance.

Long and epic: This should only be attempted if you're confident enough, otherwise you might fuck up :( Reach out to her, place one hand on her waist or behind her back and gently pull her towards you, don't be afraid to press her against you. Gently place your other hand either behind her neck (with your thumb in front of her ear) or on her jaw (make sure you don't have cold hands if you do this). Reposition your hand that was previously on her thigh so as to wrap it around her back, placing it on the other waist. Congrats, you're now in a very intimate position and it should feel awesome! [Now kiss.](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-cjtV1HLUtmY/UDRYpgkv0qI/AAAAAAAAAh8/dbDxLCflL4o/s1600/now_kith.png) You're already asserting quite some dominance so go ahead and place your lower lip between her lips. Kiss SLOWLY and multiple times. Don't over-use your tongue, it's not even necessary. If you do decide to use your tongue don't stick it in her mouth, just gently touch hers. Don't fucking twist and twirl it around, they should just touch once in a while. The focus should always be on the lips. If your breath smells nice, which it should if you're in this situation, you could breathe out through your mouth while kissing (again, just once in a while). This can be very erotic and it's subtle enough to not scare people away who don't like it, just try it and see if she likes it. I myself absolutely adore it when a girl does that. Generally speaking you should keep your eyes closed, although you could try opening your eyes once in a while. If you're lucky she will do it at the same time and this will cause an explosion of butterflies, unicorns and rainbows. Epic kisses usually lead to a lot more kisses, sometimes even whole nights of kisses and if you both feel like it, maybe even sexy-time. In other words: this is not a goodbye kiss. If you're kissing her goodbye for the night, just use the short one and leave an impression that will make her wish for more and make her legs feel like rubber.

Good luck!

True,foamopolis,,,"Nah, girl. Your trifling ass doesn't get skinny on welfare. You work all day, you don't get breaks, and you chow down something high fat, high calorie, and processed before you go to your night job. You can't afford birth control, so if you get pregnant your body sucks even more going from there.

If you're the perfect christian model of chastity (which you probably will be, as the stress of your life will basically kill your sex drive until you have a drink or eight) you eat little during the week, but during the weekend you have literally nothing to do. Gas in your car to go somewhere? You need it for work. Hobbies? Those cost money. Your cheapest bet is eating a shitload of ramen while watching pirated movies (if your internet isn't out and your roommate doesn't bitch at you about the noise) on your years-old laptop and then calling some friends to your house to drink cheap vodka and bitch. Your body is in starvation mode, so it saves every last one of those calories, and there's quite a few in alcohol.

You don't get any of those nice collarbones or jutting ribs. Your muscle tone (the stuff that makes girls who aren't skin and bones look nice) turns to flab, so all of a sudden there's a belly where there used to be smooth abs, and maybe your arms wiggle a little when you move, and your butt kinda looks like lego butt, except dipped in gravy. You used to look good, and you still probably look okay, but it doesn't make you fabulous. It makes you fucking average.

""Oh, but I'll exercise!"" Bitch, no you won't. You'll feel terrible unless you're drunk. Even if you're not physically exhausted, the stress of dealing with all your bills will have a psychosomatic effect on you. Sometimes you'll feel nauseous for weeks just from anxiety, like when your car won't start.

But, if you're from a middle class family and you have some knowledge on how to look sharp and put a resume together, you can eventually get your shit together enough through the nausea, the headaches, the hangovers, and the crippling anxiety to put a resume together, go through a barrage of interviews, and land a job.

If you don't know anything about any of that shit because you were raised on foodstamps, you're basically fucked. That's how our food stamp society works. You have resources, but no information, and with no information you have no motivation to get out of the shithole your life has become. And without that motivation, all you want to do is dive deeper into a welfare hole because as far as you can see, the light at the end of the tunnel is an 80-hour work week that makes you ill until you're old enough to die.

And if, by some miracle you make it out of all of that, get a decent enough job that you can start going to school at a state university and live in a decent (not infested with vermin) apartment with some alright people with all of that ambition still burning in your gut, it feels like fucking paradise. You can exercise, have daytime sex, maintain your personal relationships, work on hobbies and interests outside of your house, and have at least one vegetable a day.

But you are left with the burning desire to punch out every sorority girl that says shit like this in your intro to economics class. That one'll never go away.

True,[deleted],,,"1. They fail to market truth anywhere near as well as the GOP markets fantasy (but the People are doing great lately to help close the gap).

2. Often they recognize but do nothing about our nation's most pressing issues and grave injustices.

3. They have allowed too much progress in the WRONG direction.  The elite have been leeching the wealth from this nation for half a century.  Reversing that isn't progress.  It's restoration.

4. The GOP uses any and all rules and loopholes therein in attempt to accomplish its goals, but the Democrats are too nice to play dirty (so the odds are inherently stacked against them in Congress).  This is intentional.  If those who represent the needs of the people operated on an equal level with those who represent the needs of the owners, then the owners wouldn't own us all.

5. Building on 4, the GOP will utterly destroy any public figure who stands in their way if they must, while the Democrats allow a foreign-owned conservative propaganda platform (FNC) to undermine our democracy overtly.

6. A Republican will tell you to your face what they are going to do and lie through their teeth about why.  A Democrat will lie through their teeth about what they are going to do, but afterward will tell the truth about why.

7. Neither party acts upon the pressing and urgent matters our species faces with any serious intent to ensure that our extinction is prevented because both are essentially labor unions owned by those who profit from our world's continued accelerating destruction.

8. When the people must be given war to be placated and manipulated, the GOP holds power.  When the people must be given hope to be placated and manipulated, the Democrats hold power.  Either way, we have been on the same road, moving in the same direction since the mid twentieth century.  

9. When religion is not the opiate of the masses, fantasies of scifi-esque utopian technocrat futures give us hope but they're the same thing in the end -- fantasies.  Poverty will never end.  Disease will never end.  Death will never end.  Hunger will never end.  This is not because they can't but because if they did then we would eventually all be equal and those who own the world would kill us all before they allow that to happen.

So ultimately, the choice between the two parties is a matter of what it will take right now to get us all to shut up and do as we are told.  None of this holds completely for any one politician nor any group of them, but to bend an Internet phrase, all of them is as corrupt as none of them.  They do their time in office, they get out, and ultimately the world's true rulers (the banks) call the shots, one way or another.

The system in place to control and manipulate the People exists because we actually can change all of this.  However, to do so we would have to do the near-impossible: virtually as one commit to principles, eschew ignorance, work hard together, and sacrifice without hesitation no matter what the cost.  This has happened from time to time throughout history, but it is rare and it is painful.  Every time it happens, humanity takes a leap forward, but ultimately the owners once again reassert control as the People return to normal.  Thus the cycle repeats.

I hold some hope that we're at the end of such a cycle and the dawn of a new era as we speak, but so has every person to recognize these things (Democrats, Republicans, Romans, Greeks, Emperor/King loyalists/revolutionaries, whatever) since the first banks took control of trade centers in ancient times, but obviously not all those who hold such hope will see it realized.  Such cycle ends happen after a little bubble pops and peels away the illusions that allow us to live comfortably in our positions of limited awareness (as has happened recently with the world economy) and people can see the simple, obvious truth.

However, be forewarned: In the next era of humanity, the United States will not be the power it is today.  Our turn will have passed.  This will without doubt be a transition involving some adjustment, some of it painful, but after it gets worse it will get much better.  These cycles have been accelerating, so rest assured: If it is not in our lifetime and our world is not destroyed, then it will almost certainly be in the days of our children.

I hope this breaks the illusory echo chamber sufficiently.  /nod",0,1353674834,,0,1353676232,1,c75kz31,t3_13nuxd,t1_c75kz31,t1_c75kry4,,1430479355,171,False,politics,t5_2cneq,171

It's one of the things that really bugs me about the NQ is that, despite its reputation as a creative centre, etc, the wifi situation sucks balls, and cafes and bars really don't seem to think it's something they need to bother with. So many half assed attempts and places showing ignorance on the matter. It's 2012, this shit matters to a lot of people, you know? When I asked in Matt and Phred's if they had wifi, they said ""Yes"", I asked them what the password was and they were like ""Oh, it's not for customers"". Seriously, guys? Did you think I was just doing some sort of weird survey?

Edit 4: To clarify, ""Sketchy wifi"" covers a lot of angles. It might not cover the entire pub, may not work some days, may be slow or otherwise unreliable; staff may be unwilling/unaware of how they can help, might not know the password, etc, etc. Basically: these places do offer WiFi, but, compared to the 'grade A' joints that have pervasive coverage, reliable connections and accommodating staff , YMMV. In my experience, they are all sketchy. I've updated the category title to reflect this.

True,[deleted],,,"If you're *only* gaming, you won't notice the difference between gaming with an i7 and an i5 (the only difference between them is Hyperthreading, which is mostly useless in games. It becomes useful when rendering videos and etc). The RAM, video card and PSU are really expensive, and if you're paying that much for a keyboard, you may as well get a [mechanical one](http://www.overclock.net/t/491752/mechanical-keyboard-guide).

I'm gonna edit this post in a few minutes with what changes I recommend!


EDIT: Here is it. The monitor has a higher-resolution IPS panel, which is considered by many to be better than ""common"" monitors. You can also adjust it's height! This is awesome. Really, that monitor you chose seemed really overpriced. Also, this video card is better and you probably won't notice any speed difference between the RAM you chose and this one. Unless you want to overclock it or something, but you didn't especify anything like that. I recommend you to read that article about mech keyboards and decide whether you want one or not, and which switch you want.

I left the expensive motherboard there because it's pretty and looking at pretty motherboars thru your case's window must feel good.

Having a full-tower case doesn't always help with airflow. Those cases are also GIGANTIC and you'll have a LOT of space left, and the 1200 V3 doesn't even has USB3.0 headers. I'd look into a mid-tower case.

I go to UCLA. So last year my best friend and I were going out to party late one night. We were dressed in costume and waiting for our other friends to meet up with us at a stop light. So this guy and a friend of his (also super weird, I think he was on YouTube too but I can't remember his name) come up to us super awkwardly and go, ""Want to see a magic trick?"" So we politely turned them down, saying oh haha thanks but we actually are leaving soon sorry about that. But oh no, they would not take no for an answer. They INSISTED on performing ""magic tricks"" (like putting my phone in a balloon...wtf?) until our friends got here. Zach then dropped the ""I'm YouTube famous"" bomb and gave us his YouTube business card. Wahoo. I'm sure I have it somewhere around here. They also showered us with awkward complements such as that I look like Britney Spears (I look absolutely NOTHING like her besides the fact that I am a girl. Everyone I told about that cracked up). They didn't leave for so long that I ended up texting my friend to have her call and pretend our other friend was drunk and we needed to walk her home. Oh yeah and then they kept inviting us to go party with them and wouldnt let us leave until i Gave them my (fake, obviously) number. They looked like 30 years old, I was 18 at the time.

True,1gnominious,,,"Republicans think that they can win the Latino vote but it's hopeless.

1 -  They horribly misunderstand Latino Catholics in the US.  They think that people actually listen to Rome.  Statistically Catholics are above 50% support for gay marriage, that's more than other major Christian groups.  Abortion isn't a deal breaker and people laugh at the idea of banning contraception.  The latinos who do vote Republican are mostly the evangelicals, who actually make up a decent chunk at just under 20%.  

2 -  I'm half latino/half white, was catholic (now atheist), and born/raised in Texas.  I know where I'm not wanted.  I got shit for being Mexican growing up.  While in Waco I got shit from Baylor students thinking I was catholic (atheist by that time, but figured I'd better stick with them thinking I'm Catholic).  After 9/11 I got shit for being Arab and a muslim because I was tan with long black hair and a beard.  I'm pretty familiar with the people who gave me shit for 20+ years and I don't see those types in the Democratic party.  When a white dude with a southern accent driving a pick up calls me a sand nigger I never saw a Gore bumper sticker, but I did see some Bush ones.  Why would I ever join a party that associates with people who despise me for simply existing?  Not only that but they can't even be bothered to harass me with the right racial and religious insults.  So long as they're over there, I'm staying away.  While not nearly as bad as what happened to blacks it's the same basic deal.  They remember who was manning the fire hoses, spitting on them, and passing racist laws.  Simply saying ""My bad, vote for me plz"" doesn't cut it after that.  It's easy to understand why Republicans always lose the black vote.  

3 -  Immigration isn't a big deal for second + generation latinos.  Even if they were to be more liberal on immigration than the democrats it wouldn't help much.  

Don't get me wrong, there are good Republicans out there, but they abide all the shit heads.  The racists, the tea party, the religious extremists, etc... form a rather substantial portion of their base.  They have to include them because without all the crazies they don't have the numbers to be competitive and splitting the party would be disastrous as you split the conservative vote between two candidates and hand the election to the liberal.  

The republicans just have to face the fact that nobody likes them.  Blacks, latinos, asians, the entire rest of the world.  The only demographic they control are rural, white males in the US.  No other group in the entire world likes them.  Not even white males from other countries.  It's not even a sex or race issue.   Republicans just have to accept that nobody likes them not because of who they are, but because of what they do.

True,SisterRayVU,,,"No problem dude, I think this is something we all grapple with when we start dressing a bit out of comfort zone.

That said, 'it's just clothes'. An OCBD, slim chinos, and nice shoes will always look good. And it gets ragged on, but I still think it's versatile. Unironed, untucked, and with some attitude, and you look drastically different than clean and pressed and tucked. 

But good luck dude, it's really fun shit and the best part is playing around and finding out what works in the broader sense and what works for you and getting the marriage between the two of them. That's what defines a personal style and gives you distinction, I think.

False,yishan,,,"Even though this was downvote-collapsed I wanted to reply just to clarify things.

First, reddit isn't a subsidiary of a large media corporation anymore.  We were spun off several months ago.  The nice part of this is that reddit is independent and can make its own decisions, especially on behalf of its very... unique community.  :)  The other part is that we need to be pay for our own operations now.  We've got some money in the bank, but unless we can pay the cost of operations, we'll eventually go under.  *That means no more reddit, guys.*

Second, even if we were (and back *when* we were) part of a large media conglomerate, that doesn't mean they just give us money.  As a tiny, money-losing department, you're not exactly the place that the budget allocation process looks at and says, ""Wow, let's throw more money down that unprofitable pit!""  Large companies aren't charities, they are businesses, and it means that they like to invest in profitable departments, not unprofitable ones.  So even back when reddit was a part of Conde Nast, we couldn't just say, ""Oh, give us more cash to burn.""  It doesn't work that way (we did try though).  You have to show you can make money so that (ironically) your parent company would want to invest more in growing your operations.

Anyhow, I just wanted to clarify that.  To everyone else here who bought reddit gold, thank you!  We'll even be rolling out some new features and other things soon for ya!

Happy Thanksgiving!  (to those in the States)

True,[deleted],,,"I actually work for the rec department here so I can help you out with this. Outdoor Soccer is NOT offered during the spring semester due to the unpredictable and cold wet weather.

There is an assortment of fitness programs, sporting clubs, swimming activities, and indoor intramural sports to choose from. If you are looking for a list, I would refer to our website which is rec.sfu.ca. On that site you can find listings of the clubs, sports, and fitness programs that exist here. However, all the current listings are from this fall semester, so not all of them (ie outdoor sports) will be offered next semester. 

I have participated in a variety of clubs, and overall they are a lot of fun. If you enjoy soccer, I would definitely check out the futsal recreational leagues, which is basically indoor soccer.  Many of the sports clubs are also fun, I did a learn to run club before which was pretty decent. I also participate in spinning classes and a triathlon training club.

True,frozen_pingu,,,"This reminds me of when I used to play Guild Wars 1. I'd never played anything but single players on my PS1/PS2, and so it blew my mind that when I entered an outpost, all the people running around - were other people! I played it alone, only communicating with others when I was really stuck. 

One time, I got really stuck on a mission and asked for help. One guy was max level and said he'd help me, no bother. I called him Cave (a shortened version of his character's name) and we steamrolled the mission and kept playing all that day and really progressed in the story line (which he'd already completed). He invited me into his guild and told me if I needed any more help, just ask.

Everyone else in the guild were good friends, all through Cave. We would play a lot together over 2 years or so. At the time I was a little bit down with things in life, so getting onto GW and immersing myself with all these new friends was an amazing relief.

One time (when I was a lot more competent at the game), I asked if anyone wanted to do a certain task with me. Everyone was busy, but Cave said he'd come along. I was max level at this point too, and playing with Cave was quite frustrating because he was very slow and methodical, even when it wasn't needed. I kept saying things like ""I might do this later, it's a little boring."" or ""I don't know if I'll have time to complete, want to quit now?"" Eventually, he got the hint and left in a rage.

Cave's sister found out what happened and a revolt happened, I was a big member of the guild, but the ones who were there before me wanted me gone, Cave was saying things such as falling out with his best friend made him not want to play anymore etc.

Cave came online a few days later and everyone met in the Guild Hall. They discussed whether or not to kick me from the guild (they took the game very serious, I assumed the game was there life, so I just went along with it). Everyone wanted me gone except Cave, he said I was too great of a talent to let go and so, reluctantly, I was allowed to stay. I tried to apologize to Cave but he didn't respond and logged off.

When I noticed Cave hadn't been online in a couple of days, I asked his sister what was up. She said he's been having pains in his legs and he's just been in bed the whole time, and that the doctor was coming over to check him out. Over the next few days she became more concerned and although I tried my best to cheer her up, I always assumed she was being dramatic.

One day I logged on and the Guild message appears (it pops up each time you log on). It was from his sister, she'd written something along the lines of ""Cave died this morning, he would like to thank you all for the joy you brought him over the last couple of years. The guild is left in control of frozen_pingu, we trust he is the right man for the job.""

No one liked me in that guild, but they all stayed (they eventually grew to like me again, and we played together), but  I didn't play much for a while, neither did anyone else. We all returned in dribs and drabs but I missed him so much. I knew nothing about him, I didn't want to ask details about his death, no one in real life had no idea of his existence. It was difficult trying to come to terms with it. I was 14 at the time and he was responsible for so so many happy memories in a time when they were difficult to come by.

Many condolences OP, I know how strange the situation can be.

True,whitetruffle,,,"First, here are some places I make sure to take friends when they visit:

-Shake Shack (burgers)

-Lucali and Di Fara (pizza)

-Katz's Deli (pastrami sandwich—SO GOOD)

-Pommes Frites (fries with lots of sauces—mango chutney is great)

-Xian Famous Foods (Chinese Xi'an food)

-Ippudo and Totto (ramen)

-Bonchon (Korean-style fried chicken)

-Peter Luger (porterhouse steak)

-Nan Xiang Dumpling House (Chinese soup dumplings / xiaolongbao)

-Murray's Bagels AND Ess-a-Bagel (both have really good bagels!)

---

Burgers:

-Shake Shack is probably the must-try NYC burger.

-I like the Spotted Pig's burger and Minetta Tavern's Black Label Burger. You can make a reservation for the latter, but you'll likely have to wait one to two hours for the former.

-The Breslin's Lamb Burger is also really good!

---

Pizza:

-Di Fara in Brooklyn for more traditional NYC pizza. The wait time is around an hour.

-Lucali in Brooklyn for more artisanal pizza. The wait time is also around an hour. Arrive before 5:45 to get a minimal wait time.

-Other solid pizza places include: Motorino, Luzzo's, and Artichoke Basille's (REALLY GOOD when you're drunk haha).

---

Hot Dogs:

-Nathan's in Coney Island has the best hot dog in NYC in my opinion.

-Crif Dogs and Japadog are both good. I have a lot of friends who really like one but hate the other.

-If you plan to stop by Crif Dogs (or Xe May for the banh mi), try to make reservations at Please Don't Tell; it's a speakeasy hidden in Crif Dogs that makes REALLY good cocktails.

---

Fried Chicken:

-Amy Ruth's in Harlem has REALLY good chicken and waffles!

---

Delis:

-Katz's Deli has amazing pastrami.

-Russ &amp; Daughters, which is right next to Katz's, is a pretty great Jewish deli. They have great bagels with lox/salmon, cream cheese, and so on.

-Barney Greengrass (in the Upper West Side) is another great Jewish deli. They have amazing sturgeon!

---

BBQ:

-Fette Sau in Brooklyn is my favorite.

-Hill Country BBQ in Manhattan is my second favorite, though I don't think it comes close.

---

Steak:

-The porterhouse at Peter Luger's in Brooklyn is amazing.

-The mutton (it's really lamb) at Keen's is great, too.

---

Italian:

-I like Babbo and Del Posto. Del Posto's more for fine dining, and Babbo has really, really good pasta.

---

Tapas:

-Eh... Tapas in NYC aren't that great, especially compared to the amazing tapas places in Spain :(. I honestly don't really know haha. I have a list of places I like, but... I'm not really sure if they're worth trying for you if you came from London :(.

---

Venezuelan:

-Caracas Arepas has REALLY good arepas, and it's pretty cheap, too!

---

Chinese:

-Xiaolongbao? Nan Xiang in Flushing. My friends visiting from Cali like to compare it to Din Tai Fung in Arcadia sometimes; they're different styles of xiaolongbao. I still think DTF in Taipei is my favorite, though. still, Nan Xiang is probably my favorite place in NYC.

-Normal dumplings? People like Prosperity Dumpling (5 for $1) and Vanessa's Dumpling House (I want to say the basic is 4 for $1.). Both are really cheap.

-Noodles? I personally like Lanzhou in Golden Shopping Mall in Flushing (across Xi'an Famous Foods) the most. Others like Lamb Noodle Soup, though (Yelp it!). If you want to stay in Manhattan, Tasty Hand-Pulled Noodles is decent.

-Szechuan? I like Lan Sheng.

-People REALLY like Mission Chinese Food for fun spins on Chinese dishes. It's worth a try if you're curious; you can read about it and some of their dishes online! It's usually at least an hour-long wait, though.

-And random stuff/more Xi'an food? I like the beef burgers and lamb skewers at Xi'an famous and Biang!

---

Korean:

-Honestly, the Korean food in NYC isn't too amazing. Lots of the food in Ktown is similar and overpriced (compared to LA, at least :(.) One good thing is that they'll still serve you lots of soju after 4 a.m.!

-Sik Gaek in Woodside and Flushing has sannakji (cut-up raw octopus)!

-I LOVE taking my friends to try Korean-style fried chicken at Bonchon!

-For fine dining with a few Korean elements, Jungsik is pretty amazing.

---

Sushi:

The places I like are:

-Masa (but that's way too expensive—it goes to about $1,000/person)

-Sushi Yasuda ($150/person for omakase)

-15 east ($150–200/person for omakase)

-Gari (really inventive and not traditional at all—it's about $200 for omakase if you eat a solid amount).

-If you want cheaper places, Sushi Azabu and Ushiwakamaru are pretty good.

---

Kaiseki:

-Once again, Masa probably has the best, but it's not really a realistic choice to go to :(.

-I also really like Soto for their kaiseki dishes; the sushi is okay there.

-Kyo Ya has really good kaiseki, too!

-Kajitsu is good if you don't mind trying vegetarian kaiseki! It's kind of pricey, though, and they might not be as good as they were in years past; the previous head chef apparently left in mid-2011 :(.

---

Other Japanese:

-Ramen: Ippudo and Totto are my favorites. I wouldn't really use your time to go anywhere else for ramen.

-Soba: Soba-ya's great!

-Yakitori: Hm. This one's hard. People usually just go to Yakitori Taisho or Yakitori Totto in St. Mark's Place, but... I've had friends from Japan who didn't love those two places' yakitori.

-Japanese Pasta: Basta Pasta's supposed to be good!

-Takoyaki (fried octopus balls): Otafuku is good.

---

Thai:

-SriPraPhai in Woodside, Queens, is my favorite.

-The duck panang curry in Ayada Thai (also near SriPraPhai) is AMAZING. Also, if you stop by Woodside, try to stop by Fresca La Crepe (They make my favorite crepes in NYC!).

---

Vietnamese:

-Pho: Honestly, I don't really know a really good place here that compares with the great San Jose or Westminster places.

-Banh mi: Ba Xuyen in Brooklyn has the best banh mi in NYC. Unfortunately, it's pretty far. For a closer one that's decent, try Xe May on 8th St. and 1st Ave. (That's also near Please Don't Tell, which is a speakeasy with really good cocktails. You want to make reservations beforehand, though!)

Fine Dining:

-If you want something closer to modernist stuff like Fat Duck, the closest is probably wd~50 in terms of modernist cuisine.

-If you want really, really good fine dining that isn't super modernist (so closer to, for instance, Ramsay, Ducasse, and Helene Darroze), Per Se, Le Bernardin, and Eleven Madison Park are all amazing.


-Marea is pretty solid if you want a cheaper place with good seafood (though I don't think the seafood there is as great as Le Bernardin's seafood haha).

-Jean-Georges is really good if you like fine dining with some Asian influences. They have a REALLY, REALLY GOOD lunch deal, so it's too bad that you don't have lunch free :(.

-If you want REALLY traditional French fine dining, Daniel is good. It feels too stuffy for me, though. (Then again, even Le Bernardin feels pretty stuffy to me!)

-I can't really think of an equivalent to a place like Dinner by H.B. in NYC. Hm...

Dessert:

-I really like more Asian desserts. to that end, I like: Chikalicious, Cha-An, and Kyotofu. I guess Spot Dessert Bar is solid, but it's always crowded; I think it's kind of overrated :(.

-Wafels &amp; Dinges (waffle dessert truck) is great!

-If you stop by Woodside, try to stop by Fresca La Crepe. They make my favorite crepes in NYC!

-I honestly haven't really explored the other dessert places, so I can't say much about them :(.

---

Best Bakery:

-Honestly, I don't really know :(. I really, really like Maison Kayser a LOT, though. Their baguettes and croissants are amazing!

-Other people usually like to go to Bouchon Bakery; that's generally a solid choice (Thomas Keller and all).

Random:

-I like the Momofuku restaurants, but they ARE pretty overpriced. (Milk bar, Ssam, Ma Peche, Ko, and Noodle Bar—Noodle Bar has REALLY good pork buns but below-average ramen.)

-Laduree has the best macarons, but... you have one in London, so you really don't need to go there. (AND you also have Pierre Herme in London. Lucky!)

-Visiting friends always want to try the 53rd St. and 6th Ave. halal food cart to try the chicken/lamb and rice, so I'll usually take friends there. I personally think it's a bit overrated. (Admittedly, though, it IS a lot of food for only $6, and that white sauce IS good hahaha.)

-For fish and chips, A Salt and Battery is pretty solid. Still... you're from London, so don't waste your time there hahaha.

True,uber1337h4xx0r,,,"Believe it or not, but chances are that MANY new recruits to customer service jobs had the potential to be another ""Jackie"", but it ended up not going through because of inconsiderate customers that ruined their perception of people.

I used to be really, really friendly and courteous to my customers, but after 6 years of being talked down by people far less intelligent than me (not being pretentious; chances are the majority of us here are more intelligent than the people that act like I'm some sort of an idiot because I'm working a retail job as opposed to marrying some semi-rich person like they did), it affected me a bit.

Now, granted, I'm still very courteous and friendly to almost all my customers, but I've definitely lost some of my patience over the years.  An example:

If a customer had interrupted me while I was assisting another customer, I would have apologized to my current customer and asked them if it was ok with them if I went to see what the other person needed.

But now I have grown a bit jaded and tell them, ""I'm currently assisting another customer, but I'll be glad to assist you when we are finished.""  Then I proceed to make my current interaction with my original customer slightly more prolonged just to make the interrupter annoyed.

True,Warlizard,,,"Too late to the thread but this is a good story:

Everyone has worked with someone they hated.  I’ve never had a job where there wasn’t someone who made my life miserable, or whose very presence pissed me off.  Usually you just have to put up with them, but every once in a great while, you can get even…

“Dave” was a dick.  Stoop-shouldered, balding, in his 50’s, Dave was a patronizing and irritating bastard.  He’d been at IBM his whole career, had been making good money, and hated contractors.  He thought they were bad for the company, that the only people worth a shit were regular employees, and he made it his personal priority to fuck with all of us.  Nothing overt, but constant subtle pressure was put on everyone whose badge said “Contractor” on it.  I think he developed this attitude from working with the guys from India, probably because they were so soft-spoken and accommodating, but maybe he was just a racist.  I dunno, but whatever the reason, he took every opportunity to send us on little errands, wouldn’t get back to us if we needed something, criticized anything we did and generally made our lives hell in a way that couldn’t be directly protested.

I was pretty good friends with the guy sharing the room with him, another full-time employee and one day “Robert” called me up.  “War.  We’re going for coffee.”

“Um, ok, let me just finish up a few things.”

“You don’t understand.  We need coffee NOW!”

Right.  I headed over to his office and he met me about halfway there.  His eyes were shining with glee but he wouldn’t tell me what was going on until we had our coffee in the cafeteria.  Once we finally had a table, he said, “Ok.  Dave’s a fetish wrestler!”

“Huh?”

“He’s a fetish wrestler!”

“Dude, I’ve got nothing.  WTF is a fetish wrestler?”

It turned out that there were men who pay women to wrestle them into submission.  Some of them did it as a sort of hobby and others were extremely serious about it.  Dave was one of the latter.  Several times a year, he’d tell his wife he was meeting up with old Army buddies but went to Fetish Wrestling conventions instead.  They were highly organized, had rings set up for use, referees to score the matches and everything.  I never quite understood the need for refs, but hey, it’s not my fetish.  There were web pages devoted to the women who were available to wrestle and Dave’s favorite was a woman named “Red Robin”.   She was a little tiny woman who was an absolute beast and he paid her thousands of dollars every time he’d go to one of these conventions for her to wrestle him for about 20 minutes per match.  We went back to my office and pulled up Red Robin’s website.

“Why does he pay this woman to wrestle him?  She’s ugly as hell.  Do they fuck after?”

“He says no.”

“Let me get this straight…  Dave lies to his wife, flies out to California to have an ugly woman named Red Robin wrestle him into submission, pays her $400 per match, and DOESN’T fuck her?”

“Yep.”

“Bullshit.”

I went on to the main wrestling site and started reading Dave’s posts.  And there were a ton of them.  He talked in great detail and depth about the “sport”, had invented his own move, called the “Twisted Ostrich”, and told stories about amazing matches he’d won and lost.
Look, I’m all about people’s private lives remaining private, and I probably wouldn’t have done anything if he hadn’t so consistently been a fuck to me.  But he had, so game on!  I registered a fake account under the name Sue_Plex on the wrestling web site and started corresponding with him.  

I started by asking him some technical questions about the Twisted Ostrich, but it wasn’t long until he started asking me personal questions.  As time went by, I fleshed out the character so within about a month he had become quite good friends with Miss Plex.  I told him I was a late-20s single lawyer living in D.C.  My marriage had ended because my husband just didn’t understand my interest in such a harmless sport.  It was so nice to talk to someone like him who really understood me.

It was unbelievably satisfying.  Every time he’d send me on some stupid errand, I’d think of how he was confessing his private life to the character I’d created.  Oh, and he lied his ass off.  He dropped a good ten years and his wife somehow.  Finally, he asked for a picture.  Well, I’d already downloaded a whole set of a girl who looked about that age, and the photos didn’t look professional.  I started with a simple one and he gushed about how hot I was.  Over the next few weeks, I sent him more and more photos, each more revealing than the last, until the girl was fully nude, but didn’t look posed.  

He started trying to be really sexy, and started talking about how the best way to end a good wrestling match was with sex.  Hold the phones!  He’d told Robert that there wasn’t any sex at the matches!  I probed a bit and he finally admitted he had sex with the girls he wrestled.  

I fucking knew it!  

They were hookers working a special kind of crowd.  It made more sense he was spending 400 bucks per match.  I amped up the sexy talk too, including wrestling into it.  It was gold.

He was hooked.  His work slowed down, he became obsessed with Sue_Plex and quite frankly, my work suffered as well having to answer all his notes.  Fortunately, he didn’t notice because he was too busy sending off love letters.  Now it was driving me nuts, because here was this creepy 50’ish guy who was still giving me a daily ration of shit but was secretly having an online affair with a character I’d created.  Robert and I had a ton of fun fucking with the poor guy, but one day, he called me up again – “War.  Coffee.  Now.”
At the cafeteria he told me that Dave had another “Army reunion” coming up and we should see if we could get him to come to D.C. to meet “Sue” instead.  Hmmmm.  Genius!  I sent Dave an email and said we should get together some time.  Boom.  In a flash, he responded that he had been thinking the same thing and had some time off in a few weeks.  Would I be interested in him coming to visit?  
Yes.  Yes I would.  

As Sue, I arranged to meet him in D.C. at local hotel.  As the day approached, Dave became more and more excited and fucked with us less and less.  He still tried, but the conviction and heat wasn’t there anymore.  Robert and I were going nuts, having to act like nothing was going on while Dave prattled on about how happy he was to hook up with his old Army buddies, what a fun trip it would be, how he was hoping he didn’t get pinned down by the snow, etc.  I guess he thought he was being clever, but since we already knew the entire story, it just came across as pathetic.

He left early on a Friday to catch his flight, smiling like a champ.

Tuesday morning, he showed up looking like his best friend had died.  We asked what was wrong and he tried to play it off like he was just tired from his long weekend, but as soon as he could, he sent Sue a message asking what the hell had happened and why hadn’t she showed up?  We waited to respond until after lunch.  He was a basket case.  Finally we fired back a furious message that we’d called his house on Friday just to leave him a message and some WOMAN ANSWERED!  We said we’d pretended to give her a survey and we knew about his wife and 4 kids.  So he’d been lying to us all along.  Basically, we went batshit crazy on him.  We told him if he ever tried to contact us again, we’d tell his wife everything.  We waited for him to get the email, watched him surreptitiously read it and then we watched him have a meltdown.

He started sweating like crazy, called his wife to check on her, and finally left early.  He was never the same after that.  He pretty much stopped messing with contractors and kept to himself.  We never sent him any more emails and he never sent any to Sue.  My contract ended not too long after that and that was the last I heard of him.

It couldn’t have happened to a nicer guy.

When I was 13, I woke up in the middle of the night to a man laying next to me in my small bed, staring right at me. I looked at him all confused and told myself ""OH! Silly, you're having a nightmare!"" So I smiled at him, closed my eyes and was about to fall back asleep... when he started touching my thigh. Two things happened at once: I realized that I was only in my bra and underwear and that I was definitely not having a nightmare. Fear like I've never felt before gripped every inch of my body and I think I stopped breathing. He started making his way up to my underwear, presumably to take them off. What did I do? I opened my eyes and I shit you not said ""Hold on a second, I have to pee."" He looked shocked, but didn't stop me as I wrapped my blanket around my body and proceeded to take a few steps toward my bathroom. Then I noticed that my bedroom door was wide open, so I bolted. I ran to my mom's room, banged on the door and SCREAMED about how there was a man in my bedroom. My mom came out to the hallway and had just started reassuring me that it was a bad dream, when the fucker dashed out of my room and toward the front door. My mom froze, but I got the biggest sense of ""How the fuck dare he try to rape me?"" That's when I grabbed a lamp, ripped the cord out of the wall socket as I started chasing him, insanely waving that lamp and screaming all the profanities that my 13-year-old mind has ever heard. I chased that fucker down the streets while my mom called the police. I lost him somewhere in the dark, but when the police came, got statements and started searching the neighborhood, I got my revenge. They caught him hiding in the bushes, brought him over, and asked me to identify him.

True,serverdiem,,,"I worked as a server in a fine dining restaurant in a touristy town in Florida. The owners, a husband and wife team, were notorious for being cruel and petty bastards, but it was 2008 and I had just been laid off so I had to take anything. On top of that, I was engaged to be married (paying for the wedding ourselves) and planning a move to NYC as well. 

This could be an incredibly long story, so I will just give a few examples of their batshit cruelty.

1. Dyslexic Server who trained me. Fired a week after I started because he took too long to write the specials on the chalkboard. (They knew he was dyslexic.)

2. His replacement. Dec. 23rd. She was fired for selling the wrong bottle of wine. While this was definitely her mistake, their handling of it was despicable. She sold a $125 bottle of wine for $35. (Restaurant prices not the restaurants actual cost. those were $56 and $10.) The owner let the table know of the servers mistake, saying ""I hope you are enjoying that bottle of wine, its actually a $125 bottle. But don't worry, You don't have to pay for it. Your server will have to."" Needless to say, the table was furious for being put in that awkward position, and were gracious enough to give an awesome secret tip to cover the cost. Here is the nasty part. She finished out her shift and paid the total $125 thinking she still had a job. She was fired on Christmas eve by text message. 

3. Me. I kept quiet as much as I could. I saw that when ever you shared any bit of your personal life with these fucks, they used it to torment. The wife-owner follow me around the FOH and berate me in increasingly weird ways with the intent to emasculate. Once they met my fiancé and from that moment on, the wife-owner would make jabs saying ""she doesn't seem like she is too thrilled to get married,"" or ""She probably expects better,"" and then laugh it off like she was just joking.  It was my strategy to just eat shit and save money, and not let it bother me. She figured this out right away and got downright sadistic, trying to see how far they could push me and see what I would do without complaint. I managed to suck it up for 2 years thanks to alcohol, no backbone, and financial need.
   My breaking point was when she told me to take away the chair our hostess was sitting in when no customers were around.  Granted sitting on the job is supposedly unprofessional, but she was an elderly woman, sick, working outside. The hostess wouldn't dare call in sick as she was working here illegally from Hungary, and similarly had to eat as much shit as was thrown at her. So rather than talk to the hostess and possibly take over for her sick employee, she asked me to snag the chair from her without explanation. Here is the fucked up part. I did it. I fucking did it. The hostess understood. Really, what could she say? she knew what was happening and gave me this look of understanding that I'll never forget. I got a few feet away and put the chair back, looking straight back at the vile shitstain that asked me to be cruel to another person for her amusement. The owner didn't say a word to me about my subordination and gave me the cold shoulder for the rest of the evening. 
    2 weeks later, I was closing out my tips and receipts with the husband-owner. I had counted my bank prior to cashing out with him as I always did. Everything added up just fine. Turns out he had secretly added in a cash ticket to my till for $150. It showed on the report he printed at 1 minute before running the cashout report. I had only 4 tables, all cash tips on all credit card tickets that night so it was not hard to keep track of.(Lucky me I thought) I questioned this and said I had double checked my math and he must have made some mistake. His response was, ""If you don't like it, there is the door."" That pretty much sealed it. I knew what was happening and luckily my brain initiated the YOU IS BOUT TO BE FORCED TO QUIT SO YOU DONT GETS THE UNEMPLOYMENT MONIES Disaster recovery response. I refused to pay him and said I will be returning to work tomorrow for my next scheduled shift, and we can work this out then. He said fuck you, get out. I was fired. This was very important. I was fired. I didn't quit.

I was a month away from moving to NYC with my wife to try to start a career in my field. I just needed one more month of saving every last penny I made and I was out! This pretty much fucked me. 

So I filed for unemployment stating the reasons I was fired on my last night, which met the eligibility requirements. The unemployment office contacted my former employer for verification and he said I was fired for stealing wine and there were witnesses. My claim was denied. The next step was to dispute the claim. I disputed and it went to the adjudication process. Basically what amounted to a phone hearing between my former employer, an unemployment case worker, me, and any ""witnesses."" 

This is where I got revenge. 

I knew of the upcoming hearing, and my employer was notified by mail of the date. The letter explained the process and instructed to line up any witnesses and materials needed for the case. It also stated that you have a period of time to reschedule the hearing if needed. An unemployment worker explained the process to me over the phone before the letters were mailed. I then paid a anarchist punk guy with beer to steal any of their mail from the unemployment office and bring it to me. Leading up to the hearing I also reported them to ASCAP for playing copyrighted music in their establishment without paying dues, (A fairly hefty fine) and reported some of their more crooked dealings to the IRS. (Namely how the wife-owner would use her name as an employee for several of the illegal workers, underreporting earnings, etc) I also dropped a dead fish into their gutters above their patio, waited a week for the rats to appear and called the heath dept. 

At the time of the hearing, the owner was caught off guard and tried to reschedule. He was not allowed to reschedule because the letter (Which he never received...hehe) stated that failure to attend the hearing automatically results in a ruling for the other party. He complied and we went along with the hearing without his fake witness. During the hearing I kept calm but he lost his temper. I answered my questions in a way to really get his anger going, and it worked. the key question posed to my former employer was ""Had he not stolen any property, would you still have fired him?"" He slipped and said yes, sending the ruling in my favor. 

A few weeks later I received my check for all the past months of unemployment. It was enough to get me to NYC. 

2 and a half years later, I am still married (HA BITCH!!) and found an excellent job in my field with great pay, benefits, an awesome boss, and union representation. They are struggling to keep the doors open and have both had a host of financial problems.

True,AllPeopleSuck,,,"&gt;Could you maybe elaborate on the difference between these two? 

FX 8350 and the other similar ""8 core"" chips have 8 integer units and 4 floating point units. However, AMD's integer units are a lot weaker than Intels so they can fit two of them in a smaller area and they can share resources. The philosophy behind it was that when a CPU is running code, it doesn't use everything on the core anyways, so it should just share things. This way, you need less transistors and you can cram more cores on a smaller die. The FPU on AMD can run either two 128-bit instructions at the same time or one 256-bit instruction, so it's kind of like hyperthreading. The architecture itself of Bulldozer is actually really, really cool. The downfall of it was the fact that they aimed for low IPC and high clocks.

3930k has 6 full cores. That means 6 FPUs and 6 integer units, and they're all full units that don't share anything. 

AMD's strategy did work. The Bulldozer does have 8 integer units, and the die size is 319mm^2 while the 3930k with 6 integer units is about 435mm^2. However, the execution of it did not work. FX 8120 missed its clock targets by like 500mhz (it was supposed to release at 4ghz) and turbo to the mid 4ghz range. FX 8350 more than likely missed its targets too as it probably was meant to be released at about 4.5ghz base clock. The sharing of resources AMD has done is brilliant. However, the way it was executed was awful. If they instead tried to optimized K8/K10 and perform shared resources on that instead of a ground up design aimed for higher clocks, AMD probably would have had a completely killer chip. 

&gt;More particularly, what do you lose with hyper threading?

Lose compared to what? Compared to a standard Intel core, you lose absolutely nothing. Compared to AMD, you lose a lot. 

Hyperthreading is kind of like jamming more things into a pipe. As I said before, there's a lot of stuff on a chip that doesn't get used and a lot of transistors sit around doing nothing. 

Hyperthreading is an attempt to try and use more resources on the chip, but instead of sharing, it's like cramming things down a tube because the tube isn't filled all the way up. 

Hyperthreading generally gives 15% to 25% increase in multi-threaded tasks. AMD's approach, if you were to consider a core that only had one AMD integer unit and one FPU, gives about an 80% increase. 

&gt;The 8350 has eight physical cores, while the 3930k has six physical, and twelve logical.

It really depends on the cores themselves. The question is way too broad. Right now, given AMD's integer and FPU unit performance, it isn't as good as 3930k. If the FPU was much stronger, the decoder was better, and the integer units had better IPC or FX 8350 could hit higher clocks like it was meant to, then yes, it would be stronger. But, AMD made some awful decisions with their design (that Piledriver has started to fix, but there's a long way to go) so that isn't the case. 

&gt;Would the eight physical cores do better than the 12 logical?

If they were better designed cores, then yes, the AMD would walk all over the 3930k. But they're not and AMD management behind original Bulldozer made the mistake of wanting higher clock speed and lower IPC, and Global Foundaries couldn't come close to the desired clocks and power consumption. If AMD had access to Intel's 22nm process, I think we would see some very high clocked FX CPUs stock (probably close to 5ghz) that would push into the 6ghz range. I have seen some rumors that just by going from Global Foundaries 32nm with their APUs to TSMC 28nm, AMD was able to create a 35w APU with a good IGP, which is amazing. It also goes to show how horrible GloFo 32nm is compared to TSMC, and Intel is way better than TSMC. 

But the point I'm trying to make is that AMD and Intel are not on even playing fields. AMD needs to do something radical (like they did with an on die IMC), and the module approach was that, just poorly executed. AMD can not win by simply making a better traditional x86 CPU core. Their budget is about a tenth of what Intel has and they are using 32nm while Intel is using 22nm. 

&gt;Here's my context. I'm looking to buy a 3930k soon, precisely because it has 12 logical CPUs. I basically want as many threads as possible for multi-threaded programs (research). 

I love my FX 8350, but the 3930k is definitely a superior chip. The number of cores doesn't matter, it's how they perform. FX 8350 offers a tremendous multi-thread value, however it just simply can't compete with 3930k unless you're doing something special like I am where software can gain a ton from AMD's instructions and you can compile yourself. 

An off topic comparison is say, a quad core ARM chip vs a core i3. The i3 would be faster than the quad ARM since the core design is different and they have different design goals. AMD and Intel cores are the same and they shouldn't be compared by marketed core count.

A good way to compare Intel vs AMD cores is that one AMD module (that is advertised as 2 cores, so 4 module = 8 cores) is that one AMD module is the same as an Intel core with hyper-thread in multi-thread. So, AMD FX 8350 is basically on the performance level of a quad core Intel with hyper-threading when it comes to multi-thread. If AMD had a 6 module, 12 core desktop unit in the upper 3ghz range, it would be comparable to 3930k. 

I can't find any information on 8 module/16 core Opterons, but I would imagine that they would be about equal to a 3930k or a tiny bit faster given their clock speed. But they go for $700+. 

If you can afford 3930k and need multi-thread, it's definitely the better chip, even though AMD has ""8 cores"". ",0,1353787786,,0,False,1,c764yk0,t3_13psbv,t1_c764yk0,t1_c76452a,,1430489362,3,False,buildapc,t5_2rnve,3

True,thecreepywriter,,Advisor,"Some tips:

Whatever you do, do **not** go to dinner and a movie. This is a horrible, horrible mistake. When you're on a date, you should be increasing sexual tension and attraction, not sitting across from each other and watching the other try to shove overpriced food into your mouth and somehow seem graceful or sit side by side and stare at a screen and not talk to each other for two hours and then get out and be like ""well... uh, that was a pretty good movie, I guess."" Note: you can pull the movie thing off only if you're both HUGE movie buffs or are both really excited to see something, but unless things are going positively swimmingly, the whole arm-around-shoulder/sneaky-hand-holding thing is just awkward as hell. Go to a bookstore--look at books, get to know her interests, and see what she's like by how she responds to the books. You've got an entire *world* of interests in books--use it as a tool to find out what she's like. Take a walk in the park--play a game, point at people, make up stories for them, talk about things that you enjoy, talk about what you usually do in your own times when you take time to walk, then talk about how nice it is to be with someone else on the walk. Go anywhere but to dinner and a movie.

Finding things to talk about: riff. Seriously, you can talk about anything and everything so long as you do it in a unique and *you* way that shows your interests and passions. Since you sound like a pretty charismatic guy, it seems like you can do this pretty well already, but don't be afraid to do it more. Also, don't be afraid to get emotional. Now, I don't mean breaking down and crying about how your father never gave you enough attention or was emotionally distant or whatever--I mean getting to the root of a human experience. Ultimately, people come together based on what they share; while we're different, everyone relates to each other on a basic, human level. You can talk about the weirdest things so long as you can narrow it down and convey it in a way (or literally explain) what it means to you as a person.

For instance, I love video games, a lot. A lot of certain types of girls will be totally turned off by this, but I can also explain that for me, video games were how I socialized as a kid because I didn't really have that many friends because I was homeschooled and they became a huge outlet for my creativity. This turns a stereotypical ""oh ew a *gamer*"" scenario into a situation where I can now talk (or be asked) about a number of things: not having many friends, what homeschooling is like, what kind of creative stuff I like to do, etc. Most importantly, this takes a bit of vulnerability on your part, but it's also what builds attraction. Again, a **bit** of vulnerability--leave the tears at home. Just enough to show that while you're awesome, you also have depth and the emotional maturity to let someone in a little bit. If a person can't appreciate this, you don't want to date them. (I honestly wouldn't ever be in a relationship with someone who hated games--or someone I couldn't convert.)

If you *really* want to go for broke, one of the best and easiest things you can do is observational humor about her. If you're good at ""reading minds"", you can generally create an entire conversation and build a ton of sexual tension just by pointing out things you observe about who she is by how she acts and presents herself. Never reward someone based on the traits that they naturally exhibit easily--don't compliment women on their beauty, notice really out of place necklace that you bet they wear every day for some sentimental reason. Attractive women are used to being called any kind of the word; don't do it, or you just become another guy calling her beautiful. Save it for the moments when you mean it, and it comes from you rather than just a ""grooggg wow you pretty"" place. On that note: emphasize things that *you* like about her. People seem to think that it's stronger to make an objective, sweeping superlative about someone (like ""you're beautiful""), but **much** stronger is to say something like, ""Wow, I find you incredibly attractive"" or ""I like the way you tilt your head when you think I'm bullshitting"" or even ""What's that face? Is it something I said?"" From straight positivity to something going wrong, stuff like this is what shows people that you're paying attention and listening to them, and also shows your own depth of personality--the place from which these feelings come is a source, not a weird, objective concept or throwaway compliment.

Finally, be honest. Don't be *brutally* honest--but be honest. If something occurs to you, don't be afraid to say it. People know when you're lying and they know when you're just giving lip service, but they can also tell an honest, candid expression of sentiment when it comes. It's what's real, that's so totally different from our ordinary experience. Don't be afraid to admit the things you find attractive about someone, but also don't be afraid to let someone know if they've upset you or done something that's a no-go. Don't make it a big deal--just express your feelings in a real way. If you feel like someone isn't giving the date their all, say it: ""You know, I would really like to get to know you but I feel like something isn't clicking tonight. Is there anything wrong?"" Don't be afraid to ask difficult, real questions. If it freaks the girl out in a way that shows she can't deal with someone who's willing to be real with them, you don't want her anyway. Most often, though, this kind of behavior is so rare (and so good) that it'll make people want to be around you even more.

Hope that helps.

True,[deleted],,,"Well this would be my impression in an interview for the company I'm with, so it's biased and uses limited information. It may be relevant though.

The positive: You've worked with quite a few languages, you can hack at things to make them work for you (You'd be amazed how many people don't even try), you work with modern template systems, and you seem to be confident with your layout/design capabilities. I assume you're pretty good at it, which is just useful in general. Good designers are more rare than I thought in the past.

You seem to get what you're talking about in general so you're definitely on the right track. You aren't doing the thing where you claim your ruby skills as you described mean you're a ruby ninja or whatever the fuck people say on resumes. Database experience is a huge plus. Database experience with and without DBALs/ORMs would be even better, but either is cool. If I had to choose one, it would be without. Too many people are incredibly dependent on some sort of abstraction layer or relation mapper. MySQL or Postgres is ideal.

The negative: You think you have design in the bag (Bad attitude), HTML5 being rusty suggests you aren't keeping yourself current where it's very easy to do so.

You mention object oriented programming concepts then say you need to do research to use loops (Bad because loops are part of program flow control, not object oriented design, and they are a fairly primitive concept in programming. So I'm not sure how you made the connection or why you'd need to continue researching. I'd need to see examples of your loops; maybe they're really complex). To clarify I would ask you to give me an example of building and using object oriented code to your advantage. You should be able to give a really coherent, sensible, definitive answer off the top of your head if you're mentioning OOP at all.

Putting emphasis on UI/UX without banging Javascript skills isn't inherently bad, but in practice is likely to be problematic. When I build a feature heavy front end, I'm likely to use an instance of ember.js to handle a lot of interaction. That would be a disaster to maintain for someone without a good grasp on Javascript. Ability to maintain things is really essential.

All in all, for a frontend design position I would likely keep you in mind. Like you said, most people who apply for web design jobs are actually just cms customizers. I would ask you more about your ruby experience, determine what you can do with Javascript, and try to get an idea of how quickly you've progressed over the years.

At my company we are heavy users of the Symfony components (php), but we're all believers in doing what's best for a given project and being versatile. That means we hire good learners and value people with skills we don't have, such as ruby and python. I'm okay with ruby, but python. Ugh. I just don't get a chance to practice.

Anyway, that input may be useless if you're not applying with us, but there it is. Don't be too cocky about design! Or anything. We won't progress if we think we've got things in the bag so to speak. If you don't walk in sounding like someone who is eager to learn more, I'm going to have a bad impression. 

It sounds like you have a good skill set, more objectively and without interview context. If you want to stay front end, I highly recommend honing your eye for details, improving your Javascript, and generally staying handy with ruby and php for the types of tasks you're doing now. That is almost universally appealing. Also, focus on your ability to learn as much as you focus on what it is you're learning; things change so fast in this industry and I really think that the fastest on their feet will be the ones who can stay in the game the longest. I swear I've already watched coworkers become obsolete. Rather than focus on learning specific languages or styles of design, try to learn core concepts, and keep an eye out for new ones.

True,AC0CA,,,"When I was 17, I worked at Red Lobster. I closed the kitchen, so I was one of the last people to leave somewhere between midnight and 1 AM. Being as late as it was, some of the city's bus routes were already done for the day and only the heavy traffic ones were still running. Due to this inconvenience, I had to take a bus that dropped me off several city blocks away from home, leaving me with a twenty minute walk home. 

This lead me through a graveyard in the middle of a neighborhood, one of the oldest in the city. It had a small street that ran through it with streetlights, but both ends had a gate stopping vehicular traffic, only allowing pedestrians through and headstones line either side instead of sidewalks. Creepy enough at night, but it was faster than walking around, especially since the cemetery was wide and narrow. 

At this particular point, I had been walking through here at least once a week coming home from work, so I grew fairly comfortable there and would even sometimes just check out headstones instead of walking straight home. This one night, however, things changed.

I was walking up to the cemetery's street, cutting through a grocery store parking lot, just wanting to get home to bed. As I walked up the side street leading to the pedestrian entrance, the streetlights in the cemetery shut off. All of them. At once.

""Weird,"" I thought, but I carried on. My bed was calling me. I walk through the gate and the first light turned on, basking me in it's glow. I slowed, looked around and saw nothing unusual so I continued. Coming to the edges of this lone lamp, the second light flickered on, stopping me in my tracks. I pull my already quietened headphones out of my ears, getting scared and searching for an answer.

Still nothing. I pick up my pace, briskly walking through this second pool of light, noticing that the first pool has disappeared as I leave it behind. Getting up to the third light, it flashes to life while the second one dims out, much like my bravado by now. This continues on all the way through, the lights turning on and off as I enter and leave them, jogging out of fear.

As I make my escape, the lights all off for now, I think about how creepy it would be if they all turned on now... But they didn't. At least, not until I was across the street from the graveyard, causing me to break into a run for the rest of the way home.

I've told this to many friends, and always get the ""it was probably just motion sensors"". It wasn't. I continued to use that path and had a couple of other less freaky experiences, but never again did I have the lights protect(?) me in such a way.

True,crakk,,,"So what Mexican cultures are you saying you mimic? Do you live in Mexico? Are you saying that Mexicans predominantly work at restaurants? That's racist if anything. To consider yourself a ""Micksican"" as you call it, because you're Irish and act Mexican would mean you dress like, eat like or in some way mimic a Mexican specific trait. Simply being nice and hardworking isn't specific to just Mexicans. My Grandfather immigrated to the U.S. from Italy in the late 40’s by himself at 17, got drafted into the Marines during the Korean War two years later, came back raised 5 kids, and now owns two houses and is a great-grandfather. And guess what? He’s not even Mexican. He’s Italian. And the difference between my Grandfather and the people you worked with that made money for their families back home is that they probably don’t consider themselves American citizens. They’re taking American money and sending it to Mexico. That’s great for our economy haha. I live in NY, I’ve worked with Mexicans myself. They all told me if there was a draft they’re going back to Mexico. The majority of them consider themselves Mexicans first and foremost, not Americans like my Grandfather did. I never said anything derogatory about Mexicans in any of my posts. Yes, I've met lazy Mexicans. Yes, I've met successful hard working Mexicans. I've met both types of people of all races.

True,[deleted],,,"So... there's a thing that happen when you create a reasonably static instance of a token [or item that is consistently chosen to represent X], such as a meme. Or, in this case, the categorization of the memes themselves into static linguistic representations, such as ""Veiled misogyny"", or ""public shaming from an ivory tower"".

This is something that would be a bit clearer with Venn diagrams, but really we're talking about set membership.

Each of these memes is chosen to have a static image represent some feature or interpretation of features that is evidently salient to the mind of people familiar with the meme. 

In other words, each meme represents a set of which membership can be certain or vague: it is not a fixed set, is is a gradient set. An excellent example of this comes from the psychological study of color perception. It turns out that certain colors have exemplars. IE, there really is ""the reddest red"" ""the bluest blue"" and ""the greenest green"". Subsequently, adjacent colors also have an exemplar, and the colors on the spectrum between those wavelengths -ie, between red and yellow, do not fall so neatly into one set or another as do the exemplars. 

IE: orange is yellowish-red. 

It turns out that approximately mid-way between two colors you get people who will attribute set membership to different classes than other people. However, faced with the choice ""it's either Red or Yellow"" people will disagree about which set an in-between color falls into. Some people choose a third option, which was to invent ""orange"". Now it turns out (do due features of perception) this it is nowhere near as easy to pick out ""focal orange"" as it is to pick out ""focal red"" or ""focal yellow"". Likewise for every subsequent subdivision.

So these memes follow the same principles: people pick out features of everyday experience that are salient to others. It is also evident that whatever feature is picked out has the same exemplar/focal point feature. This is how we know what is an appropriate use of the meme and what isn't -a fact that is evidenced by the ""I don't think that memes what you think it memes"" meme. Likewise, for every meme there are outliers that a sufficient number of people support to include it in the meme-set, but over which there is some disagreement. 

This is a natural consequence of trying to discretize a gradient, or to measure a continuum with discrete units.

So what you have done, op, is pick out a feature that seems salient to the set of each meme. This often happens when people learn of new, useful, concepts. You re-examine the things that you used to understand a particular way and reinterpret them according to your new, useful concept. As a result, you can generalize the idea that, like a meme, a useful concept has examples that are on the gradient between being *precisely* an instance of the concept and definitely *not* an instance of the concept.

And, like any concept or meme, an inaccurate understanding tends to lead to either *over-inclusion* or *over-exclusion* of examples of the concept.

However, what you seem to have done is make an attempt to claim that *all* members of these meme instances belong to the categories and sets that you overlay upon them. I think this is an erroneous generalization.

Take for instance the ""successful black man"" meme. We can find plenty of instances of this meme which many would consider a mis-use, which indeed appear to harbor thinly veiled racism. Examples: [1](http://global3.memecdn.com/successful-black-man_o_731817.jpg), [2](http://d24w6bsrhbeh9d.cloudfront.net/photo/4705611_700b.jpg), [3](http://memecrunch.com/meme/18NE/successful-blackman-food-stamps/image.png), versus what appear to be the intended use of the meme; which is to point out an awareness *of* the inherent racism of society and ridicule it, as imaged in this [image collage](http://imgur.com/xQoq2).

E: It seems the primary difference seems to be that *good* successful black man memes play on the continuation of a well structured sentence that is actually benign in nature. Bad ones seem to employ separate clauses that appear to come off as racist. Frankly I think the difference is clumsiness, and the tendency of the reader to look for offence. A 

Here we can clearly see the same meme image used in two, apparently, contrasting ways. Does your generalization about ""veiled racism"" genuinely characterize both sets, and subsequently, all Redditors? I hardly think so. 

Best to use a bit more foresight when characterizing groups of people, and their productions on the internet.

Cheers.

True,Exis007,female,,"This is a pet theory of mine, actually. 

 I think there are people who legitimately like opposite sex friends (Group A) and there are people who really only have same-sex friends but have opposite sex ""friends"" around to be potential sex partners (Group B). Just for the LGBT kids let me say this; I could reword this to include y'all but it made my head spin trying to get the words right but know that I was thinking about you in here as well. 

So here's where the problem happens. 

* Girl (Group A) meets Boy (Group B): All men are just friends with women so they can sleep with them
* Girl (Group B) meets Boy (Group B): Come on....don't we ALL know that opposite sex ""friends"" are just waiting to bang?
* Girl (Group B) meets Boy (Group A): Dude...what do you MEAN you just want to be friends with her? Is she ugly? Don't you find her attractive? Weren't you leading her on all this time cause why else would you ever want to spend time with a girl? 
* Girl (Group A) meets Boy (Group A): Why the hell does no one believe that we're just buddies? Why is everyone so stereotypical and jaded? 

Well, the reason that the last scenario is so difficult to believe is that it is only holding about a 25% market share. That number might even be way, way off if you take into account that there may indeed be way more Group B people running around. And, hey, let's take ages into consideration. In high school or college, before anyone has standards/practice dating/controlled libidos/the good sense to keep it together there are way, way, way more Group B scenarios. Even when people didn't *intend* to fall in love with their female friends they do anyway because pickings are slim, crushes happen, and the younger you are the easier it is to overlook characteristics that would disqualify someone as a partner in the future. 

As we grow older, of course, we're a lot more picky about the kind of people we date. We've done a couple of destructive boys/girls and realized that the charm wears off and chaos is all that they leave behind. Maybe we've even gone for the nice, sweet, simple person without any sexual chemistry once or twice and now we know better than to settle for someone that doesn't click with us. We're far more likely to take those people (with all that practical experience in mind) and relegate them to friends; ""Gee, I really like you as a human being but I would **never** date/sleep with you....wanna go to a movie?""

Lastly, there are communication issues here. When a 35 year old woman looks at a man and says that she doesn't feel anything for him romantically and they should be friends, we're all FAR more likely to take that seriously. That is NOT to say there isn't game playing and lying at any age, but I am more likely to trust someone older with more experience to know her own heart and be able to pro-actively communicate boundaries. Young people who are still scared *shitless* about even the concept of asking someone out will often couch their feelings in friendship because that's the safe way to play it. It is, by consequence, also the best way to a one-way friendzone ticket but we all learn that with time (or we should, more accurately). So your words don't mean much if her friends and your friends are used to people using friendship as a euphemism because you are, in their mind, confirming what they expect: you're unaware of your romantic feelings or downplaying them because you don't have the social chutzpah to declare your attraction. 

So OP: they are giving you a hard time because they just don't get it. They might be naturally Group B kind of people, they might not have the life experience to have come across an attractive person you just don't *want* in a romantic way, and their life experience so far has told them they are right. They've probably seen friend after friend swear that their budding relationship is not worrisome because they are *just friends* only to catch them banging in the pool house the next week. Maybe there's some internal mechanism by which they once THOUGHT it was going to be a friendship only to have feelings develop on one or both sides of the coin. 

So....just relax. Time will help a lot because people will, given enough time, start to believe you and chill out about it. Time will also help inasmuch as this won't be a problem as you get older and more mature. Sorry people are dumping on you, but they aren't doing it to be assholes, they just don't know any better. Best of luck!

True,ZombieLikesPuns,,,"This is actually a story I'm really proud of. In elementary school, my class had a fairly nice art teacher. She had just recently had her first child when I was in third grade and was taking maternity leave. She was replaced by the most god-awful cunt of a substitute ever to walk the Earth. This woman was short, even compared to third-graders, and just full of concentrated hate. She was rude and exigent and sarcastic to everyone there, even other teachers, and everyone was glad when her last week rolled around, her last day was scheduled to be Valentine's Day. Also scheduled on Valentine's Day, the school's largest annual bake sale. Naturally, I swept the tables clean. With ten dollars, I must've bought at least three or four brown bags-full of cupcakes, donuts, and fuck it, even the apples and bananas they kept around for decoration. Being young and easily wiled by sugar, I ate everything I bought and felt completely fine the next period. And the period after that. But when it came time for art class, shit went south fast. I was going to throw up rainbows of frosting and powdered sugar everywhere, and I knew it. I ran to the teacher's desk and begged her to let me go to the bathroom because I was feeling sick, and of course she decides to give me a hard time. Halfway through a lecture on how I have to raise my hand when asking to use the bathroom and ask for a pass, I heave. I heaved half digested candy hearts all over that evil harpy and her desk. And I didn't stop. I directed the flow to a trash can nearby and continued emptying the contents of my stomach. It was the kind of vomiting where you're so overwhelmed by it that you start to convulse. My little navy blue mary janes scraped against the linoleum trying to get a footing, and I filled that can. When there was a break in the puking, she directed me to continue in the closet, and I complied. Someone ran for help, and the nurse came in to find the teacher crying, covered in vomit, and a little pigtailed girl in the closet with a bucket wiping her smug little face.

These ones will never know need or want, to long for something, find a way to earn it, and feel the satisfaction of having done so without help and starting from scratch all on their own.  From birth to death, they will never know self actualization because they will never earn anything for themselves.  It hurts them because self actualization is a psychological need, so they use projection and deny others what they can not have under the very transparent guise of greed.

I wish I could tell them that's not as fashionable as they think.  ""Congrats!  You're a murderous economic glutton; bank accounts like rolls of sweat-drenched fat, choking all who come near with the stench of your self worship.  Children go hungry thanks to you!  Humanity would be better off had you never existed.  How trendy!  You must be proud.""

However, because they are so spoiled, they are too weak to lock themselves out of their own wealth to challenge themselves to the experience of self-actualization even for a limited time.  Hell, they're brainwashed from childhood not to!  They're soft and they are frightened by a world full of people they have always been kept separate from.  It terrifies them to imagine themselves living among the rest of humanity.

This is why they say that the poor don't work to earn.  It's why they attack the disabled and those on any form of government assistance.  These people are mentally incapable of comprehending that we WANT to be able to work for more but can't because *they* will not allow it.  In fact, that's part of their mental disease.

They don't allow others to work for as much as they could because if they did then they could not project upon those others their own feelings of insecurity, inadequacy, and helplessness.  They need people to grind under their heel because they are forever in the shadow of those who came before them, both invalid and inferior.  These are spoiled brat child-kings.  They think themselves Augustus, while the world sees Caligula. 

This is the truth of what pathetic creatures plutocrats really are.  It's simultaneously enraging and revolting.  They're an affront to their own humanity.  Were there a God, then He truly would despise them but only out of mercy -- he would end their wretched existence before they could harm others for their own hedonistic sadism.  That's why we get people like Romney who are so sick and twisted that building wealth by destroying the lives of others is all they can do, and they think that is a gift to society.

All of this would be different if they admitted it, challenged themselves to build *at their level*, and valued those who work for them (rather than feeling entitled to the BEST workers for almost no cost while treating them like objects).  But that's not the case.  These are not civilization building industrialists.  These are not truly rulers.  They're just mentally ill people with too many resources and not enough people with the balls to tell them what pieces of shit they are.  They're frightened bullies with too many toys.

The only satisfaction we can take is in knowing that these ones will always be unhappy.  They will never, ever feel fulfilled and satisfied, and they will die in bitter regret because they will have spent their lives in demolition when they were gifted with the means to build.  I would not want to experience their final moments for anything in the world, no matter how strongly they deny these things.  Imagine.

True,AndYourWorldWillBurn,,,"We would make a good road trip team. I always make a point of telling my passengers that riding shotgun is not a privilege, it's a responsibility.

Duties include:

- Operating navigation systems (SatNav's, Mobile phones, Paper Maps, etc.)

- Entertainment Management (In-drive entertainment, music, radio station acquisition in foreign territories)

- Resource Management (Giving out/Passing out food and drink, collecting wrappers, managing waste)

- Communications. No calls, text, or any for of messages will be answered by the driver, only the shotgunner, or backseat passenger.

Benefits:

- Navigation directions given by Shotgunner are final. 

- First pick priority on all music.

- First pick priority on food and drink.

- You can ruin your driver's relationship with his girlfriend by texting her inappropriate messages.

The car is our ship, the driver our captain, the shotgunner our commander. The USA is our land to explore.

EDIT: Well, this blew up faster than I imagined but I'll add a few things here that many people have contributed that I assumed and forgot to add.

- Driver has veto power. The extent of such veto power is left to the discretion of the owner of the car and the group. I tend to give a little more freedom on music and food choices but if you put something crappy on the radio I will strike you down with the passion of a thousand suns.

- Height restrictions: Sometimes you have a super tall friend whose pure statue necessitates that he ride in a larger space. Resolving this is at the discretion of the driver. Luckily my friends and I are all similar heights, but were that not the case and the tallest person got shotgun by default, I would expect tall-friend to step up to the plate and be the best damn shotgunsman he can be to earn his rightful place as the default shotgunner.

This list is by no means exhaustive, but people have suggested additional duties such as: 

- Police lookout, the obvious benefit of that being that you don't get arrested. 
- Scouting, looking for gas stations, restaurants, hotels, and the like. If you're the Scout you can pick and lobby for locations you prefer.
- Weapon systems. Be it a milkshake thrown at a jerk (DISCRETION AND CAUTION ADVISED), or an actual shotgun to ward off zombies and mutants living in the New Mexico desert, the shotgunner is expected to lead the defense efforts of the entire vehicle. As a benefit, he gets a bloody shotgun.

There's more but I think that's all I can cover right now.

True,Riddla26,,16GB,"I'm going to be slightly brutal here OP, because I actually looked at your screenshot and no one in this thread has given you any good advice, except for the guy who mentioned Better Battery Stats.

This is possibly due to an issue in part with your signal reception and in part the WiFi network you were using.

I say this for three reasons, the steady drain while the WiFi is on, the relatively low wake and screen on instances and the fact that the second you turned it off and you got a decent signal on HSPA+ that your battery drain completely stopped at 50% for what looks like about 20 minutes.

If you have WiFi turned on but not connected to a network, what is your signal like where you are? Do you notice it's either H+ or 3G or G or E or that it often switches rapidly between those states? Android will constantly strive for a faster, better signal if the one you have isn't sufficient and if you are on the edge of a HSPA+ ""bubble"", where your phone is falling in and out of service this will often drain your battery a lot as well.

If you have WiFi on and connected, are you noticing a lot of data transferring? You can check this by going to Settings &gt; Data Usage &gt; Options &gt; Show WiFi data usage and taking a look at the graph and from there you can also see the worst offenders and probably revealing the app which is likely to be causing the problem. Another thing to check is whether your WiFi icon is blue or grey, if it's grey this indicates that your phone cannot connect to the Google services servers. Things like GTalk and GMail push messaging won't function in this state and syncing cannot complete, though the phone will often retry - wasting battery.

We can probably figure this out, get Better Battery Stats and post the results here after a drain, also if you could provide more information along the lines of what I posted that would be awesome.",0,1353873264,,0,1353873562,1,c76l1t5,t3_13ro86,t1_c76l1t5,t3_13ro86,,1430496900,16,False,nexus4,t5_2v9bv,16

True,InTheVale,,,"Apologizing in advance for the length, but I relate to this very very much...

I sometimes think about this Doctor Who episode (""The Girl in the Fireplace,"" if you're familiar) where the Doctor visits a woman at a few random times in her life.  For the Doctor, a time-traveller, the main character, each encounter comes immediately one after the other.  In fact, he's rushing around from one scene to the next.  But the woman is stuck on ""the slow path,"" forced to live out all the nothing-days between these scenes, waiting years and years for the next encounter.  We are all stuck on the slow path in this reality, forced to endure the mundanities of life, sometimes with nothing to show for it.  Time passes so slowly and nothing ever seems to change.

I like to imagine that this reality is just another setting of a book, not inherently more or less interesting than any other.  And maybe I'm still in the ""introduction"" part of my plot line, or maybe I'm just some minor/background character, unaware of the larger story unfolding (itself a depressing thought, I admit).  Still something about the possibility of being in a (book) setting on par with ""actual"" book settings make everything a little more bearable.  This concept has become easier for me to imagine because lately I've been having anxiety-related derealization.  Very mild, but just enough to make me wonder, ""Is this real?  Am I dreaming?  What if I woke up right now and the last x years hadn't happened?""

The saddest part is when I realize that if I did wake up, I would feel relieved.  And I think about the scene from Inception where Mal believes she is still in a dream and the only way to wake up is to kill herself.  And I think about the scene at the end of Le Petit Prince where the Prince allows the snake to bite him so that he can ""go home,"" leaving his body behind.  But I tell myself I can't kill myself yet, because it would be like walking out of a theater a half-hour into a film.  Even if it's a sucky film, there's still a part of me curious about how it will play out.  And even if the plot is dreadfully boring, I can try to appreciate the psychological drama of it contrasted with the absurdity of our simple little routine lives.

She and her annoying little shit of a yappy dog hook up with a couple of dumbass rednecks and their pet lion. They all get high on opiates and murder a rich old lady with a tragic skin condition in exchange for some flashy shoes, a medal, a watch, a counterfeit diploma and a ride out of town. She and her friends sing incessantly.

**The Big Lebowski** from Donny's POV is a stark tale of alienation and heartbreaking loneliness: A pale little simpleton is constantly bullied by everyone he encounters at the bowling alley he hangs around in like a ghost. All attempts at achieving a sense of connection with others are mercilessly shot down. He develops a pathetic sort of attachment to an inseparable pair of drunks who only seem to have a semi-sport and borderline psychotic disorder in common. Even though it is clear that they find him loathesome and only just barely tolerate him for the sake of rounding out a bowling team nobody in his right mind would dare to join, he still ends up giving his life in a foolish attempt to save them from being mugged in a parking lot.

**Gone With the Wind** is the dramatic tale of a woman with an indomitable spirit who, although born a slave, manages to utterly shackle several generations of a wealthy, inbred white family into carrying out all her whims, thus ensuring herself the highest standards of living to which anyone of her ancestry can aspire. With an instinctual understanding of how making white people wholly dependent upon her places her in a position of mastery over them, Mammy consolidates her authoritarian rule over the O'Hara clan by keeping its male members in a permanently pliable state with a steady diet of hard liquor. Additionally, she keeps whitey in line by applying a strict regimen of discipline, verbal abuse, the setting of social ""norms"" via carefully constructed phrases beginning with the words ""It just ain't *natural* to..."", as well as implementing devices of control such as force-feeding and the judicious use of highly constraining corsets.

3820 is the cheapest x79 CPU.

Now to explain this build. The (more expensive red Phanteks) was simply because it matches the mobo and RAM. 

the biostar Tpower is an awesome overclocking mobo and is very nice for its price. 

16 GB of RAM. overkill but at this budget most stuff is overkill.

2TB barracuda for storage. 256GB samsung 830 (faster than 840) for OS and most played games. 

The GPUs are placeholders as they/most nicely priced 7970ies are out of stock. they are actually really good and at an awesome price. to recommend some other, non reference cooled cards: sapphire, MSI, gigabyte, HIS, ASUS. XFX are usually good to but they've had problems with their coolers on the 7970ies.

True,CraftD,twist,Twist,"The story being told there is actually a little different. At the time Winter Wrap Up hadn't been aired and Faust said there was a character named Ditzy Doo who was clumsy who they might use the design for, but that didn't end up happening. There was a fanon disjunction over which name was to be used, but eventually Derpy won out. Ditzy Doo never ended up being attached to any character design. So she's a canon character, but doesn't have a canon design. The explanation a lot of people have gone with is that it's Derpy's actual name and Derpy is a nickname.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;


&gt;you should be able to accept ALL fanon names rather than just denounce one. 

[](/rdwut) Trust me. That's not how the fandom works.

[](/sp)

I'm not sure if you were around for the previous two seasons live, but character's don't get agreed upon fan names. Every character has a *ton* of different names, and different people accept different ones for each character.

And some people think canon names override all fanon, others think interesting fanon names are more important.

&amp;nbsp;

For example: [This pony](http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110813223822/mlp/images/thumb/5/53/Golden_Harvestid.png/250px-Golden_Harvestid.png)

What's her name?

For the first season it would have been ""Carrot Top"". A funny spin on a famous comedian and an almost universally accepted fanon name. Nowadays? It's Golden Harvest and Carrot Top isn't acknowledged as much because Golden Harvest is canon.

[Or this pony](http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120507041961/mlp/images/b/b6/Minuette_id.png)

The fanon argued over her name for *months*. Colgate, Romana, Toothpaste, Colgate T. Romana, Mintyfresh.

And now she's Minuette and nothing else to a lot of people, though the fanon name is still argued over.

[This one?](http://mlp.wikia.com/wiki/Trixie)

Well, not much fanon there, the name trixie was canon after all. But when a blindbag came out calling her ""Lulamoon"" instead people were confused what to do. Eventually it became her last name though, and people are still debating whether that's fanon or canon.


Or gods forbid- [This one](http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20111214223829/mlp/images/c/c4/Fleur-di-lis.png)

We had people biting and scratching and kicking each other for *weeks* because some people thought ""Sluthooves"" was a funny name for her. Others thought Trophy Wife, others wanted Fleur de Lise, others Fleur Delise.

[This one?](http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120514003615/mlp/images/0/04/Berry_Pinch_ID.png)

Most people think Ruby Pinch. But the wikipedia says Berry Pinch, and some others say Ruby and Berry Punch.

And her sometimes mom? She was ""OPPP"" for a good three months before the name ""Berry Punch"" ever caught on.

&amp;nbsp;

There's no such thing as accepting all fanon names for characters. And that's actually really normal. Every time a new character comes up there's something of a mini-war between the entire fandom. A creative war, where the group that uses their name in the most cool stuff eventually convinces everyone that name should stick.

And then when Hasbro releases canon material those fanon names get completely overridden.

If you want to talk about ""Same as everything else"", Doctor Whooves is actually the exception, not the rule. Most ponies get their names completely changed in the fandom when that happens. So there's obviously bound to be people saying ""Doctor Whooves is just a fanon name, he's actually canonically named Time Turner"". It's true, of course, it's just not something people are as willing to accept as normal.

True,jveezy,fortyniners,49ers,"The reason why 49ers fans have pretty much flipped their stance on Alex Smith is because he is pretty much an all-around good guy. Yes, he wasn't a very good player for a long time, but he also took a substantial paycut for the final two years of his monster rookie contract to stay with the team rather than get a fresh start somewhere in a more stable organization to try to prove himself here.

He's stuck around for a long time with a fanbase that hated him and then finally embraced him when he improved to become a good player. He hasn't been a cancer off the field or in the locker room and he has always had the support of his teammates. He's even been very good friends with the other QBs he's competed with for the starting job (Shaun Hill was one of the groomsmen at his wedding). He led the offseason workouts during the lockout last year when he didn't even have a contract with the team. It's easy to downplay how much a starting QB tutors a young backup, but keep in mind that Colin Kaepernick's first exposure to the 49ers offense was through Camp Alex. This isn't answering questions or giving a helpful tip here and there. This is literally training the rookie you know is eventually going to replace you and accelerating that replacement process by leading the camp during his first (and lockout-shortened) offseason.

He's done his best for a fanbase that demanded he be replaced with David Carr, for an organization that subjected him to so many different offensive systems and coordinators for most of his career, and for head coaches that believed in him when it was convenient for them and threw him under the bus when their job was on the line. And through it all he's actually turned himself into a smart, veteran player who won't lose the game for the team and occasionally wins one when he's asked to. It's a story of perseverance that isn't easy for anyone to experience no matter how much they get paid to do so.

So yes, a lot of us feel bad for Alex Smith. He's been playing the best football of his career and has been a reliable player and leader on this team, even without the flashy numbers. Ultimately he lost his job while scrambling out of the pocket to make something out of a broken play. After how far he's come and all the shit he's been through (some deserved, some not), it's just sad if it has to end this way for him.",0,1353895082,,0,False,1,c76qzlo,t3_13s0yg,t1_c76qzlo,t3_13s0yg,,1430499699,447,False,nfl,t5_2qmg3,447
True,WeAreAllEqual,,,"Yo. Instead of jerking it off before bed, just do a core workout. Do as many sit-ups as you can followed by as many push-ups as you can. Next, do 30 bicycle kicks vertically into the air (a full rotation for both legs counts as one kick). Next, plank for 2 minutes, flat back, head down, counting to 120 in your head. Do not forget to breathe, ever. Then hold your legs straight out in front of you in the air for 10 seconds at 2 feet above the ground, then 15 seconds at 1 foot, then a full minute at 6 inches.  Over time, increase the duration and quantity of all exercises.

Trust me, I haven't jerked off for months, I have an amazing body at this point (started off kinda fat), and ""fun-time"" with my girl is amazing. DO IT. Huge confidence boost. Maybe do it before you shower in the evening. Trust me.

Edited addition:
I've been just doing this for quite some time. Just remember, don't get discouraged. This is especially good because it's free, you can do it nude if it makes you comfortable (so long as you're in your own house), and it can be done at home, which means no drives to the gym. This also means you don't need to worry ""Holy shit will that smokin' chick on the treadmill think I'm a pussy"" because you'll be by yourself, you can but on whatever music or video or politics you like, set your atmosphere to be your favorite, hog all the fans, and just do it for yourself.

Edit2: Thanks to ""lobo_en_mis_botas"" for the input. Don't forget to do back exercises. For instance, do the ""superman:""  Also, you may want to occasionally mix up the exercises (as you also increase reps/time) to not have your body get too used to the order. I personally would still recommend alternating upper and lower abs exercises (as a personal preference).

1. To begin, lie straight and face down on the floor or exercise mat. Your arms should be fully extended in front of you. This is the starting position.

2. Simultaneously raise your arms, legs, and chest off of the floor and hold this contraction for 2 seconds. Tip: Squeeze your lower back to get the best results from this exercise. Remember to exhale during this movement. Note: When holding the contracted position, you should look like superman when he is flying.

3. Slowly begin to lower your arms, legs and chest back down to the starting position while inhaling.

4. Repeat several times.

Edit3: Thank you ""anonimyus"" for this input: Still, make sure you get enough sleep. Aim for 7 hours minimum if you can. You'll be happier when you get enough sleep.

Edit5: Something that really helps is to eat well (this is obvious but should be pointed out).  For anything to work, don't eat big-macs or other really fatty foods and the like. Eat vegetables more too. And cut back (HEY REDDIT) on some Papa John's pizza and eat more fruit. Eating well definitely helps one's self-image and one's body image.  To reveal abdominal muscles, one must eat well. If you have a solid core but a big layer of fat, nobody will know about that core at the pool.

True,danharmon,,,"Evil Abed, like Schroedinger's cat, or the Snuffaluffagus of my childhood (I think they later profaned this), either exists or doesn't, and, in my mind, both conditions can exist simultaneously, because, assuming there is no ""real"" way to connect two timelines, the only way for one to be conscious of another is via imagination, as in, I think therefore I am, but also, I think there's a version of me that went jogging this morning instead of masturbating, and either he ""is"" or ""isn't"" but it really doesn't matter, except to the extent that I can ""connect"" with ""him,"" and eventually, like...become him.  By letting him haunt me.

That would be an example of a ""good"" dan making real dan a better dan...evil abed was in danger of making real abed a worse abed...which would either have been Abed having a plain old psychotic break ...OR, a sci-fi thing happening..and...in the end...what's the difference.

True,iruleatants,,,"You do understand that this is the biggest play of power by the US Government in copyright infringement, and it needs to be addressed quickly and efficiently. This is essentially on part of SOPA, without the need to pass SOPA. The fact that people don't support this case, is a huge issue, because you have to see what the government did, EVEN if he did break the law.


Take for example, the past cases of copy right infringement. Remember when Google was sued for a billion dollars? That is how Copyright cases have always been handled. You don't call in the police and have them do your dirty work, you take it to the court system and handle it there.

They ignore this policy for megaupload. After failing in the past to stop them, they decided that it was time to corrupt our government, and use them to end this company. Despite megaupload serving over a hundred thousand takedown requests a day, the FBI decided that it was worth taxpayer money to raid them and shut them down.

With a single court order, served by a judge who does not grasp technology, they shut down a website with over a billion files on it. Yeah, thats a lot of data to just take.

But, lets move on to things even scarier then that. When asked to reveal documents regarding the investigation, and provide more evidence, they claimed they couldn't. For NATIONAL SECURITY. Yup. That is where we are now. Copyright infringement is a threat to our national security, and we must defend ourselves against that. Tomorrow, posting a negative comment against the MPAA is going to be illegal. Perhaps I will be arrested in a year for posting this comment.

But, we should continue discussing how scary this act is. Not only did they eliminate over a billion files, they then performed a full raid on a foreign country, to extradite a person who did not directly harm the US Government, and did not pose a threat to our national security. Again, anti terrorist units were used in this case.

We move on. They attempted to perform the ultimate act of punishment on anyone arrested, something that is terrifying. They froze all of his assests and funds, preventing him from paying a lawyer. Innocent until proven guilty, and as such, he should have the funds available to prevent they. Luckily, the court system isn't completely retarded, and has started giving him money.

Imagine a day when you are convicted of a crime, and put in jail, and then told to defend yourself but you can't access you money to do so. Imagine if you even had the lawyer on escrow, ready for this case, but he wouldn't be allowed to be paid? At what point is that even fair?


So here we have it. The FBI, has in a single move. Extended their right to punish copyright infringement, before proven guilty (As the court system should). Denied access to evidence because of national security concerns, frozen funds intended to pay for lawyers, and delayed lawsuits.


Now lets move on to what should scare everyone who doesn't host a website. The people that uploaded legitimate things to megaupload.

I personally hosted over 20 files on Megaupload, programs that I created, and with out a doubt did not break copyright laws (Maybe patents, given that there is a patent on displaying text. a patent on accepting user input, and a patent on network communications, but that's a different case entirely). Those files are gone, without me having any say over it. Its been over a year, and over a hundred lawsuits, and still no data is allowed. Again, they tried National Security, and they tried calling copyright infringement on the files because they might have music files on it, just to prevent the data from being returned.

Luckily for me, I am not an idiot, and I knew that cloud storage was never an answer. I kept backups of my programs, but I had to spent 5 hours to replace those links. The government (And the MPAA through the government) took that data from me, and are refusing to give it back. I did not break any laws. I did not do anything at all, except upload the files to a service.

I have a contract with that business, and the government has broken that contract, confiscated my files, and told me to fuck off because I'm criminal scum for using that service. So why exactly should you be scared? Imagine a world where the government seizes your files, because someone you talked to committed copyright fraud, and refused to return them to you. Imagine that you create a program/video/novel and have it hosted online, and the government comes in and takes that file on copyright grounds, and then refused to give it back, or verify that it is infringing. When you file a lawsuit, they simply say, ""Well. Its possible that he used 30 seconds of a song in one of the videos, but we can't let the court determine that because then it would damage nation security""

Let's throw in that this Redditor is a software project manager professionally and has been slowly hobbying along for two years on a game that is meant to succeed Duneon Keeper.

Let's also say that this Redditor had broken Dungeon Keeper down to its root mechanics, play tested the gameplay with outside testers, revised and iterrated the mechanics and is currently in the midst of completing in depth design documents.

Let's say that this Redditor also has tons of concept art complete and is almost ready to transition from design into production. Let's say that this Redditor is also on the verge of hiring an experienced asset artist to produce a gameplay video similar to [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/isometric/comments/uny19/here_is_a_video_of_my_isometric_drawing_process/) for this game.

What would Reddit think about that?

**EDIT**

Due to the upvotes/comments I'm going to add this bit. It's two points from the Preliminary Scope/Concept document. Because the trademark is still pending, I've removed the title of the game and replaced it with ""GAME"":

**Summary Statement**

GAME is a medieval, fantasy, god game where the player is the bad guy.
 
This game is a refreshing title for a player tired of rescuing princesses, saving worlds and playing the part of the good guy who journeys into monster’s lair to save the day.

In this god game, with Role Playing Game (RPG) elements and Real Time Strategy (RTS) undertones, the player assumes the role of the evil, vile, villain – the GAME. With their henchmen and minions, the GAME executes evil plans, vile deeds and serves as the villain of the player’s story. Within the GAME’s dungeon – a ruined castle, an overgrown graveyard, a drowned temple or a series of caverns – the GAME’s henchmen, minions, monsters, traps and puzzles await to stop heroes from invading their lairs and stealing their ill begotten treasure.

At its core, GAME is a game where instead of being a good guy, the players get the chance to be the bad guy.

**Philosophical Design Points**

GAME is a dynanmic game.

With randomized worlds, a new story and the ability to build a new style and design of dungeon each playthrough, GAME will have the dynamic repeatability that attracts players to this genre and makes games like this fun to play. With each playthough, players will have additional information about the game and will modify their strategies for their next game on past experiences.

GAME is a god game.

With artificial life elements for the player’s henchmen, minions and monsters, this game casts the player in the position of controlling the non-player characters on a large scale. In GAME, the player’s character is not an entity with divine/supernatural powers, rather a great but evil leader. This places the player at the head of an evil conglomerate of henchmen, minions and monsters, all autonomous non-player characters to task and influence.

GAME tells the story of a dungeon.

Why are dungeons filled with monsters and treasure? Why are there so many rooms and different levels to a dungeon? Why don’t the monsters kill each other? Who keeps the torches on the walls burning? GAME will explain the dungeon narrative to players, providing lore and an explanation to the other side of the story of the classic fantasy dungeon.

It doesn't work that way. I still struggled with the depression, still couldn't find a job, nothing changed but the weather.

I missed a lot of college and was forced to drop out.

So, once again, on the dole, depressed, no prospects and no hope. My only saving grace is that I found a (very) part-time job in the summer.

I'm on the dole part-time, and I work for about 12 hours a week. I hate my job, hate it so much, but I hate being at home constantly even more. The worst part, for me, is that I can't leave this horrible job because the dole office will punish me by taking away my money for 9 weeks, but having this part-time job stops me from finding one I like.

TL;DR Been on the dole for about 2.5 years, it's fucking awful.",0,1353944826,,0,False,1,c76zow2,t3_13t01m,t1_c76zow2,t3_13t01m,,1430503975,29,False,ireland,t5_2qhb9,29

True,iheartgiraffe,,27/F/Not actually a giraffe,"You posted here before, right? Waited something like four months to tell her?

Look, you need to stop dating. You're not ready. Here's why it hurts so badly: You only had a few months with her. You didn't have enough time to learn her annoying little quirks. You didn't have years for the relationship to grow and mature and then stagnate and end. That's why it's different than with your wife. It's not at all that this girl was better, it's that the situation allows you to build her up in your mind to be some ideal, where in reality she was just some girl.

*Again: She was just some girl.*

You're probably sitting here reading this all pissed off, like ""Who does this internet person think she is, telling me she was just some girl. She doesn't know, what we had was special."" Right? If not, you should be. But it's normal. I've been there. Most people have been there. It's fucking soul-destroying. So much potential down the drain, all the could-have-beens dead in the water.

But you need to heal. You need to **stop dating**. Stop. Yesterday. You're only going to reinforce the empty feeling in yourself and waste the girls' time.

You have to deal with this pain until it fades, and it will fucking hurt in the meantime. The way to get over this is by slowly getting back in touch with yourself. Hit the gym, delete from Facebook, seriously. Consider therapy if it's really bad. Reconnect with friends, pick up a new hobby. Cheesy as shit, but this is what you need right now. Over time, it will start to hurt less often, and then less badly, and then you'll be numb, and finally you'll feel normal again. This can take months, don't expect to get over her overnight. Recovering might take longer than the relationship lasted and that's okay.

And once you've done all that, and **only** once you've done all of that, you can start dating again. And you'll know two things: First, be cautious with your heart. Second, *no girl is perfect*. Every girl has foibles that can break the relationship, and your job is to find one whose foibles are manageable and work well with yours. This girl was never perfect, you just never got to find out why she's not.

True,fedabog,,,"He is what will probably happen if you start smoking...

First, you will try a cigarette. You will cough, your lungs will hurt, and you might have the feeling like you wanna puke. However, you will also get a feeling like all of your blood is rushing to your head. It will feel mildly euphoric, and you will have a little more clarity of thinking. I think of it as taking a very low dose of Percocet or other prescription pain killer, only enough to feel the effects but to not be a zombie. 

Next, that feeling will go away, and you will light up again. Might be after a few hours or it might be a month down the road. After you light, you realize that it doesn't hurt so much to inhale. It's actually quite pleasurable. And that nicotine rush....WOW!!!! Hit you like a ton of bricks. Now you feel amazing! You're thinking clearly, you feel great, life is on the up and up.

Fast forward a little bit. You now smoke 3 cigarettes a day. Smoking one still feels good, but it's a little harder to feel that high. You explain to yourself that you will only have 3 a day. You don't want to be full on addicted. Fact is, it's already too late. 

Before long, 3 cigarettes dont give you the high anymore, so you do 4. 4 becomes 5. You start smoking right after you get out of bed in the morning. Next thing you know, you're smoking a half pack a day. You smoke more when you are stressed. You start smoking after a drink at the bar, after a few rounds of video games, during your break at work, on your way home. You start to realize that now you don't get a nicotine high, but you smoke so you don't have cravings.

On top of all of this, you start going through body changes. You are more irritable if you haven't smoked for a while. Food/drinks don't taste as good. Your fingers smell. You smell. Your level of fitness drops (can't run as far, cant push as much, ect) and even moderate cardio makes you short of breath. You cough more. Your libido drops a bit. Your overall health drops, but you continue because you are addicted. 

Finally, you decide to quit. However, patches, gum, and lozenges are total shit. You may try the prescription medication route. It works, but you start having vivid dreams and difficulty discerning reality from the dream world (I did). You may even consider suicide because it feels as if you are going insane. You quit prescriptions and go back to the cancer stick. Btw, cold turkey and the lollypop methods don't work. 

Smoking may seem harmless at first. But honestly, its a very slippery slope. I have been smoking for almost 5 years now. Yeah, I admit that sometimes I love it, and that it helps reduce stress (or my mind had reasoned that it does). But I also hate it. I currently have an e-cig on order so I can try to quit, because smoking a pack a day is hard on the body and extremely hard on the wallet. 


**TL;DR** Smoking is bad, mmkay?

EDIT: Apparently, I can still edit my post once it's archived. I want to make the point that I wrote this 11 months ago, and that my views have changed somewhat. Note that this was based on personal observation and the observations of those around me.

I do think that methods to quit can help. Patches, gum, and lozenges can help... However, they really are not that effective. I took Chantix to quit, which caused suicidal ideations and vivid dreams (both are side effects). It may work for some, but it's very slippery and I've yet to hear a single success story. 

Finally, there have a ton of replies on the /r/bestof that they quit cold turkey. Congratulations! Seriously, good job. Again, I mentioned cold turkey as innefective from personal expereince and oberservation. It takes a ton of willpower to quit cold turkey, and a ton of willpower to continue to keep off the habit. Like many have said, it only takes one to get you back on the habit again. 

Finally, I want to express my thanks for getting this on /r/bestof.

They even have [a course](http://www.udacity.com/overview/Course/cs253/CourseRev/apr2012) taught by Steve Huffman, a co-founder of Reddit. Their courses are self-paced by default, and personally I prefer their teaching method.

[edX](https://www.edx.org/) started as MITx, but soon Harvard joined and by now Berkeley and U of Texas system joined too. I haven't taken one of their courses myself, but they seem to be more difficult than the others I mentioned.

True,mcdronkz,,,"For sure, I have no secrets! It's a pretty involved process though so I can't cover it in great detail, but feel free to ask for specifics.

It starts with planning. First I figured out what the shot had to look like. I created the concept, composition, color scheme and more. Also did some visualisation in Sketchup which really helped establishing the right angles and served as a great reference later on. Now that I know what I wanted, the preparation for the shoot began. Figured out what gear and other tools and materials were need, then found a fitting location.

While the quality of the work has to be absolutely professional, I have no budget. Just parked the car alongside a quiet road and started shooting with my dad as an assistant. First we shot a few simple bracketed exposures of the static car. No additional lighting, just a beautiful harsh sun pointing towards the camera. Then it was time for the fun part: fire. Using some deodorant and a safety lighter, we shot a lot of frames of fire at the right angle. Worked perfectly, but during the post processing I found out I couldn't use them, more on that later. Since I don't have a physical rig, the motion blur had to be added in post. To make things easier for later on we used a hydraulic jack to get the wheels up in the air and shot them while spinning with a relatively slow shutter speed. Then we shot a so-called 'clean plate' of the background, without the car. We ended up with 80 pictures in total. That's it for the shooting part, for now at least.

Then the work in Photoshop began. I sorted out the pictures I needed, and started building the photograph with the clean plate as the base image. Remember, only the background needs to be motion blurred, the car and the shadow remain 'static'. So I masked out the car from another shot and put that on top of the base layer. Then I manually painted the shadow(s) using the original image as a reference, and yes, that's pretty hard to get right. Then I added the wheels with movement, which proved to be a challenge because of the swing axle construction of the Beetle which radically changes the camber of the wheel once jacked up.

Then I tried to add the flames, but since there was a slight mismatch in the position and the flames were shot midday, there was no way they would end up looking right. So I set up the car in a similar position at home later that night, shooting them in the darkness. Now I had flames with a black background which could easily be added to the shot using Screen blending mode.

There were a *lot* of nasty reflections (mostly from trees) on the car which needed to be killed, so I started manually painting the rear fender and the roof line with some success (these gradients are hard to get right, believe me) but then decided that there was an easier way. Went to a 'clean' location without stuff such as trees and shot the car at 95% the same angle using 95% similar lighting. Ended up with shots of the car without annoying reflections. Then I cut out the good body panels of the 'clean' car, and pasted and warped them onto the 'messy' car. It's much more work than it sounds like, since all the colors and exposures need to be matched. You can't afford any mistakes here since everyone will notice it.

Then I worked on the backplate. The road and curve was nice, but the background was boring. So, I rendered an interesting landscape in Terragen 2 using digital elevation maps of Beartooth Mountains if I'm not misstaken. Matched the horizon, perspective and lighting and things went pretty smooth. Then I combined it with the road I shot the car on and added the motion blur in Virtual Rig Studio. 

Then I did some color grading, dodge &amp; burn and other standard things to get the look down. Then some high pass sharpening, and the shot was done. Oh, and the 'Hollywood' watermark of course, which also has some motion blur to be fully integrated. ;-)

Would love to show you the before/after slider I made, but that takes away too much of the magic I think. Makes the result much more impressive though. :P

*

Life towers far above me,  
A trident in his hand;  
I sweep my eyes to left and right,  
Survey this sunken land.  

*The shadows cling to everything,*  
*The light clasped in a clot;*  
*And all that I hold beautiful,*  
*Is wrought and caught in rot.*  

It wasn’t always like this though –  
I still remember times,  
When Life had forged a place for me,  
Amidst its tender rhymes.  

*But now the night has fallen fast;*  
*And all my dice are cast;*  
*I stand before its mighty gaze,*  
*And know I cannot last.*  

Its trident slowly lowers down;  
It points below to me;  
In ancient tones, eternal voice,  
It speaks: ‘Now bend your knee’.  

*And in Its breath, I feel the weight,*  
*Of all that I can see;*  
*Crescendos of existence,*  
*Slowly bearing down on me.*  

I cannot take it anymore;  
I stand, to no avail;  
It seems as though, at last, I've stepped,  
Beyond the nether-veil.  

*But no.*  
*I am not done here yet.*  
*I raise my head, and blaze.*  
*Life retreats away from me;*  
*It trembles at my gaze.*  

And all the mystics of Its world,  
The centaur, griffin, elf,  
They gather round for my reply;  
I say... ‘go fuck yourself.’  

*His weapon breaks; it falls to Earth;*  
*The shadows slip away;*  
*The sun climbs high and frees the light,*  
*To shine on the new day.*  

*

Life may try to break me;  
To bend at its command;  
But I am made to live and last,  
And to the night, withstand.  

*

I hope the will to keep going lasts and lasts. All the best.",0,1353967985,,0,1354036471,1,c776gcs,t3_13tw87,t1_c776gcs,t1_c774s1f,,1430507292,696,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,696

True,Knight_of_Malta,,,"In the Western world, men are oppressed equally, if not greater, compared to women. You may find that hard to believe, but the facts below speak for themselves.

1\. Women are treated better in all aspects of the legal system. For instance, [women receive lighter sentences and a higher chance of acquittal, simply for being women](http://www.terry.uga.edu/~mustard/sentencing.pdf). 

2\. [Men are significantly more likely to be the victims of violent crime (of which rape is included) than women](http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/glance/tables/vsxtab.cfm).

3\. [Despite domestic violence being equally committed by women](http://www.csulb.edu/~mfiebert/assault.htm), for the most part only male perpetrators are arrested: 

4\. [The feminist definition of domestic violence has skewed arrest and prosecution philosophies, resulting in having mostly male batterers criminally pursued, and female batterers left alone.](http://www.law.fsu.edu/journals/lawreview/downloads/304/kelly.pdf)

5\. It is legal to circumcise male babies against their will. In some places, laws have been passed which forbid any attempts to make male circumcision illegal. Meanwhile, female circumcision is completely illegal, even though some types of female circumcision are equivalent in harm to male circumcision, and other types (a symbolic prick to draw blood) are non-harmful.

6\. Men comprise 95% of workplace deaths.

7\. Men commit suicide at over triple the rate that women do.

8\. The vast majority of prisoners are men.

9\. [Men are doing worse in all aspects of the educational system, from kindergarten to university](http://www.boysproject.net/statistics.html).

10\. [Men who are falsely accused of rape can have their names published and their lives ruined even if they are not convicted or charged - their accuser is protected and is likely to face no punishment, or a light one.](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-04-01/duke-lacrosse-players-suit-over-false-rape-claim-may-proceed-judge-says.html)

11\. Reproductive rights. Men have none. Simply [read this story](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/7x78v/what_do_modern_men_want_in_women/c07omtc).

12\. Parental rights. Men have virtually none. See below.

* [A woman can name any man she likes as the father, he gets a letter in the mail, if he does not prove he isn't the father within 30 days—(suppose the letter gets lost by the USPS?)—he is now the father and must pay. He cannot contest it.](http://reason.com/archives/2004/02/01/injustice-by-default)

* [A boy who is the victim of statutory rape must pay child support to his rapist.](http://www.avoiceformen.com/mens-rights/legally-obscene/)

* A man who is raped while unconscious must likewise pay child support.

* [A man who fathers a child and wishes to take custody may have his child adopted out against his will and essentially kidnapped](http://www.fathersandfamilies.org/?p=19159)

13\. The majority of homeless are men. 

14\. Despite men's need being arguably greater than women, government spending to help women is 10 to 100 times greater than that to help men. That figure is unrelated to medical spending. 

15\. [In 2009/2010 it was $1,516,460 toward men and $57,562,373 toward women. In 2010/2011 it was $3,740,800 toward men and $48,331,443 toward women. In 2008/2009 the province dedicated $561,360 toward men's resources and $98,983,236 toward women's resources](http://www.reddit.com/r/OneY/comments/i2i06/crosspost_from_requality_i_just_did_a_little/c20d8q8). (figures are for British Columbia, Canada, but representative of Western society).

16\. [Female-owned businesses get free government money for literally no reason other than being a woman (i.e. all other factors are equal, same size of business, same income, etc. etc. but the owner's gender is different = money or no money](http://reason.com/archives/2004/07/01/confessions-of-a-woman-owned-b).

17\. [On some airlines, men were banned from sitting next to kids on airplanes, simply because they were men](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/travelnews/7957982/British-Airways-changes-discriminatory-seating-policy-for-men.html). Why? Because men are pedophiles, obviously. This ban remains on some airlines, such as Air New Zealand.

18\. [Under a recent federal directive, men are convicted of rape in university campuses if the investigating board finds that the chances they committed the rape are at 50.00001% or greater.](http://falserapearchives.blogspot.ca/2011/09/writings-demonstrating-error-and.html) 

19\. [The DOE policy in practice: Caleb Warner was accused of rape and expelled from the University of North Dakota, then his accuser was charged with filing a false report. He remains expelled as of June 2011](http://www.wdaz.com/event/article/id/6963/).

20\. Selective service. Enough said.

Pretty sure there's more, but I'm getting tired.

You will notice that I have not even touched ""social discrimination"" such as [a group of women, on a popular talk show, cheering and laughing about a woman who cut off and destroyed a man's penis simply because he was divorcing her](http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/is0af/send_complaint_to_cbs_against_the_talk_hosts_for/). Or gender stereotypes forcing men to work to their deaths, treating men as predators and pedophiles, that sort of thing.

That is because I recognize that though social discrimination is bad, ultimately you still have choice and agency. People can mock you for being a male who likes sewing, but ultimately you can still choose to do it or not. But that pales in comparison to actual oppression, where you genuinely have no choice about the matter.

Note the numerous examples of governmental and legal discrimination against men.

**These are examples of real discrimination, where there is literally nothing you can do about it. Not ""discrimination"" where women do more housework.**

Most of the discrimination against men described here government-enforced discrimination, which is involuntary, non-consensual, and inescapable.

For instance, if you are a male victim of domestic violence, you cannot simply choose to walk into a government funded men's shelter - they don't exist. You cannot choose to call the pro-male police who fairly punish female batterers; there is only one police, and they are likely to arrest you if you do make the call.

In contrast, a lot of discrimination that feminists discuss is what I call societal discrimination, which is voluntary, consensual, and less significant.

Feminists state, as evidence of discrimination, that women do more unpaid housework due to societal norms. Even if that is true, given that surveys are biased and do not include male work like car repair, exterior house repair, etc. that is not discrimination since women are choosing to do more housework. They are choosing to be involved with men who do less housework, and choosing to tolerate such a state. They make that choice freely, without coercion. That is why it is not discrimination.

True,[deleted],,,"So I was standing in a rather large line at my local Wal-Mart today behind a couple families that I know from when I went to church with my family in year younger. It was the only register open so there wasn't much of another option to get my 12 pack of Mountain Dew for a party I was heading to. I was wondering why the line was going nowhere when I decided to poke my head up front to see what the holdup was. It was a little old lady who didn't have enough for her groceries and she was trying to talk the cashier into letting her get away with being short. This struck me as odd until I found out she was a mere $0.21 short of her purchase. Now all these families were just staring and there was even two making fun of her. I walked up and handed my soda to the cashier, handed him a $5 and told her to keep the change. One of the middle aged women (I knew these people, so I also knew that they all make over 6 digits) grabbed her kid and yelled very loudly, ""See that man? He's acting just like Jesus wants us to."" For some reason this set me off, so I turned around. I haven't shaved in awhile so I'm rocking some nice scruff, a Slayer shirt, and gym shorts, so it must have been a nice sight.

True,mishagale,,,"I'm not an American, but I'd like to offer a European perspective, and maybe explain why our reaction to the Pledge ranges from mild discomfort through disgust to outright horror.

It comes down to the distinction between patriotism and nationalism. It's not news that there is a fine line between these two ideologies, but what seems like patriotism to an American can seem like Nationalism to many Europeans.

The thing is, the rise of fascism and the Second World War are still a huge part of the national psyche for most European nations, not to mention the Soviet era. Of course, America suffered in the war too, and I don't want to downplay that. But America didn't have foreign troops occupying its mainland, didn't have bombs dropping  on its cities, didn't have its political institutions subverted into dictatorship. Americans saw the concentration camps as the 3rd Reich fell, but didn't see their neighbours being dragged into the street, or feel the broken glass crunch under their feet.

Even though only the older generation has first-hand recollection of these things, we are all powerfully aware of them. Most of Europe has an ingrained horror of anything resembling fascism or nationalism. There is an unspoken fear that what happened before could somehow happen again.

So it is really nothing to do with the words of the Pledge of Allegiance, it's the very idea of having such a thing. Standing at attention, reciting a loyalty oath just has unpleasant symbolism for us. It looks like the kind of thing the Nazis, the Blackshirts and the Stalinists did, and which people were persecuted for not doing.

It's not that we have a problem with patriotism, its just that we generally don't feel comfortable with it being either overt or mandatory; we see it the same way we see religion, as a private matter, not something to display in public, except on special occasions.

**NOTE: I am aware that neither Europe or America are homogeneous monoliths - I have made some broad generalisations for the sake of simplicity.**

From a sociology dictionary:

&gt;&gt;The attributing of characteristics of inferiority to a particular racial category. Racism is a specific form of prejudice focused on race. 

http://sociology.socialsciencedictionary.com/Sociology-Dictionary-R-1/racism


Here's another one:

&gt;&gt;Racism is the perception and treatment of a racial or ethnic group, or a member of that group, as intellectually, socially, and culturally inferior to one’s own group. It is more than an attitude; it is institutionalized in society. Racism involves negative attitudes that are sometimes linked with negative behavior. 

http://sociology.about.com/od/R_Index/g/Racism.htm

And another one:

&gt;&gt;The belief that one race is supreme and all others are innately inferior.

http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/0072435569/student_view0/glossary.html


The source of the fringe definition that you claim predominates ""most sociological discussions on the matter:""

&gt;&gt;As near as I can tell, the formulation ""Racism = Prejudice + Power"" originated in a book by Pat Bidol in 1970. Titled ""Developing New Perspectives on Race,"" in it Bidol explicitly makes the formulation as stated and then uses this definition as the basis for an argument that in the United States Blacks cannot be racist against whites, they can only be racially prejudiced against them. This makes an important connection that matters as far as this particular nonsense is concerned, which is that **this stipulated definition exists as an excuse to defend members of racial minorities against accusations of racism and it has always existed for this reason**. The definition was largely popularized by Judy Katz, who referenced Bidol explicitly, in her 1978 book ""White Awareness"" which presented a course of counter-racist training for organizations. The book was highly influential and through it the formulation, for those who were searching for such a tool with which to deflect accusations of racism, gained popularity.

http://www.wetasphalt.com/content/why-racism-prejudice-power-wrong-way-approach-problems-racism


What you've done is picked a very narrow definition from a social movement from *within* sociology and applied it for the very same reason that it was invented in the first place: to create a semantic (and therefore meaningless) argument in order to defend your own bigotry while simultaneously decrying bigotry directed at others (perhaps yourself). There is no consensus whatsoever in the field of sociology that racism has any qualifier with regard to which races the term can apply to. Nor are there any non-racial qualifiers such as privilege or power because they are irrelevant with regards to racial discrimination and are relegated to the other types of discrimination, as they should be. Many *many* reject your definition outright because it's actually racist according to the standard definition. Now, if you want to *qualify* racism, you can do that all day long. Racial discrimination is what it is, but if power and privilege are important to you, they should be discussed parallel to each other, not one arbitrarily negating the other. Further, the new definition has no argument backing it. It's simply an assertion which is either accepted or rejected without reason. However, there are plenty of good arguments which preserves the original definition to the exclusion of incorporating power as a necessary qualifier for racism. 

Keep in mind that the argument is semantic. You'd have to redefine several other words as well to try and make any kind of ideological separation. For example, even if there was a consensus that accepted that somehow that the word ""racism"" can't apply to instances of racial discrimination against white people in the United States, it still doesn't make it not racial discrimination and it still doesn't make it not wrong. It only means that we don't accept the word ""racism"" as applied to what used to be called racism with consideration of a majority population. It's an intellectually bankrupt argument and I wouldn't make it if you want anyone to take you seriously. It shows that you're willing to ""win"" using reasons other than ideological fortitude and as such can be perceived as an admission that you believe that your own point is fallacious if not outright incorrect. 

Edit: I think I know why you came to believe in such a definition. I would urge you to use your internet search skills to try and find information counter to an extreme ideology rather than accepting it at face value and then only searching out information that confirms it.

True,Kitchner,,,"Geuinely if you love shopping for the love of ""going shopping"" and doing all that stuff you're going to find it difficult to entice any man to go along with you.

The best advice I could give you is:

**1) Don't mess around.** If you're going shopping ""to buy something"" then just go straight into the store and look at that. Nothing frustrates me more then being told ""I only need to get X"" and then we look at half the shop.

Example:

You are shopping because you need a new dress, and your boyfriend is there.

**DO:** Go into the shop, go straight to the dress section and look at dresses ignoring everything else.

**DON'T**: Look at everything that catches your eye, no matter how cute you look in it (unless you REALLY intend on buying it). 

**2) Don't ask me for my opinion on your clothes.** Chances are if I'm going out with you I think you're attractive and I like your dress sense. The exception I will make is that if you're buying something that you currently don't really have in your wardrobe (e.g. formal ballgown, or an expensive dress) I'll make an exception. However if you do ask for advice, actually listen to it. I get really frustrated by ""do you like this?"" ""Yeah"" ""Hmm i dont"" and ""Which do you prefer?"" ""The yellow one"" ""I think I'll get the red one"".

Example:

You are struggling to buy a new dress to wear out this weekend up town.

**DO:** Pick the dress that you think looks best on you. 

**DON'T:** Ask me for my opinion.

**DO:** Ask me for help finding something if you don't usually wear this type of clothes

**DON'T:** Ask me for my ""opinion"" and then ignore it when I give it to you

**3) Do things that aren't shopping.** So you're on a ""shopping trip"", why does it all have to be shopping? Take a break and have a drink in a pub, go have some food, if it's a nice day go to the park etc. If it feels like I'm having a good time with you apart from the shopping I'll feel better about it all.


**DO:** Try to have fun, stop for alcoholic drinks, ice cream, food... whatever.

**DON'T:** Spend the entire day going to shops back to back.

**4) Men buy things too.** The one thing I used to hate my ex doing was ""OK we'll go to town to get your X"", we'd go to town get my X and then spend 2 hours shopping for her stuff. If I moaned I got ""Hey, we only came here for you!"". Don't be fooled into thinking getting our stuff first or last is going to help. Get all our stuff first and i'll be bored the rest of the trip, get it last and i'll be bored for the first bit. Go round the shops in a sensible order, but split them up a bit between his and hers.

**DO:** Go into ""men"" stores as much as ""women"" stores. Note: Men's clothing stores do not count as ""men"" stores unless they want clothes.

**DON'T:** Look bored when you're in whatever shop I go into. If you're bored in mine, why shouldn't i be bored in yours?

**5) Don't pick clothes out for me.** This may be a personal thing but I don't want you showing me stuff and telling me you think it would look great on me (unless I've asked for you to do that specifically because I'm sad and lack the style to dress myself properly). One of my mate's ex's did that to him and it's really demaning. I hate ti because I like to think I dress quite well anyway and if I WANTED a shirt I'd have said I needed to get one.

**DO:** Help me look for what --&gt; I &lt;-- want IF I ask you for help.

**DON'T:** Tell me something would look great on me if I haven't asked you to look for that thing. If I wanted to spend £40 on jeans I'd do so, I probably want to spend that onsomethnig else. 


I haven't add the ""buy me something"" or ""promise me sex"" options because while those work you're not making me enjoy shopping, you're making me stop moaning while you drag me around.

True,reddiculon,,,"I dislike how your title is designed to appeal to the mainstream gender stereotypes, but then in your post you back-peddle and admit that actually, you're just shopping-crazy and really love shopping and trying every new product before finally settling on something, and can't understand why other's wouldn't indulge you in your love for them (by proxy of consumerism).

So the real question is this: If you are crazy for the endless stream of carefully chosen alternative varieties of products some marketing department decided your demographic would find appealing to the extent that you would spend hours indulging in their limited selection of choices for you and your ilk, how do you also captivate someone in your indulgences who wants nothing to do with such nonsense?

To be fair, this question cuts across all segments off society.  It doesn't matter if it's women's fashion, videogames aimed at teenage boys, children's toys or cleaning products; any market segment is applicable.

The simple answer is - you don't.  You can try to force someone to enjoy something they vehemently dislike, however the best you can hope to achieve is to earn their grudging compliance to 'keep you happy', best achieved through explaining the reasons behind your emotional needs and appealing to their sense of empathy.  

At worst, you'll drive a wedge through the relationship if requiring your significant other to validate your preferences via mutual participation becomes a driving factor in your interactions with each other.

To this end, the various suggestions to 'leave him at the pub' or 'write a list and stick to it' all seam to angle towards the same points; be prepared to compromise in any relationship (no two people can ever be the same - obviously this works both ways), and be prepared to live and let live (where compromise is not possible, it's OK for couples to do their own thing apart from each other, yet still remain a couple).

I really can't put it any more succinctly than this.  It's not a gender thing, it's all about reaching a healthy balance in a relationship between the needs and expectations of the individuals involved.

True,Geotis,,,"Here's my personal account with a private school that had corporal punishment.

EDIT: This was in Southern Mississippi at the time. (Also, Spelling. Thanks rcinsf.)

When I was in 7th grade, I was in a private ""christian"" school. Spent the 3 years there. I was spanked many times due to ""problems"" they had with me, including ""demonic"" drawings I made during free time. (They were drawing from the video game, The Legend of Zelda.)

I was spanked for many issues that were non-issues but a biased problem they had or came up with. I was always spanked by the vice principal, normally a male, but witnessed by the offended teacher, normally female.

One day, I had enough. I was spanked for ""fighting"" with another student. (We were playing flag football, he got pissed and physically punched me. I did not respond and we were tattled on by two girls who witnessed and improperly reported the incident.) The vice principal paddled me (it was always three licks) and I turned around, severely angered by the injustice that happened and said, ""you will never strike me again."" The female teacher who I had issues with and was the witnessing party said something along the lines of, ""we'll spank you until you finally learn your place."" I said with all the bitterness I could muster, ""The FUCK you wont!"" The assistant principal, who was paddling me at the time swung me back onto the desk and said, ""you just bought yourself three more licks.""

Before he could swing, I grabbed the long scissors he had on his desk and swung at him, nicking his hand in the process. I swung erratically until he and the female teacher vacated the room and locked me in.

I knew I was in deep shit, so I decided to make the most of the situation, figuring I'd make a point as I went down. I took some autographed bat off his wall and destroyed his office, breaking everything in the room, the nicknacks on his desk, the windows, the phone, everything. I spent a good ten minutes in that room until the police arrived. I surrendered to them without any problem.

This led to the local media getting involved, which worked out to my benefit. The media investigated the school and reported on the issue of the opposite gender witnessing my punishment, the improper reasons for my punishment, and the fact that most of my teachers did not even have a college education.

I was expelled for the incident, but I already had my revenge. I caused a major embarrassment for the school, so much so that they had a high degree of students withdrawn from the school (which caused them to lose a lot of money in tuition funds) and also caused them to change their school name.

It was worth having to repeat the 7th grade. I enjoyed public school from then on.

* If you like beer, try some [Great Lakes Christmas Ale](http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/73/1576). While most of us around here are numb to it, it's legendary and certainly something to write home about. I recommend actually going [to the brewery](http://www.greatlakesbrewing.com/homepages/age_verification), they have delicious food and the beer on tab.
* Nearly across the street from the brewery is the [West Side Market](http://www.westsidemarket.org/), it's a public market that just celebrated its 100th birthday, ~~only open on Wednesday's and Saturday's~~  it's open on Mon/weds/Fri/Sat. If you want a taste of Cleveland, this is where you'll find it, its packed full of incredible local food. 
* If you love sports, there's a [Browns](http://www.clevelandbrowns.com/) home game on the 9th. If there's one thing you should know about Cleveland is that it's a Browns town. We love (American) football. You need to go tailgating (read: partying and drinking in parking lots) before the game. The atmosphere is electric and surely an experience that you'll never forget. You can easily buy tickets to the game from someone on the street for cheap. 
* You can get tickets to a [Cavaliers](http://www.nba.com/cavaliers/) home game, our NBA team. They play the Chicago Bulls on the 5th, that would be worth seeing. 
* If you're a foodie, our food scene is amazing. I've got [a blog](http://discoveringcleveland.com/) with some reviews that may help you find something you'll like. 
* If you like art, our museums are pretty outstanding and free. [Cleveland Museum of Art](http://www.clevelandart.org/) and [Museum of Contemporary Art](http://www.mocacleveland.org/).
* We're also the Rock n' Roll capital of the world. If you're into it, check out the [Rock and Roll Hall of Fame](http://rockhall.com/).

True,Walkercain,,,"Hello! Voice teacher here, specifically speaking voice. The methodology I teach was designed by Kristin Linklater and is found in her book, Freeing the Natural Voice. You can also look at the work of Cecily Berry &amp; Patsy Rodenberg. All three of these women teach voice for the actor and are great mentors in the industry, and their work is completely transferable to the real world. 
I can completely understand your reaction to that video, and your desire to emulate that kind of sound! A bit of (super condensed &amp; simplified) voice theory that might help you (wall o' text warning!):
The Linklater technique teaches that the sound of the voice resonates in &amp; is amplified by the hollow space in the centre of your bones. Ideally, you want to use your whole body to resonate your voice. That video is a great example of a resonant voice; you feel it as much as you hear it. Like me, it sounds like your sinuses and the bones in your face have a tendency to do the brunt of the resonance - you can google some Netter anatomy images of the skull to see what bones &amp; hollow sinuses I mean. This tends to result in a more 'nasal' sound. This is totally changeable!
What I would suggest first is to check in with how you are breathing. Ideally, your stomach/belly is soft &amp; relaxed, which allows your lungs &amp; diaphragm to displace your lower internal organs as you breathe in. Your ribs may or may not move, the majority of the movement of your breath is seen in the abdominal region &amp; low back (your lungs are actually longer in the back of your body and are an essential resource for a powerful voice). If you work on your breathing a few minutes everyday, image the breath falling in and whooshing back out. No conscious muscular control is necessary (this can be a very difficult concept to master, so patience!). I would suggest lying on your back, legs straight &amp; relaxed, with one hand gently placed on you low abdomen - if you spend a few minutes each day just laying there breathing, this new breathing pattern will be more and more available to you when you begin to work on your voice. 
Secondly, think of the deep internal muscles that are wrapped around your bones like the dampeners on a piano. If the dampener pedal is depressed, the piano strings will not resonate. This is true of these deep muscles. You want the muscles of your face, tongue, jaw, neck, shoulders, torso, &amp; ribcage to be soft, relaxed, &amp; available. Think of how you feel when you're about to catch a fly ball; your body could move quickly in any direction -- as opposed to how you might feel flexing at the gym (taught, tight, &amp; restricted). Soft muscles = availability for sound &amp; resonance. 
Finally, I would say that the most important thing is to let changes to your voice happen naturally. If you 'put on' a deeper voice, you run the risk of straining your voice, or even developing nodes on your vocal chords - all because of forcing a sound using musculature instead of allowing authentic changes to occur. You don't have to DO anything, you just want to ALLOW changes to happen. Your Ted Williams voice is inside you, you just need to let it free!
My voice used to be very high pitched and nasal (and it still can be, at times), but with years of work I have developed a really rich and balanced sound. I love working with the voice, and because I am sure that some of this comes off as a bit esoteric, I am actually transitioning into Speech Pathology so that I can learn the science behind everything I have said here. You - or anyone - is welcome to PM me if you'd like more info, or if you would like a lesson over Skype. I'd be more than happy to help!
tl;dr - let your breath soften, let your muscles soften, find how you can use your bones to resonate, &amp; don't DO, instead ALLOW. ",0,1354033380,,0,False,1,c77k5av,t3_13tnyj,t1_c77k5av,t3_13tnyj,,1430513833,6,False,IWantToLearn,t5_2rjo5,6

True,alt01ds,,,"Camping at the beach with several families this past summer. Where are the kids? in the fucking RV and each one on either an iPad, Nintendo DS, etc.  Mine were outside chasing squirrels. Let's go down to the beach--it's a 1000 yard walk on a cement trail for god's sake. Is there a shuttle service?  Is there WiFi available? I don't want to get sand in my smartphone. The parents were useless. Trying to convince the parents that it's okay to throw rocks was ridiculous. So now my kids and I are bad influences.

My kids and I were happy to sleep in a tent, on the ground without a two inch thick insulated wall surrounding us.  My kids and I were happy to stay up until the logs burned down to glowing embers so we can look at the stars while the other kids were in their big cozy RV watching DVDs and microwave popcorn. Wow, no one but my family brought actual food to cook.  The others had microwaveable food. The big fire was too smoky.

True,jcaimbridge,,,"I just want to say that while that's tempting to believe--that this election has proven that ""the people have won,"" I think it could be very damaging and premature to say this for the following three reasons:

1) With or without Citizens United, the candidate that raises the most money wins ~90% of the time.  I encourage you to look at the election year by election year statistics on opensecrets.org to verify this.  Money definitely has an effect on elections, and Super PACs and 501c4s are just another piece of the pie now (and will only grow in significance, as other avenues of influence have)

2) Even more important is that the problem is not just getting ""your guy"" in office.  Perhaps the biggest problem with the current system of campaign finance is how it affects the operations of congress itself: with more and more money being funneled into the system (through means that have existed for decades before Citizens United), candidates have to win the backing of more and more monied special interests (if they can't raise to meet the competition, chances are they won't be in office the following election).  In other words, to whom did both democrats and republicans have to indebt themselves to compensate for this extra influx of special interest money?  And what interests did they ignore (e.g. labor groups, climate change groups) because such groups could not outraise interests competing for a congressman's attention?  And how is a congressman's world-view shaped by surrounding themselves with so many lobbiests that only present their self-interested side of the story?  All of these have been shown to have a significant negative effect on congressmen acting in the public interest.

3) Lastly, the more aggressive the competition is with raising money, the more time politicians must spend on fundraising in order to stay competitive.  Right now, congressmen spend 30% - 70% of their time fundraising.  On the presidential side of things, this election cycle Obama has spent more time fundraising than any incumbent president (which, I believe, is somewhere around ~230 days out of the year).  This is time that is not spent doing what congress was *intended* to do--deliberate over issues to promote the public good, and that can only have a negative effect.

&gt;  Nine times out of ten a shitty mother would get custody over a great father.

Nine times of ten, the father doesn't request custody. [Source](http://www.villainouscompany.com/vcblog/archives/2012/04/child_supportcu.html).

&gt; No fault states.

Not sure how this is an issue. IMO, a person should have the right to seek a divorce in the smoothest way possible when possible.

&gt; The fact that a woman can do anything to a man physically and rarely have any legal ramifications. 

TIL there are no women murderers in prison. 

&gt; Women also typically get lighter sentences than men for doing worse crimes.

Black people get longer jail sentences than white people do for doing worse crimes. Yet I don't see you picketing over there. In fact, a significant chunk of r/mensrights users also post to r/whiterights. [Source](http://i.imgur.com/pB5I0.png)

All of that said, you are correct that women get lighter sentences than men do.

Women are also barred from serving the country in combat. They face social pressures to avoid joining physical sports like wrestling and football. Physical tests for occupations like police officers and firefighters are designed with men and mind, making them biased against women. [Source](http://i.imgur.com/Yp9iF.png). r/MensRighters has no problems discussing how women are too weak/unhygienic/etc to serve in combat. [Source](http://i.imgur.com/VqQZL.png/).

Now here's where the dissonance is. You keep acting like women are weak, saying over and over that they're too weak and helpless to stand shoulder to shoulder with men . . . then why does it become a surprise when nobody takes violence by women seriously? 

You know Lizzie Borden, right? Killed her father and her stepmother, totally got off for it? Did you do any research on it? I did. Wrote a paper on it. Quiz time. When people talked about why she didn't go to jail did they go:

A) We can't send a woman to jail. They are angels, goddesses! It would be a shame to our country, to our Father, to imprison a queen!

or

B) She is a woman. She couldn't possibly have done it. That axe is too heavy for a woman, there were far too many blows for a woman to make. Her fragile mind wouldn't be able to bear the violence that unfolded.


Hint: It was B. 

Protip: Being seen as physically inferior is not a privilege. Shorter jail sentences may be a product of perceived inferiority and therefore perceived insignificance of crimes, but being viewed as inferior is not a privilege. The same system that says a woman couldn't possibly do significant violence to men is the same system that says women aren't capable of participating in combat, of being firefighters, of being tough or dominant.

Oh, and by the way - a chunk of the reason that women have lower/lesser jail sentences than men do has to do with the fact that there are so few of them. 

Men and women's prison facilities are segregated, and this includes many of their programs, and because a huge number of the prisoners are men, the majority of the budget, facilities, and programs go to them. Prison has less rehabilitation programs for women. On a televsion program I was watching on Nat Geo, the seven-floor prison had multiple levels for men, ranging from minimum security to maximum security, from minimum offenders to the most violent criminals. The women had one floor, and low-level offenders were mixed in with higher level ones. Prison has no childcare programs for women; when a single mother is arrested, as many women prisoners are, their children are often displaced to foster homes. When women to go prison, they go to prison having more people, innocent people, dependent on them than men do. This coupled with the fact that women drug users are not going to have access to as many drug rehabilitation programs like men do.  Before you start wailing about how women are getting different jail sentences, stop and consider how women and men's circumstances are different before they enter prison, and how the facilities that they enter are different. 


&gt; Vocational bias. In a lot of cases men are frowned upon for working with women or children, because it's generally assumed that we're all sexual deviants.

Ah, yes, men's poor demonized sexuality. Except for that really inconvenient realities of how men's sexuality is catered to 24/7 in movies, videogames, bill boards, magazines. How organizations are encouraging men to become teachers. [Source](http://www.edutopia.org/male-teacher-shortage). How *more than half* of gynecologists are men. [Source](http://www.jaoa.org/content/105/8/369.full). 

&gt; In many states, a woman can put any name on the birth certificate of a child, and it's up to the man to have the burden of proof that it was NOT his child. 

Exactly what do you propose be suggested? Women can't go into labor unless the biological father is present? Children aren't issued their birth certificate unless the biological father is present?  ""Leave the father's name blank,"" is one suggestion, but unless you think that women are *maliciously lying* about who the father is, chances are it's safe to say that they think they know who the father is.

Women don't need to supply a burden of proof that their baby is their own because it came shooting out of their vagina. Women can't provide a burden of proof that the person they declare to be the father is the father because that's physically impossible unless she carries of a vial of his sperm + a contract with his signature stating that that is in fact his sperm. 

&gt; After 30 days and no evidence, it's nigh-impossible to change it. You're stuck paying child support for a child that isn't yours.

[citation needed]

&gt; The list goes on and on and on.

It's easy to make that list go on and on when you aren't concerned about things like facts or reality. 

&gt; Feminism, on the other hand, doesn't believe in egalitarianism. 

Eaglelibrarianism is a joke. It's a concoction by MRAs who want to shriek about how unfair the world is to them without considering how sexism actually works.
 
 When people say they are an ""egalitarian"" because it's a gender neutral term, unlike feminism, they're demonstrating a complete lack of knowledge of issues of gender equality. They're entering the field under the assumption that women and men are equally oppressed, completely erasing the historical roots of oppression. It would be like approaching racism while erasing the Holocaust, slavery, and segregation as irrelevant to racism today. Feminists seek to achieve gender equality recognizing that women and men are involved in multidimensional system that puts men in a position of power over women, and that equality is achieved by raising women - and femininity - up to the status of men.

Research demonstrates that negroes are born with smaller brains, and their skulls calcify at an earlier age so as to prohibit further brain growth. They have a physically smaller prefrontal cortex, a part of the brain which is responsible for abstract thought and self-control. The result of these physical differences can be measured experimentally with, for instance, IQ tests, on which negroes scores substantially below whites. 

Of course, nowadays, a persons wealth is most strongly determined by a persons IQ. So it is no wonder that negroes would find themselves to be 'economically disadvantaged'. 

Indeed, one may argue that negroes have low IQ because they are poor, rather than the other way around. But the support for this claim is almost non-existent in comparison to the breadth and depth of supporting evidence for the thesis I am advocating for here.

When I was in high school, my mom had set a pretty large pile of my freshly-laundered panties on the ground of my bedroom. At some point between then and when I got home from school, our dog managed to eat the. entire. pile.  This wasn't just a few pair either. The pile was probably a good 5"" off the ground pre-consumption.

I didn't notice right away (since she actually *ate* the *whole* pile of underwear), but a few hours later, she puked up a humongous, nasty, slimy, black pile which we realized was my underwear after a little bit of digging through it. 

Needless to say, the dog had some trouble with her bowels since pooping out a chewed up pair of panties isn't as easy as passing a turd. My dad had to help her a few times by manually pulling it out... Afterward, he came back inside the house, disgusted, and said, ""There is nothing more disturbing than pulling your daughter's thong out of your dog's ass.""

True,qcdiko,,,"First: See if they're receptive to a conversation. If they have headphones on, are reading a book, or just look busy, they're sending you social cues that they would rather not have a conversation.

There's a reason most people talk about the weather, sports events, news (that isn't too controversial, i.e. no political talk) and other small talk with strangers: it's light, simple, and easy to build on. 

But you're not going to get very far just chatting up strangers, because most people are busy and have their own social circles going on, and you're a stranger to them. Practice just making small talk, but don't expect much from it. 

Your best bet is to meet people who share your interests. Are you in school or working? Can you join any clubs? You can meet new people that way who you already have something in common with. Another thing you can do is mine your existing friends for other friends. If your friend is having a party or something, and you'd usually say no because you're shy or awkward (which I've personally been known to do), try to go anyway and practice your small talk skills you've been using on strangers. Your efforts will go farther because you've already been ""vouched"" for in a sense, since you share the same friendship circle.

As far as talking to girls, we're just people. Talk to them like you would other people that you know, but maybe build up your relationships with guys first if that's easier? 

Wow that's a lot. TLDR: It's not a terrible thing to suck at speaking to strangers, focus your efforts on your existing friend groups and meeting like-minded people at clubs. Oh, and talk about boring stuff like the weather at first then branch on out and do your thing.

[Big fan of your segments on colbert,  What was your initial reaction when Colbert told you he wanted to start a Super PAC?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13vvzd/i_am_trevor_potter_stephen_colberts_personal/c77mnrd?context=5)|First he called and asked about 30 minutes of technical questions about Pacs--who can have one, how they work, etc. Then he asked if I'd be ""willing to say all of that on air""...so I went on the show to answer his questions and explain Pacs. Only after that did he tell me that he really wanted one, and asked if I could help--and by then I was impressed enough with him to say ""sure""...every lawyer likes a new and interesting client--it makes going to the office much more fun!
[Thank you for turning an incredibly complex topic like campaign financing and its effects into something more easily understandable.  How did this system arise in the first place with the emphasis this country has on governmental checks and balances?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13vvzd/i_am_trevor_potter_stephen_colberts_personal/c77mqoj?context=5)|The answer is there IS no ""system"" in the sense that no one designed what we have. Congress passed McCain-Feingold, which was supposed to revise the campaign finance system, but the Supreme Court has since made swiss cheese of parts of that law--and the tax laws enforced (or not enforced) by the IRS were written in pieces over many years, with no reference to how they relate to campaign finance laws. Then the FEC has written regulations changing/interpreting  major portions of the laws passed by Congress, in ways that cut even further holes in the ""system."" So--no intelligent design here--just chaos...
[What is the plan with the money that was pulled from the Super Pac to the 501(c\)4?  I understand him going through the process of ""keeping it"" to show the holes in the system.  But I find it hard to believe he would actually do that when all was said and done.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13vvzd/i_am_trevor_potter_stephen_colberts_personal/c77mnhu?context=5)|That is a question for Mr. Colbert--his lawyer is obligated by the attorney-client privilege not to reveal client secrets! I have great faith in Stephen Colbert, and am confident the money will be well-used--but the point being made is that under current laws it is possible to have it all disapear from public view--which it just has.
[Seeing how this point has been made crystal clear.

True,Froolow,,,"Some of your facts appear to be distorted. For example, you write:

&gt; Research demonstrates that negroes are born with smaller brains

While it is true to say [some](http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/content/129/2/386.abstract) studies have found a link between race and brain size, the link is very, very weak (r values of 0.15) and may well not exist at all. [Cernovsky](http://www.brown.uk.com/brownlibrary/INTEL2.htm) very convincingly demonstrates that brain size is more to do with climate than race, by showing that the cranial capacity for North American blacks is comparable to Caucasians from similar climate zones, and that the brain size of the average Massai is larger than the average white Egyptian.

Furthermore, it is a red herring to assume brain size is absolutely correlated to intelligence. Certainly [infant brain size](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/118/4/1486) seems to have *some* effect on adult intelligence, but if that were all there was to it then elephants and whales would be much smarter than humans, and women would be less intelligent than adult baboons.

&gt; their skulls calcify at an earlier age so as to prohibit further brain growth

I couldn't find anything on google about early-life skull calcification by race, nor do I understand why 'prohibiting further brain growth' is relevant. The study which appears to show that brain growth is positively correlated with intelligence also says the effects taper off after one year and since I know adult black people have very similar sized heads to adult white people the calcification effect - if it exists at all - must happen well after this date.

There is a small difference in [pineal calcification](http://book.neurosurgeon.org/?defaultarticle=&amp;defaultnode=2150&amp;layout=22) reported by the Congress of Neurological Science, but since the pineal gland is responsible for producing melatonin ~~(which itself controls skin colour) I can't say this is a staggering surprise to me.~~ *Edit: Melatonin =/= melanin. Apparently there is some relationship between the two but it is indirect. Melatonin controls the sleep cycle, melanin is what I was thinking of which controls skin colour. Thanks to everyone who spotted that!*

Once again, a quick search of all the science reference libraries I subscribe to turned up exactly one result - a [1906](http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/49594/1/1000050402_ftp.pdf) paper by noted racist Robert Bennett Bean. Obviously the fact he is a racist has no bearing on the quality of science he can output, but in this particular case the science is absolutely dismal. Take a look, for example, at his images of a [vertical, transverse](http://imgur.com/ltZSR) section of the brain and tell me that identifies any major structures that he should have seen (I'll grant you the corpus callosum in the bottom image). Moreover, his statistical tests are absolute bunkum and his findings [have not been replicated since](http://neurophilosophy.wordpress.com/2007/03/14/on-the-peculiarities-of-the-negro-brain/).

&gt; the support for this claim [that poverty causes low IQ] is almost non-existent

There is nothing wrong with reading this mountain of evidence and saying, ""You know what, I am not convinced by any of the methodology"". But to pretend the evidence doesn't exist is willfully ignorant.

I'd also like to point out that the *most* disadvantaged group in the UK, judged on educational attainment, are [white, working class males](http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2008/mar/27/schools.uk4) (sorry it's not an academic source). If you are correct that poverty does not cause low attainment then you are committed to the thesis that white, working class males are genetically inferior to blacks of all socio-economic statuses and genders. Which I suspect you wouldn't be too keen on doing.

In conclusion, I was very interested to research some of your arguments, using google as you suggested. I was able to add a number of interesting studies to my folder of socio-economic status articles and learned an interesting fact about how pineal calcification differs by race. On the other hand, I wasn't able to confirm any of your race-specific claims to my satisfaction other than that black people tend to score worse than white people on IQ tests (which I personally think is just one of the many methodological problem with IQ tests). I was also quite cross that you claimed there was 'almost no' evidence for a link between SES and IQ when in fact there are hundreds and hundreds of papers, most of which agree with me, some of which find no link but *none* of which agree with you. It made me feel like you had not done any independent research which was disheartening after spending so long rebutting your earlier claims. But rebut them I did, and I really don't see how an intelligent person could continue to hold the views you do after seeing such a string of scientific articles undermining your position.",0,1354106143,,0,1354554172,5,c780pkt,t3_13r5tm,t1_c780pkt,t1_c77sf7h,,1435663640,5261,False,Columbus,t5_2r373,5261

What is your favorite place? I mean really just for a moment forget all the bullshit, and just think of that place that you love. 

I know you're going to say this is fucking stupid, but what's the harm. Really if you are going to end it today, wouldn't you rather have your last thoughts be something that you enjoy. 

One of my favorites is the Olympic Peninsula in Washington state the Hoh Rainforest. It is one of the last quiet places left in the world, where you can hear no effects of man just the world as it was intended. The river is milky white with sediment as it flows from the glaciers on the mountain tops. 

My life is not how I want it, in fact most days I hate it. 

The last two days, I've called in sick to the job that I fucking loathe because I just can't stand to be there.i I am overwhelmed, the anxiety is often unbearable, most days I just want to be left alone in the silence. 
 
I desperately want to just quit but I can't how would we make ends meet when we barely get by as it is. It took me long enough just to find this job, I can't just walk away. I struggled this year to find hope in my days. I was always sad or angry, I would come home and cry or scream. 

I kept waiting for this to change, then I realized it was me who had to change. So I have little things that add up, stopped my smoking cigarettes &amp; weed, started eating better, cooking from home. Still working on the cleaning part and organization. 

don't get me days are still hard like the last two. Yesterday, the anxiety attack at  the start of my day because I realized I might have really fucked up at my job. I enrolled in a class this semester I have an exam tomorrow and I haven't studied at all. I just couldn't face it so here I am on reddit, watching reruns on netflix. 

There's always going to be shit, most days are shit. Honestly, I'm not going to say it's easier.  But for the fucking terrible low points in my life like the last two years, there are those moments like sitting in the rain forest next to the river, one day I'll be there again not today but I'll get there. 

So if you choose today as your last, then make the fucking most of it. Don't sit at home and wallow, even prisoners get a last meal of their favorite. It's the least you could do for yourself. 

Or just maybe you should give yourself a break. Believe in yourself just a little maybe next year which is just around the corner will be even the slightest bit better then this year. Maybe next year you'll meet a girl that likes you, and ask you out for a drink. Maybe once you cut yourself  some slack employers will too. Then you'll get even a low paying job, just to get some cash of your own. Maybe look into some classes that will improve your skills to get a better job. 

Maybe you'll start talking to people that have been down this road before. Who are still walking it day by day but are on the way to the rain forest.

True,ad_audiendum,male,♂,"I know this is AskWomen, but I've been in two 6 year relationships and have entered the dating world twice now with the same kind of awkwardness you're probably having. Moreover, I also lean toward romantic and chivalrous behavior.

First, congratulations on being able to talk to women and get numbers, honestly, that's the hardest part for someone who's been in a LTR and reentering the dating world. It's the most foreign aspect of it all.

So, you've met a girl, you find her intriguing in some capacity, and have her number. I'd suggest sending her a text along the lines of, ""Hi [her name], this is [Yankee], the [your physical description, e.g. tall guy] from [place you got her number]. Would you like to get drinks or coffee sometime?"" Drinks and coffee are a nice non-committal way of getting to know someone. They can be brief or long depending on how it goes. If she agrees, suggest a more quiet place (stay away from sports bars and Starbucks, they're busy, loud, and not very intimate). Because this is non-committal you're not expected to bring flowers or other such gifts. You're simply meeting up to hangout and have a chat. Light and easy.

I find it best to think of the first meeting as a very casual and light interview. Do not grill her, but you're purpose is to find out if she is the kind person you'd like to spend more time with. With that in mind, be yourself. She wants to find out about you, so be yourself and give her the opportunity to do just that. Don't overthink your responses and actions. If it's gone well, part with a hug and a ""We should do this again."" and depending how she responds, ""I'll get ahold of you."" If it's gone *really* well, maybe go for a kiss. (I would generally assume just a hug, but sometimes you get vibes that say, ""kiss me!"", no better advice than, 'feel it out'.)

Your level of communication is probably best gauged off of hers. After a few days (no more than a week), float out a text, ""Hi! How are you today? I really enjoyed chatting with you."" How does she respond? Assuming it's favorably, maybe ask a light follow up question to something you talked about on your first date or whatever you'd like. Then ask her if she's busy next weekend (or whenever).

Dinner, or something more novel (maybe a potential interest you gleaned from your drinks/coffee date), is a good way to go for a second date. Again, be you, find out about her, and if you're into her just enjoy her company - that's what this is about after all. If you're the kind of guy who likes giving flowers (etc.) a single flower would be acceptable at this point, although not very common - which is not to discourage you from doing it, if that's the kind of guy you are, that's what you should do.

When you part ways at the end of the second date ... here's where the potentially awkward bit comes: to kiss or not. Generally, read her signs. Have you been receiving warm smiles? Has she been laughing at your jokes? Has she asked any questions that would indicate she wants to know more about you. Basically, does she seem interested? If you think so, kiss her. I would suggest (although you should do whatever feels best to you) a light bit of aggressiveness. Not too much! But a little. I think most women (and women here, please correct me if I'm wrong) find a certain amount of bravado attractive. (I think of masculine bravado like salting food: a little is good, but too much and you'll ruin it.)

Past this, just feel it out. Beyond the second date, I like to think there really isn't a roadmap - in a good way. At this point, make your own path with her, however brief or long it may be.

Note: I've never received any negative response to opening doors, taking coats, pulling a chair out, or ensuring that you're walking curbside on a sidewalk. This kind of chivalry seems acceptable. Paying for food and the like has become a bit of a grey area. It varies greatly from woman to woman. Some like the gesture of paying for drinks/dinner, and some feel that you are maybe stifling their independent strength in a small way. Rather, some feel it's an outdated paradigm that maybe signals a masculine dominate mindset. */shrug* I see both sides. I don't know of a good way to broach the subject prior to it happening. I'd say pay for the coffee or drinks on the first date since it won't be too expensive, if she protests, ask her if she'd pick up the tip and assure her you'll let the bill be split next time.",0,1354119766,,0,False,1,c783hoo,t3_13xi3w,t1_c783hoo,t3_13xi3w,,1430523176,276,False,AskWomen,t5_2rxrw,276

We were looking at silverware in the kitchen section, and we parked our cart in one of the larger aisles since no one was around. We're both in our early 20s. As we looked through the various utensils, a tall skinny blonde man who looks about 40 comes and stands near our cart. 

I glance over at him for a split second, and he seems to be looking at the items on the shelf next to the cart. Then I look back to my girlfriend, and the man yells at us, ""Did you seriously just LOOK at me, and NOT UNDERSTAND WHY I WAS STANDING HERE?""
We both look up, and the man is glaring at us angrily. Neither of us know what the hell he is talking about, and kind of just stare back, dumbstruck. 
""MOVE YOUR CART.""


Girlfriend grabs the cart and stammers a quick, ""ohokaysorry.""

Sure, this is a good place.  There are some other good subreddits as well, I'd assume, but none that I frequent.  I'm sure you'll get a lot of advice from people who say ""Go to /r/$foo"", but this is a good place to start.


&gt;Hi. I'm a 41 year old male who has never experienced the very basic of what is supposed to be friendship or a relationship.

That sucks, and I'm very sorry to hear it (truly).  The good news is, you're making connections here and while Internet friendships can be somewhat tenuous, it's a start.  And it sounds like a start is really what you need.

&gt;I've never been able to get a job, so I ended up freelancing. Most of my own family doesn't talk to me and feels that I am useless and will never get married and live a happy life. I cry almost every day and just lie down in my bed or chair for much of the day, before job searching, doing freelance work and browsing randomly on the internet, thinking about why this happens to me, and what I have done wrong.

OK, first things first:  You are not useless, you can have a happy life, and you didn't do anything to deserve this.  Truly, on all three.  It'll take work, but it's not even remotely out of reach.

&gt;I just need to let it all out and I cannot do it vocally, a psychiatrist was my first option but first I will post it here.

Again, a good start.  I would recommend that when you can you follow up with a therapist of some sort.  They're going to be a much safer space than the internet, and should be able to offer constructive advice that (hopefully) won't be the ascerbic kind you may get in an open forum.

I'm going to try to address your post here, but as it's rather long please forgive me if I leave out some sections.


&gt;Ever since I went to Nursery (UK equivalent of Kindergarten I think?) I have never made a friend. Nobody wanted to pair up with me or be my play-buddy, or even talk to me on the playground. I was always bullied, always the odd quiet kid, always the one that nobody wanted to talk to.

It sounds like you got picked out for the omega/low-man-on-the-totem-pole role in that first year, and that the habits you've learned because of that treatment have become so ingrained you have a hard time escaping them.

so here's the good news: you can escape them.  You're stronger than you know.

Really, you are.  You're 41 years old and have dealt with shit and isolation for, by your words, most of that time, and have survived.  You're wounded, and scarred, but not broken.  None of your classmates, from any school, have broken you because you're still here.  You are strong enough to carry the crap they piled on you, and to still reach out and try to make human contact.  That's strength right there.

Sure, you're scared by other people.  We've never given you any indication that you can, or should, trust us.  That's a hard trap to break out of, but the fact that you're here asking for help is a start.


&gt;I feel that anybody who looks at me thinks of me in the most negative fashion possible.

This is one of those self-fulfilling prophecies.  Again, it's not something that's your fault, but it's something that you have to change yourself.  The truth is most people who look at you (or anyone else, for that matter) don't see them.  We're all caught up in our own worlds, our own minds, and only rarely to strangers intrude into them.

I'm tempted to offer advice, but I remember my own dad's words on the subject of free advice (to whit: ""You get what you pay for."")  If you like, I or someone else can offer ideas, but I don't want to drop a huge list of ""you need to do *this*, and *that*, and *this other thing*.  I don't think that'd be helpful right now, and in my own experience it can make you feel even more overwhelmed.


&gt;I feel like I am the worst person on this planet. I repeatedly hit myself and have removed every single mirror from my house. I don't want to look at myself, or remember that I am this person. I wish I was never born to make it easier for everyone who has to put up with my existence.

This is the most worrying part of your post to me.  While impulses to hurt yourself are a pretty common stress reaction (I've had them myself, and over a lot less stress than you're describing), they're also alarm bells.  Please, when you can find a therapist to talk to about these urges.


&gt;Why has this happened?

Because people can be true assholes, and you had the misfortune to run into them at a very early age.

&gt;What did I do wrong?

Nothing, at least not at first.  Now you've internalized the role of ""someone who can't be loved"" so you may be pushing away those willing to connect with you, even if you don't realize it.  But that's not a permanent thing, it's something you can change.

&gt;And what can be done about this?

You're going to have to work hard to ditch all the baggage that's been loaded on to you, or at least to set it down every once in a while.

I don't know what, specifically, you should do, and I do know that you're going to thing things are hopeless a bunch of times while you're changing yourself, but it can be done.

I was shit on, though not to your degree, from 2nd grade through the middle of my senior year in high school (ages 6 through 18, roughly), and it leaves a lot of scars.  I'm still not comfortable doing some things around others, such as dancing, and it takes me a while to open up to people in person, but I'm far beyond where I was back in school.  

I had the fortune to run into some folks in college who dragged me, nearly kicking and screaming, into social interaction.  Later on, many of them pointed out they'd been similar to me in the past --fearing social interaction, stuck inside their own heads, feeling like eternal outsiders-- but had lucked out just the way I had.

So you're a few years older than I was when I learned to crawl out of my shell, you're still capapble of emerging, and there's people here who'll help you if you're willing to try.

True,[deleted],,,"That other people who say ""oh, I've got ADHD"" are often lying. They will treat your disorder like it's a just a fun social accessory and pretend they've got it too, just for the novelty. Be prepared for that.

They should also know that having ADHD looks a lot like laziness to some people, and they will treat you unfairly because they think it's just a character flaw and not an actual disorder.

They should know that no amount of accommodations will ever level the playing field for them and the other kids. Society has expectations for everybody, and they will be judged against kids without their disorder as if they were all given equal opportunity to succeed. They should be prepared for this harsh reality and know not to waste their time or energy fighting it- they have to rise to the expectations of society, no matter how unreasonable they may sometimes be. It's not fair, but it's something they will have to deal with.

For example, teachers will not accept ""I couldn't focus"" as a reason for not having your homework done, no matter how true it may be. Sometimes it requires a herculean effort to complete tasks and assignments that are simple for other people. Never, ever give up. Don't dwell on how unfair it is. Don't throw your arms in the air and say you can't do it because of your ADHD. Do it in *spite* of your ADHD. It will require monumental effort, effort that will likely never be recognized except by close friends.

Your peers and your teachers will never realize how difficult it is for you to even pay attention, so do not expect them to. For them, it is easy. They don't have to put effort into listening. They don't have to martial their thoughts when they start wandering off. Their urges to procrastinate are almost nonexistent compared to yours, and because they cannot see it through your eyes, they will assume it's just as easy for you.

TL;DR:

-People will downplay your disorder. 

-People will treat you like you have a character flaw instead of a mental illness.

-People will minimize it and treat it like a fun social accessory (""oh! I've got that sometimes too!"").

-Your battles *will* be harder than everybody else's. You are still expected to win them.

True,jusksmit,,Mr. Fiskers / Dillo Hills 2 (@fexlabs),"Hey there. I've worked on rhythm games before ([vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pIQrw5mGrU), [vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-otzm2cymw), [vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-3SmZaK-yU)).

There are two issues to consider here. The most important one is how to make sure you interpret the player's input correctly, so that they feel like they're being rewarded accurately, and the slightly less important one is making sure that your graphics match the music, so that it looks like the notes/actions are happening in sync with the music.

We'll start with the second one: making sure your actions/graphics are matching the music. Let's assume that our game is similar to DDR or guitar hero: as the music plays, notes come falling down the screen towards a ""strum bar"", and when they reach the bar, you're supposed to press a key. Easy, right? You could just use a function like this:

    renderNoteFallingDownScreen(id:int) {
        note[id].y = strumBar.y - (mySong.position - note[id].strumTime);
    }

So you write that function, compile, and to your shock and horror, everything is wrong. The notes are jittery/stuttery, and when they do finally manage to stutter their way down, it looks like they're hitting the bar about half a second behind the song, especially during framerate dips. So what gives?

First of all, in almost all environments where you're playing back an audio file (or at least the environments I've worked in: AS3, javascript, C#), it's very difficult to get a precise playhead position for an audio file that updates at a reasonable rate (~60FPS). In a perfect world, if you traced out the playhead/position of an audio file every frame, you would see something like this:

0, 17, 33, 50, 67, 83, 100, 117, 133...

But in the real world, the results are going to look something like this:

0,0,0,0,83,83,83,133,133,133,133,200,200...

Instead of giving you a smooth, consistent output, the playhead updates in steps. What you need to do is interpolate between those steps, which is exactly like interpolation in a multiplayer game.

The easiest way to do this is to keep track of the playhead position with your own variable, and automatically add time to that variable every frame. There are bad ways to do it:

    everyFrame() {
        songTime += 1000/60; // 1000ms in a second, 60 frames per second
    }

And slightly better ways to do it: 

    songStarted() {
        previousFrameTime = getTimer();
    }

    everyFrame() {
        songTime += getTimer() - previousFrameTime;
        previousFrameTime = getTimer();
    }

    // OR:

    songStarted() {
        startTime = getTimer();
    }

    everyFrame() {
        songTime = getTimer() - startTime;
    }

However, all three of these methods are imperfect. Or, to be more precise, your audio playback method is likely to be imperfect. Either way, it means that eventually, your little songTime variable is going to get out of sync with the actual audio playhead. This is especially likely to happen if you're in an environment where the audio is likely to skip, buffer, or crash - like a web game or a game that streams its music instead of playing from a file. It's also likely to start off with a slight delay because most audio playback routines hiccup at the very start of playback - especially if you're using MP3 files that have encoding data baked in, if you're reading the audio file from a slow hard drive, or if your gamer is using Chrome's built-in ""pepperflash"" plugin, which is a piece of shit.

So in order to take our songTime and keep it consistent with the actual playhead position of the audio file, I like to use a basic easing algorithm to apply corrections every time I get a fresh playhead position, like this:

    songStarted() {
        previousFrameTime = getTimer();
        lastReportedPlayheadPosition = 0;
        mySong.play();
    }

    everyFrame() {
        songTime += getTimer() - previousFrameTime;
        previousFrameTime = getTimer();
        if(mySong.position != lastReportedPlayheadPosition) {
            songTime = (songTime + mySong.position)/2;
            lastReportedPlayheadPosition = mySong.position;
        }
    }

This function will automatically take the songTime variable that I'm tracking manually and average it with the actual reported playhead position every time a new playhead position is reported. I *only* do it when I've just received a fresh report, because if we keep easing it towards the ""stepped"" valuable in between fresh reports, we're gonna get stuttery playback again. Instead, I'll continue to advance the songTime manually until I receive another fresh report.

But the fun's not quite over yet! You see, all rendering pipelines have delays of their own: the time it takes to actually render the scene, plus a small delay for the scene to make it to the user's monitor (and if they're playing on a TV this delay will be *much bigger*). On top of the delay it takes for your graphics to make it to the monitor, there is also a delay that happens between the user hitting a key and the keystroke making it back to your program. In most games, this delay is completely negligible, but when you're dealing with rhythm games, you need absolutely perfect accuracy, which means you need to account for that small round-trip delay.

Unfortunately, every person's monitor and input devices are different, which means there is no universal constant we can add to our playhead. Instead, we need the user to run a visual delay test, like the one rock band / guitar hero uses. They use two tests, and we'll get to the other one later, but the one we're talking about right now is [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=MoUIQr2pTAw#t=54s).

There are lots of ways to do this test. You can flash the screen, or you can show a visual indicator like a metronome, and ask the user to tap along with the indicator. There should be no audio playing during this test: you are trying to calibrate their video lag, not their audio lag. Each time your test flashes the screen (or makes the metronome tick), record that time. Then, when you receive a keystroke back from the user, you just measure the time again. Subtract the time you sent out the visual flash (ping) from the time you received the keystroke (pong), and that's your visual latency.

In theory, it's not possible to have a negative visual latency, because visual latency = rendering lag + input lag. However, the user might be the kind of person who consistently plays their notes a little bit earlier than they think they need to. If they are, and if their monitor and input devices are both very low-latency, it's not impossible to have a negative visual latency, so your system needs to be equipped to deal with that.

Also important: you're going to need to run this test for 15-30 seconds to get reliable results. A single round-trip ping test is not going to be reliable: there are too many variables that can cause inconsistencies, both in the rendering/input process and in the user's ability to keep a consistent beat with your test. Each time your test ticks and you calculate the lag for that tick, add it to an array, then use the average value of that array to set the video latency.

Once you've got the stable measurement of the song's position and a fairly good video latency, it's easy to display graphics and animations in sync with the music, using a formula like this:

    renderNoteFallingDownScreen(id:int) {
        note[id].y = strumBar.y - (songTime - note[id].strumTime) + visualLatencySetting;
    }

And there you have it. The visual side of things is taken care of! Now we need to deal with the music itself.

Just like visual lag, there's a lag between when an audio file is processed and when the user actually hears it. Again, there are a ton of variables in this equation, including their audio hardware, their reaction time, and even their distance from the speakers. And to make things even more fun, this audio lag is usually *totally different* from the video lag, which means we can't just use the same adjustment variable for both of them.

Fortunately, we can account for this audio lag exactly like we account for the video lag, with a test [like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=MoUIQr2pTAw#t=38s). This particular video is using a method where the guitar actually listens and plays the note automatically, but for your game, the user is probably going to have to tap a key along to the beat, which means we're also taking input lag into account here, too.

Because this could result in double-compensating for input lag, you either need to fudge the numbers a tiny bit to compensate, or you need to do the audio test first and apply the result before starting the video test. In other words, every time you get the 'pong' response during the video test, you adjust it based on the results of the audio test.

There are two reasons you want to apply the results of the audio test to the video test, rather than vice versa. The first reason is that audio latency is *much more important* than video latency. In rhythm games, your eyes guide you to the correct note, but your *ears* tell you when to play it, so they get top priority. Another reason why it's safer to do the audio test before the video test is because audio latency is usually much, much lower than video latency, which means more of the latency is coming from input delays rather than output delays. Say, for instance, that I run the audio test and get an audio latency of 25ms. If I had to guess, about 20ms of that is coming from the user's reaction time and input lag, not lag between your game and the audio hardware.

This also means that the user is more likely to have a negative audio latency. Again, this is not terribly uncommon, especially with inexperienced players/musicians who will try to overcompensate and end up playing notes a little too fast. It's important to note, though, that a user might get uncomfortable and overcompensate during a latency test, but then once they get into the game, they start mellowing out and hitting notes at the right time - but since they adjusted the latency settings based on early note hits, their timing will be off again.

To solve this problem, your audio calibration test needs to be as close to real gameplay as you can get. The user needs to feel relaxed and in the groove. **Listening to a metronome ticking with no background noise is stressful and difficult**. In between every tick, there's a lot of dead silence, and during that silence, a lot of people are going to get antsy and lose track of the beat, because very few gamers (and even musicians) are accustomed to following a metronome without accompaniment. To see what I mean, listen to [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:120BPMclicktrack.ogg) and try to tap along to the beat, then skip to about 1:15 in [this song](http://grooveshark.com/s/Edge+Hill/44vMly?src=5) and tap along to the beat. The second one is *way* easier, right? I've never understood why Rock Band uses a metronome tick instead of a simple song with a consistent beat, and I think it's very dumb that they're still doing it after all these years.

Anyway, assuming you applied the audio latency to the video test, that means there might now be a tiny, insignificant discrepancy between the video and the audio, because not 100% of the audio latency comes from user input. These discrepancies can come from hardware delays, the user's reaction time (although this should be minimal; rhythm games are about anticipation, not reaction), and even the time it takes for sound waves to travel from their speakers to their ears - roughly 1ms per foot between the speakers and the user.

Because we tested for audio latency first, the player should always be able to close their eyes and play by ear without any problems, even if the video is a little bit off; but for hardcore gamers, it's nice to allow them to fine-tune things. For that, I like to have a manual adjustment window where I show a metronome or a flash (adjusted by the video latency setting) while music is playing, and let the user manually tweak their video latency setting up and down 1ms at a time until the metronome tick is perfectly in sync with the audio.

Sorry, I know I'm rambling at this point, and I kind of get the feeling that I went way more technical than you were expecting. Just one more thing I wanted to mention. In most environments, you will get a much more accurate reading of a user's input if you take the input reading inside of a listener, rather than checking key states in your main game loop. For example, this:

    keyPressedListener() {
        keyDownTime = getTimer();
    }

...is much more accurate than this:

    everyFrame() {
        if(keyIsDown) {
            keyDownTime = getTimer();
        }
    }

Again, this is probably environment-specific, but in the environments I've worked in, event listeners fire near-instantly, compared to frame loops which only process at around 60FPS or so.",0,1354141358,,0,1354168298,1,c78aawd,t3_13y26t,t1_c78aawd,t3_13y26t,,1430526451,383,False,gamedev,t5_2qi0a,383

True,philman53,,,"I upvoted you because I do find it a relevant question. However, it must be noted that Asians were never enslaved en masse, like blacks and natives were. Those latter two populations have the highest rates of incarceration, commit the highest rates of crime, etc. I would argue that this is because the societies they lived in were torn apart - the culture which informed their behavior was removed, and the white western culture was withheld, whether intentionally or through neglect, leaving a cultural, intellectual, and social vacuum that only naturally and logically was filled by crime and vice.

White America's response, rather than undertaking the tremendous cultural and social changes that would need to happen in order to reverse these trends, instead simply continued judging these people by the rubric of white culture, white ideals of law and order. Therefore, disproportionate numbers of blacks and natives were incarcerated or received the death penalty, which caused a tremendous amount of collateral social damage. A man serving life in prison cannot be a good mentor to his son, who then grows up predisposed to also turn to crime; the recognition of the disparate treatment of their fellows led these communities to turn inward, creating an ""us vs. them"" mentality that leads to violence against police, police brutality against racial minorities, and an insular population that sees incarceration as a badge of honor, a sort of righteous martyrdom imposed on them by the white oppressors; felony convictions prevent ex-cons from getting employment in environments where the pay is high enough to keep them from returning to crime for profit, or else in places where a significant proportion of their coworkers are not also ex-felons; the treatment of minority juveniles disciplines behavioral issues by juvenile detention rather than rehabilitation, which only takes away opportunity, thus further continuing the cycle. It is a nasty, ugly truth. 

It is logically fallacious to state that ""if I were a black person, or a native American, I would go to school and get a job and do everything I could to break the cycle and make life better for myself and for society."" No, you wouldn't - unless ""you"" means all your memories, your education, your connections, the skills you acquired through genetics or happenstance. If you were someone else, you would not have these assets, only those skills and memories and abilities available to them, and you would undoubtedly make the same choices, the same mistakes. A Chinese-American, raised by parents with Confucian values of hard work, study, and industry, preserved by generations of ethnic self-identity, insular communities such as Chinatowns, strong family connections, no history of slavery or genocide (the obvious exception being Japanese internment camps during WWII, but let's stick with Chinese-Americans for the sake of the argument), and no other cultural destruction, will OF COURSE do better in modern America than a black kid who was born to a crack-smoking homeless woman in inner-city Atlanta. What options does that kid have?

I say all this as a white American who is really and sincerely trying to simultaneously recognize the challenges faced by racial minorities in my country while also not veering into the ditch of condescension or presumptuous ""white guilt."" It's a hard thing to do; but my hope is that maybe I can help others like me become aware that there is a problem in the United States, and especially in my beloved South, and that we all have a responsibility to help each other, and not to jump to judgment or logically fallacious statements.",0,1354142788,,0,False,1,c78apvp,t3_13xyb7,t1_c78apvp,t1_c789etf,,1430526645,219,False,TrueReddit,t5_2qyt6,219

I happen to have a very common hispanic name, also I served in the Marines who on two different occasions lost personal information of mine to include my social security number. The state of Florida was able to pull $25K out of my personal bank account with only my very common last name and social. It was for someone trying to collect way past due child support. Neither Florida Child Support Collections or Bank of America bothered to check the first or middle name on the account. Much less the birthday, residence, or any other personal information. This all happened with out any notification. All the sudden I had nothing in my account, and it was up to me to figure out how to live for the next 3 months while BOA and Florida unfucked my shit.

True,Noltonn,,,"Although crudely worded, to a certain extent, I agree with you. Keeping in mind, this is coming from a person who has heavily abused alcohol and is addicted to his nicotine.

When you start with something like this, you *know* it can drag you down to addiction. Everyone does. Trust me, there is always a point for people like me that they think ""I'm slipping"". Yes, overall, it's a gradual process to get addicted. But when you take meth for the 2nd time in a week for the first time, or maybe the third, those words will go through your head. And what you do then, is your own conscious decision. When I bought my first pack I knew the risk. When I noticed I was losing my steady hand if I hadn't had a smoke for half a day, I knew my point was there. Either I could stop, or go on. I went on, and am still going. When I bought my second bottle of vodka in a week, planning to have a glass in the morning to help my morning classes, I knew where I was going. And I went on. Every sip and smoke I had the days after that, were my choice to slip further. They were all my choice, my choice to continue, and not to stop, even though I could've. And I'm letting no one take away the fact that it was my choice. I blame my faults on no one but myself. Not the liquor store, the grocery store, my upbringing, the people who brought me the pain I wanted to go away, or some form of God. And anything I did after this was my responsibility for *letting* myself slip.

There is no one that will take that away from me. I refuse to make excuses like ""It was an addiction, I couldn't help it!""

I think getting an addiction is a choice. I firmly believe this. Maybe you'll want out later, but in the end, there's no one to blame but yourself for getting there. 

The sole reason I stopped drinking was that I realized I was hurting myself more than it was worth. I lost the balance of a functioning addict, and I purely started living drink to drink. I was hurting myself, and the people around me, and *I* decided to quit. Another thing no one will ever take away from me.

Please don't pity addicts. I give money to bums on the street, while knowing they'll turn around and spend it on drugs, because cutting them off won't help them. They need to make the decision to get clean. And if they never want to get clean, I hope they die in their fix, happily burning the pain away from their souls, in a happier world than I am in. I think this is more humane than dieing from a lack of your fix. 

These are people, and they deserve respect like the rest of us, and we should not pity them for the choices they made themselves. Help them if they ask to get out, but don't pity them if they don't want to.

Sorry for going off on a tangent. It's 3AM and I can't sleep because usually I would be passed out on my couch by now with an empty bottle in my hand.

What we've got here is dual 2.4GHz SB-E Xeon E5-2609's on an Asus dual-CPU motherboard with 32GB (16GB per CPU) of quad-channel DDR3-1333 ECC unbuffered memory. Storage is provided by two 1TB Western Digital RE4 enterprise drives to be used in RAID1 for redundancy. The 300GB 10,000RPM VelociRaptors are to be put in RAID0 for 600GB of fast and *reliable* scratch space for your creative suite apps. SSDs are ill-suited to this as the constant write cycles will wear out the NAND chips.

A PNY Quadro 400 card gives you 48 CUDA cores to accelerate multiple CS tasks, along with NVidia's Quadro drivers and support. It may seem like a dinky little card, but the drivers do infact make all the difference. 

Power is provided by an 80 PLUS Platinum certified Rosewill Tachyon 750W that's designed to output 750W continuously at 50C, which is perfect for a server environment. It's also properly equipped with the dual EPS12V connectors required to power both CPUs.

Case is a 4U Rackmount, as it turned out to be the best value in fitting the CEB EEB-size dual CPU board. Comes with 4 80mm fans blowing front to back for adequate cooling. Consider picking up two extra 120mm fans to mount on the front mounts for even better airflow.

True,vlotyg,green,,"Really? Are you fucking serious? Okay then. 

&gt;You're tall, hot, blonde, great figure. Nice rack, too, since this is imaginary. You're a just-graduated university student, starting out at some firm so you can build your way to the top. You've been in this job a couple of weeks. 
&gt;
&gt;You like coffee. Trim flat white with one sugar please, as always, the same every day. You go to a new cafe this morning, because you parked on a different street. Guy behind the counter is at least twenty years older than you, he gives you a smile, he waves your fee. 
&gt;
&gt;It's awkward. You're making your own money now, you don't need shit bought for you. You know it's cause of your legs, your long hair. But how can you refuse? It's rude, is it not, to say no? So you smile politely and go to sit down, picking up the paper on the way. 
&gt;
&gt;The coffee is brought over, and he gives you another grin. It's creepy, and you're uncomfortable from the way he stares. His eyes look you up and down, all around, and there's a little chuckle. But you don't say anything - he gave you a free coffee, didn't you? It's a favour, isn't it? 
&gt;
&gt;You leave earlier than usual, too bothered by the way he looks at you. You go to work, settle in at your desk, and get out the proposal you've been working on for weeks. It's good. You know it's good. It's solid and well thought out and perfectly exhibits that you've paid attention throughout your degree and throughout your countless internships. 
&gt;
&gt;Once the senior partner meeting is over, you take a deep breath. You're ready to approach a man you haven't spoken to before, someone who's not involved in staff management at all. 
&gt;
&gt;You stride over and say hi. He looks you up and down, smiles kindly, and asks what you want. Asks if you're looking for Rita, the secretary. You frown, and realise he thinks you're an office junior and not aiming for his job. You say that you've got a proposal for him, and he peers at you carefully. He takes you into his office, and you know it's because of the way your hips move. But that's okay, a leg up now and then is good, right? 
&gt;
&gt;You demonstrate your proposal, aware that his eyes follow your waist and not your pages; aware that he's only half listening and altogether too focused on your lips. You finish, take a deep breath. He thinks for a bit. 
&gt;
&gt;'Nice work, sweetie,' he says. You freeze up. 'You can go now.' Like you're nothing more than a child. He's not talking to you at his level, he's talking down - the worst thing in the world to you. 
&gt;
&gt;You're so embarrassed. So embarrassed that you tried and you proved yourself and it's still not enough because no one can get past the healthy flush on your cheeks and the way your eyelashes meet them in a sweeping motion every time you blink. You fume all day, and cringe when watch him shake hands with another employee at the same level as you. Equals. From the moment you met him, you've been a girl - not a woman, you're too pretty for that - but a girl. 
&gt; 
&gt;You leave at the end of the day feeling dejected, and go to the bar to meet a couple of male friends. 
&gt;
&gt;A glass of wine later and you feel a little better. Your friends are on form, making you laugh as usual. A few minutes later, you get a drink brought over, paid for by the man-sitting-at-the-end-of-the-bar. You sigh. It's kind of him, and it would be rude to reject, but you don't want to give the wrong idea. You shrug and drink it, smiling nicely but slightly awkwardly, hoping he doesn't think you're keen. 
&gt;
&gt;You start to leave around ten o'clock. You've got work tomorrow, after all. As you gather your things and head to the door the man who gave you a drink comes over. He's frowning slightly, and quite drunk. He asks if you enjoyed your drink, and you affirm. You start to leave, he's standing uncomfortably close. 
&gt;
&gt;He doesn't let you. He asks you where you're going. You explain that you want to go home. He growls. 'But the drink. I gave you a drink.' It dawns on you. He doesn't care that you're tired, all he cares about is that he gave you a drink. You're obliged, now, to be thankful. To give him what he wants. Because he gave you a drink. Like the coffee, it's entitlement. 
&gt;
&gt;It's the assumption that just because you're gorgeous you're available. As though your beauty makes you an object. As though, like the 'asking for it' rape rhetoric, your genetic makeup means you're allowed to be stared at. Drooled after. Used. Who cares that you have a brain under there? That you've worked hard? That you've written a novel, that you're a talented musician, that you're exceptional at netball, that you're a multidimensional creature with hopes and dreams that don't stop at the colour of your hair and the light in your eyes? 
&gt;
&gt;You have to work twice as hard. You have to be twice as cold. You have to be ruthless and standoffish because the slightest nicety means you'll never be more than sweet little girl. You don't get to be kind to people, even though you're genuine at heart; because that's not seen as ambitious. Your personality isn't allowed to enhance your appearance, like normal people, because then you appearance is all that matters. All that anyone sees.

You are not unattractive, you a human being and fantastic by extension, do not put yourself down it will only make things harder. 

Some people who have severe facial deformaties or open festering wounds are (externally) unattractive, but I doubt very much you would have described yourself as 'fairly unattractive' if that were the case. So we can assume that you have nothing blazingly wrong with you, you just have low self esteem and don't live up to the unattainable high standard that advertising sets for you whilst unfairly half a dozen of your acquaintances do. Let's assue you're somewhere between about 4 and 6.9 out of ten.

If you want to be 'attractive' you can, it's within your grasp, this is true of men and women. You can lose weight and gain muscle, there are roads to run on and you have willpower to be in control of what you eat, if you want to be 'attractive' then you have no insurmountable obstacles, only poor excuses. You have the greatest research assistant every created at the tips of your fingers, if you want to know what clothes would suit you best, just fucking google it. There's no excuse. If you want to know how to apply make up; google it and then do it. If you want to grow your hair, just stop cutting it because you're nervous and want a change. If you want blonde hair, dye it and stop dying it other colours because you think a change might help. 

This all comes with a parental warning. Being 'attractive' isn't and shouldn't be the end goal for anyone. It makes you no less valuable, what does that is your own self esteem and the time you spend alone thinking about how you're not worth anything. 

I just re-read your title, I think I over-reacted a lot and might end up deleting it. I'm sorry if I offended you, but I find it hard to see people put themselves down publicly because I can only imagine what they feel privately, and I don't know you but I can say with certainty that you will have thousands of invaluable assets to those around you, you being attractive (if you want that) is not out of your reach as long as you take action in favour of it.

True,Simultanagnosia,,,"In the final analysis of filter theory a consciousness absent a brain is also absent a self-awareness as the mechanisms for such are part of the brain. For example the *precuneus* is critical to the sense of spatial and temporal awareness. It integrates information from the vestibulocochlear nerve and various other sensory tracts. The Ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex has been demonstrated to play a critical role in self-interest. Patients with VMPFC damage apparently do not care whether they win or lose. Orbital Frontal Cortex injury causes an inability to imagine oneself in somebody else's shoes leading to all kinds of errors in moral decision making. The OFC contains the so-called ""mirror neurons"" that allow us to empathize. OFC damage is extremely common among the criminal population. Damage to the Nucleus Accumbens or Ventral Tegmentum causes all kinds of problems with learning and self-control. 

Self-consciousness appears to be the result of integrated information processing in the so-called *cortico-thalamic* complex which is a diffuse system consisting of billions of synaptic connections projecting all over the brain with no central nucleus.

All of this is sufficient to explain human decision-making and self-concept. Our sense of self can even be deconstructed introspectively. What exactly is it that we identify with? Philosophers and psychologists have asked this since time immemorial.

But mainly the concept of free-will is a violation of causal law which forms the basis of logic. All explanation invariably follows a pattern of causality, we say that one thing causes another, or that multiple things cause other things. Even if those answers are wrong or attempt to avoid causality they invariably wind up assuming causality in the explanation. If you sat down to write a thesis on the ""inner workings"" of free-will you would end up undermining your own thesis because the notion of free-will having a mechanisms undermines the entire concept of free-will.

You also encounter the homunculus error of using the very concept you are trying to explain as the explanation. You can't explain your decisions except by saying that you can't explain your decisions. It is inexplicable that you did so and only due to free-will. But note that the word *due* implies causal interaction. To say that a decision was *due* to your free-will means that the decision was *caused* by your free-will. That is how inescapable causality and explanation are. You cannot even say that you caused a decision or your free-will did without beginning to explain and invoke causality. If you say ""I went to the fridge to get a glass of juice because I was thirsty."" you are invoking a causal explanation for your behavior and not exercising any kind of free-will.  When you say ""I didn't see that other vehicle there because my mirror was maladjusted and I didn't realize it until I got on the road."" you are invoking a causal explanation for your behavior and not in any way relying on free-will.

It turns out people commit what is called the Fundamental Attribution Error in which they attribute their own success to their own doing and their failures to causal circumstances. Conversely they attribute other people's success to causal circumstances and their failures to their decisions. The following Table illustrates the discrepancy.

             |   Self    |    Other    |

Success  | Free-Will | Causality |

Failure    | Causality | Free-Will |

It seems that people's sense of being a free agent depends on the circumstances being convenient for them and when the circumstances are no longer convenient they make an appeal to causal circumstances.

I was once in an aquarium with some friends and we decided it would be cool to go scuba diving with a giant shark because hey, what could possibly go wrong?  Things were all fun and games until my buddy got his ankle chewed off.  I somehow managed to fend off the beast as we were helping each other onto a small platform floating in the middle of the tank.  We were shaken up, but otherwise in good shape considering.  

It was only when the shark popped its head out of the water and began talking to us that we realized we weren't in Kansas anymore.  And it wasn't just any old voice either; no, that would be too normal.  This particular shark spoke with the unmistakable charm of Roseanne Barr.  She was trying to apologize for her aggression, but we still didn't trust her. Attempting to kill and eat someone can do that to a relationship.

We were trying to get the aquarium staff to help us out of the tank when Roseanne decided to hoist herself up onto our little flotsam, and that was when the dream went from good to great.  Roseanne decided that if words could not sway us, she would have to party us into submission.  She immediately broke into dance and started busting moves that would make Michael Jackson blush.  We were all long past the point of asking questions, so we decided to just ride it out.  We started dancing with her, and soon our little platform was packed with partygoers.  There was mutual agreement that Roseanne was incredibly awesome.

As with every party, our impromptu celebration had to end eventually.  But by then I was a changed man.  I guess the wild gesticulations of her sharky anatomy had some mystical allure, because next thing I know I'm talking to Roseanne, awkwardly attempting the shark equivalent of hand holding.  We had grand plans, Roseanne and I.  I could be a marine biologist, I could get a job at the aquarium, we could be together forever.  People would despise our love, but we could get through anything with each other, species barriers be damned.

It was at this point that I woke up and spent a long few hours asking myself what I wanted out of life.

***The Great War: An Introductory Book List***

**Lead-Up and Causes**

- *The Guns of August* by Barbara W. Tuchman (1962): a marvelously accessible narrative history of the early days of the war.  It does a good job of situating the conflict within the waning era of the Empires, and its combination of solid research and exhilarating prose has more than accounted for the acclaim it has received.

- *The Proud Tower*, also by Tuchman (1966): gives an account of the world and its tenor in the years immediately prior to the war (1890-1914).  It's more of a collection of essays than a sustained narrative, but every last one of them is fascinating and useful.

- *The Origins of World War I* by Richard Hamilton and Holger Herwig (2003): a comprehensive analysis of the war's causes and early contours, presented from a thoroughly international perspective.  Makes as good a run at being the definitive treatment of this subject as any text has yet achieved.

- *The Marne: 1914*, also by Herwig (2011): an excellent account of the war's astounding opening battles.  Provides a sound, easily comprehensible description of why the war was not ""over by Christmas [of 1914]"", and for how the static system of trench warfare at last came to be.

- *Griff nach der Weltmacht*, by Fritz Fischer (1961): an essential -- though controversial -- work which describes the manner in which Germany instigated the war and asserts that her war aims were essentially predatory from the start.  The debate over this work is enormous, but Fischer's claims must be contended with by anyone who seriously hopes to understand what the war was about and how it is popularly perceived.

- *The Origins of the First World War: Diplomatic and Military Documents*, by Annika Mombauer, will come out in March of 2013.  There've been a number of similar volumes over the years (which can be consulted in the absence of this one), but if the advance buzz on hers is anything to go by it will easily eclipse them all.  In any event, this or something like it will provide a very useful background against which to view the developments of the summer and autumn of 1914.

- *The Lost History of 1914: Reconsidering the Year the Great War Began*, by Jack Beatty (2012): an unusual and interesting work tracking all of the massive social contours leading to the conflagration that followed.  It's also one of the few works devoted to this subject to offer a thoroughly in-depth account of the development of trench warfare on the Western Front without wallowing in the apparent futility and stupidity of it all.  As it was neither futile nor stupid, this is to be welcomed indeed.

**General Histories**

- *The First World War*, by John Keegan (1998): a fine single-volume introduction, and one of the most accessible.  Keegan was one of the best popular military historians going, and he was generally believed to be at the height of his game in this particular work.  It situates the war in the ""senseless tragedy"" school of cultural memory, but this is hardly a fringe position.  Still, very good.

- *The First World War*, by Hew Strachan (2004): offers a remarkably international view of the conflict, and in a compact single volume at that.  This was meant as a companion piece to the (also quite good) television documentary series of the same name which he oversaw.  Still, if you want more, look to his much larger *The First World War - Vol. I: To Arms* (2003) -- the first of a projected three volumes and absolutely staggering in its depth.  This first volume alone runs to 1250 pages.

- *The First World War: A Complete History*, by Martin Gilbert (2nd Ed. 2004):  The title is a bit of a lie, but this work from Winston Churchill's official biography is as lucid and sensitive as anything else he's written.  Gilbert takes great pains to situate the operations described within the context of their human cost -- not everyone has always found this to be a satisfying tactic when it comes to the critical distance of the scholar, but it's a decision for which good arguments can be made.

**Famous General Histories**

These volumes have become subjects of study in their own right, but are still well worth reading for the student determined to tackle this conflict in depth:

- *The World Crisis, 1911-1918*, by Winston Churchill (1923-31): a work in 6 volumes that contentiously holds the title of the ""most comprehensive"" history of the war.  A modern abridgment (clocking in at around 850 pages) is readily available, and well worth a look.  There are significant debates within WWI historiography about Churchill's judgments and biases, so it would be worth looking into them as well before taking everything within the book at face value.  I'll have some books that would help with this in the *Debates* section below.

- *Nelson's History of the War*, by John Buchan (1914-1919): a twenty-four-volume series offering a thoroughly lucid, readable account of the war in an international context.  Anyone reading it must always keep in mind that most of its volumes were written without knowing what would happen next -- this lends the work a striking degree of immediacy, but also harms its ability to contextualize events in the light of things that would happen later.

- *A History of the Great War, 1914-1918*, by C.R.M.F. Crutwell (1934): has become the subject of historical inquiry in its own right, and the gigantic Strachan volumes I noted above were commissioned as a replacement for it.  Crutwell is largely well-regarded as an historian, but it would be hard to call the work an exciting one.

- The *History of the Great War Based on Official Documents* (finally completed in 1948) is the official British history of the war as compiled by Sir James Edmonds with the help of Cyril Falls, F.J. Moberly and others.  It runs to twenty-nine volumes and is predicated upon the conveyance of straightforward information rather than any kind of satisfying narrative.

**The British**

- *Tommy: The British Soldier on the Western Front, 1914-1918*, by Richard Holmes (2004): a work I cannot recommend too highly or too often.  It is thick, ferociously well-sourced, entertaining and comprehensive.  Holmes was one of the best we had until his untimely death in 2011, and *Tommy* finds him firing on all cylinders.

- *Battle Tactics of the Western Front: The British Army's Art of Attack, 1916-1918*, by Paddy Griffith (1996): one of the more provocative and influential texts in the ""learning curve"" movement, which maintains that the British army experienced a sharp uptick in the quality of its tactics thanks to the lessons learned on the Somme.  Griffith is a somewhat irascible figure well known in the table-top war-gaming world, but this remains an essential work.

- *The British Army on the Western Front 1916*, by Bruce I. Gudmundsson (2007): One of the excellent *Osprey Battle Orders* series, this volume offers a thorough, table-heavy breakdown of the British infantry in the field at the height of the war.  

**The French**

- *Pyrrhic Victory: French Strategy and Operations in the Great War*, by Robert A. Doughty (2008, I think): Offers a solid, comprehensive account of France's military aims, strategies and achievements.  Works of this sort are essential to correcting the general perception of the war, which tends to diminish or even forget the massive role the French played on the Western Front -- it wasn't just Tommy versus Fritz.  Anyway, this volume gives a good overview of the ""spirit of the offensive,"" the decisions that lay behind it, and the ways in which the French attempted to adapt to the realities of the field.

- *France and the Great War, 1914-1918*, by Smith, Audoin-Rouzeau and Becker (2003): From the Cambridge *New Approaches to European History* series, this volume provides an overview of France's involvement in the war that's just as much cultural and political as military -- a welcome breadth.  I credit /u/CrossyNZ with bringing it to my attention, and thank him for the tip.

- *The Price of Glory: Verdun 1916*, by Alistair Horne (1962): Likely the most famous engagement with the slaughterhouse that was Verdun, Horne's work offers a combination clarity, sympathy and rigour.  The second of the two can occlude the others in some parts, unfortunately, but it is understandably hard to write about such events in a key other than that of sorrow.  A very significant work all the same.

**The Germans**

- *The First World War: Germany and Austria-Hungary, 1914-1918*, by Holger Herwig (1996): arguably *the* modern text on the subject of how the Central Powers conducted their end of the war and what the cultural impact of it upon them was.  A sometimes heartbreaking work, but all the better for it.

- *Through German Eyes: The British &amp; The Somme, 1916*, by Christopher Duffy (2006): a remarkable and necessary work that offers a recontextualization of the Somme Offensive -- so often viewed as a thoroughly British tragedy -- from the perspective of those troops against whom wave after wave of Englishmen advanced in the summer and fall of 1916.  Seeing this event from the other side paints a somewhat different view of it than is typically enjoyed, and I cannot recommend it highly enough.

- *The Eastern Front: 1914 - 1917*, by Norman Stone (1975): a very readable account of the German army's efforts against its Russian counterpart.  It has also benefited from a recent republication by Penguin, and as such is very readily available.

**The Canadians** 

I have to get the oar in for my own people here! 

- *At the Sharp End: 1914-1916* (2007) and *Shock Troops: 1917-1918* (2008), both by Tim Cook: jointly offer a comprehensive and fascinating account of what it meant for this country to become involved in such a conflict, both domestically and in the field.  These have been winning lots of awards up here, and deservedly so.

- *The Madman and the Butcher*, also by Cook (2010): covers the often quite tense relationship between Sir Sam Hughes (the Canadian Minister of Militia) and Sir Arthur Currie (CIC of the Canadian Corps in France and Flanders).  

- *Propaganda and Censorship During Canada's Great War*, by Jeffrey Keshen (1996): has a rather specific focus, as the title suggests, but goes into a great deal of detail about the efforts that were made (both at home and abroad) to leverage a nascent ""Canadian identity"" in the bid to encourage greater recruitment and sway public opinion.  An excellent work, and pretty much *the* book on its particular subject.  I'll have more to say on WWI propaganda in general in a section below.

- *Death So Noble: Memory, Meaning and the First World War*, by Jonathan Vance (1999): examines in a specifically Canadian context the many ways in which the war is now remembered.  Vance is one of the best cultural historians going, at the moment, and this work has gained a substantial reputation Canadian historical circles.

- *Baptism of Fire: The Second Battle of Ypres and the Forging of Canada, April 1915*, by Nathan M. Greenfield (2007): examines the manner in which this nation is purported to have ""come of age"" during the first gas attack on the Western Front.  Greenfield also has a lot to say about subsequent developments, myth-making and national pride.

**Some Specific Engagements**

- Herwig's work on the Battle of the Marne was already mentioned above, as has Greenfield's on Second Ypres.

- *Loos 1915: The Unwanted Battle*, by Gordon Corrigan (2005): A good single-volume account of the Battle of Loos.  Something of a prelude to the Somme Offensive of the following year, it is most popularly remembered now (which says a lot, and I don't know if anything good) as the battle that killed Rudyard Kipling's son.

- *Bloody Victory: The Sacrifice on the Somme*, by William Philpott (2009): commendably combines absurd expansiveness with a novel thesis.  A highly necessary (and welcome) antidote to the otherwise all-prevailing ""absolute tragedy thesis"" that seems to mark the rest of the major writings on this campaign.

With regard to the Ludendorff Offensive in the Spring of 1918:

- *The Kaiser's Battle: 21 March 1918 - The First Day of the German Spring Offensive*, by Martin Middlebrook (1983): Middlebrook has a penchant for taking a single day and using it as the basis for a broader historical inquiry.  Just as he did with the First Day on the Somme, so has done in this volume; it focuses primarily on the one day, but has frequent recourse to the campaign as a whole.

- *To Win a War: 1918, the Year of Victory*, by John Terraine (1978): remains a classic account of the war's final year, and has much to say about the circumstances that caused the Spring Offensive to fail and the Hundred Days Offensive to succeed.

- *The German 1918 Offensives. A Case Study in the Operational Level of War*, by David Zabecki (2006): admirably focused but without sacrificing breadth.  Much like the Osprey volume about the British that I mentioned above, this is where you go for information without narrative.

**Conscientious Objectors and Pacifists**

- *To End All Wars*, by Adam Hochschild (2011): an admirable attempt to integrate the story of objectors, resisters, pacifists and the like into the already well-established tableau of the war's history.  It is a less than objective work, to put it mildly -- the tone is often one of outrage rather than dispassionate provision of facts.  Still, the war seems to bring this out in people in a way that others do not, so this is scarcely a surprising feature.  It's still a good start, though; broadly focused on Great Britain and British colonies.

- *Conscience: Two Soldiers, Two Pacifists, One Family*, by Louisa Thomas (2011): examines the tensions involved in non-combatant decisions on the American home front, with particular focus upon her great grandfather, Norman Thomas, who refused to fight at a time when two of his brothers had chosen otherwise.  More of a meditation than an outright history book, but still quite interesting.

- *The Beauty and the Sorrow*, by Peter Englund (2011): a fascinating narrative history that contains about twenty interwoven accounts of the war from a variety of perspectives, many of them on the home front.  It's more determinedly international than the other two books I've mentioned, and is focused on a variety of different cases (not all of them strictly relevant to the title heading above).

**Interesting, Quirky Case Studies**

It's a coincidence (I think!) that both of the following are set within a naval context, but there it is:

- *Mimi and Toutou Go Forth*, by Giles Foden (2004): tells the absolutely insane story of the Battle of Lake Tanganyika in Central Africa, 1915.  A gang of British eccentrics dragged two boats through the jungle to do battle with the German *Graf von Gotzen*, and a more motley band of people has seldom been assembled.  Geoffrey Spicer-Simson, their commander, is the kind of man who makes one feel intensely inadequate.

- *The Wolf*, by Richard Guillatt and Peter Hohnen (2005): tells the remarkable tale of how a state-of-the-art German warship was disguised as a merchant freighter and then taken around the world in a multi-year campaign of piracy and destruction that was nevertheless marked by the absolute chivalrous gallantry of its captain and crew.  The *Wolf* was forced to survive only on what it could capture from other ships, and by the time it returned to Kiel it carried over 400 passengers from 25 different countries, the bulk of whom had become great friends with one another and with their courteous German captors.

**Propaganda**

I already mentioned Jeffrey Keshen's volume above, which covers the Canadian context, but there's a lot more out there.  The following is just a taste:

- *Falsehood in War-Time*, by Arthur Ponsonby (1928): A hugely influential volume outlining what Ponsonby believed to be the pernicious efforts of various actors (both state-based and otherwise) to trick the public into the war.  Ponsonby was a socialist and pacifist, and had what is to my mind a somewhat extravagant view of the public's peace-loving innocence.  In any event, the book is a seriously important one, as it helped cement (not entirely correctly) the idea among the public that tales of German atrocity France and Belgium were wholly invented, thus helping to inoculate them against similar claims focusing on the Nazis in the 1930s and onwards -- an unfortunate consequence indeed. 

- *Propaganda Techniques in the World War*, by Harold Lasswell (1927): Another influential volume, this time from a leading American scholar of ""behavioralism"" and public relations.  He and Edward L. Bernays (*Propaganda*, 1928) offer roughly contemporaneous (though very differently focused) theorizations of propaganda and its practice, and the two volumes can be read usefully as companion pieces.  

- *The Great War of Words: British, American, and Canadian Propaganda and Fiction, 1914-1933*, by Peter Buitenhuis (1987): currently the standard work on official propaganda operations among the English-speaking powers during the war.  Standard, anyway, but not as good as it could be, perhaps; even favourable reviews note its arch, moralizing tone and the manner in which it frequently substitutes moral judgment for mere critical description.  I include it for its significance, but hope very much that a better book on this subject will come along soon -- and that mine will be it ;-)

- *British Propaganda During the First World War 1914-18*, by Michael Sanders and Philip M. Taylor (1982): A fine companion piece to the one above, but focused far more on the operational structure of the various British propaganda organizations than upon their actual creative output.  Both works provide indispensable accounts of the inner workings of the War Propaganda Bureau at Wellington House, anyway, and the reader who has packed away both volumes will be well-equipped indeed.

- *How We Advertised America*, by George Creel (1920): A frank and enthusiastic memoir of the American Committee for Public Information's propaganda operations during the Great War as presented by the man who ran the show.  Modern readers should welcome the opportunity to read about propaganda, from the perspective of a delighted propagandist, as written in a pre-Goebbels age.  This is the narrative version, anyway; those looking for a massive collection of data should instead consult the lengthy post-war report Creel prepared for his superiors (1919).

- *Secrets of Crewe House: The Story of a Famous Campaign*, by Sir Campbell Stuart (1920): A sort of corresponding number to the Creel volume above, but this time focused upon the efforts of Lord Northcliffe's staff at Crewe House, who produced reams of propaganda intended for distribution amongst the enemy powers.  You can tell the tone of the work by its title, I think -- a very valuable and interesting piece.

- *A Terrible Beauty: British Artists in the First World War*, by Paul Gough (2010): A solid and comprehensive overview of the work being done by the official war artists in Britain during the war.  Lavishly illustrated, and has a lot to say on related subjects as well.

- *A Call to Arms: Propaganda, Public Opinion, and Newspapers in the Great War*, ed. by Troy R. E. Paddock (2004): A remarkable little volume that offers a survey of the press responses to the war's outbreak in Britain, France, Russia, Germany and Austria Hungary.  This kind of cross-cultural analysis is hard to come by in a field that so values specialization, so it's certainly worth checking out.

**Debates**

There are, I would say, five major ongoing historiographical debates.

1. Incompetence vs. a ""learning curve""
2. The ""justice"" of sentences of execution for certain soldiers
3. German guilt and the Fischer school
4. Westerners vs. the resterners: which front was the most essential?
5. Cultural memory vs. operational history

I do not find myself well-equipped to discuss the first four at the moment, and I draw attention them now primarily to deflect objections that I'm not acknowledging their importance.  Still, I also believe that the fifth debate generally encompasses the preceding four, and it's on that subject that I hope to expand.

The major tension in the field at present, from my point of view, is between those who hold to the narrative of futility and cultural rupture that was so dominant in the 1960s and those who have tried to step back from such rhetoric.  In its place, a newer wave of scholars have tried to offer a more measured view of the war as, well, *a war* -- not a break in history, or a moment of psychic trauma, or a fundamentally ironic enterprise, or a uniquely awful nightmare, or whatever other such label one might wish to apply.  There is surely a middle ground to be found, and some of the ""revisionists"" (who wear the label proudly, in some cases) perhaps go a bit far in the other direction.  I will admit at once that I find myself more sympathetic with the revisionist camp, but there are merits to the prevailing account as well.

In any event:

- *Forgotten Victory: The First World War, Myths and Realities*, by Gary Sheffield (2002): Offers a welcome but measured rejoinder to the sort of narratives I noted above, albeit from a primarily operational standpoint.  Sheffield is a first-rate historian, and his recent biography of Sir Douglas Haig (*The Chief*, 2011) would also have appeared on this list if I had had the time or inclination to do the twelve-entry section that Sir Douglas warrants.  Maybe I'll whip up a post about him in his own right later, but for now... well, look above.

- *The Great War: Myth and Memory*, by Dan Todman (2005): A fine companion piece to Sheffield's, in that it shares many of the same concerns while being willing to work along cultural as well as operational lines in advancing arguments.  Todman has done a lot of excellent work on how representations of the war in creative media (see *Blackadder*, *Oh What a Lovely War*, *The Monocled Mutineer* and so on) have shaped the public's ""memory"" of the war itself, and a lot of this work is very much on display here.

- *Mud, Blood and Poppycock*, by Gordon Corrigan (2003): An irascible volume with a title and packaging that are more annoyingly forthright than its contents necessarily warrant (the cover boasts in a blurb that it will ""change everything you thought you knew about the Great War"", or something to that effect, alas).  Still, this is probably the best single-volume introduction to the revisionist school currently on the market, and is presented with an unabashedly operational bias: Corrigan is tired of poems and movies and novels, and doesn't care who knows it.  Even speaking as an English professor, I can't say I entirely blame him.

- *The First World War and British Military History*, edited by Brian Bond (1991): A really, *really* good collection of essays by some of the best names in the field.  It focuses primarily upon the difficult tensions that arise between operational, cultural, memory- and personality-based understandings of the war, and -- unlike some of the works in this line -- attempts to resolve them peaceably.  The first three chapters are especially amazing for the evaluation they offer of the early attempts to plot the war's history, taking for its subject many of the works I noted so far above in the ""famous histories"" section as well as as those of now-lesser-known historians like John Fortescue and even Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.

- *The Unquiet Western Front: Britain's Role in Literature and History*, by Brian Bond (2002): Based on a series of lectures, this slender volume offers a sort of meditation on much of what has already been described in this section above.  Bond pays specific attention to the literary and cinematic spheres, and has some considerably valuable things to say.  In fact:

- *Survivors of a Kind: Memoirs of the Western Front*, by Brian Bond (2007): A very welcome volume.  Bond evaluates the most popular war memoirs (such as those of Siegfried Sassoon, Robert Graves, Erich Maria Remarque, and Ernst Jünger) from a primarily military-historical standpoint, which is a more novel approach than one might think.  This work is especially valuable in that he goes somewhat beyond the usual canon and brings in lesser-known memoirs, such as those of A.O. Pollard and John Reith, which are marked by a more positive engagement with the war than that of their contemporaries.

I must close by acknowledging some of the prevailing works in support (or enactment) of the cultural memory camp. 

- *The Great War and Modern Memory*, by Paul Fussell (1975): the *ne plus ultra* of this school; I have much more to say about it [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/12zp30/what_work_has_done_the_most_damage_to_your_field/c6zjwba).

- *A War Imagined: The First World War and English Culture*, by Samuel Hynes (1991): A very important literary-critical evaluation of the war not only as seen through literature, but of the war *as* literature.  Hynes acknowledges that the general conception of the war as a futile, uniquely terrible, cultural-rifting, etc. enterprise is a myth, but continues to assert the value of that myth over whatever may have really happened from time to time.  Very well-written, but possibly infuriating -- I like it all the same.

- *Rites of Spring: The Great War and the Birth of the Modern Age*, by Modris Eksteins (2000): Views the war in terms of aesthetic Modernism -- the war is its crux, cause, and almost pre-emptive culmination.  I have never found a book simultaneously so interesting, so predictable, and so annoying, but it is absolutely worth reading.

- The works of Jay Winter are essential if one wishes to examine the war from an American cultural-memory perspective, but I've run out of steam.  Will edit them in later

True,scrumptiouscakes,gluck,,"This is a question which also interests me, particularly because I am on the bipolar spectrum myself. I thought I would try to answer this question at length, because I think what you're asking is actually very complicated.

&gt; If he'd grown up today and had been treated for his (what I can only presume was) bipolar disorder would he have had the spurts of manic creativity that produced Carnival, Kinderschezen and all other amazing works?

I'd say that it would depend on the nature of the treatment, and also on what treatment he chose to accept. While there is a worrying trend for over-medication in certain quarters, there have also been moves in recent years towards offering greater choice of treatment and more power for patients. Lithium, which is one of the most commonly used treatments for bipolar disorder, *can* have a dulling effect on someone's creative faculties. But again, it's quite common now for people to try several kinds of medication, or a combination of different medications depending on the fluctuations of their mood. So not all treatment necessarily precludes the possibility of creative activity. Anti-depressants (particularly things like SSRIs) can, if taken at the wrong time, actually *heighten* manic states. My own experience with this kind of medication was that it actually made it *easier* to focus on sustained creative activity. Some people self-medicate in various ways. There are also talking therapies and things like CBT which *can* be effective in certain circumstances, even for people who have gone beyond mania into psychotic states. They can also be as effective as conventional medication. So depending on the particular treatment path followed by our speculative reincarnated Schumann (or Schubert, or Beethoven, [any number of other people, possibly](http://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/07/arts/classical-music-though-this-were-madness-was-there-yet-method-in-t.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm)), the creative outcomes could be wildly different.

But the other part of the question is perhaps more important:

&gt; would he have had the spurts of manic creativity **that produced** Carnival, Kinderschezen and all other amazing works? *(my emphasis)*

That seems to imply a belief that mania and creativity are inextricably linked. I would say that this is only partly true - yes, mania can lead to feelings of energy, inspiration, poetic leaps between ideas, and so on, but it doesn't mean that works produced *during* a manic episode are necessarily energetic, inspired, or poetic. Indeed, when viewed in the cold light of day, they often make very little sense. For me, the real creative process happens *after* the cycle of mania and depression has finished, or has at least stabilised or evened out. Yes, those extremes of experience are extremely useful to draw upon afterwards, but for me, it was always after the event. Mania and depression are extremely disruptive and are generally not conducive to concentrated creative effort. I'm sure other people will disagree, but that was my experience. I remember another user on this subreddit commenting that Schumann believed that Romanticism was all about composing something in one solid burst of creativity, and not revising it at a later date - I don't know how much truth there is to that statement because I'm not a Schumann expert, but it could be taken as evidence that his works were, as you suggest, **produced** by mania. But I would offer an alternative interpretation, if this was in fact the way that he composed. I think he might have been trying, while composing in a lucid state, to *recreate* the experience of mania. I feel the same way about Beethoven, but in his case, it's more that he's trying to recreate the experience of mania *in performance*, in the physical act of making music. I think it was Christian Thielemann who observed that there's something *forced* about all the ""Freude"" in the 9th Symphony - that struck a chord (pardon the pun) with me, because I feel like that work is all about *enacting* the joy of mania, rather than just representing it. It's perhaps not coincidental that bipolar can trigger feelings of extreme religiosity - ""Ahnest du den Schöpfer, Welt?"", hypersexuality - ""Seid umschlungen, Millionen! Diesen Kuß der ganzen Welt!"", disinhibition and risk-taking - ""Was die Mode streng geteilt; Alle Menschen werden Brüder"", and substance abuse - ""Wir betreten feuertrunken"". 

&gt; I mean, that's the sort of tragedy of mental illness and the arts: While it makes the artist suffer, it also inspires terrific art.

I think we have to be a little careful here. Again, I'd say that yes, suffering can be inspiring, but only afterwards, and not while it's happening. Depression is incredibly debilitating - most of the time you don't even want to get out of bed, never mind doing something creative. Although Beethoven was actually talking about a physical illness in this case, I think the Heiliger Dankgesang is a good example of this - it's a A **Convalescent's** Holy Song - he's *recovering* from the illness, rather than writing while it's still happening. Also, we have to be cautious about making a link between creativity and mental illness more generally, firstly because it can make those people with mental illnesses but who *do not* benefit from extra creativity feel lacking, and secondly, on a related note, because the evidence linking them is not conclusive or universal, in spite of [media reports](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-19959565), or [things that are posted on reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/Foodforthought/comments/11kj2e/creativity_closely_entwined_with_mental_illness/). If it is shown that such a relationship *does* exist, I think we still need to be cautious, partly for the reasons I've already talked about, but also because I think the relationship can be much more nuanced than is immediately obvious. Do people with mental illnesses create just because they *feel* more creative than other people? Or is it that they are somehow biologically predisposed towards creativity? Or do they create as a therapeutic outlet, because it helps them to cope with their condition? Or do they create because it is the only effective means of communicating their experiences to the ""neurotypical"" world? Is there a social/cultural element at work? Do discussions like this one, and stories about the illnesses of artists inspire people to follow in their footsteps? I think there are many different things at work here, and they're often conflated as if they were all the same. 

&gt; While it makes the artist suffer, it also inspires terrific art.

There's also the question of whether anyone has the *right* to treat art as a means of vicariously exploring other people's suffering and illness, but that's a whole other discussion.

**TL;DR** - The relationship between creativity and mental illness is very complex and often very personal

EDIT:  Whoa, thanks for the gold!  I'm editing to throw on basic answers to a few repeated questions so people can see them on the top comment and they don't get lost. Maybe someone can elaborate more.

1) Isn't it too hot to have ice??  A:  An interesting thing about Mercury is the ~~absence of an atmosphere~~ presence of a very very thin atmosphere (thanks to heroicdanger for the correction).  This means that it is very hot in the sun and very cold at night or in the shade. The equator is the hottest, while the poles are the coolest. The ice was found in craters on the poles in areas that are always in shade.

2) Does ""organic"" mean living?   A: No. Organic only means the compounds contain carbon. Think of it like sugar sitting there. It contains carbon atoms, but it is definitely not alive. BUT this leads them to conclude that organic compounds are prevalent in meteorites and maybe the universe... some think this is how life on earth started..... organic compounds and water.

Basically what they are saying is that meteorites with organic compounds and ice hit and filled some old craters. Then the sun evaporated all ice that was not in shade. The mixed organic compounds are now sitting on top of some of the ice. There is no atmosphere so it would be very hard for anything (so far as we know) to live there.

Whilst most simpler elements go on to create heavier elements, oxygen and carbon are considered 'waste products' in the nucleosynthetic process and so aren't really 'used up' as much.

True,JunkmanJim,,,"I am not going to sugarcoat or filter my feedback so be warned, this isn't personal and my goal is that you understand how to better sell on Ebay. This advices comes from selling all kinds of crap on Ebay for a living for many years.

The descriptions look fine and generally don't matter unless there are issues with the item that need clarification. The problem is stuff you are selling is near worthless and poorly displayed. I checked completed listings on your items and they do not sell very well. The best item you have is the Ghostbusters NES in which the packaging is in poor condition. I found 1 completed listing with all the packaging, in pristine condition that sold for $19.99. I suspect the one you have is worth $4-13 (yes quite a span, hard to judge exactly given the info available). Look at completed listings before you invest your time. I believe the money is made when you acquire an item, buy it right and the rest takes care of itself.

These little fast food ""collectible"" figurines are not rare, people are trying to dump them by the bucket load. Look at the completed listings for ""McDonald's Beast Machines"" and you will see the carnage. Don't waste your time.

Your pictures need help. Some items are too small in the frame, bad background, and out of focus. Most of the Ghost Busters pictures are slightly out of focus or badly out of focus. If you don't care enough to take a good picture, what else do you not care about? Use plenty of light with a decent point and shoot camera. If you don't have decent photo editing software, use Photoscape, it is free, open source and works great without being overly complex.

Use a white background if the item color allows, easy method is to use a TV tray or table against a white wall, you can use white poster board or printer paper if the table isn't white. I have black and blue solid blankets for light colored items. It looks professional and gives people confidence to purchase.

The thumbnail shot is critical, get closer shots of items for this pic. On multiple items, I sometimes focus on the main item in the foreground with the accessories out of focus in the background. Really varies based on the type of item.

That is the bad news, the goods news is that you have some positive selling history, shown some initiative and you can spell. This is actually quite valuable. I noticed a buyer left you this feedback ""Seller immediately cancelled order and issued full refund, with no explanation."" this is not what I want to see from a seller.

If you want to sell some crap on Ebay to make money, watch Craigslist for stuff you can resell also yard sales, pawn shops, auctions and estate sales are good sources. It if isn't a slam dunk good item that you are paying $5 for and selling for $50, then make sure to do your homework on completed listings. Negotiate the hell out of people, don't have to be rude, tell them you can only spend X dollars right now. Tell them you are buying for a friend (Ebay friend, lol), get them to sell for less, this is your profit, don't throw it away. Most people, this includes you right now, have no idea what things are worth, sometimes they ask too much and sometimes too little. A great item to look for on CL and pawn shops are high end damaged speakers, people often sell them for next to nothing. Take the speakers out of the cabinet, people will buy the components separately on Ebay. Throw away the cabinet if they don't bring the money, don't forget to check if the badges or logos have value. People will even buy speakers with bad surrounds for repair. I have done this many times with JBL, Advent, M&amp;K, Klipsch, Bose, etc. Those fancy surround systems Bose makes? People sometimes sell them for $100 with 4 speakers and a bass unit, I typically get $50 each on the little speakers and $50 -$100 on the bass unit. Look for free stuff and cheap broken stuff, people will pay money on Ebay for broken phones, parts for TVs, you don't need too much in the way of special tools to remove the boards on a TV with a smashed display. Always check what the parts are worth on broken items, sometimes working items are worth more broken up. I have parted old Sears Atlas lathes, easier to ship and you get more money. Depends on how much work you want to do.

People are selling stuff in your area right now you could make an easy profit from but you have to be patient like a serial killer and choose your victims wisely. I cannot stress patience enough. There is a dude in Gladwin selling a set of Bose surround speakers with 5 cubes and a sub-woofer for $100 http://saginaw.craigslist.org/ele/3423672664.html . You could resell this set for about $300, easy to sell and list, far more money than the stuff you are selling. Some figurines can be quite valuable, sometimes people try to sell a collection of whatever outright and it is worth considerably more parted out. Don't be afraid to offer people 25% of the asking price if it has been on CL for a while, people don't like feeling ripped off but if you are polite and make it about your particular budget then you might be the point where they break down and sell.

If you decide that you want to watch CL for junk to sell then it will take a while before you become proficient at spotting deals. Some of the most profitable items are scientific or specialty tools that require a special buyer that only a market like Ebay can provide. I have purchased items for $20-$100 and resold for over a $1000 on many occasions. Generally, I look to at least double my money unless there are multiple repeat items that are easy to ship and list. 



Sorry that I got carried away, thought this might help you or someone else maximize your time and money.

Worry about your own manager. There is nothing more annoying than ""Wenger Out"" from people who are not even fans of the club.

Qualifying for the CL became a concern when two clubs got bought up by Billionaires who totally warped the system by spending ridiculous amounts on players and starting an arms race so stupid that now even the billionaires themselves are having meetings to introduce some sort of wage ceiling. So those two clubs have taken residence at the top of the table.

And one of those clubs? Oh yeah, Manchester City, regularly handing out 150,000k contracts like candy.

But i am not railing against wealthy clubs. I've always defended city - every successful in the world has had significant investment at some point. But what does get me is when people like you say Wenger is the problem, totally ignoring the fact that it was your club which changed the rules of the game.

Do you know anything about the club? Go read the Swissramble.com article on Arsenal's finances to fully appreciate the fine margins the clubs is working with. Arsenal have the *lowest"" in net spend in player transfers over the last five years. Not the 10th or 15th. *Last*. Has it ever occurred to you that there is a *reason* for that? How fucking unusual it is that a top four club to be in that position?

There is no money. Of course the club says otherwise, but the club had to sign long term deals to pay for stadium and now what we earn years from commercial deals are dwarfed by what other clubs earn (at least that is starting to end). We also have stadium debt to pay.

Wenger has navigated all this. Let me remind you that other Wenger, there is no reason really why Arsenal should expect to finish above Spurs/Chelsea/Either Manchester club. You could make that argument that each club has had better squads than ours in the last three years. 

I defy you to come up with one manager that can bring relative success under these conditions (partially caused by your club) other than Sir Alex. It is certainly not fucking Roberto Mancini. Rafa Benitez? Anceloti? Mourinho? So who are going to replace Wenger with? It is easy to open your mouth and shout Wenger out when it isn't your club and you don't have to care about the aftermath, isn't it?


And worst of all, Arsenal are always accused of paying average players too much. But when we refuse to pay wildly inconsistent Theo ""running is my only skill"" Walcott a hundred grand or like in this case, put a sensible clause in a contract, the club is accused of showing no ambition.

If we were talking about achievement relative to the amount of money spent, it should Mancini out. You've been knocked out of the CL for two years in a row by Dortmund and Napoli, teams who spend a fraction of what you do. Given the resources he is given (i.e. damn near unlimited), it is *your* manager who should be out on his underachieving ass.

You are being downvoted because you don't know what you are talking about.

Anyway, a quick backstory, this was the first year I would have Christmas without my father, he had cheated on my mum with my best friends mother, controversial. 

I suppose my dad wanted to make amends for kind of bumming out our. Christmas so he offered to get me Buzz Lightyear, mum agreed to this.

Christmas comes, and I receive no Buzz Lightyear, in fact I don't recall anything that year, on top of this my dad got my best friend the Buzz Lightyear toy. Though I don't remember it clearly my mum still recalls the heartbreak in me.

True,LeBongJames,,,"[Do You Realize?? - The Flaming Lips.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXGb3JoGp0w)

This song means more to me than any other piece of art. I first found this song while I was travelling back from a beach camping trip with my father. Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots was one of a few albums I purchased to take on the trip with me, and as a fourteen year old many of the themes of Yoshimi went right over my head. 

My girlfriend at the time had gone on a mission trip with our church, and was in Arizona. My father had to stop to get gas and gave me a few quarters to call my girlfriend's cell phone from the pay phone. My girlfriend's sister answered the phone and quickly informed me that the driver of the 15 passenger van that my girlfriend had been travelling in had fallen asleep at the wheel and the van consequently veered into the median and flipped three times. She was the first love of my life, and it was the first moment where I realized that anything could be taken from me at any moment, and I had absolutely no power over it. 

The phone call was quickly disconnected as my girlfriend's sister had to go into the hospital to fill out all of the paperwork for her sister. She had no idea what the extent of the injuries were, and only knew that my girlfriend had been unconscious for several minutes only to awake, crying for her mother and myself. I was in total shock, the largest worry of my day three minutes earlier was not being able to sleep in the car because I had such a nasty sunburn. I stood there while the click of the receiver hitting metal echoed in my head for a few seconds, only ripped back to reality by my father calling me back to the Jeep. 

Walking back across the parking lot the only thing going through my head was, ""She is still alive, and you are a man. Do not cry. Do not cry in front of your father, this is the trip where you became a man."" I climbed back into the front seat, and my dad asked me straight off what was wrong. As soon as the words left his lips, I started bawling like a baby. He quickly turned the radio off, and let me cry. After what seemed like years of crying my eyes out, Dad placed his hand on my back and said, ""Son, it will all be okay. What happened?"" I told him of the eventful phone call, and he was at a loss for words as well. I started to break down again, as we were traveling in through the beautiful mountains of North Carolina with the top down on the Jeep and the sun setting on the horizon. The beautiful scene instantly made me think of the track ""It's Summertime"", track 8 on Yoshimi. 

It was a song I had connected with throughout the week, and I was looking for any form of solace. I pulled my backpack out of the back seat, dug out Yoshimi, pushed it into the cd player, skipped to track 8. I pulled the hood of my sweatshirt over my head pulled my knees into my chest, and started bawling again. Fate has it that the very next track on the album is ""Do You Realize??"", and all of this tremendously overwhelming emotion started to settle. It was the first moment in my life where music really hit me to the core of my soul. If you have never listened before, stop reading now and click the youtube link above. 

All the feelings of powerlessness and helplessness subsided, and the glowing joy of all the good times shared with that beautiful girl flooded my mind. I credit that event largely with shaping me as the person I am today. Life is about making the most of what you have at this minute, and always being gracious and thankful for any beautiful things that happen.. because they could be gone in an instant. It is natural to feel emotion for the loss of these seemingly perfect moments in your life. But, in the end, it is far more fulfilling to hold on to the happiness that you feel than the sorrow that naturally follows.

In the end, my girlfriend was okay, with only a broken collarbone and concussion. Everyone in the van was wearing their seatbelt, and everyone made it back home in one piece. This moment took me from obsessive music listener, to obsessive music analyzer. I started learning the guitar, and Do You Realize was one of the first tracks I learned. Do You Realize?? has popped back up many many times in my life since, often when I needed it most.

There is something about it that makes it feel like it's missing something and I think that might be it. Your wife should continue to explore her art and build on what talent she already has. 

All in all I think your wife is talented based on this picture! 

Props to you as a hubby for posting and promoting your wife's work. That is very sweet and so supportive! I think it's probably one of the coolest things a husband can do. I know it always makes me feel amazing when my husband falls in love with an art piece of mine. Cheers to you!

I always wonder, why is it that everything is now open for ridicule? Nothing is serious. Everything is fair game in the name of ""humor"", even things that are offensive or that don't even have a real punch line.

True,Cubicle_Surrealist,,,"I really hate reading stories like this.  Sure the guy in it (if it's true) probably was trying to scam the family, but I hate that these stories give people that impression of all homeless people.  

There is an incredibly high co-morbidity rate between smoking cigarettes and schizophrenia.  Maybe the guy in the story was chainsmoking because it helps make the voices stop. Mental illness is very high among the homeless population, so I think that there is a very real possibility that this person was self-medicating with cigarettes / other drugs.  

People also seem to forget that even without mental illness, homeless people won't always make rational decisions.  I don't smoke cigarettes anymore, but every once in a while I'll crave one because of stress at work or with my family.  Compare the stress at my cushy office job to the pressure of wondering if tonight's the night you freeze to death, if you're going to have food in the morning, or whether there's any point in even staying alive.  I can only imagine how fucking terrible being homeless would be, fortunately I will never have to go through it because of my upbringing and because I'm fortunate enough to have friends and family who wouldn't let that happen.  Not everyone is so lucky, and to speculate about the motives of people who do have to suffer through these conditions without any ability to put their behavior in the context of their lives is perverse.  
 
Two days ago during the powerball frenzy, I decided to buy a homeless woman a cup of hot chocolate instead of buying a lottery ticket (figured if I'm going to lose 2 dollars, I might as well help someone directly), and she was ecstatic and incredibly grateful. We had a nice short conversation, she has been homeless since 1999, and a few people have given her a warm place to sleep across the years, though its always temporary.  I hadn't the slightest regret about brightening up her day so very slightly, because I know she appreciated it.  She also apologized at one point as she stuttered because the ""cold had scrambled her brain.""  I can only imagine what her life has been like.  

So can we please stop celebrating these people for trying to apply their middle-class worldview to the lifestyle of people who have to deal with unimaginable hardship on a daily basis?  Maybe I'm wrong, and maybe most homeless people really are lazy shiftless scammers with fully functioning mental capabilities, but I would rather be guilty of misplaced compassion than misplaced disdain.

True,SinX145,,,"We dont talk about WarZ around here...

(in actual fact we do, but we make fun of it a lot, and sometimes the people that bought the game, not really their fault imo, but it happens)

WarZ was announced after people started jumping on the DayZ bandwagon, officially they said that the framework for the game had been out for two years, and it was just getting into alpha stages. Many people called bullshit, research was done, turns out the game had only been in the making for four-six months, statement was never retracted. Add insult to injury, they made the game run on their ridiculously shitty and glitchy War Inc engine (another f2p game, no zombies, on steam). Fast Forward a bit, game is playable (barely), when new information comes out, admins acting unprofessionally (turning on godmode to attack bandits,spawning things) failure to implement a working ai for zombies, there was a bit more, i forget. People getting refunds automatically blacklisted from a so called ""global"" database, accounts are banned and i believe you are not allowed to buy from that company again (dunno maybe from what i read). Game is supposed to be balanced, and not support a pay2win system, when in actual fact the items that are being sold are extremely rare in game. Fast Forward to last week, a forum moderator gets banned, engages his rage cannon and blasts WarZ, new information (MAYBE BIASED) comes to light about a large amount of the playerbase hacking, as well as the company banning people who have accrued a certain amount of playtime, just because they might buy the game again, not having a working anticheat but instead hand picking which hackers to ban to maximize profit, general things to increase money gain and decrease player fun, OH and a huge thing was the clan system, which when first implemented costed 750 currency, but after a huge outpour of negativity, they decided to make it free (trying to bail a ship at the bottom of the ocean imo). Also revealed by the former mod, was the plan that the developers would drop WarZ after six months, if they felt they werent making enough money from it.

FOUND IT FUCKING LIARS...When renting a server you'll be able to choose between a predefined number of player slots. The lowest amount of players per server is 70 and the maximum is 250.

--------No Hackers--- extremely large amount of player base is currently hacking

--------No P2W System---they claim they are not running a pay to win system, when in fact all you really need to succeed in warZ is a couple bucks and a sniper rifle, and intelligence.

--------Huge Maps--- maps are very spacious, because there is no fucking things anywhere, tons of empty space with absolutely nothing going on at all.

--------Fun--- tons of hackers, glitches, shitty engine = no fun or very limited fun.

--------Skill System--- it was reported that a skill system would be implemented, i have no idea where this is right now.

--------Refunds--- shit just went wrong. OP's method dont work no more.

I am sure someone here can post the links and research, I am too lazy right about now.

True,pseudolobster,,,"Thank you for this. I've been homeless on more than one occasion in my life, and one of the must frustrating things about being homeless was having to deal with people who ""know"" why you're homeless and how easy it would be to fix all the problems in your life that led to you being in this situation. 

""Why don't you get a job?"" Well, let's see, I stink. I haven't shaved or showered in a month. I don't have a resume, any references, or anyone on earth to vouch for me. Want to phone me? I don't have a phone. What do I put down as my address on my application? A ditch? I've tried this before, got nowhere. Spent a month diligently searching for work only to be talked down to, told I'm wasting people's time, and worse.

""Why won't you accept my food?"" Okay well I ate at the shelter and I'm actually okay for food for now, but thanks. I'd really like to try and save up six dollars for a pack of cigarettes so that I don't have to pick up cigarette butts out of the gutter and smoke them. It's a small thing, but any scrap of dignity I can muster makes a big difference in my life.

""What the fuck are you doing with your life? You don't look crazy"" So, you might be surprised to find out, but a huge number of homeless people are actually very articulate, intelligent people, who through one situation or another were left with nowhere to go. I for one don't have a family. There's no one for me to turn to, and when I ended up with severe depression and no job and no money, there's really no other choice but to live on the streets. Many homeless people were raised in broken homes, where they were severely beaten by their parents and they've never known love or trust in their lives. 

You can't have any idea what circumstances led to hitting rock bottom like this. Presuming to know how and why people are homeless, and how simple it is for them to rise out of that situation, is one of the most completely myopic and ignorant things you can say to them. 

I am a good person. I'm intelligent and funny. I'm caring and giving. But, if I'm sitting on the sidewalk none of that matters, I'm a piece of shit drain on society who has no one to blame for his problems but himself. That was the single most difficult thing I dealt with on a daily basis. Not the violence, not the despair and hopelessness, but the presumptions. The prejudices expressed by every single person I spoke to. Being made to feel like shit just for existing, let alone trying to fit in with normal society. Yes, i'm asking you for a dollar, and yes I'm going to spend it on a slice of pizza or something else that's frivolous and wasteful, but you know what, that frivolous expenditure does a lot more than fill my stomach it makes me feel like a normal person, walking into a store and exchanging money for goods. After being dehumanized so long, anything that helps you feel like a normal member of society is a godsend.

I'm digressing pretty hard here, but I think this needs to be said more often. Homeless people are people too. They've just gone through some really shitty times, that's all. Anyone without a social safety net of friends and family, who runs out of money, becomes homeless. It can happen to you or I.

It's because everyone has this fantastical idea that they can just go to a bar or wherever and pick up a random girl that is going to up for getting fucked by a couple and then never be heard from again.  This happens, but isnt super common (it's easier if you and your partner are both extremely attractive).  Really, the best way to go about it is to pick a friend that both you and your wife are very comfortable with, and talk all this shit out between the three of you before you do anything.  What is on the table? what is off the table? will it be a regular thing? will it be just the one time? what is ok to talk about after the fact?  And start slow.  Make sex off the table the first time, just roll around and have a good time and see how everyone feels afterwards.  If that went well, and everyone is feeling comfortable then maybe you can graduate to other activities.

It has only happened once, and I don't like to tell the story, but I'm actually kind of proud of it.  I was out at a bar with some friends, trying to find a girl I could take back to my twin bed and disappoint twice before 4AM.  Apparently, one guy at the bar didn't like me talking to someone who wasn't also black.  Which is fine.  Have outdated opinions, but keep it to yourself buddy.

That morning I suited up for my interview, went well but didn't get the job, I left the building and headed off to pick her up. She told me she was gonna wait for me by the clock on the main floor. I got there a little late, the sun was going down at this point. 

When i finally found her she being harassed by a 3 guys trying to get her to go out drinking with them. Real Bro's and obviously assholes, they had obviously hit the bottle hard before heading in. She was dressed to party, but i was told that it was just how girls in Russia dress when they go out, go figure.

I walked right up to them, with my sunglasses on, black suit, and the earpiece from my cellphone headset in. I took my most serious tone and said ""Ma'am, your detail has arrived. Would you please follow me?""

The guys looked really confused for a second, and thankfully she took the cue and thanked me and walked past me, leaving them all stunned. Before I turned around to follow, I just nodded and said ""Gentlemen"" before following after her.

We burst into laughter once we were out of the building.",0,1354312900,,0,False,1,c79bjf7,t3_142h43,t1_c79bjf7,t3_142h43,,1430544832,1954,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,1954
True,EnzoYug,,,"Reasons to get a 250cc bike over a larger bike?

**1. They exist for a reason.**

250cc... that doesn't sound like much? After all there's heaps of cars out there with 2.5 litre engines - why there's THOUSANDS of great bikes in the 600cc + range. If all the guys with sexy rides and great looking girlfriends are riding big bikes, why should I buy a 250?

You should buy one because they were thought out, designed, developed and made - JUST FOR YOU! The people making these not only understood learner riders better than you ever will (you'll understand your own learning experience, but not the 'entire spectrum') and they've built something that gives you EXACTLY WHAT YOU NEED.


**2. You need a 250 more than you know.**

It's simple. You're inexperienced. Motorcycles are fast, and offer very little protection. The odds of your crashing either solo or hitting another vehicle in your first two years are 1:1. Statistically you are guaranteed to some kind of accident / injury within the first 5 years.

You're male (I'm almost certain) and you're young. Men under the age of 25 battle with undeniable fact that risk-taking hormones run through your veins. You can argue that control is all in the wrist, blah blah blah - but here's the simple fact. If I had one eye, I'd be vision-impaired. No doubt. No arguments. You are risk-prone. It's not a mindset, you can't over come it. Compared to everyone else you are the RISKEST demographic alive. It is simple a temporary handicap that you must overcome - denying this is the SINGLE STUPIDEST THING YOU CAN DO. Accept it, know it, move on.


**3. Speed kills**

I have watched my friend bleed to death. Imagine everything in the world is a potential bullet. All it needs is enough speed to punch through your leather jacket and into your lungs. When you accelerate on a motorcycle you're giving everything around you the speed it needs to kill you. Slow bikes are still fast compared to cars, buses, vans and wheelchairs. Trust me on this, start slow.


**4. Speed is nothing without control**

A 250-cc motorcycle is designed to sacrifice speed for control. If you were playing your first FPS you wouldn't jump straight to hard-core mode. Especially if there was no re-spawn. 250's are light enough for you to move easily whilst you're building the strength and muscle-memory required to throw a bigger bike around. They accelerate a speed which leaves you time to make decisions - because as a learner the correct course of action WONT BE REFLEX - you *will* have to think about it. And thinking takes time.

As you learn to control your bike you will be thankful it's light, maneuverable, low to the ground (for sturdier feet placement) and most of all - cheaper to repair / fix when you bin it.


**5. Learn from everyone else**

In my country, for a long time, a 250cc motorcycle was mandatory for all learners for the first 2 years of their licence. (we have a different system now but it's very similar; Low-power only) This wasn't just because some old guy wanted to rain on everyone's parade. It's because the old fuckers know where they screwed up - and they look at the crash reports, they do the research, they find the best solution and - guess what? The solution was: SMALL BIKES ARE BETTER FOR LEARNERS.

- Crashes on small bikes are less likely to be fatal.
- Good thing considering your first bike is the one you're most likely to crash.
- Being in control not only saves your health, it's more fun!
- It's a simple fact - it's more fun making a slow-bike go fast than making a fast-bike go slow. Ask anyone who has to commute on a litre-bike.

**Summary**

I'm really excited to hear you're learning to ride. That's awesome. The best advice I can give you is - get a 250. Just don't get an RR or a SS (super sport / race replica) they're not designed for you.

Don't get something with lots of pretty fairings unless you're going to get crash protectors. You will drop the bike. You will scratch the fuck out of it. You will cry a little. You will impress no-one of consequence.

The Ninja-250 is a nice looking bike, so is the CBR250-RR. But they are WORLDS apart. Learn about engines, learn about riding positions, learn about what you're really paying for. **HINT** Ninjas, you're paying for looks - not performance.

V-Twins and singles are great. They use very little gas. (Single's actually break the laws of physics with how little gas they use) and are very reliable. They also produce much more power ""down low"" ie. in the 0-40 mph region. This is probably where you want your power right? Or are you more concerned with how quickly you get from 90mph to 120mph? I didn't think so.

Naked bikes are easier to clean, repair and maintain yourself. You SHOULD repair it yourself. working on your own bike is the fastest way to learn about it, discover flaws issues etc... and fall in love with all it's little bits.

Lastly - Get a bike that RIDES great. Not looks great. If it looks good on the showroom, but it doesn't feel as good as the ratty-looking one from craigslist - DON'T BUY IT. Bikes are like women, there are beautiful ones, and then there are the ones that make you SMILE. 

Find something that makes you smile - and keep the shiny-side up.

**Goodluck &amp; Godspeed.**

True,moomooman,,,"The general equation for abrasive or adhesive wear developed by Holm goes like:

V=K*(F/H)*d

Where V is the abrasive wear volume, F is the normal force on the worn body, H is the hardness (or yield strength) of the worn material, and d is the sliding distance. 

Holm's paper is published in a book called ""Electrical Contacts: Section 49"" from 1946. 

That is to say, the model for abrasive wear does not actually include the hardness of the object doing the scratching. In general, any application of a stress greater than the yield strength will induce abrasive wear.

There is another equation developed by Evans and Marshall which shows that generalized wear (any type) is proportional to the normal force, F, and inversely proportional to both the harness/yield strength and the fracture toughness of a material. Once again, the hardness of the second body is irrelevant. The equation is too difficult to write here, as I'm on my phone. 

Evans and Marshall are both pretty famous-ish guys in science and published their paper titled ""Wear mechanisms in ceramics"" in an ASM book called ""Fundamentals of Friction and Wear of Materials"" in 1980. 

If the harness of the second body was required to exceed that of the worn body, things like water jet cutters would not work. The hardness/yield stress of a stream of water is low in the traditional sense, but it works because it can deliver forces/stresses in excess of the compressive yield strength of many materials.",0,1354315883,,0,False,1,c79cbo2,t3_142doj,t1_c79cbo2,t1_c79arqw,,1430545233,21,False,nexus4,t5_2v9bv,21

True,17Hongo,,,"OK, no comment I've seen so far seems to have gone all out, so I'm going to try here. Sorry if I overdo a stereotype. 

Welcome to Global High. Let me introduce you to your peers. 

Over there is USA. He's a big, tough guy - not overly bright, but not exactly an idiot. He's come into his own very recently, and while he certainly isn't up there with the smartest kids, he can sure as hell look after himself. He's the Jock - he has a brain in his head, but he's still young, and seems to rate physical strength over intellect. As a result, he's more accustomed to solving problems with his fists, but can use his head to get around other kids - especially when he steps over the line. His heart's generally in the right place, and he has the potential to really improve himself over the next few years, but he could also hit the gutter badly. The other kids like him, but they tend to step around him carefully if they're worried about crossing him. 

This little group is the UK. Their generally nice guys - they used to be the biggest guy in school for a long time, and they still hold a lot of weight. They're a bit smarter than the USA, and somewhat less volatile, but they aren't nearly as physically strong. Not any more. That said, USA still takes notice of what they say - he's gotten clever enough to recognise a good source of advice. They're generally rather arrogant, and haven't gotten over running the place, although they seem to have accepted that they aren't top dog any more. Don't hang around them too much - they're real douchebags if you give them too much space. The dynamics of the group are rather interesting though - there's quite a bit of inside conflict and friendship there that is very interesting. Take England, for example. He's a big guy, and generally used to running the group. He's smart, and can be a bit cruel if he's feeling mean, but he's also fairly down to earth and reliable if he's your friend. That short, red headed one is Scotland. He looks small, but don't fuck with him - he packs one hell of a punch - as England has found out from time to time. He's also the most volatile of the group - he has a rather nasty inferiority complex since England used to pick on him quite a bit. He's gotten much more confident in himself recently, and made a few friends outside the clique by himself - he might even leave it soon. Northern Ireland is the only girl in the group, but she really holds her own. She's fierce, like Scotland, and more than capable of standing up for herself against anyone - she went rather mental in an issue with England not that long ago. She has a bit of a thing going with USA, but no-one's really sure what's happening there. The last kid is Wales. He's a big lad, and, while he's maybe not as clever as some of the others, he's quiet and surprisingly wise. He's quite popular with some of the other big kids, and while USA puts up a big front for his sporting life, Wales is probably the best at contact sports in the school, although New Zealand and Australia might have something to say about that. 

That group over there is Scandinavia. They're very quiet, and really smart. This is Denmark. Cute? Yeah -we all think so. She's lovely if you get to know her, and, as we've noticed, a real looker. She's not one of the alpha girls though - too quiet, too down to earth. It's easy to see why we all respect her so much, and for such a quiet, removed kid she's really insightful and clever - if she has something to say, we'll listen. That's her mate Norway over there - yep she's gorgeous too. She's probably the most level headed girl in the school, and while she keeps more to herself than Denmark, she's probably the best role model in the school. This guy? He's Sweden. Clever lad, but a bit mixed up. He's probably the most mainstream of the group - they're real nerds; they have their own games, their own little social rules too. Sweden had some problems that he's still dealing with, but he's got a better grip on himself than most of the other kids. The other guy is Finland. No-ones really sure where he stands - he's not really part of the group, but he seems to run with them generally. He's a bit of a mystery, and a bit out there - the whole group are fans of heavy metal, but he's really into it. He's probably awesome to be at a gig with. 

That's Russia. Big fellow, isn't he? He doesn't mix well, and if there's going to be a fight, then it's going to be between him and USA. They used to have a real tension between them that could have really blown up, but they seem to be mostly past it. That said, it wouldn't be pretty even now. He's got some issues of his own, and tends to keep to himself. Everyone else steps around him pretty carefully. 

This is France. I know what you're thinking - what a fucking queen. He's very dramatic, and kind of effeminate. That said, he's an awesome cook, and his parties are the best in high school - that guy can rave. Plus, don't let the drama fool you - he's a pretty skilled sportsman, kicks ass at soccer and rugby, and he's pretty clever too. He might not quite have the brains that Scandinavia or the UK have, but he's not stupid, and when it comes to personal decisions he's generally less pretentious than either of them. 

This is Germany. No, we aren't sure what we think of her either. She's insanely clever - but she tends to be a  bit industrial in her thinking process, and as a result appears rather emotionally removed. We all listen when she talks - we pretty much all owe her some sort of debt, whether it's money (she wasn't rich to start with, but she's really economical) or favours. She was insane for a while back, and did some real damage - there was a school wide intervention on that. You should remember that she cleaned up her act very efficiently and thoroughly, and she's a much better person as a result. Don't get too close though - she doesn't flinch from axing her friends if she thinks they're in the wrong. 

You noticed Spain, huh? Yeah - she's pretty much the hottest girl in the school, and my god is she exotic. Probably the best at soccer too, although be careful when you say that around the rest of Europe - Germany and Italy are insanely jealous of that. She's a bit of a mess right now - she has no money, and just between you and me, she's a bit loose. Still the most popular girl around though.

That other sultry señorita you're eyeing up is Portugal. She's even more of a mess than Spain, plus a little more broke but a bit less of a slag. Great girl if you get to know her though, and a bit gutsier than Spain - she can go on any guys night out and hold her own. She's also a big one on the soccer pitch. 

That's Israel. He's a douche. Ignore him. He used to be small, and bullied, for a long time, but he's now big enough that he can pick on some of the smaller kids. He relies on his friendship with the USA and the UK to get away with being such a cunt, but even they aren't buying it any more. He uses the bullying he experienced in the past as an excuse to get away with murder, but that's wearing thin. Don;t pay him any attention. He's a shit. 

That really small kid? That's Palestine. Israel's favourite punching bag. He's really religious, and can be a bit unreasonable sometimes, but he's catching up with the rest of us - he just needs a bit of help standing on his own two feet. If the USA and the UK had any decency they'd probably help him out.

The Middle East Nations are over there. I'm not going to dumb it down - they're weird. Very religious, and in the case of Afghanistan, Syria and Lebanon - very conflicted. The USA and the UK have been trying to help Iraq and Afghanistan lately, but they've been pretty aggressive, and even they aren't sure if they helped that much. Egypt's starting to get a grip of himself and might join in with the rest of us, but he might also retreat back into that little clique they have going there. Turkey's all right - he's a bit more relatable than the rest of them, but to be honest they've all been showing some inner conflict that could get nasty - Syria's definitely fucked up, and Europe had to get involved with Libya already. Saudi Arabia and Iran stand alone a little - they're just as messed up as the rest, but they're either big enough and/or rich enough that we take them with some degree of seriousness. Don't take their advice though - too much weird religion in there for it to be really pragmatic.

You've checked out China, eh? He's only just come out of his shell - he's big and smart, and could probably end up running the place - he seems to have gotten some real confidence from somewhere lately. He's maybe not the smartest kid in school, but he's definitely the hardest worker, and he's probably got some scary levels of talent that we haven't seen yet. He's a nerd, right enough, but we're not sure where he's going, and he could be really big and important.
