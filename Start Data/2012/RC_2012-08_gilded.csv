True,banzaipanda,,,"OR Nurse here.  This is kind of a long one...

I was taking call one night, and woke up at two in the morning for a ""general surgery"" call.  Pretty vague, but at the time, I lived in a town that had large populations of young military guys and avid meth users, so late-night emergencies were common.

Got to the hospital, where a few more details awaited me -- ""Perirectal abscess.""  For the uninitiated, this means that somewhere in the immediate vicinity of the asshole, there was a pocket of pus that needed draining.  Needless to say our entire crew was less than thrilled.

I went down to the Emergency Room to transport the patient, and the only thing the ER nurse said as she handed me the chart was ""Have fun with this one."" Amongst healthcare professionals, vague statements like that are a bad sign. 

My patient was a 314lb Native American woman who barely fit on the stretcher I was transporting her on. She was rolling frantically side to side and moaning in pain, pulling at her clothes and muttering Hail Mary's.  I could barely get her name out of her after a few minutes of questioning, so after I confirmed her identity and what we were working on, I figured it was best just to get her to the anesthesiologist so we could knock her out and get this circus started.  

She continued her theatrics the entire ten-minute ride to the O.R., nearly falling off the surgical table as we were trying to put her under anesthetic.  We see patients like this a lot, though, chronic drug abusers who don't handle pain well and who have used so many drugs that even increased levels of pain medication don't touch simply because of high tolerance levels.  

It should be noted, tonight's surgical team was not exactly wet behind the ears.  I'd been working in healthcare for several years already, mostly psych and medical settings.  I've watched an 88-year-old man tear a 1""-diameter catheter balloon out of his penis while screaming ""You'll never make me talk!"".  I've been attacked by an HIV-positive neo-Nazi.  I've seen some shit.  The other nurse had been in the OR as a trauma specialist for over ten years; the anesthesiologist had done residency at a Level 1 trauma center, or as we call them, ""Knife and Gun Clubs"".  The surgeon was ex-Army, and averaged about eight words and two facial expressions a week.  None of us expected what was about to happen next.

We got the lady off to sleep, put her into the stirrups, and I began washing off the rectal area.  It was red and inflamed, a little bit of pus was seeping through, but it was all pretty standard. Her chart had noted that she'd been injecting IV drugs through her perineum, so this was obviously an infection from dirty needles or bad drugs, but overall, it didn't seem to warrant her repeated cries of ""Oh Jesus, kill me now.""

The surgeon steps up with a scalpel, sinks just the tip in, and at the exact same moment, the patient had a muscle twitch in her diaphragm, and just like that, all hell broke loose. 

Unbeknownst to us, the infection had actually tunneled nearly a foot into her abdomen, creating a vast cavern full of pus, rotten tissue, and fecal matter that had seeped outside of her colon.  This godforsaken mixture came rocketing out of that little incision like we were recreating the funeral scene from Jane Austen's ""Mafia!"".  

We all wear waterproof gowns, face masks, gloves, hats, the works -- all of which were as helpful was rainboots against a firehose.  The bed was in the middle of the room, an easy seven feet from the nearest wall, but by the time we were done, I was still finding bits of rotten flesh pasted against the back wall.  As the surgeon continued to advance his blade, the torrent just continued.  The patient kept seizing against the ventilator (not uncommon in surgery), and with every muscle contraction, she shot more of this brackish gray-brown fluid out onto the floor until, within minutes, it was seeping into the other nurse's shoes. 

I was nearly twelve feet away, jaw dropped open within my surgical mask, watching the second nurse dry-heaving and the surgeon standing on tip-toes to keep this stuff from soaking his socks any further. The smell hit them first. ""Oh god, I just threw up in my mask!""  The other nurse was out, she tore off her mask and sprinted out of the room, shoulders still heaving.   Then it hit me, mouth still wide open, not able to believe the volume of fluid this woman's body contained.  It was like getting a great big bite of the despair and apathy that permeated this woman's life.  I couldn't fucking breath, my lungs simply refused to pull anymore of that stuff in.  The anesthesiologist went down next, an ex-NCAA D1 tailback, his six-foot-two frame shaking as he threw open the door to the OR suite in an attempt to get more air in, letting me glimpse the second nurse still throwing up in the sinks outside the door.  Another geyser of pus splashed across the front of the surgeon.  The YouTube clip of ""David at the dentist"" keeps playing in my head -- ""Is this real life?""

In all operating rooms, everywhere in the world, regardless of socialized or privatized, secular or religious, big or small, there is one thing the same:  Somewhere, there is a bottle of peppermint concentrate.  Everyone in the department knows where it is, everyone knows what it is for, and everyone prays to their gods they never have to use it.  In times like this, we rub it on the inside of our masks to keep the outside smells at bay long enough to finish the procedure and shower off.

I sprinted to the our central supply, ripping open the drawer where this vial of ambrosia was kept, and was greeted by -- an empty fucking box.  The bottle had been emptied and not replaced.  Somewhere out there was a godless bastard who had used the last of the peppermint oil, and not replaced a single fucking drop of it.  To this day, if I figure out who it was, I'll kill them with my bare hands, but not before cramming their head up the colon of every last meth user I can find, just so we're even.

I darted back into the room with the next best thing I can find -- a vial of Mastisol, which is an adhesive rub we use sometimes for bandaging.  It's not as good as peppermint, but considering that over one-third of the floor was now thoroughly coated in what could easily be mistaken for a combination of bovine after-birth and maple syrup, we were out of options.  

I started rubbing as much of the Mastisol as I could get on the inside of my mask, just glad to be smelling anything except whatever slimy demon spawn we'd just cut out of this woman.  The anesthesiologist grabbed the vial next, dowsing the front of his mask in it so he could stand next to his machines long enough to make sure this woman didn't die on the table.  It wasn't until later that we realized that Mastisol can give you a mild high from huffing it like this, but in retrospect, that's probably what got us through.  

By this time, the smell had permeated out of our OR suite, and down the forty-foot hallway to the front desk, where the other nurse still sat, eyes bloodshot and watery, clenching her stomach desperately.  Our suite looked like the underground river of ooze from Ghostbusters II, except dirty.  Oh so dirty.

I stepped back into the OR suite, not wanting to leave the surgeon by himself in case he genuinely needed help.  It was like one of those overly-artistic representations of a zombie apocalypse you see on fan-forums.  Here's this one guy, in blue surgical garb, standing nearly ankle deep in lumps of dead tissue, fecal matter, and several liters of syrupy infection.  He was performing surgery in the swamps of Dagobah, except the swamps had just come out of this woman's ass and there was no Yoda.  He and I didn't say a word for the next ten minutes as he scraped the inside of the abscess until all the dead tissue was out, the front of his gown a gruesome mixture of brown and red, his eyes squinted against the stinging vapors originating directly in front of him.  I finished my required paperwork as quickly as I could, helped him stuff the recently-vacated opening full of gauze, taped this woman's buttocks closed to hold the dressing for as long as possible, woke her up, and immediately shipped off to the recovery ward. 

Until then, I'd only heard of ""alcohol showers.""  Turns out 70% isopropyl alcohol is about the only thing that can even touch a scent like that once its soaked into your skin.  It takes four or five bottles to get really clean, but it's worth it.  It's probably the only scenario I can honestly endorse drinking a little of it, too.

As we left the locker room, the surgeon and I looked at each other, and he said the only negative sentence I heard him utter in two and a half years of working together:

""That was bad.""

The next morning the entire department (a fairly large floor within the hospital) still smelled.  The housekeepers told me later that it took them nearly an hour to suction up all of the fluid and debris left behind.  The OR suite itself was closed off and quarantined for two more days just to let the smell finally clear out.

I laugh now when I hear new recruits to healthcare talk about the worst thing they've seen.  You ain't seen shit, kid.

Could possibly be [Clark Chapman](http://www.boulder.swri.edu/~cchapman/). [Here](http://www.psi.edu/about/history.html), one Don Davis is mentioned as a ""U.A. PhD graduate known at that time for participating in saving the Apollo 13 mission"" After some more digging, I found [this](http://www.psi.edu/sites/default/files/imported/news/newsletter/Summer2010pdfweb.pdf) which mentions that Davis worked for NASA at the time. Also it doesn't look like he studied at MIT which rules him out. However, the name mentioned after his on the PSI website is Clark Chapman, a UA and MIT graduate of Meteorology and planetary science. In Chapman's [bio](http://www.boulder.swri.edu/~cchapman/#BIO) on his personal site it states that he got his PHD from MIT in 1972 which suggests he could have been a student at the time of the Apollo 13 mission in 1970. Also on the PSI website is a [photo](http://www.psi.edu/webfm_send/386) which I believe features Chapman (second from right) after comparing it to a recent [photo](http://www.boulder.swri.edu/clark/crc05ph3.jpg).

True,bigidea,,,"NOTE:  THIS STORY IS 17 YEARS AGO, AND I CAN RECALL IT LIKE IT HAPPENED THIS MORNING: 

My first street paramedic job was the worst city in Alabama.  Look it up, Pritchard, AL is the worst, most dangerous, most lawless city in Alabama.  There was a neighboorhood called ""Alabama Village"" that looked like a bombed out block in Iraq. We would not even go in there on a call at night without Police escort and backup.  My busiest shift was 24 EMS calls in 24 hours.  We averaged 1 call an hour in one day, and that was just our truck, we had three more in the city.  THAT was fucking crazy.

My best/worst call ever from Pritchard:

Got a call for two shot in an apartment.  Police get there, clear the scene of any potential perp, and tell us to step it up on the radio, which if the police tell us that, that's a code for "" Oh God please get here fast, we're in the shit"" .  We go barreling up the steps with everything we could carry, and firemen coming down to get more of our gear.  Me and my partner hauled up 2 jump kits, two airway kits (O2, oral airways, masks, AMBU Bags, Intubation kits), a cardiac bag, and a cardiac monitor. Firemen bring up drug box, stretcher, two backboards, and a scoop stretcher behind us.

We walk in, and not a light in the place works, either burnt out or knocked over.  We run through every room, quickly to assess casualties.  Right inside the door in the kitchen is a Female, laying on her back, 1 GSW to the head, in the forehead, out the top/back of the head, unresponsive FULL TERM PREGNANT.  First bedroom, there are two kids, boy and girl, about  5 and 7, sitting upright, on bed, unhurt, staring at us like like zombies, no emotions. They had just watched their mother and her boyfriend get murdered execution style 10 minutes ago.  Back bedroom, is guy, laying on back on bed, three .5"" holes in his chest, from a .45.  Unresponsive, no vitals.  Firemen start CPR on him and and get him packaged for the second EMS unit a few minutes away.  We (my partner and I) return to the pregnant female  where two firemen have started CPR on her and are prepping her for us (cutting clothes off, getting on hard floor, setting up O2 and Intubation kit.  I have already called Medical Control on the way to get standing orders.  Standing orders are ""I'm getting ready to be in the shit and I need to be able to do everything I'm legally allowed to do, just trust me"".  We get them and since they are the region's Level 1 trama center, and are just 5 miutes away, they start getting ready for us, Peds, Surgery, Pulmonary, and cardiac units all head down to trauma center. 
Back at the scene, I put the monitor on the pt. and she has the death rhythm, it's the rhythm of a heart on it's last grasp on life, and 90% is morbid.  I see this, but then realize that there's a very good chance we're close enuough away if I can get her intubated, and get an IV line in her, I can pump enough drugs into her to at least make the baby's body shut down which would lower her oxygen requirements a bit.  We get her intubated, and I slam an Epi into her ET tube, as some drugs work as well in the lungs as they do the blood.  We get her on a backboard and stretcher, and get her down to the unit, on scene time about 6-7 minutes.  We're hauling ass.  Get in the unit, and two firemen jump in to assist with CPR and handling.  I get a 14 guage needle and IV line in her.  14 Guage is a BIG FUCKING NEEDLE.  I get a Lactated Ringers Fluid started, and jam in Atropine, Epi, and Sodium Bicarb.  Bicarb is old school, and is normally only used in long long cardiac arrest scenarios.  When youve peen unresponsive, co2 builds up in you blood, and mkes you very acidic, bicarb raises the Ph.  It also means the end for the patient, as at this point there's not much hope.  We roll in to the trauma center, and go barrelinng into the ER straight into the trauma suite waiting for us.  Get her into the suite, and on our stretcher, the Peds doctor on duty busts through the crowd of us, and grabs a scalpel that is taped to the wall. They tape shit on the walls for easy access. She opens the scalpel (she is a 5'-2"" female, about 105 lbs tops), and stands up on the legs of our stretcher, and leans over the pt and jams the scalpel just above her pubic bone, and cuts (from the inside out if that makes sense) up all the way to her sternum.  She then reaches it, and TEARS the placenta open with her hands, and reaches in and yanks this baby out.  Its a full tern baby girl, and she's in deep distress.  They call it on the mother, she's dead, and turn their attention to the baby.  They get her intubated, she has a pulse, but is in bad shape. They rush her to NICU, and work on her all night.

She lived.  She has cerebral palsy, and can't walk or talk, but appears to be conscious, and somewhat aware, and happy.   Several years later, I'm working part time on a private ambulance company, ones that do routine transports, transport minor emergencies, etc.   I get a call to transport a pt to the doctor, we show up, and it's a little girl on a bed, with a ventilator, unable to walk or move, but apparently cheerful and conscious.  I ask her grandmother what happened to her, and she told me ""This is the girl that those paramedics saved when she was still inside her mother that had been shot and killed"".  So many emotions flashed through my head at that moment.  I couldn't believe that this was the baby that I had saved a few years ago.  I was sad and happy all at the same time. On a snap judgement, I chose not to tell her I had been on that call.  I second guess that decision all the time, and still don't know if I would tell her if the situation arose again.  

Both patients had died, he had been killed over drugs, and she was killed for being in the wrong place.  I never saw or heard what happened to the other two kids, or how the girls was doing after that.  That call is still as vivid to me as it was the day it happened.",0,1344210681,,0,False,1,c5opfan,t3_xo41d,t1_c5opfan,t1_c5om4g1,,1429561727,73,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,73

True,[deleted],,,"Over the last year of loseit, fittit, keto and MFA, my biggest revelation was that it was *ok to be shallow.* Like a lot of nerds, I was never very confident, and that lead to a incredibly poor appearance. ""Kip dynamite"" was the *best* thing I was called. The worst was ""potential rapist.""

As a psychological defense mechanism, I looked down on attractive people. I think a lot of us have at some point. *I* wasn't creepy, *they* were shallow. They cared about stupid shit like clothes and hair and weight, while I cared about computers and science and literature and ""stuff that really mattered."" Girls who cared about looks were pretentious. Guys who cared about looks were pussies. And the whole time I get to be smug and condescending, because my shitty appearance must mean I'm deep and intelligent. I bemoaned this shitty world where people couldn't look past the creepy neckbeard and see the person inside. I bitched about cheerleaders and jocks and cool kids and popular people, and decided that the physical and mental were polar opposites.

It turns out that attitude will get you through about three decades, and then you look in the mirror and realize you look like Comic Book Guy. I had a moment of clarity where I realized the world was shallow, and it did care about appearances - *and that wasn't a bad thing.* I had spent years getting pissed off that people were chasing illusions. Instead of trying to change that, why not take control of the illusion?

It took be 30 years to realize a stupid jock is stupid, and fat ugly nerd is *also* stupid. A good looking nerd? That motherfucker knows what time it is.

And when you hear a good song you know you won't hear it again 1000x in the next week as the station plays its 14 song rotation?

He was wrong about one thing, the music never died. 

Various entities have tried to control, guide, and define music over the years.  We're emerging from a relatively dark period.  Throughout it all, the music has broken through and survived.  As Jeff Goldblum might say... ""The, ah, the.. music will eh.. ah the music find a... music finds way way"".  It is both an expression and catalyst for everything that is good in humanity.   It's a common language we can all learn.  And now we're at the time that it breaks from its restraints and soars free forever.

True,zenfish,,Asian Kid,"To me the washing of mah jong tiles somewhere in the house is, even now, like white noise. Beyond the drowsiness, it drifts me back to those Friday and Saturday nights when the parents got together and threw us kids like shrugged off coats into a pile, upstairs or down in the basement. It didn't matter. A kid, one usually four years older would act like a den mother or wedgie dispensing brother for the night: we still needed to be watched.  
  
Scrabble or Pictionary or Monopoly already set up before we arrived. Hot Wheels or Lego dumped on the carpet.  
  
At Z's house, Z's sister Q, 4 years older, was the warden. She decided what activities would be available, the aforementioned board games, a cartoon tape in the VCR: Denver the Last Dinosaur or Chipmunks' World Adventure or some Disney flick.  
  
Sometimes we were bifurcated. Boys in the living room snapping together their *stupid hot wheels tracks through cities of LEGO.* Though there was always a girl or two out of the bunch who wanted in, for the most part the girls would retreat into the unknown territory of Q's room and emerge later subtly different. More sparkly?  
  
But most times we were together. Under the hot cone lamp that hung over the dark wooden breakfast table we wanted to be the racecar or the terrier, or tried to guess somebody’s scribble of a mutant cactus, or stole someone else's letter, or slipped a hundred Monopoly bucks out of the bank while Q was distracted by her idiot brother’s antics.  
  
We were together doing our stupid little talent show contests, rolling into the room to ""I aint fraid of no ghosts,"" looking like Chippendale dancers with particle accelerators strapped to our backs. Or we were going around the world in the hot air balloon of the living room carpet. One was always Alvin, the charismatic chipmunk. One was Simon, the nerd. One was Theodore, who liked to eat. All the girls wanted to be Brittany.

Z’s place wasn’t the only place we knew. The parents liked to rotate. Us kids had a feeling for each. C’s was cool because it had a big screen projection TV and you could play big Nintendo. It had a basketball hoop out back and the patio was quartered into large concrete slabs perfect for 4-square. There were games of ping pong on the table out on the patio as the moths whirled around the flood lamps and got stuck in big bangs or flung themselves into mouths as we exclaimed: *Slam you! Bammo! Pfffth!* Another plus: C’s parents always had push up pops in their drop-in freezer and fun could be had pretending to push the kid who reached inside for one.

T’s place was like visiting the country, or what we understood the country to be. It was twenty minutes by car and sat on two acres, one of them wooded. It wasn’t really country, but at dusk the fireflies came out like it. Once one of the girls, S, caught thirty of them in a jar and cried when they were all dead in two hours.  
  
At T’s there were dogs kept in an outdoor pen and little bunny rabbits in the woods. At all the other houses the boys slept with the boys, the girls with the girls, but at T’s we huddled in the dark, on the living room’s pink 70s carpet, surrounded not by tacky wood panels but by the piney woods of the south. We told each other ghost stories by the light of a 4DD lamp and leapt at each other for shrieks and made it so not one of us could sleep. We kept telling stories until dawn, until our parents dragged us, bleary eyed, to the car where sleep would finally find us.  
  
The sleep ritual was always most stringent at C’s. The mom always came downstairs, stern and efficient (she had a game to return to). She was mother to all of us at that moment. We were made to brush our teeth (we each maintained a toothbrush there) and wash our faces. At C’s house there were only two cramped kid’s rooms so they put us kids in C’s and V’s beds, respectively. They had us boys lay horizontally across C’s queen size and we would jostle each other or hog the sheets or throw them on a surprise victim to dutch oven. Man, how flatulent we were. SBD’s and Bitbrrrrrrs and Atomic Fireballs and Chinese Firecrackers. V would come in and threaten to tell on us, on our gas and our guffawing. S and R and P would crowd around her, their faces gradually scrunching up in disgust around the point of their twitching noses.

We calmed ourselves, threw our hands over our mouths. We promised we would be good. Promise. And the girls went back to their room as we tried to eat our laughter. 

This sleeping arrangement continued for many years. I don’t remember exactly at what point it was decided we were too old for it. Or who decided this. With my feet hanging off the side of C’s bed, I was already beginning to feel suffocated by my life. Yet still I had no clue that this, all this glory, was doomed. Even lying there planning my eventual escape from childhood, it was not something that came to mind. That we would grow up to such an extent and grow apart, or that one of us would begin to smoke pot, or another would start sneaking off with one of the girls for sex. That some of us would have better things to do with their white friends and some would move far far away. Still thankfully inconceivable. And farthest from my scheming brain: that eventually we would keep in touch through the rare electronic missive, connected only by faded photograph and crumbling memory, and by the sound of those mah jong tiles being washed as we drifted to sleep.",0,1344582413,,0,False,1,c5qyahs,t3_xym4z,t1_c5qyahs,t3_xym4z,,1429600486,2196,False,AsianParentStories,t5_2u8j6,2196

Let me tell you a secret. 

Depression is a thing. OCD is a thing. Social Anxiety, all that shit. They exist. I'm not saying you don't have them, but for the vast majority of people I know who say that they're depressed, I have one response. 

You're not Depressed. You're FUCKING BORED. 

The human brain evolved over millions of years of running through jungles and fighting lions and killing shit. Today we sit here on reddit. Your brain doesn't have anything to do with itself. There aren't any lions. There are no more jungles. Our society has degraded itself into mental masturbation. Television, internet, media, movies, music. It's just fucking playing with yourself. 

We are bored, and we don't know how to handle it. You think you're depressed? Drop everything right now and go volunteer somewhere. Go feed the homeless, go to the wartorn starving heart of africa and build a fucking orphanege. You think you're depressed? Go look an AIDS stricken ex-child solider in the eye, and tell him you're depressed. Your problems? You don't fucking have problems, man. You have no idea.  

I challenge you, I'm calling you out. Go do something to make the world a better place for the people who have it worse than you. It can be something as small as picking up a homeless man and taking him to lunch somewhere. Or you can quit life and volunteer. And if after all that you're still ""depressed"" at least you have done something to make the world a better place. 

It's like this. Your problems are fucking stupid. That's the core of our belief. Your worries about if Becky thinks you're hot, or how you spend too much time online, it's fucking stupid. It's masturbation. Go fucking do something. Go do something beautiful.

True,gogge,topcontributor,CONSISTENT COMMENTER,"As rootale said, count calories. Coke zero, atkins bars and whetever else you eat shouldn't affect your fat loss unless they contain calories. If you aren't losing fat then just eat less, but make sure it's not just water retention. 

Fat loss and weight loss are two separate things, you'll have swings in weight loss but your fat loss is constant as long as you keep a caloric deficit. After you lose the initial water weight you'll slowly regain it as your body adapts to keto, this means that you can have rapid weight loss during the first three weeks and then a really slow loss (or plateau) for several weeks, sometimes months, when you gain back those 5-10 lbs of water. During all this time you're still losing fat if you're keeping a caloric deficit, the fluctuations is body weight (water, food in the digestive system) are just masking the fat loss.

Say you're at a caloric deficit of 500 kcal, the first three weeks you'll lose 21 \* 500  = 10,500 kcal, which is 10,500 / 3,500 = 3 pound of actual fat. On top of this you'll lose the 5-10 lbs of water, so you might see it as this:

Week 1: 5 lbs (-4 water, -1 fat)  
Week 2: 3 lbs (-2 water, -1 fat)  
Week 3: 2 lbs (-1 water, -1 fat)  
Week 4: 1 lbs ( 0 water, -1 fat)  
Week 5: 0 lbs (+1 water, -1 fat)  
Week 6: 0 lbs (+1 water, -1 fat)  
Week 7: 0 lbs (+1 water, -1 fat)  
Week 8: 0 lbs (+1 water, -1 fat)  
Week 9: 0 lbs (+1 water, -1 fat)  
Week 10: 0 lbs (+1 water, -1 fat)  
Week 11: 1 lbs ( 0 water, -1 fat)  
...

So you lose ""weight"" the first weeks as you lose both water and fat, and then at the fifth week you stall as you start gaining back the 6 lbs if water. If you gain back 1 lb of water weight per week you'll have six weeks of stalling before you start losing 1 lb per week again, and by that point you've actually lost those 10 lbs in real fat (four weeks of weight loss, six weeks of stalling, but actually losing 1 lbs of fat per week). You might gain back more water, or less water, or more rapidly, or less rapidly, you might seem to gain weight or only lose after plateaus.

I posted this in [another thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/t7htl/whats_the_cause_of_no_losses_despite_huge_calorie/c4k7dlt):

---

So it's not fat, what's more likely is that it's added water weight; glycogen stores refilling, higher sodium retention, higher insulin sensitivity (or chronic high cortisol), all these cause your body to retain water. It might also be a higher amount of food in your digestive system.

As long as you're keeping a decent caloric deficit you're losing fat, there's no way you're putting on actual fat mass (unless you have some metabolic disorder), and any water/weight gain is just masking the actual fat loss. So don't focus too much on the scale, it's just a number. Start measuring neck/waist/hips/etc. and see if those changes, or have a set of ""tight"" clothes that you can use to see if they fit better with time.

You can eat more to try and normalize cortisol and get your body to release the water, some have success with alcohol, some drink more water and get some electrolytes (sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium), some have to go super strict on carbs (or re-examine calories), some have to exercise, others just have to tough it out (if nothing else works) and the water retention reaches it's limit (like it was before keto) or it eventually drops (for females it might be part of their cycle).

True,Omegastar19,,,"I agree with your general comments, but you make a mistake regarding the influence of the rebel humans and 'the one'.  
  
&gt;The freed humans and ""the one"" had all proven repeatedly to be proponents of destruction. Six times before the matrix, both humanity and the machines were brought to the edge of extinction due to the actions of the one.   
  
This is not true. You are forgetting what the Architect told us at the end of the second movie. 'The one' is not a force for humanity. 'The one' was actually created by the machines themselves as a control-mechanism to fix the inherent flaw in the current matrix. The inherent flaw is that a tiny percentage of humans reject the matrix and free themselves. As the Architect says, these rebels 'constitute an escalating probability for disaster' (they will eventually become numerous enough to fuck shit up). The one was created by the machines as a way of controlling the rebellion by resetting the matrix while the machines destroy the rebel stronghold. The Architect himself says that ""We have become exceedingly efficient at it"". The machines's army in the third matrix movie even has the exact same number as the human population of Zion. Why not more? Because the machines have long since figured out precisely how many units they need to achieve victory. Note also that the entire real-world battle as portrayed in the 3rd movie has the machines relentlessly pressing on and winning. Even the few setbacks that the machines suffer are almost immediatly taken care off (First, when the first machine drill is destroyed, a second drill immediatly appears. Second, when the EMP pulse is employed, a new machine offensive begins soon after).  
  
Hell, I even wonder if the machines themselves created the foundations for Zion. You see, having all human rebels bunched up in one big city is VERY convenient if the machines wanted to destroy all human rebels in one stroke.  
  
&gt;Six times before the matrix, both humanity and the machines were brought to the edge of extinction due to the actions of the one.   
  
So, no, the machines have always held things perfectly in hand. The One is simply another 'system of control' for the Machines. The Architect explains as much.  
  
Off course, this leaves you with some important unanswered implications and questions. To explain things best, Ill offer this question:  
  
""Is the 'matrix cycle' depicted in the 3 movies any different from the previous 6 times when Zion was destroyed and the matrix was restarted?'  
  
The answer is yes.  
  
""In what way is this 'cycle' different?""  
  
The answer to this question seems quite logical to me. The difference between this cycle and all the other previous cycles is Smith. Agent Smith. It is quite clear from the way that the machines are completely helpless to defend against Smith in the 2nd and 3rd movies, that this is something they have never encountered before.  
  
""If Agent Smith's actions in this cycle are different then in the previous 6 cycles, what caused this?""  
  
Ok, now its gonna sound like Im making a very big leap here, but keep reading.  
  
The Oracle did it.  
  
How? She gave Neo a cookie in the first movie, and a candy in the second movie. The cookie especially is given a lot of attention in the first movie. This is not some random scene. There is more to the cookie then meets the eye. I believe the cookie in fact altered Neo. But how can a cookie alter Neo. Ok, now Im going to make another big leap, but bear with me.  
  
Neo is not entirely human. Remember what I said earlier about 'the one' being another system of control created by the machines? The Architect further said that 'previous incarnations of The One were made to identify with the entire human race (so that they would be guilttripped into choosing to save the human race instead of letting them die out when the Architect gives them the choice). The way the Architect says this sounds as if the identity of 'the one' was never a mystery to the machines - how else could they manipulate the one into identifying with the human race if they didn't know who he/she was.  
  
So how do the machines know who 'the one' is? Its simple. Modify him. Neo is not entirely human. Neo is part machine. More so than any other human. There is more proof for this theory. Remember the weird last scene of the 2nd movie where Neo is suddenly able to short-circuit a squiddy in real life? Remember when he does this on a much greater scale in the 3rd movie when he and trinity are heading to the Machine City? This can be explained if Neo is partially machine, and would therefore possibly possess the 'implants' needed to do what he did.  
  
So, Neo is part-machine. If this is true, it is likely that the machines simply put tracker's in Neo's body to track him in the matrix. Thus, the machines would always have been aware where Neo was, and would have been able to influence him.   
  
What does this have to do with the Oracle and the cookie? The Oracle knows that Neo is The One, and she knows that The One is partly machine - she knows this because she helped create this system of control in the first place. So what is the cookie? It is a code-altering device. The cookie changed Neo's code in order to influence him.  
  
So what did it do specifically? It subconsciously taught Neo how to break Agent Smith free. And it subconsciously inserted into Neo the instruction to actually break Agent Smith free. And Neo does so - he breaks Smith free at the end of the first movie, when he 'dives' into Smith. Note again, the clues that support this. Everything in the Matrix is made up of code. By 'diving' into Smith's body, Neo is infact 'entering' his code, thereby allowing him to change the code. Neo then changes Agent Smith into the monster he becomes in the 2nd and 3rd movies. Note that Neo himself is obviously not aware of what he is doing.  
  
So now we have the Oracle creating the nigh-unstoppable virus-Smith who nearly destroys both humanity and the machines! Why would the Oracle do this?  
  
The answer is simple. The Oracle wants peace between Humanity and the Machines. But as an isolated exile, she is powerless to influence the other Machines into changing things. Hell, the Architect perfectly represents this - he clearly dislikes the Oracle strongly.  
  
So, having no chance of convincing the other Machines, the Oracle creates a desperate gamble to end the vicious cycle once and for all. First, she created Smith in order to threaten the Machines' very existence. Then, as the second part of her gamble, she alters Neo once again, this time with a candy in the 2nd movie. The candy is actually the piece of code that gives Neo the power to destroy Smith.  
  
And thus, having put the Machines in a desperate situation, she now offers them the way out - Neo. However, Neo is only willing to help if the Machines make peace with Humanity. The Machines have no choice but to agree. Neo then destroys Smith (or rather, Neo provides the means to destroy Smith - notice how Neo is at first seemingly taken over by Smith, after which the Machines send a 'pulse' through Neo's real body, after which Smith is destroyed. Neo, as heartless as it sounds, was really nothing more than a tool used by the Oracle to obtain peace, and used by the Machines to save themselves).  
  
I will leave you with the final scene in the 3rd movie. The Oracle is sitting on a bench in the park watching the sunrise. The Architect approaches and says ""You played a dangerous game"".  
  
She did. She nearly destroyed both Humanity and the Machines in a desperate Gamble to end the vicious cycle of the Matrix. But she succeeded.

True,red0x,,,"$0.02:

Okay, hold up on all the ""she want's to cheat on you"" commentary. My wife and I talked about this recently while watching some porn together.  It doesn't necessarily mean anything, in and of itself.

An Open Relationship is an actual thing, that's not always or necessarily motivated by the desire to cheat.  The fact that she's talked to you about it says to me that she does NOT want to cheat, but in fact wants to discuss this with you, and do it WITH you, not TO you.  This is your number one advantage over people who just find out that their spouse cheated - you have the opportunity to go into this eyes open and aware, and possibly to SHARE in the experience of some strange... =)

Now, that said, Open Relationships are not for everyone.

Personally, I like to evaluate HUGE life decisions in a couple ways: emotionally, logically, and pragmatically.  They all play a very important role in your decision making process.

Emotionally: 

- You're probably a little hurt in at least one way. It may feel like she's not happy with you, your life together, or your sexual performance.  It's okay to have feelings.  She's inviting you to talk about it by bringing this topic up - TAKE HER UP ON THAT. Chances are, maybe you feel like she doesn't feel into you or your sex life or something.  Air all that out BEFORE you make any open-relationship level changes to your life.  Air it all out.

- If you're human, you're probably hurt that she flirted with someone else.  That's okay too.  Feelings are okay.  Talk about this too.

- Basically, get all your feelings about it out.  Don't try to SOLVE these feelings, just open out and TALK about them.  It's about SHARING.

Logically:

- Your wife is a human being, and human beings (evolutionarily speaking) were not evolved to be monogamous.  It really is a ridiculous thing to think that we'd spend our lives with just one partner.  We're made to breed. She probably feels this too, albeit maybe to less of an extent of a male.  (Not being sexists here, but I'm sure breeding is more pleasurable for males than females, given the whole birthing situation. And again, speaking evolutionarily (this is the logic section after all), there has been, until very recently, a VERY real chance of dying during child birth, and no birth control, so, evolutionarily, women who bred less were necessarily more likely to survive.  This might be why women tend to have less of a desire. Maybe).  Anyway, on with the logic section.  During this phase of decision making, turn off all emotion, and just evaluate with logic. Does her asking about your thoughts on an open relationship mean she's not happy?  No - that would imply a cause and effect relationship that has not been demonstrated.  They are unrelated.

- About her flirting: First of all, it's natural, and it's a (relatively harmless) way of being validated, for you both!  I don't know how old you both are, but I know that it's important to women in our modern society to feel sexy and beautiful, especially as they get older.  Flirting can help satisfy this.  **However**, giving out her number was a violation of trust.  You need to bring it up as such.  This is one case where you do need to SOLVE something.  If you're going to seriously dive into an open relationship, you need trust above all.  Doing something like this may be okay in some future, open relationship world, should you both choose that.  But in today's world, that was not an okay thing to do.  Don't guilt trip her or anything, but demonstrate that you have limits, and this was over the line.  Don't be a dick about it, just say it's not okay, and if we're going to do this, it needs to be above-board, truly open, and honest.  It's good that she told you right away, but you had not had any ""giving out her number"" discussion before hand, and that's what makes it a violation. Anyway, work on this trust thing before you actually go into an open relationship.

If it were me (and it's not, so come to your own conclusion): I would only proceed forward if she openly and honestly broke it off with this guy.  She should text him (or call him, if they've progressed to that stage) with you right there.  Something like apologizing that she broke her husband's trust (which should be more important than some strange), and that she wont be able to see/talk to this man anymore.  Otherwise, this one guy is going to be a thorn in your mental state, and trying to talk about or experiment with an open relationship is going to be confusing enough, without this guy running around in your mind.  He's got to be out of the picture. Even once you're in an open relationship, that ship has sailed.  You need to be clear on this.

- One last thing in the logic section: research.  Let's face it: most people in America, maybe even most people in the world, know shit-all about how a REAL, functional open relationship works (myself included - I have friends that are open, but I myself am not, and have not yet researched this topic in depth).  You wouldn't buy a house without a seriously thorough inspection would you?  Do the same for this level of lifestyle change.  Research - buy books about the topic and read them (one that comes up a lot, although I haven't read it myself, is ""The Ethical Slut"".  I'm sure there are others on the topic as well).  This will arm you with the most important thing in the world: KNOWLEDGE.

Okay, now the pragmatism section, a couple things to cover:

- First and foremost: STDs.  Man, this shit is real.  It's not like something you might see in porn (""oh hey, sex party!! alright!!!""  remember, those ""actors"" are tested A LOT), people out there have diseases, and they do not always give an honest answer when asked.  You need to be prepared for this with hard limits: always, always, always use a condom. The only person who doesn't have to use one is your spouse.  Anyone else - condom. If possible, get an actual screening on new partners from an MD or a clinic.  This is serious shit - gonorrhea is down to ONE last anti-biotic that works.  After that, it might end up being a death sentence.  Again, serious shit, treat it thusly.

- 2nd: you have kids.  Now, they should not *run* your life, but you need to think about them and be considerate, as they are involved in it.  How old are they?  How are you going to handle it when they ask why some lady comes over, screams loudly for about an hour, then leaves?  Or why mommy has so many male friends? Will you be open with your kids too? (meaning open in discussing your lifestyle with them, you dirty dogs...) Or will you try to shield them from it?  Again, this is serious shit.  Don't fuck up your kids. Both options listed above can have serious consequences that deserve your forethought. Think about and RESEARCH about how this might work BEFORE you go down this road.

- This may be a bit over the top, but I'm going to say it anyway.  Even if you have the happiest marriage in the world, there are people out there that want to steal your wife away.  Similarly, there are people that want to take you away from her. Even if these people know you're both open, there are greedy people in the world. You need a way to allow your spouse to interact with/evaluate your new, ahem, ""friends"" (actually, some of them may indeed grow to be actual friends - that's beside the point) to make sure there's no underhanded bullshit like this going on.  Again, this is about trust.  If you go this way, there's more than just the 2 of you who need to build trust. Each new partner needs to be in on the trust equation.

- Another thing: Given that this is complicated, especially with the above factored in, I would suggest (and this is just me), some form of legally binding agreement in the form of ""If everything goes to shit, we both get half, equal custody of the kids, no questions asked.""  You're married, so you have shared assets.  Face it.  Don't try to pull some ""well, this is my money, and that is yours"" crap.  If it goes to hell, split it.  You don't want her taking you to court because you got lazy and took home an STD do you?  Or vice versa - that shit cuts both ways.  Hopefully it wont come to that, but just in case, cover both your asses from yourselves.

Again, I don't really know shit about open relationships, but I think this way of approaching a decision is a good tool to be able to apply in any situation: emotional, logical, and practical evaluation of the pros and cons, add them all up, and if the number comes out positive - go for it.  Negative - not a good time.  Somewhere in the 1 -&gt; -1 range?  Maybe you need to do more talking, trust building, and/or research.

Also, one last thing: she's your wife, man.  You promised to cherish her in good times and bad.  Live up to that promise, try to shake off your hurt, talk about it, agree to let the WHOLE topic go undiscussed for a night or two to catch your breath, and **take her on a date**.  You still gotta love her, even if she's going in a new direction.  Take this as an opportunity to re-learn who your wife is.  People change all the time, and you made a promise to keep up when you got married!

Too many people pull the ""shit got weird: DIVORCE"" thing.  People make mistakes. People change. People grow in new directions.  It has the potential to be a really neat, beautiful life experience.  

**TL;DR: Don't abandon ship because there are ice bergs on the horizon.  Grab the damn Captain's Wheel like a real man and re-learn your wife and your marriage.**

**Life is weird: out weird it.**

Good luck!

There is no scientific evidence to support that hobo spiders are any more dangerous than other spiders, including other species of Tegenaria.  This myth only exists in the U.S.  The spiders are considered harmless in their native Europe, and in Europe there have been documented bites *without* necrosis.

To establish causality, you need evidence that one thing is associated with the other.  In this case, ""one thing"" is the spider bite, and ""the other"" is necrosis.  A spider bite is established when you see/feel a spider biting and catch it in the act, and subsequently identify the species.  There was one documented bite in a Spokane woman who had another medical condition that coincidentally is associated with dermonecrotic lesions.  That doesn't count.  In another incident, they blamed a spider they found on a railroad track beside the victim's house.  Please.  When you get a necrotic lesion, you can't just search the neighborhood and blame the nearest arthropod.  This is not how science works.  Also, these incidents were some 20 years ago.  If anything, the population of hobos has increased and spread since then.  If the threat is worth warning people about, you would expect evidence that anyone has been bitten - but there isn't any.  *Not a single instance*.

[One study in rabbits](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3576638) found that their venom causes necrosis in rabbits (well, in one species of rabbit but not another species).  Rabbit physiology is different from human physiology, and several venoms are known to affect some mammals and not others.  Furthermore, in that study, the spiders could not even be provoked to bite.  The researchers tried their best to piss off the spiders and get them to bite, and they wouldn't.  The researchers ended up extracting the venom and injecting it into the rabbits themselves.  Thus, the amount of venom administered in a real bite may not be comparable - if you can even get one to bite.

For the spider to be harmless in Europe, but necrotic in the Pacific Northwest, some theories were proposed:

1) the separate populations evolved different venoms 

2) they carry different microbes that are responsible for lesions or 

3) arachnophobic Americans were quick to latch onto early erroneous reports and repeated them so much they became common knowledge.

Theories 1 and 2 were debunked by [Binford, et al, 2001](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=binford%20toxicon%20tegenaria%202001).

Theory 3 is also supported by the fact that physicians in states/provinces where hobos do not exist attribute necrotic wounds to hobo spiders.  Hobos get blamed where hobos do not exist, just like brown recluses get blamed even in Alaska, several thousand miles away from any brown recluse.

For more on this topic see:

It's a cognitive bias where people choose to see the world in a way that people get what they deserve in life. People have a vested interest in rationalising injustice so they can feel safer and more in control of their lives. 

Most people will turn a blind eye to suffering or look for excuses to blame the victim. People pretend not to see the homeless, or accuse the unemployed of choosing a life of ""ease"" at their expense. Their minds can't handle the existence of injustice. 

A fair number of vulnerable people also have a tendency to blame themselves, even when they haven't done anything wrong. They ultimately want to believe they can end their suffering by ""correcting"" their behaviour, and they're extremely impressionable when the previous group gets involved and tells them what they want to hear- that they can be made better people and that comfort is a few short steps away.

Those who experience phenominally good fortune (or perhaps great privilege and power) rationalise it by creating a self-image of themselves as the saviours of the world; there to lead the idle and useless masses out of the darkness.

It would not surprise me in the slightest to find out that little Kim believes his own hype, and that he sees himself as the god-like figure the media portray him as.

He's surrounded by corrupt and cowardly generals who are too afraid to tell him the truth and don't want to lose status (or end up dead). They may be more aware of the true situation having witnessed it, but like most people just want to get on with things with the minimum of fuss. They play his game of let's pretend while at work, go home, and probably whinge about him to their wives.

The general public just want to get on with things too by doing their day's work and then returning home to see their families. The more informed of them probably play the game as the generals do, but the more vulnerable and insecure of them really do believe him to be a god because it's the most comfortable thing to believe to explain what's going on.

While the state may give them the right nudge, it's the people who brainwash themselves. North Koreans are the same as anyone else when it comes to confronting reality.

People around the world do the same thing. Look at how many people support the system *we* live in, where our resources and living space are controlled by an unelected minority that we need permission from before we can share them.

I started it because I like writing flash fiction, and I like talking to people, and while I could hand-write them, the typewriter is more eye-catching, and a lot more fun. And my hands don't get as tired. I write a story in about 7-10 minutes, and if people would like to ask for specific themes or characters or situations, they are more than welcome.

You can follow me on twitter: @rovingtypist. I go out to the High Line once a week or so.

(and for those who mentioned it, I did indeed have an iPhone with me. AND an iPad. But those don't really matter for what I was doing.)

(Oh, and someone mentioned they saw me in Starbucks - I would never do this inside a cafe. Typewriters are super loud.)

True,_Old_Man_Jenkins_,,,"Story time, children. Gather round.

Many years ago, when I was in high school, I worked at a movie theater. Allow me to preface the story by saying that I pride myself on my ability to accomplish tasks that I find unpleasant. My parents own several section 8 rental properties around Youngstown, and I had been roped into innumerable ""This house is a mess, we're not paying anyone to clean it, we feed you, here's a bucket, get started"" adventures in my short life. I had dealt with festering diapers left in the open air for months in summer, rotten food, spoiled milk, animal corpses, used hypodermics, anything you could imagine. Cleaning the grease trap in the concession area did not phase me. I was woefully unprepared this day.

I arrived in my polo shirt and slacks through the lobby entrance as some of the theaters were letting out. I could tell immediately something was amiss. One of the managers had put the caution tape we normally used to mark defective chairs over the door to the women's restroom, and was standing in front of the door looking worried. When a patron would try to enter, the manager would stop them, nod apologetically, make a brief ""mia culpa"" gesture with her hands, and usher them away. When she saw that I had arrived, her eyes immediately brightened and she waved emphatically for me to come over.

""Jenkins,"" she said, ""You want to do something for me? There's gas cards in it for you.""

This should have been my tip off. Gas cards were highly prized commodities in the theater, being given only for the most exemplary service. To receive multiple gas cards was unheard of.

""How many gas cards?"" I asked.

""Three.""

""What do you want me to do?""

""There's a mess in the first stall. I want you to clean it up.""

""Sure, no problem,"" said 17 year old me, ready to earn the easiest 30 bucks in gas cards of my life. I was naive, and did not expect the horrors that awaited me.

I was allowed entry into the women's restroom, and the first thing I noticed was the smell. It was the foulest thing I have ever smelled to this day. Imagine that a dozen homeless people are filming a scat porn with a dead dolphin inside a sweat lodge inside a paper mill next to the Jersey River in August. That pales in comparison to the unholy aroma permeating the room; its soft pink tiles ironic in the face of such an insidious odor.

After leaving the room to get a lungful of fresh air, I held my breath and proceeded to open the stall door there. What I was to bear witness to was a travesty. What had been done to that stall could not have been done by any creature, human or animal, but rather some breed of deranged shit demon conjured from the 8th circle of hell for the sole purpose of wreaking psychopathic excrement torture on the souls of the living. 

Before me sat what I would estimate to be about two gallons of sludge-like human waste, coating the area immediately surrounding the toilet as if it had been somehow weaponized. It had caked the toilet, formed a 3 foot halo around the toilet, splattered and stuck to the back wall, caked itself onto the toilet paper dispenser, seeped into the little bin used for sanitary napkin disposal, and caked itself in a Pollock-esque pattern on the stall doors. Amongst the refuse, draped over the toilet's handle and pump was a medium-sized woman's cardigan that had originally been white, but appeared to have been subjected to a profane fecal tie-dye. To imagine this volume of crap being expelled from a living thing's anus in such volume and with such velocity as to form the specific pattern of disaster in front of me was to break the natural and physical laws of the universe. To look into that first stall was to look upon the face of God, and know with certainty that he is an angry and terrible God. Beware ye who would fight monsters, for when one stares into the shit abyss, the shit abyss stares back.

I left the restroom to prepare for my struggle against the cesspool. I donned gauntlets of nitrile, blue and sterile as the cleanest lagoon. From a hefty bag, I fashioned a hauberk and adorned my shoes and shins with packaging from frozen pretzels, held securely in place with rubber bands. I gathered 8 rolls of paper towels, three additional hefty bags, a mop and two extra mop heads, a bucket, and two gallons of green, undiluted industrial strength disinfectant. To finish my raiment, I stole the face mask from the blood born pathogen kit and doused it in industrial air freshener so that I could smell pine groves clearly when it was extended to arms length.

The battle began and raged for two hours that passed in a blur. I lost all sense of time. I forgot my hopes and dreams. I forgot my name. In retrospect, this may have been because I had doused a face mask in aerosol air freshener and was higher than an entire Phish concert.  I scrubbed. I worked. I cursed. The battle raged on, and new enemies were discovered. In addition to the cardigan, there was a pair of formerly pink ankle socks. Anything that was not held in place by bolts or mortar had to be removed and destroyed.

In the end, I was victorious. I lost a lot of good men. The mop and mop bucket died valiantly in the effort, and were given a burial with full honors in the dumpster behind the theater. Because they were not proud men, and the general manager had a fragile temperament, whenever she inquired about them afterwards I maintained that they were lost. They would have wanted it that way.

I went on to leave the theater for college later that year, but the employees still talk of it to this day. I am the shitslayer.

TL;DR: It is untrue that girls do not poop.

If you start with moderate intensity and then progressivley increase it, you body will be able to adapt better.  

The presumption about the need for carbs to build muscle is wrong.  I usually recommend that people get 50-150 grams of carbs a day in order to ensure adequate thyroid health.  Even that can be lowered.  Extra protein will also protect you thyroid so if you go the low end on the carbs, just increase your protein some.

For fuel, fat works as well as carbs and your body can build muscle without the carbs.   There really is no reason to stop eating the way you are doing.

1. I think you have some good ideas and I like your general philosophy regarding government and politics, namely having integrity and being upfront and open with its citizens. [(Source)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yj2p2/i_am_amazons_1_nonfiction_reviewer_of_all_time_in/c5wliuj)

2. I think some of your theories sound very plausible and could very likely be true.  There's no doubt you are well read and have researched a lot of this stuff with a fair level of detail.  I don't doubt you worked for the CIA but I'll tell you this much, you are not in a unique position to confirm all your theories as correct just because you worked at the CIA.  That's just not how the intelligence community works.  Don't get me wrong, I'm sure there is much the CIA and government is hiding and certainly things of questionable ethics, morals and judgement.  I'm sure decisions were made based on personal gain and also people that may have been well intentioned but misguided in achieving an end result.

3. You're obviously on reddit to add to your fan base and promote your political platform.  I don't see anything terribly wrong with that and as I stated before I actually kind of like some of the ideas you promote in your political platform but I can't in good conscience trust you. 

Here's where the bug crawled up my ass.  Mixed in with your legitimate theories and ideas are ludicrous and outlandish ones that you have no proof of and you state confidently as fact and conveniently can't prove because it's a government coverup with sources to your website which are book reviews of other conspiracy theorists.  You act like an expert in everything and you patently confirm every conspiracy theory placed before you on this thread because you've ""reviewed"" hundreds of ""non-fiction"" books that are not even peer reviewed at any level.

I can kind of see where you were trying to go and what you were trying to achieve but you've lost yourself along the way and I don't know if you're just willing to do anything to garner more support for your political platform or you're drunk with the attention you're receiving but the levels of corruption and depths of deception for the more outlandish theories you are presenting as true are not possible no matter how much kool-aid gets passed around.

This is not the way to gather support for your cause, by embracing the very tactics that you are trying to expose in others.

* Do a little research on which advanced job you would like to play, and focus on just a few.
* Try your best to keep your skills capped. Meaning, weapons, magic, etc. 
* Beehive chips are a great way to make early money. Beeswax is and always will be in huge demand.
* Always get Signet.
* Get a hold of all of the teleport grag key items.
* Open up all maws to the past. (This may be difficult for low level players, getting some help with some of these may be needed)
* DO NOT discard beastman/kindred seals and crests. There is an NPC that can store these when you are ready to use them.
* FFXI has a great macro system for new players, but terrible for advanced players. Learning to use the macro system for spells and abilities will improve the way you play.

True,Nerdlinger,NFLBrowns,,"**Part I of IV, for length reasons**

No, it's a case of ""this is the first time he's ever had to actually fight evidence rather than procedure, so he quit"".  That write-up is so full of BS and one-sided that I wouldn't be surprised if it was written by a member of Lance's PR squad (I also find it interesting that that account was created the day of Lance's hearing with Judge Sparks).

Some examples of the errors/bias:

&gt; It's essentially a private organization making its own rules

Well, it's a private organization making up rules that comply with the WADA Code as is required for all nations that wish to compete in the Olympics

&gt; so the Federal court ruled that they didn't have jurisdiction. Kind of like if a private school gives you a punishment for running in the halls even though you didn't; none of that is up to the courts.

Indeed. Just like a business can make up their own code of conduct and it's not the courts' business.  So what?

&gt; Everyone KNOWS he won the titles, so ""stripping"" him of them is basically saying ""nuh-uh!""

This is a bit like saying that everyone KNOWS Rosie Ruiz won the Boston Marathon because they saw her cross the finish line first.  If he won the competition through illegal means then stripping him is not saying ""nuh-uh"", it's saying ""you cheated and don't get to keep the title"".

&gt; Also the UCI (International Cycling Union) disagrees with USADA, and it's only because of some very poorly-thought-out reciprocal agreements that this can even happen.

And the UCI is an organization with [some very shady people at the top](http://www.cyclismas.com/2012/08/the-myth-of-the-uci-it-is-time-for-a-change/) (the president is actually [serving a lifetime ban from the IOC for a rules violation he says he would break again every time he had the choice](http://www.cyclesportmag.com/features/interview-who-is-pat-mcquaid-and-why-is-he-running-our-sport/)) who actually have a vested interested is not just protecting Lance, but in being lax on dopers.

And I don't know he thinks that ""it's only because of some very poorly-thought-out reciprocal agreements that this can even happen."" UCI is free to disagree all they want, and those reciprocal agreements (article 15.4 of the [WADA Code](http://www.wada-ama.org/Documents/World_Anti-Doping_Program/WADP-The-Code/WADA_Anti-Doping_CODE_2009_EN.pdf)) allow them to appeal the decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) if the disagree strongly enough).  I'm not sure what he feels a better reciprocal agreement would do? Bar UCI from disagreeing? Not allow them an official avenue of appeal?

&gt; Basically WADA has agreements with the major sports bodies, but then ALSO gave all its ""franchises"" (each country's __ADA) its same powers, meaning that ANY franchisee in ANY country can start proceedings against anyone anywhere, regardless of their ability to defend themselves in that venue.

This is actually, quite untrue. The rules of jurisdiction are well laid out in the WADA Code (in particular section 15).  Basically, you have jurisdiction over events that happen in your country (international events like the Olympics have their own ADA that presides over the games), or over athletes that are competing under the auspices of their nation's governing body for their sport (in Armstrong's case, this is USA Cycling).  However, they also have jurisdiction over trainers and doctors that are working with athletes under their jurisdiction.  This last bit comes from [UCI's own anti-doping rules](http://www.uci.ch/Modules/BUILTIN/getObject.asp?MenuId=&amp;ObjTypeCode=FILE&amp;type=FILE&amp;id=NDc3MDk&amp;LangId=1) which extend to:

&gt; a) Any Person who, without being a holder of a license, participates in a cycling Event in any capacity whatsoever, including, without limitation, as a rider, coach, trainer, manager, team director, team staff, agent, official, medical or para-medical personnel or parent and;
&gt;
b) Any Person who, without being a holder of a license, participates, in the framework of a club, trade team, national federation or any other structure participating in Races, in the preparation or support of riders for sports competitions;

But let's continue with his complaints:

&gt; USADA started this off with banning several doctors and staff who are EUROPEAN CITIZENS for life because they didn't respond within 5 days or whatever the requirement is to this U.S.-based inquisition.

Actually, they started it off with an investigation and then the [filing of charging letters](http://documents.latimes.com/usada-charging-letter-lance-armstrong/). In the charging letters, the accused are given ten days to respond to USADA if they wish to challenge the accusations.  Three of the accused, Dr. Michele Ferrari, Dr. Louis Garcia del Moral and Pepe Marti did not respond and USADA issued sanctions against them including lifetime bans.  The other three, Armstrong, Dr. Pedro Ceyala, and Johan Brunyeel asked for, and were granted 30 day extensions to the response deadline.  Pepe Marti later asked that he be allowed to challenge the accusations and USADA complied, setting aside their earlier sanctions and allowing him to go to arbitration.

Note that their being european citizens is of no consequence.  Brunyeel is the director of a team that participates in USA Cycling events and the rest are pulled into USADA's jurisdiction by UCI's own ADR.  **addendum:** Additionally, if you have a problem with USADA sanctioning European citizens, why do you argue in favor of UCI, a Swiss organization, being able to sanction non-Swiss athletes like Armstrong?

True,Donny_Brook,,,"Two years ago my pop-in-law was diagnosed a terminally ill with cancer, I was with him that day in the doctors office and it was a difficult moment for him. I promised him on the way home that we'd put up a fight no matter what the Doc said, and that I'd be there with him and see it through no matter what happened or how it ended. 
For the next year he put up a courageous struggle and I was his caregiver for that year. 
My wife was there too and very attentive but her Dad was a man and for that reason alone had a different relationship with me and felt more comfortable with another man in some situations. As he got sicker I tended every single one of his needs as promised, appt's, treatments,  right up to the point of him being 100% bedridden. I learned to administer meds, feed someone through a feeding tube and a lot of other duties that don't need to be expanded on. 
The day he died I held his hand and comforted him while I played some of his favorite music on the radio. 
I'm in my fifties and have done a whole lot of fighting, fucking, and generally a load of shit that might be written here as badassery, but keeping my word and helping another man through a very difficult transition with some dignity and pride is what has made me feel more like a bad ass than anything else in the world.
You want to feel like a real bad ass, go find someone sitting alone in a chemo ward waiting for treatment and with them, try to make them  feel not so alone. That's some serious badass shit.",0,1346347114,,0,False,1,c610x0b,t3_z2nhy,t1_c610x0b,t3_z2nhy,,1429775026,1441,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,1441

True,rupert1920,chem,Nuclear Magnetic Resonance,"The Curiosity rover actually won't be actively looking for _life_, but rather compounds required for life. So it wouldn't know if it has scooped up bacteria or a complex mix of organic compounds, as the analysis method will destroy the unfortunate bugger anyways - the mass spectrometer will break everything into fragments.

Of course, you can still ask the same question - how do we know the organic compounds aren't from Earth?

The Curiosity rover does have some calibration solids for this. These solid bricks are made with fluorinated organic compounds - very rare in nature - and Curiosity will begin by taking samples from these solids using the same method of sample collection and analysis, as if it were taking a sample from soil - drilling, GC-MS, etc. If the analysis shows that there are organic compounds other than the fluorinated controls, then we know there are stowaway organic compounds from Earth somewhere on the instrument.",0,1346417240,,0,False,1,c61f4sg,t3_z4j4n,t1_c61f4sg,t3_z4j4n,,1435687500,71,False,askscience,t5_2qm4e,71
