TRUE,TMobotron,,,"I want to continue a bit where he left of, since dubstep has been around for over a decade now and he only got into how it started. I've followed it pretty closely and done a lot of research so I think I did a decent job of explaining it here. Hopefully I can save some of you some confusion and time researching and looking into it by consolidating what I've learned here. I added youtube links for most of it if you wanna check some of the tracks out. HD wherever I could find it, but I couldn't for a few of them. Wall of motherfucking text here, but it's broken down into sections with bolded headers, so feel free to read just what you want (or none at all). First off:

**A small tweak/correction to Bassnectar's description**

He does a good job explaining most of it, but I didn't like that he said two-step was kind of like R&amp;B and that dubstep is R&amp;B, or two-step, with dub samples. Two-step garage is it's own entire genre and style of music, and producers looking to push the boundaries added the rolling bass vibes of dub (not dubstep) to make the sparse deep sound that the original dubstep artists have.

**Dubstep**

The original sound was sparse, bassy, half-step 140 bpm tracks that had a dark vibe. There were some jaw-dropping tracks in this style, like [Darkstar - Round Ours](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7GTdcaNdGw) and Skream's [Dutch Flowerz](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlnH17ozylI&amp;hd=1). It transformed into the modern popular sound because artists were trying to make it more aggressive. Big drops were good, and artists tried to make them a bit heavier by adding distortion to their basslines. It transformed from the deeper sound to tracks like [Coki-Spongebob](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-ltsvi4ojM&amp;hd=1) or [Distance's metal influenced sound](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOFd0G6lAvI&amp;hd=1). Basically tracks that were still really bass heavy and focuses on the low end, but had some distortion in more mid-range frequencies to add some aggression. But the important distinction is that the focus is on the low end still at this point.

Then it took the logical next step and more focus was put on that distorted mid-range sound, like Rusko/Caspa stuff like from the fabriclive mix they did ([Jahova](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJxbEwt7NhE&amp;hd=1), [Too Far](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54QoAKvZGok), etc.). [Cockney Thug](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4skrhmg7apo&amp;hd=1) was absolutely huge, and the focus was on the horns and not the basslines. Those catchy horns dominated the mix, and they were catchy as hell which caught a lot of attention. That started a big change from a more bass-oriented sound to a sound that focused a lot on mid-range and catchiness over deep sparse vibes. The focus was now on the mid-range sound and not the low end, but there's still a massive dub-like bassline in tracks like Cockney Thug and [the caspa remix](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuR6YE9sgiI&amp;hd=1).

Finally producers caught on more that they could fill the space in the track with catchy mid-range stuff, or really distorted synth lines that were heavy, like in [Flux Pavilion's ""I Can't Stop](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJlA3Fn868w&amp;hd=1). Some artists that really mastered the style absolutely blew up (skrillex, zeds dead, bassnectar, flux pavilion, etc.). A lot of producers still put a lot of focus on the low end, and have really nice sub-bass going under all the other mids and highs. But since the focus is now almost completely on the mid-range stuff and the widest audience doesn't have a system that necessarily re-creates the bass side of tracks, you get dubstep tracks with drops that squeal and yoi but don't necessarily growl or rumble. It's not a universal issue because a lot of producers still understand the power and necessity of the low-end. But that loss of the bass-driven sound makes it a big departure from the original style. 

It doesn't have to be a bad thing. There are incredible old-school dubstep tracks and incredible new dubstep tracks. But this is what brings in a lot of debate because the old-school fans hate the huge departure that happened, especially since that distanced sound is what blew up.

The problem now is that the genre went from dark and deep to deep and heavy, to heavy, to REALLY heavy. Since the focus is on heaviness now, there's nowhere else to go from here. When Skrillex's [Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MPwQLyaiqw&amp;hd=1) track came out, it was huge. It got a lot of hate, but it was a big track and extremely heavy. Now he's releasing EPs full of the same tricks, but there's nothing new to them, and it's actually quite a bit worse. He does everything he can to ruin what could've been a sweet Wolfgang Gartner track on their collab for Skrill's new EP, [The Devil's Den](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGNHLc4FWwA). Artists don't know where to go from here, so they try to make these really squealy drops or throw a gimmick in to catch the listener's attention. The majority of tracks follow a strict formula: Build-up section, then the drums double tempo, double tempo again (and possibly again), everything exits and a (usually vocal) sample enters, then the track hits you with everything it has. So the genre has stagnated pretty hard, and there's a lot of negativity surrounding it because almost everything that comes out now is a re-hash or worse (but there are exceptions of course).

It's important to note that artists didn't stop making the old-school sound in this time. There are still a ton of producers pushing that style, such as Kryptic Minds who just dropped a nicely sparse and bassy album this year. But in that same way, this sound obviously stagnated a bit as well. There are still tracks and artists that are doing more experimental things though, and since the focus isn't just on being as heavy as possible, the genre is less constricted to evolve. The artists that are trying to add new and different things to the genre are the ones behind the movements of:

TRUE,libertas,,,"I used to think this. I am a very big proponent of free speech, so I figured this was an extension of that. It isn't.

There is actually a very important reason to ban them. There is a natural process at work that WILL reduce the quality of content of any rapidly expanding subreddit without action. As a 6+ year reddit user, I have seen it happen **again and again and again**.

If we don't make a decision **now** about the kind of community we want to have here, the subreddit will eventually become overrun with lowest common denominator type bullshit like memes and image macros. Right now there's still a lot worth saving, but there's not much time left. We are at the tipping point, and it's starting to run away from us as we speak.

Why and how does this process happen?

Meme comments by their nature attract upvotes easily, because they are short and can be read quickly, are funny and clever at first, inspire an 'in joke' sort of feeling (if you're cool and get it, you upvote). We'll call this LOW-EFFORT CONTENT. Longer, more insightful comments, the kind that makes this one of my favorite subreddits, take longer to read, you don't always agree with them, and in general require much more effort from the reader to earn upvotes. We'll call this HIGH-EFFORT CONTENT.

So to begin with, even in a community that is naturally biased against memes, they have a competitive advantage over interesting comments.  So even if most people in the subreddit are against memes, they can still rise to prominence, because it's just easier to read and upvote them. 

Second, this effect is greatly exacerbated when new users who don't get the ethos of the subreddit join. They are far more likely to engage in low effort upvoting behavior. **Once a subreddit reaches a certain critical mass, low effort content beats high effort content, every time.** It sucks, but that's how it is. So you have to make a choice about which you would rather have.

As a subreddit gets diluted with more new users, the high-effort, mind expanding comments are overwhelmed by low effort jokes, and valuable contributors become discouraged and stop contributing as much. Once they start gaining a toehold, people writing and reading mind-expanding comments are going to look elsewhere, and as the size of the subreddit expands people will spend more time contributing memes, because that's what works. All of a sudden you have a crap subreddit.

It's a really poisonous process that has ruined many a subreddit. What we have learned is that unless you have a very clear vision of the kind of subreddit you want to have, and moderate accordingly, you will eventually end up with a memebin. /r/askscience has been very successful in maintaining the quality of their subreddit as subscribers have increased, because they insist that only science gets posted in /r/askscience, and anything that isn't gets removed. Their achievement is really quite incredible. Almost 250,000 users and every article and comment is thought-provoking, intelligent and on-topic.

*I hereby propose that only thought-provoking, mind-expanding articles and comments are appropriate in this subreddit.* It's why I come here. This is subjective and obviously needs elaboration, but if we don't make this choice now, we are choosing to have dumbed down memes, jokes, pictures, etc as the primary content in this subreddit, with interesting stuff being mostly relegated to the sidelines. It WILL happen in 2012. It's just a matter of time. The process really starts to pick up speed around 10,000 subscribers.

Moderators, you need to step up. Only you can stop this from happening.

P.S.  If you like psychedelic memes, there's probably enough of an audience now to support a psychonautmemes reddit or something like that. Somebody start one.

If the outside temperature was 48, it would require twice as much energy to heat a home to 62 as it would to 55.  If it were -15 it would require only about 10% more to bring the temp up to 62 compared to 55.  However, its still roughly the same amount of energy use in either case.

55 won't hurt anything in the house UNLESS you have a crawl space with water pipes that can get 25-30 degrees colder than the house above when its -40.  As long as your pipes don't freeze, it's OK for the house to be cold.

That being said, 55 is insanely cold if one person is miserable.  You are not a spoiled bitch, and your SO is being very selfish in not recognizing the value of your comfort over a reasonable amount of money.  

Do you own?  If so get better/more insulation.  Put 2""-4"" of rigid foam insulation between the sheathing and siding.  

If you rent or own; windows suck heat right out of your house.  Curtains help heat loss.  Double foil bubble insulation will quickly pay for itself; just block off a few big windows with it.  Seal all drafts in doors and windows.

TRUE,ekster,,,"&gt;Kind of like how the founders of reddit have seen it go on to become something great and successful.

The difference being is that Reddit created a service, this site, and they have got to see it become something great and successful. What Cinsere is failing to realize, is that people would be just as pissed off if they learned that the admins of reddit were doing things like he did. Imagine if reddit admins said they were making a non for profit. They would get tons of donations. Now, if they neglected to mention that there technically isn't a non for profit just yet, and there is nothing legally binding them to be transparent with the money, and that the money is basically controlled by one person who may or may not do anything ethical with it, we would all be pissed off. 

He should have come out as soon as he had these ideas. Explain to the userbase what he intended on doing, and be completely transparent about it all. I think the reason so many people are upset is because they feel betrayed. They join a sub-reddit expecting like minded people, and when you neglect to inform them the totality of your actions, they are going to feel as if you personally lied to them. 

What gets me, and it seems a lot of others, is how entitled Cinsere comes across. 'well, I do consciously spend literally like 12 hours a day here and I deserve something for it' . When you start defending your actions by trying to get other people to feel sorry for you, or appreciative because of all the 'hard work you do' you have already lost. Right now it seems like his is grasping at anything he can hold on to, to make it seem like he isn't in the wrong. 

Cinsere, you aren't providing a service. You are providing your time to a group of people who are supposedly like minded. You are providing your time because you want to, not because you should get compensated for all your hard work. People don't want excuses, they want accountability. If you are willing to profit from the group, who is to say that you won't decide to profit off of the non profit? Well, you certainly deserve to get paid for all the 'hard work' you put in to creating it and learning about all the 'boring legal documents'. 

Don't do something if you aren't passionate about it. Money should always take the back burner when it comes to creativity. You don't own this sub reddit any more than you own your own body. One day you will die, and so will this place. What will stick in the minds and hearts of people is your actions and words, so choose both carefully.

I feel for people who get lynched by reddit, they are an unforgiving bunch. Really though, you have to examine your motives and this whole situation. It takes a lot to get ents pissed off, and it takes even more to get them to not just sit back and be stoned out of their trees. You have motivated a lot of people to dislike you and what you are putting yourself out to be. You probably aren't that bad of a guy in real life, or on here. I'm not here to judge you, just trying to empathize with every ones position, even yours. 

The only thing you can do now is PR damage control. Write a letter apologizing and donating all the money you made to a non profit agency (one that currently exists), back track on all the ads you have done, hold the money you have accountable until the non profit is up, or step down. People already have their pitchforks out for you, so calmly debating and trying to get people to empathize with your side of the story is clearly failing. 

I hope you can see the errs of your ways, and not take all of this so personally (even though that is easier said than done). It seems like a lot of people are trying to get you to clue in to exactly what it is that everyone is pissed off about, and what you have done. Unfortunately all you have really done is tried to defend yourself by explaining how much you do for the community, how it wouldn't be here without you, blah blah blah.

TRUE,ComebackShane,,,"This is a story I wrote about one of the many interesting things that happened to me during my short tenure as a waiter at Denny’s:

The ceiling fans lazily spun as I cleaned off one of my tables; a young couple with two energetic toddlers had just occupied it, and unfortunately for me, they opted to go ahead and have dessert — a banana split. I think they took pity on me as I saw they added a hefty 25% on their credit card as a tip. Thoughtful of them, but I’d have preferred 15% in cash, so at least I wouldn’t have to report that tip as income on my taxes. Not that I would ever recommend you cheat on your taxes. No sir!

As I cleaned up the chocolate syrup and puddles of ice cream, I saw a young woman, no more than thirty, walk in alone. She held her arms crossed and close to her body, nor looking up as she passed through the double doors. She was dressed in a black pants, and a black button-down blouse, nice but not dressy. She had long, curly brunette hair. She was pretty, but not beautiful. I couldn’t tell for sure, but I had the feeling she was a woman who’d had a long day. I could relate.

I finished resetting my table and walked back behind the counter to drop off my rags, while our hostess Tara greeted the woman with her usual cheer, which is to say, not very much. Tara sat the woman at table 3, over in the corner, which seemed to suit the woman just fine. I instinctively cringed as I realized she was most likely a ‘steader. ‘Steaders (ala homesteaders) were what we called customers who would come in, usually alone, and order a cup of coffee or a slice of pie, then proceed to sit around for hours; reading a book, scribbling in a notepad, or cramming for a midterm.

It wasn’t that they were any trouble, quite the opposite, but they did cut into your tips for the night. If you got hit with a ‘Steader, they would take that table out of circulation for half your shift; costing you nearly a third of your total tips for the night. For a 19 year-old trying to save up for his first car, this was almost a capital offense.

Resigned to my fate, I walked up to the table. I could see she hadn’t looked at the menu, it was still resting where Tara had placed it. “Something to drink?” I asked, pulling out my pad on the off-chance she wanted to order the steak and shrimp.

“Just coffee. And a slice of chocolate cake, please.” Maybe a really long week.

I put my blank pad back in my apron, and typed in the order on the computer. Tara gave me an apologetic smile and a shrug as she served the coffee for me. Least she could do, I suppose. I went to the chiller to pull out the cake. I cut out the slice, placed it on a plate and licked some chocolate off my fingers.

As I washed my hands, I looked up and saw the lady lazily stirring her sugar into the coffee, her chin resting on one hand. I realized she must have had a bad month.

I walked the cake over, and gave her the customary “Anything else” as I was starting to turn away. She looked up at me for the first time, and I was immediately stopped by her murky brown eyes. They betrayed a weary, torn existence. It was patently clear she had not had a very good year.

“Could I have a candle?” She managed a sheepish smile, and in spite of myself I grinned back.

“Your birthday?” I asked, hoping maybe I could keep that smile of hers going a little longer.

She shook her head, and her dark, curly hair fell like a shadow over half of her face. Her eyes darted down to the table, and then back up to me. “My husband’s. He would be 35 today.”

Ah, crap. I thought. Hey Shane, how does that Reebok taste? Maybe you should get it out of your mouth before you gag on it. “I-I’m sorry. I didn’t—” Brilliant save; you’re a regular T.S. Elliot, you wordsmith you.

“Don’t worry, it’s fine.” She flashed that smile again.

“I’ll see what I can do. You want the trick ones that come back on?” Okay, you’re not allowed to talk anymore.

I spent the next 5 minutes tearing up the offices and storeroom, but to no avail. I grabbed Tara after she finished seating a party of teens from the high school band coming in after a competition, and asked her to go to the Target across the street, and pick a pack of candles up for me. “Here’s a twenty” I said. “Keep the change, just get it, please.” She tried to protest, but when I explained it to her, she was gone and back before I knew it.

I brought the package over, placed the candle on the cake and lit it. The lady looked at it for few seconds, closed her eyes, and blew it out. Tara peeked over from behind my shoulder, almost in tears. I couldn’t blame her.

Don’t. Don’t ask it. I told myself. You don’t want to know. “So what’d you wish for?” Dumbass!

She looked up at me again, those eyes were almost too much to bear. “Happiness” she said.

Ouch. You think that made her feel any better, genius? “Well, I-I’m sure you’ll get it.” Real reassuring, good one. “I heard a story once—” I stammered, and then kneeled down at the end of the table, so we were at eye level.

I went on. “It was about an ancient Chinese Emperor who commissioned his three wisest men to come up with one single phrase that would apply to all occasions. The story goes they spent nearly a year pondering, when finally the youngest of the three returned to the emperor, with a scroll. ‘Here it is’ he said.”

“What did it say?” I could tell the lady was almost crying. To be totally honest, I almost was too.

“It said, ‘And this, too, shall pass.’ The Emperor rewarded him with riches, and made him his chief advisor in all matters from that day, until the day he died.”

She smiled, and nodded to me. “Thank you.”

I managed a smile. “Anything else?” I meant it, this time. I’d have gone to milk a cow to get her more cream, if she asked.

“No, thank you though.”

I walked into the back office, sat down, and sighed.

About five minutes later, I went out to check on her, and she was gone. On the table was ten dollars, almost double what the cake and coffee cost. Also on the table was a CD. I picked it up, and saw the cover, titled ‘Big Heart’. On the back was a picture of her, and a good-looking young man who must have been her husband.

The back cover mentioned that in August of the year before, her husband had passed away from an enlarged heart. The album, it said, was to help her get through his illness and passing.

Tara came over to see it, and when I handed it to her, she burst into tears.

I walked into the back office, sat down, and cried.

The rest of the night went by in a blur, and as I drove home, I listened to the CD. It was sweet, if a bit folksy, and surprisingly upbeat songs. It was about love, compassion, and living for the moment; all things he must have done in spades.

A few months later, she came back. This time with some friends, and she had a real meal. Well, I wouldn’t call dinner at Denny’s a “real meal”, but she enjoyed it. We talked briefly, and she told me she was now working on a second CD. Apparently some people had liked her stuff.

She said she was calling it “And this, too, shall pass”.

**TL;DR - Lady came in to Denny's for a birthday cake slice for her dead husband, who died of an enlarged heart. I did my best to make the  visit not horrible, and she gave me a CD of music she wrote to cope, called 'Big Heart'.**

For ease of use you'll want to have the two browsers open side by side. In Chrome press '.' (period/full stop) to open the RES console. Copy/paste this in

    RESStorage get RESmodules.saveComments.savedComments

and press enter. In the box that pops up you need to copy the entire contents, then press 'cancel'. Now go over to Firefox and call up the console the same way and enter the same command. 

    RESStorage update RESmodules.saveComments.savedComments

Assuming you haven't saved any comments on Firefox yet, the box should be empty. Either way, empty the field completely and paste in the contents that you got from Chrome. This time click 'confirm', not 'cancel'. 

Now you just have to repeat the process for the tags. The steps are the same except the console command this time is

    RESStorage get RESmodules.userTagger.tags

TRUE,RukiTanuki,,,"About twelve years ago, I had a professional level designer at a big studio mock me on a major game-development forum for posting about my team's upcoming project, because I'd posted that I needed programmers, modellers, level designers, sound, etc., and had therefore revealed that all I had was a good-sounding idea and a website.  The conversation got ugly, particularly when he started dropping vulgarities at various people in the thread who came to my defense, and I remember how I felt a bit curb-stomped by the whole thing.

I'd rather walk away from this thread than do something like that.  But as someone working on their third MMO production credit, I'd like to make an honest, non-judgmental attempt to give you some perspective on the road ahead of you.

I'm assuming a few things here:

* I assume you have not completed development of a video game before.
* Since you haven't mentioned anyone but yourself, I assume you are not currently working with anyone else.
* I assume the talents you're bringing to the table, based on your comments, are art-related (and the game design, naturally).
* I specifically assume you have no programming experience.
* I assume you haven't selected an engine ([here's a great writeup](http://www.eldergame.com/2010/05/unity-2-6-for-indie-mmos-yes-but/) on the strengths and weaknesses of Unity, by the way).
* I'm assuming most of the last two years has been spent writing down details of the world, along with cool gameplay ideas.

If I'm wrong on any of that, correct me as needed.  But (and this is important) still take the rest of this into consideration.

So, with that in mind, here are a few of the pitfalls I foresee in the road ahead:

* If this is the first game you've ever made, I'm begging you, don't go straight for the MMO.  Take a little sub-section of your game, a minigame if you will, and build just that, as a single player game.  You'll learn so much you didn't even know you needed to know.  Even the big guys do this: [take Spore, for example](http://news.cnet.com/8301-13772_3-10033443-52.html).  I have a grand MMO design that I'm splintering into small-game sub-designs and fleshing out in my spare time, because I understand how detailed the design needs to be and I recognize that I can't design it properly as one giant whole.
* No one has successfully made an MMO alone.  A game that persists online and builds a community simply requires too many features, too much art, too complex a server infrastructure, too much community oversight, for even a genius master-of-all-trades to do it alone.  One person (and honestly, even a half-dozen) doesn't have enough time to create a full MMO's worth of content in a short period of time.  ""Well, we'll just take a few years"" doesn't work, because you have the same problem Duke Nukem Forever had:  After three years or so, the bar for ""acceptable""-quality art has been raised so high that your work from three years ago needs to be scrapped and started over to get back to ""acceptable"" quality.  (This applies no matter how low you set the bar, unless you drop it to Minecraft levels and don't care at all.)
* With a team, you have a different problem: Unless you pay them, you don't have an effective way to control what they produce or how quickly they produce it.  If your team is online, there's an added danger: they can disappear at any time, without a trace.  If you didn't make them store their work on a server you control, then they can vanish and take their part of the project with them.  If the person who disappears is your programmer, it doesn't matter that you have a working build; you no longer have the code needed to make any changes.
* Speaking of programmers: an MMO is ludicrously programming-intensive.  If your programmer hasn't made an MMO before, your game's top risk (and most likely cause for failure) is that you're building an MMO engine with no experience.  Conversely, a programmer with MMO experience is likely working on an MMO (with a lot of unpaid overtime) and isn't available for a side project (or at least not an MMO-sized one).  Unity, by the way, is a client-side engine; you still need the server infrastructure and code, and mixing and matching client and server engines has led to at least one MMO failure that I've witnessed first-hand.  Full MMO engines exist, but the ones that have actually shipped a working title are priced at least in the six digits.
* Art is one of the biggest expenses in a commercially-produced MMO.  There's a LOT of it, it's time intensive to create, and it has to be turned around fast (see above DNF comments).  One person might be able to turn around mid-grade art for a small multiplayer game that reused content constantly, but you're generally looking at a team... which means you're looking at an art director to keep all the art in the same style and help manage who needs to make what and when.
* World-building is great, and I love doing that for games of all types, online and offline.  But again, to do this with other people, you'll need a full-fledged [design document](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3384/the_anatomy_of_a_design_document_.php): a bible detailing every little detail about the game.  If you can draw parts of the game on paper and play them out at your table using the design document's rules, then you've typically got the correct level of detail.  If your notes talk about a feature with the level of detail of the typical IGN interview, you need to design in more detail.  (Your comments here suggest this, if only because they they're vague enough to hide the possibility that specific implementations don't yet exist; I obviously don't know the truth, so I only provide what warning I can.)

So, to drive this home: Fully half of all MMOs commercially developed never release; half the survivors immediately fail.  If I was building an MMO ""on a budget"", and I had what I considered a ridiculously good design, and I wanted to ensure that it had a greater than 50/50 odds of success, I'd plan to use a minimum of 10-20 people and $1-2 million.  If that makes you spittake ... if you look at that and think ""that's absolutely impossible"" ... then I can't stress it enough: don't try to make an MMO.  Start small.

(And if you choose to proceed, [go to this blog](http://www.eldergame.com/) and start from the beginning.  He's walked the path you must follow.)
