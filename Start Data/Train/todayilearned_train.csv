"EvilDasNad","","","There's a documentary made about this.

[War Dogs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyH1T9Y7u8w)

The quality is bad, but the documentary is great. 
I was an animal care specialist in the army for a while. Deployed to Afghanistan for a tour. Dog handlers can become incredibly attached to their dog. And it's not just the handler either a lot too. You read stories of soldier finding puppies and raising them all the time. In the latest theaters in Iraq and Afghanistan, you read stories when these soldiers move heaven and earth to get these dogs back home. 

When you're down there, and you find some puppy starving in the street, it's normal to want to save it. And it's not just saving the dog, it's saving yourself. You spend every fucking day sometimes wondering what the fuck is going to happen. Is someone gonna drop some mortars on us today? Are we going to come under fire again on patrol? You get so wrapped up in the warrior culture, eating and breathing being an invincible machine, just so the fear doesn't strangle you. And there's this dog. It's a symbol of normalcy. You can just be a person taking care of his dog. You go out on patrol, and come back, and your dog is excited to see you. You find a tennis ball, or have someone stateside send you some in the mail so you can play fetch.

For a little bit, you can unplug from the bat shit insanity that is being deployed to a war zone, and be just a normal person. A normal guy with his dog.

A lot of the handlers I worked with were like that. They had this partner who was trained for detection work and patrol work. He could be a aggressive fucker, but that handler still had a bond with him, and to them it was a symbol of normalcy. You're still a person with their dog. You have a job to do together, but when you're done for the day, you can unwind for bit in their company.",1432561067,"","False",1,103,"todayilearned"

"FalseHistoricalTales","","constant lies","While Stalin is a deplorable historical figure, this title is slightly misleading.

Joseph Stalin's second wife,  Nadezhda Alliluyeva (or Nadya), died on November 9th, 1932. The cause of death was reported as suicide by self inflicted gunshot wound.

However, Stalin believed that there was more to her death was suspicious. For several years, members of Nadya's family had been trying to use Stalin's position to gain power and influence. In deference to his wife and their happy marriage, Stalin mostly ignored these attempts and focused on more pressing matters of governance. However, the family's scheming and conniving continued after Nadya died. Under duress from his wife's death, Stalin no longer had the patience to deal with what he called ""piyavki"". He executed these three family members for the following crimes:

- Her brother, Abram: Abram tried to gain control of the Russian postal service by threatening its senior leaders with deportation to Siberia. He had no real authority, and was instead stealing money from the government run post.

- Nadya's sister, Alina: Alina attempted to set up a huge brothel in Moscow to serve Russian soldiers. Prostitution was illegal in Russia, and she was taking productive workers out of factories to use as sex slaves.

- Finally, her cousin, Boris: Boris was the absolute worst of the bunch. He had an extensive network of homeless children that he hired as rat-catchers, paying them with moldy bread. He then butchered the rats in unsanitary conditions and sold the meat to hospitals, schools, and the army as premium grade beef.

So while it is true that Stalin was distraught at his wife's death, the executions listed in the title were not that unreasonable.

This happened in the early 80s. Back then there was a lot of ignorance about HIV and AIDS going around. The name AIDS itself only was coined in 1982 and people were only figuring out that the disease was caused by a virus that could be transmitted via blood and blood products.

At this point there was no way to screen the blood products for the disease. All the companies who were making blood products started developing new process to prevent their products from being contaminated, developing the process and getting it approved took time and in the meantime they continued to sell the normal stuff.

The risks of the old potentially contaminated products were poorly understood and judged to be less than the risks of not getting any products at all.

Nobody can blame the companies for selling contaminated products up to that point since there really wasn't any alternative.

Once they new purified products came onto the market the stopped selling the old stuff rather quickly. However this left the companies with a big load of products they couldn't sell anymore in the US.

The right thing to do would have been to destroy this stock. Unfortunately the people making the decisions too the poorly understood risks and the fact that many third world countries had not yet reacted with regulations the way the US had to mean that it was okay to get rid of the existing potentially contaminated stock by selling it to poor countries.

That was wrong. They should have listened to the experts and erred on the side of caution and they didn't.

However the magnitude of their error is a lot easier to see with the benefit of hindsight.

"mkultra123","","","I did some consulting work for 2 brothers living in a remote section of NW Brazil. They had about 2,500 maripona hives and we were trying to help them sell their honey out of state. 

The Maripona genus is really interesting. The bees are tiny, about the size of a grain of rice, maybe a lite bigger. Their hives are totally different from Euopean honeybees. There's no ""comb"" that can be removed and drained. The honey is stored in little sacs, like bubbles. 
It's more fluid than European honey, delicious, but not as sweet. And unfortunately (from a commercial perspective) doesn't have the same shelf-life as European honey. 

Extraction is also a problem. To harvest the honey you have to manually pierce each bulb with a syringe or tube and suck out the honey. You can't pull the bulbs and extract by crushing or centrifuge because pulling too many bulbs will kill the hive. 

Those brothers were great - their great great grandfather started the hive because his village elder wanted a way to make their village more independent. 80 years later the brothers had grown it to cover several acres of Amazon Jungle. The only tools they had were a crank operated suction pump and a chainsaw for cutting wood to make the hives. They kept talking about needing a laboratory, which threw us off until we realized that by 'laboratory' they really meant 'room with glass windows, running water, and a generator to run a fridge"".

We estimated it would cost them about $5,000US to build the 'laboratory' - most of that cost from shipping the construction materials down the river to the village. But to those guys 5k might as well have been 5 million - it's just an absurd amount of money for them. We eventually worked out a deal with a wealthy fisherman in the closest city (2 days away by boat). He agreed to pay for the lab in exchange for a 30% gross take in the yearly honey sales for a period of 10 years. That's a terrible deal, but literally the only option available. He did agree to forgive the loan if the operation failed, and there was a clause to forestall payment if the yearly harvest was week due to disease or weather. 

That village was truly amazing. 15,000 people living in the same stretch of jungle for 350 years. The village elder was a 90 year old woman who was so strong and spritely we were joking she could beat me up. On our first day we got a tour of the whole village. When we got to the fishery (via canoe) she just jumped out of the boat and disappeared under the water for like 3-4 minutes. We were like 'oh my god they're gonna think we killed the Elder!' Then she popped back up with 5 fish in hand - lunch. 

Her father was the one who got the bee farming started 90 years ago. 30 years ago she decided the village needed a western education to survive, so the village picked out a dozen of the smartest children, pooled their money and sent the kids to a western style boarding school, then college. It was those 'kids' (no longer kids) who arranged for our consultation through our business school (all pro-bono). 

Last I heard, the brothers had their lab, a new chainsaw and a generator powered suction system (no more hand crank!). Really an amazing experience.

"XenophonOfAthens","","","**EDIT 3: I might be wrong!**

/u/topsmate at /r/Australia [has uploaded a scan of a 1991 Australian magazine](https://www.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/2xe7wi/when_was_the_first_time_you_heard_the_term_mullet/cozdfmr) referring to a young man as ""mullet-haired"". It doesn't say that he ""has a mullet"", so it's not clear if it means ""he has hair like a mullet fish"", but he does definitely have a mullet hairstyle! Good enough for me! It's still remarkable that the quote isn't from the 80's, but at least now we know that The Beastie Boys weren't the first!

We did it, reddit! We made a significant contribution to lexicography! 

Original comment and edits: 

The Oxford English Dictionary entry for [mullet](http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/253382) (referring to the hairstyle) lists 1994 as the earliest date it was used, having been unable to find any earlier examples. They even put up an [appeal to the public](http://public.oed.com/appeals/mullet/), asking if anyone could find earlier examples, because it seems so strange that no one used the word like that until the mid-90s. 

It should be noted that the word ""mullet"" itself is much older. It's been used to refer to [this fish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mullet_(fish\)) since the 14th century. There's also a term ""mullet head"", meaning ""stupid person"", that has been used since the mid 19th century. 

If anyone can find earlier examples of the word referring to the hairstyle, let the OED know, they would surely be very grateful. 

EDIT: lots of people are saying ""no way that's true, I was using it all through the 80's!"". I'd just like to ask: are you sure? Like, *really* sure? Beyond a shadow of a doubt? It's not just that you saw the hairstyle all through that decade, but only found out later (in the mid-90s) that it was called a ""mullet""? Memories are malleable, are you sure that you didn't ""insert"" the word into your memories afterwards?

Because the simple fact is that there is literally no evidence for it that anyone has found. None! Not one printed word, not one spoken line in a movie, not one music lyric, not one barbershop sign. It's true that it might be out there somewhere, and nobody's found it yet, but it doesn't look like it. There are lots of ""mullet heads"" and lots of people talking about fish, but no hairstyles. There's literally the same amount of evidence for the use of the word ""mullet"" to refer to a hairstyle before 1994 as there is for creationism, or that vaccines cause autism. 

Shit is freaky, yo. 

EDIT 2: Ok, to clear some things up, here are answers to common questions: 

**You're full of shit, I've been using it since way before 1994**

See above.

**My coach used to call us ""mullet-heads"" all the time in the late 70's!**

As stated, the phrase ""mullet-head"" is different from ""mullet""; it is a much older term (from the 1850's, at least), which means ""stupid person"". It has nothing to do with hair styles (though it is probably where The Beastie Boys got the term). 

**They said it in Cheers/Cool Hand Luke/Mark Twain!**

All the examples I've seen people point to are using the term ""mullet head"" to call someone stupid, not ""mullet"" to refer to a hairstyle.

**Just because there's no written source before The Beastie Boys, that doesn't mean that it didn't exist! They just used some common slang! We didn't have the internet back then, so nothing got written down!**

While it is a possibility (you can't prove a negative, and all that), the total lack of evidence makes it fantastically unlikely. While it's true that because of the internet, much more of the language is preserved today, the 1980's are not some sort of dark age. There's a massive amount of media from that time, from magazines to books to music to movies to television show to everything else imaginable, not to mention lots of academic linguists documenting slang, and nobody has found an earlier use. And this stuff is easier to research than ever, there's Google Books and LexisNexis and archive.org, and many more massive archives you can search. Not one single use has ever been found. 

Many people say they've heard it since at least the early 80's, which is at least a decade before anyone wrote it down. Do you really find plausible that slang that was apparently that common TOTALLY escaped the massive clutches of American pop culture? No, it doesn't seem likely, does it?

**Just because The Beastie Boys are first in the OED, that doesn't mean that they coined it.**

Certainly possible, but given the fact that the song lyrics ([helpfully posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/2xcl2e/til_that_the_beastie_boys_coined_the_term_mullet/coz2b0j) by /u/zyzzogeton) are basically one long explanation of the meaning of the term, and given that the [Grand Royal magazine article about mullets](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/2xcl2e/til_that_the_beastie_boys_coined_the_term_mullet/coz5ftf) (helpfully posted by /u/BovingdonBug) claims that Mike D coined it, it seems like a safe bet. This is also the opinion of the OED in their etymology section. 

**I hate you. You're wrong!**

"onoffabsurd","","","Yup. From a perspective of weight loss, fewer calories means fewer calories. One of the real problems with ""junk food"" is that these foods are very calorie-dense, and don't necessarily give your body the nutrients it needs. During a meal, your body mediates appetite based on volume, more than anything else. A large apple has ~90 calories. A single oreo has 45 calories by comparison. If you eat to satiety, then with a calorie-dense food like bacon or oreos, you will have consumed far more calories than if you were eating a food with low calorie density, like an apple or cucumber. Either way you feel full (or at least less hungry), but the difference is how you got there, whether your body has what it needs, and how many calories your intestine will absorb from that load of food. This is also why it's helpful to drink a glass of water before and/or during meals if you're trying to lose weight; the added volume makes you feel full earlier, and hopefully you stop eating sooner.

EDIT: Ok, I'm gonna expand on this a bit. There are three basic components to short-term satiation during and immediately after a meal. Mechanical signals, nutrient signals, and hormonal signals, in that order. The mechanical signals, carried on the vagus nerve, are mediated by stretch receptors in the stomach, [first documented in this article](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1365716/pdf/jphysiol01403-0067.pdf). This component of satiation is the fastest acting; it responds as soon as your stomach starts to fill with food/drink. The nutrient signals come next. They are based on blood concentrations of glucose, amino acids, and fatty acids; all that information is picked up by chemoceptors throughout your body and sent to your hypothalamus, described [here](http://physiologyonline.physiology.org/content/22/4/241). Chemoceptors in your mouth, stomach, and small intestine also interact with your hypothalamus to mediate hunger, but that signalling pathway is more oriented towards making sure that sufficient gastric acid and pancreatic enzymes are prepared to properly digest the food as it progresses through your GI tract. Finally, hormonal signals including insulin and cholecystekinin mediate hunger, but this a downstream effect that occurs after chyme reaches the duodenum, and these pathways don't respond as rapidly as the stretch receptors. These other mechanisms keep us from being able to substitute water for a meal, and make it hard to diet unless you have a balanced intake. The stretch receptor signalling is what makes it hard to stop eating at the appropriate time, and the reason that eating to satiety with calorie-dense foods (such as junk food) will make it hard to maintain a healthy weight. 

**tl;dr** [satiety](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunger_%28motivational_state%29#Short-term_regulation_of_hunger_and_food_intake) is complicated but stretch receptors in the stomach represent the first and strongest physiologic signal for fullness.

""Mosquitoes are delectable things to eat and they're easy to catch,"" says aquatic entomologist Richard Merritt, at Michigan State University in East Lansing. In the absence of their larvae, hundreds of species of fish would have to change their diet to survive. ""This may sound simple, but traits such as feeding behaviour are deeply imprinted, genetically, in those fish,"" says Harrison. The mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis), for example, is a specialized predator — so effective at killing mosquitoes that it is stocked in rice fields and swimming pools as pest control — that could go extinct. And the loss of these or other fish could have major effects up and down the food chain.

Many species of insect, spider, salamander, lizard and frog would also lose a primary food source. In one study published last month, researchers tracked insect-eating house martins at a park in Camargue, France, after the area was sprayed with a microbial mosquito-control agent1. They found that the birds produced on average two chicks per nest after spraying, compared with three for birds at control sites.

&gt;  STACY KEACH (NARRATOR): It is unclear just how much information was exchanged between the British and American teams. But for some across the Atlantic, the memory of the collaboration remains a bitter one.

&gt; DENNIS BANCROFT: The idea was that they had decided that it was a good idea to make a supersonic airplane, and they had heard that we were making one. So, they came over to England with the idea that they would have all the information that we had accumulated, the idea being that a fortnight later, we would go to America and they would give us all the information the Americans had got. But after the Americans had got the information, take the drawings away within a fortnight. When we were trying to arrange the visit, they just said, ""Sorry. Secrecy. The Pentagon says you can't.""

&gt; STACY KEACH (NARRATOR): But the real threat was Germany. If America was months behind the British, it was even further behind the Germans. By 1944, Germany already had a vehicle that could travel faster than sound: the V2 rocket, a weapon of terror unprecedented in modern warfare.

This is referring to the exchange of the Whittle engine. The Whittle engine gave rise to the GE/Allison J31 -&gt; J33 and then, with the J35 and J37 (1946 and 1947) the US had gone axial-flow instead of the centrifugal-flow that the British Whittle design was based around. Pratt&amp;Whitney did license a version of the Nene and Tay engines from Rolls-Royce in the late '40s so this is still clear indication there was considerable cooperation between the US and UK governments. 

&gt;  In December, 1945, just days before Britain's hopes were ended, the United States rolled out its first test plane. Called the Bell X-1. 

&gt; early in 1946, Miles Aircraft received a letter from the Ministry of Aircraft Production canceling the project.

The lead of the project, Lockspieser, was convinced the M-52 would never break the sound barrier.

How would the Bell X-1 copycat a British plan that hasn't even cleared the drawing board... and one whose chief engineer isn't even convinced would work? This is very flimsy. Additionally, they're both (X-1 and M.52) simply rockets with wings.

So, other than the Whittle engine (that was quickly out-dated and phased out) the US got nothing from the British of any substance. Whittle's design was remarkable, however, it just paled when compared to axial-flow engines. ",1430233165,"","False",1,142,"todayilearned"

&gt;But, as science writer Jessica Wapner reports in a long and fascinating article in Mosaic, an online science magazine published by the Wellcome Trust, equally authoritative health organizations in other developed countries have looked at the same evidence and decided that the procedure is medically unnecessary.

Aside from preventing urinary tract infections, which can be treated with antibiotics, it concluded that the health benefits of circumcision are ‘questionable, weak, and likely to have little public health relevance in a Western context.’”

Let me just say I am not condoning their actions, merely trying to explain their mentality. 

Likely when the fire first started, they did not know how severe it was and would have hopefully assumed that it could be put out without catastrophic loss. At first it would have just been smoke coming from an unknown location. 

Of course the shoppers would panic, and run. Some would take advantage of the situation and start looting while running. Classic mob mentality, I'm sure you've seen related videos online. Once the shit hits the fan, is spreads and when one person starts looting, many more people start looting. This likely would have started with a little smoke, and a minute later hundreds of people would have been going on a looting spree. 

The owners would have instantly tried to stop the hundreds of shoplifters fleeing from the store. At this point it was not known the store was doomed, it was probably just a little smoke. So they lock the doors to stop the shop lifters. People inside are probably still trying to run out/looting as much as they can. 

Then the fire starts to spread fast, we are maybe a few minutes in here. The doors have been locked, and people are trying to get out. Smoke suddenly engulfs the entire building and starts billowing out from the entrances. The building bursts into flames. The owners realize the loss is imminent and try to let the people out. But oh wait, fire is hot, and the smoke is blinding and toxic to breath, and now they can't get close enough to open the doors even if they want to. One minute later and everyone is dead and the building is fucked and the owners are just realizing what has happened. I bet this entire event happened in a few minutes (fires can spread really really fast) and the owners had no intention of killing anyone, only preventing the looting of their store, which they had no idea would actually burn to the ground at the time of their decision. 

Of course what they did was stupid, and I'm glad they got decent prison sentences, but I hope I helped clarity what their mindset might have been like at the time. They would have been panicking just like everyone else and acted on foolish impulses and probably instantly regretted their actions as soon as the extent of the fire was known.

&gt; **What's bigger: 1/3 pound burgers or 1/4 pound burgers?**
&gt;  
&gt; Do Americans really think 1/4 pound hamburgers are larger than 1/3 pound burgers? Apparently they did in the early 1980s. At least according to the New York Times — and the guy who bought the A&amp;W restaurant chain back in 1982.
&gt; 
&gt; You may have seen this bizarre example of American mathematical ignorance getting passed around lately as a fun fact from ""Why Do Americans Stink at Math?"" by Elizabeth Green:
&gt; 
&gt;One of the most vivid arithmetic failings displayed by Americans occurred in the early 1980s, when the A&amp;W restaurant chain released a new hamburger to rival the McDonald's Quarter Pounder. With a third-pound of beef, the A&amp;W burger had more meat than the Quarter Pounder; in taste tests, customers preferred A&amp;W's burger. And it was less expensive. A lavish A&amp;W television and radio marketing campaign cited these benefits. Yet instead of leaping at the great value, customers snubbed it.
&gt; 
&gt;Only when the company held customer focus groups did it become clear why. The Third Pounder presented the American public with a test in fractions. And we failed. Misunderstanding the value of one-third, customers believed they were being overcharged. Why, they asked the researchers, should they pay the same amount for a third of a pound of meat as they did for a quarter-pound of meat at McDonald's. The ""4"" in ""¼,"" larger than the ""3"" in ""⅓,"" led them astray.
&gt;

My personal Dudeist philosophy is that we all have within us a Dude, a Walter, and a Donny. The Dude is what really ties the Trinity together. He's the main man and the one we should all aspire to be, even though the Dude himself is not perfect. He's pretty chill and alright, but he lacks motivation and direction. The Walter within us is the rash, emotional person in us, short-fused and suspicious. We should try to limit the amount of Walter we exhibit, though he is not without his positive qualities. He is also bold and loyal. And then there is Donny. The Donny within us is the reserved, quiet type who is content with just going along with it. Donny also has his good and his bad; he's shy and awkward and just not confident, but he's a good listener and humble.

"UhSwellGuy","","","The flavor packs themselves are made by distilling the orange oils and essences out of oranges and then fractionating them to get different aspects of it (juicy, rindy, pithy), then adding them back in such a way that it makes a more consistent product.  The other advantage of this is that the flavors break down much more slowly when stored separately than they would while still in the orange.

Think of a blended whiskey, which seems to retain the same taste year after year despite differences in the raw materials.  The blend ratios might be slightly different, but the goal is to have the same product as you did last year.

The real take home message that I want you to get is that there isn't some guy combining random chemicals which taste nothing like orange into a suddenly orange tasting potion which they then feed to us.  They are adding essences taken from oranges back into orange juice.  Although this is certainly a mechanized and engineered process, it is not quite as deceitful as you might be led to believe.

Also, it's pretty well known if you are a food scientist that fragrance companies and flavor companies are one and the same - it's simply because the chemists they employ are the best at extracting particular taste and aroma extracts from raw materials &amp; at evaluating them (tasting and smelling things isn't exactly a standardized, quantitative science, but these guys have done a really good job of making it in to one).  Not sure why the article felt the need to point that out unless it's to really underline the artificial nature of this process and spook everybody.

When it comes down to it, the whole point is to make something that is harvested once and doesn't last long available year round, and something which changes from year to year consistent.  The chemists that work for these companies are always struggling with the reality of what actually happens and the pressure of making the product seem as  true to ""natural"" as possible.  What they have come up with is essentially ""split it apart and recombine it later"".

Tl;dr - the ""flavor packs"" used in this case are made from the essence of oranges, so while definitely engineered, not entirely artificial.

This is a bad thing. This is a sexist thing. This is indeed a small, incomplete study that shows that in a very PARTICULAR situation women have the advantage of opinion of being nice.

This does NOT mean that this somehow 'debunks' feminism. If anything, it proves it. Automatically assuming a woman is somehow nice is indeed sexism (both misogynistic and misandristic) and is something that many feminists, myself included, stand against. Mainly because when we, this is to say women, do NOT act favorably we are somehow thought of as lower, because we're constantly thought of as sweet little angels. The study seems to suggest that these people have stereotyped women as 'good', putting them on a pedestal.

This is bad, this is harmful to both men and women and it needs to stop. Not just because women are not always nice but because men can/are victims as well.

This is to say, in a domestic violence dispute for example, the suggested mindset is likely not to be 'This horrible, evil man put his hands on this pure woman', but 'This man put his hands on this weak, tiny little girl', making it seem like a man is subjugating the 'weak'.

"nater255","","","Speaking as a violinist, I can tell you a violinist's personal politics comes into play heavily when choosing jobs. Three weeks ago, l was offered a job on some boat. Beautiful yaucht. Tons of lifeboats. A simple playing for dinner job. They told me if l could stand around even if things got ugly, l would double my price. Then l realized whose boat it was. Thomas Andrews. The same! The money was right, but the risk was too high. I knew who he was, and based on that, I turned the job over to a friend. Based on personal politics. The next week, an iceberg put a hit on Andrews' boat. My friend was drowned and killed. Didn't even finish playing the song. I'm alive because I knew the risk involved in that particular client. My friend wasn't so lucky. Any contractor working on that boat knew the risk involved. If they got killed, it's their own fault.

Linda was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1995. What Paul said is that they both knew her odds probably weren't great from the start, however they ""tried to block it out"" and focus on the positive. She had surgery and very intensive chemotherapy for about two and a half years, so she definitely fought intensely. But according to Paul the cancer spread to her other breast and finally, her liver, at which point they knew things were bad. He said at one point her primary doctor told him privately that Linda was not going to survive. Paul asked if anything would be accomplished by telling Linda that outright and the doctor said no, he didn't think she needed to know because it would just destroy any positivity she had left. Paul agreed. 

However, Linda did know on some level she was going to die soon. Plenty of her friends attested to that. She asked her daughter to move up her impending wedding by several months. She arranged for birthday and Christmas presents to be delivered to Paul and her children for later that year (she died in the spring of 1998). Before she left on her final vacation to Arizona, where she passed away, Linda called her best friend to tell her she loved her and also sent her a meaningful present. A couple of months before she died, the head of her frozen food company had a long meeting with her where he said Linda bluntly told him she was not going to beat her cancer and needed to make arrangements for the business to carry on in her absence (source: the biography of Linda McCartney by Danny Fields). 

As for treatment, Linda was in no way denied it. She of course knew she had breast cancer and had battled it for about two and a half years by her death, with intensive treatment that made her very, very ill for most of that time. She had private medical care in her home when she died. Paul, Linda and their children all went to their home in Arizona two weeks before she died expressly because Arizona was Linda's favorite place, they were all there and all got to say their lengthy goodbyes to her. The horse riding actually occurred two days before she died; Paul physically assisted her so she would be able to get one last ride because it was her favorite thing in the world, she was not galloping around. She went into a coma the following day after the horse ride and Paul stayed in her bed with her and held her in his arms the entire time until she passed. He said they felt very blessed that she had so little discomfort and went quickly. In thanks to the medical staff who helped Linda, Paul donated $1 million after her death to each of the hospitals who treated her. 

Here's a direct quote from Paul on the subject from a 1999 interview with Chrissie Hynde:

""[After her cancer spread to her liver] We asked, 'Is there anything we can do? Do people ever come back from this?' Yes. Sure. There's statistics which show that people have licked this, which is true -- so we always went with that side of it. Linda never said, 'Oh, I'm going to be a bad statistic.' I think that's what sustained us. She'd say to us, 'You're the best support group a girl could ever have,' and we'd say, 'We couldn't do it without you, babe.' She had such courage. We just couldn't have done it. It's true. We would have fallen apart. But she was just so on the ball. We could be strong because she was. I don't even think that until the last week she even knew. I think the last week, you know, things were going so badly -- but we were riding horses. I said 'Tell you what, babe, I'll get the horses ready, you don't have to even do anything. I'll tack them up, get them all ready, get a little bale of hay and you can hop off of it.' That was always one of our horrors, of being eighty and you can't ride. We'd joke that we'd design a special crane and have you lifted up. Because that was the horror of her life, that she couldn't ride. Thank God that she was able to, two days before she died. And, as I said, the crowning moment was this big rattler  stretched across the track. We just looked at it and felt awed. Like it was some sort of magic sign. I bet it is in Indian folklore.

So, thank the Lord, she went into a coma as they had predicted. Which wasn't the worst of all scenarios, as it happened. She just felt tired, and I said, 'Would you like to sit by the pool?' She said, 'No. I don't really fancy it today.' I thought I'd try her in about an hour's time. I tried her in about an hour's time, she still felt tired. I joked, 'Well you just fancy a lie-in, don't you?' She said, 'Yeah.' The next day she died. She was just in a coma for one day. It was as if she was so smart that something in her said, 'We can't lick this one. Let's get the hell out of here, quick.' And she didn't hang about. As I say, she'd spent that day in bed, the previous day she'd got up, she spent that one day in bed, I went to bed that night with her figuring, 'God, things are getting desperate but we'll just keep hoping.' I went to bed and she got restless in the middle of the night, as they'd warned me she might. So I called the nurse about 3 in the morning and at 5 she died. She didn't hang about. In her last sort of moments she got very peaceful. As she died something told me to just say something to her...It just suddenly came to me at the moment when she was just about to die. I have no idea why, I just thought, 'I've just got to say this.' It was as if I was guided and I said, 'You're up on your beautiful Appaloosa stallion; it's a fine spring day, we're riding through the woods. The bluebells are all out, and the sky is clear blue.' And she just drifted off. So, a terrible tragedy. But I don't think it could have happened in a better way in a better place.""",1432962123,"","1433015628",1,1319,"todayilearned"

* I judge what I think, say, or do harshly, as never good enough.
* I am extremely loyal, remaining in harmful situations too long.
* I compromise my own values and integrity too much, to avoid rejection or anger.
* I put aside my own interests too much in order to do what others want.
* I am hypervigilant regarding the feelings of others and take on those feelings.
* I freely offer advice and direction to others without being asked.
* I become resentful when others decline my help or reject my advice.
* I can defiantly take care of myself without any help from others, but
* I believe most people are incapable of taking care of themselves.
* I value others’ approval of my thinking, feelings, and behavior over my own.
* I constantly seek recognition that I think I deserve, but at the same time:
* I am embarrassed to receive recognition, praise, or gifts.
* I think 'The more I suffer, the more it shows I really care'

Some things to consider:

* **For those of you who are thinking that these excerpts apply to you**, click on the link and check the full list. If some most of them apply to you, **do some research on your own, whether that's a coda meeting, buying a book, or just reading some more literature**. I know you'll feel a lot better soon.

* I have felt more caring and compassion at CoDA meetings than I ever have with most people. We're nice, we promise!

* Most people deal with their codependency with a particular drug of choice, whether it's liquor, wine, beer, porn, coke, pot, food, or exercise. Honesty time: Mine is food.

* So, either type of Jameson (Jenna or liquor) listed elsewhere in this comment section may help cover up those feelings, but only for a bit.

* As for God: All that's required is just a 'higher power'. I'm an atheist; I still go. I replace it with 'Nature' or 'The Universe'. Anyone who admonishes you for not believing in their God is acting inappropriately, really. Really.

* A great book, it really helped me: [Codependent No More](http://www.amazon.com/Codependent-No-More-Controlling-Yourself/dp/0894864025)

* This does not demonize consideration or empathy. People who are codependent can't help feeling this way, to a fault. We 'help until it hurts', and we can't stop. A balance is crucial, and the program is helping me find the right balance.

* If you don't feel this way, please don't criticize those who do. Everyone is different and everyone has things they already have a good balance with.

* A $20 book or an hour long meeting is a small commitment to potentially discover something incredible about yourself, even if you decide afterwards that it doesn't apply.",1426276643,"","1426308588",3,852,"todayilearned"

The article seems to imply that 25% increase is greater than $3K to $5K or $4K to $6K. 

After digging into their source article (on [TMZ](http://www.tmz.com/2013/10/16/peyton-manning-papa-johns-franchises/) of all places) the $3K to $5K jump in daily sales is on **Game Days** only. One restaurant does have year over year increase of 25%.

It is probably over stating the impact of weed legalization. I also highly (hehe) doubt that weed consumption in Colorado has increased to such a number that it would have a measurable down stream impact to the pizza business.

So Ontario said ""Fine, we'll make a law that says if you apologise for something, it doesn't mean you're admitting fault, and that won't be used as a piece of evidence in a civil trial.""

When you remember it again, you are tying all those memories together again, but you are depending upon the last time you tied them together.

2. **Start an act of violence.** It takes one act of violence to turn a protest into a full-blown riot. Start a small fire into the Nabasco corporate office. Others will quickly follow your lead.

3. **Justify your actions.** People need to feel like they're doing something right. Remind them what infuriated them through chants and slogans, such as ""Double Stuff? Double Lies!"" to keep the riot from dying down.

"[deleted]","","","Misleading headline, girl was offered no time and she chose a jury trail for a crime she was obviously guilty of.

Girl sounds like a real piece of work:

&gt;At Cotton's trial ""a half-dozen or so teachers — mostly white and two blacks"" testified about her past disciplinary problems. One teacher described her as someone who was ""openly defiant"" and ""generally did not follow rules."" Teacher Michael Johnson, an African-American testified that Cotton threatened another teacher, saying ""I’m going to bust her in the nose."" 

And she was offered no time for her crime, but she felt that attacking a teacher isn't actually a crime:

&gt;Cotton was charged with felony assault on a public servant by Lamar County District Attorney Gary D. Young. After the story received national attention, Young claimed to have offered a plea deal to reduce the sentence to a misdemeanor count with two years of supervised probation. Cotton's attorney, Wesley Newell, confirmed the plea deal was indeed offered in a statement to the Houston Chronicle.[6] Cotton maintained her innocence, meaning she declined the plea bargain offer in favor of a bench trial.

You're not going to win over a jury trial when you attack and harm and old women:

&gt;Cotton's jury consisted of three men and three women, one of whom was African-American. After testimony, the jury reached a guilty verdict on the higher felony count of assaulting a public servant in less than 10 minutes.[3]

Gloves were added not particularly to increase the number of knockouts but rather to reduce the amount of visible damage. An amateur sporting culture had arisen in the upper crust that prized the athleticism and grace of the sport. The bloody rough and tumble nature of prize fights were frowned upon. It was seen as a way for gentlemen to participate without disfiguring themselves.

The Marquess of Queensbury rules were not intended for Prize Fighting. They were designed with amateur bouts in mind. It was an attempt to curb the ""savagery"" of the prize fight for gentler audiences and upper class amateurs. Namely these rules removed grappling, which had been an integral part of bare-knuckle prize fights. They added timed rounds, which hadn't been present before. Prior to the MoQ rules fights went on as long as the had to and a round only ended when a man hit the floor whether by being knocked down or thrown. The rules also mandated the gloves and made a host of other regulations.

Bare-knuckle boxers most certainly threw plenty of shots to the head. The surviving manuals written by Bare-Knuckle champions split their focus evenly between body and head shots. What is likely is that they threw less punches in general. Why? Time. 

They faced the prospect of going an indefinite number of rounds. It was better to conserve yourself when you don't know how long you might be there. They also did not focus on combination punching, in fact out of the numerous surviving manuals combination punching is only mentioned in passing later on toward the gloved era.

The fights much more resembled fencing matches interspersed with bouts of ""dirty"" wrestling. At the long range fighters sniped at one another, in close they came to clinch and battled for a position from which they could hit without fear of return or throw their opponent.
This changes the fight drastically compared to modern boxing. Bare-Knuckle fighters ""Boxed"" at greater range so as to reduce the chance of ending up being clinched. At that greater range combinations and hooks are harder to land so power straights are emphasized. 

They took those funny looking stances with defensive concerns. By keeping their lead arms extend they had a better chance to parry or block blows being thrown from long range, the slight backward lean many of them showed was simply to further increase the range that their opponent had to hit them at increasing their chance to block or parry. They did slip and weave some but it seems to have been less important. 

As to the safety of Bare Knuckle boxing. We really can't say for sure. Detailed records weren't kept for these fighters, you are talking about a period extending back to the late 1690's records in general from that era are hard to come by. Even for many of Bare-Knuckle Boxing champions we have only precious few details. Many of them also died quite young by today's standards, in their 40's quite often. Many neurological diseases set in decades after the trauma's that caused them.

We also most certainly do have records of these fighters dying. In one case there was an early American BKB fighter who seemed to have been suffering some form of early dementia before he died. (I'll look up the name and add it later). However fighters of that time period also tended to have shorter careers than modern fighters, often around only twenty bouts. Many of them never fought amateur as it was not an organized sport at the time, so twenty or so bouts would be their entire career. Typically it seems that they had more time between fights as well, many times only fighting twice a year. Compare this to modern pros who often have north of 100 amateur bouts before their first pro fight.

Now gloves did likely increase the number of knockouts but not by themselves and not for the reasons we might think. Their common adoption coincided with the rise of the MoQ rules over the old London Prize Ring rules. This barred grappling, introduced timed rounds, shortened the amount of time a downed man had to rise, and put a finite limit on the number of rounds. 

With glove being introduced fighters began to throw more often, their hands were likely safer so why not? With grappling being removed the range that men were grappling at before became another range in which to hit, thus increasing the total opportunity to hit. It could also be supposed that the shortened amount of time a man had to rise from a knockdown increased the number of ""knockouts"".  

Now this last part is just theory from me. With the introduction of gloves and wraps which reinforce the hands and the removal of grappling people began to develop and throw rounded blows. The hook shows up in earnest within a decade or so of the MoQ rules becoming the standard. 

Rounded blows were frowned upon in the old days because ""boxing"" was done at a range where their wider arc was a liability, more easily countered by a sharp straight. Hooking blows I also suspect might be more dangerous to an unshod hand because of how they tend to land if they don't hit just so. 

So with the new closer range fighting and protected hands fighters began to throw and develop hooks. Now it has always been taught to me that the rotational force exerted on the brain by motion of a hook tends to be more dangerous and more likely to produce a knockout. I have no idea if this is just bro-science from the gym but is what I have heard for many years.

Source; I'm head over heels in love with the sport and have spent a great deal of time researching it's early history as well as reading nearly every surviving BKB manual from the period.

TL;DR: It isn't as simple as it seems, boxing has undergone a great deal of evolution since the Bare-Knuckle days and the sport was almost a different thing entirely then. If it was safer it was for more complex reasons than just the lack of gloves.

Women are placed on pedestals by men their entire lives; they do not know a world in which men don't treat them in a unique way, and therefore neutral treatment is received as hostile because their barometer has been shifted up.

When they speak about equality they are usually talking about having their cake and eating it too, with very little effort expended to understand how males experiences life (and a LOT of assumptions and generalizations in place of said effort). Now, that's nothing out of the ordinary - males generalize just as much. The problem lies in the current culture surrounding ""gender talk."" Examining female culture is perceived as inherently sexist, as the ""problems with women"" are all said to be injected by external sources (they are not vain - they are pressured by society to focus on appearance; and so on), so there is no examination to be done; you should be examining the external force ""inflicting"" the situation on the female. This obviously goes hand-in-hand with female passivity and the passive perspective (careful now - such passivity isn't a problem; it's ""who they are."" In the same vein, male directness and brashness is not a problem because it's who we are...  /s). On the other hand, examining male culture is treated as inherently progressive; males need fixing, while females do not. There is also the aforementioned problems with generalizations and perceptions of uniformity among males; males who place too much emphasis on their special snowflake status are seen as flamboyant and feminine, while females who do the same are excused or even rewarded for it. That's the current unspoken culture of discourse on the topic, and it is totally laughable.

There is this misconception that antibiotic resistance is a completely one way progression - when a gene for resistance crops up, that's it - it will spread to all the bugs and that antibiotic will never be of use again. Looking a bit closer at it makes you realize that there is much more too it.

Generally the gene that confers resistance has been around in the population of bugs long before any exposure to antibiotics. It isn't about these genes turning up, so much as it is about genes being selected for and becoming more prevalent. This means that if the gene that confers resistance carries any evolutionary burden - so in the absence of antibiotics makes the bacteria less competitive, the resistance genes will be gradually selected against and fall in prevalence if we stop using any particular antibiotic.

[We've seen this too before with other antibiotics.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9180179) 

The problem we are running towards isn't that we don't have any antibiotics to treat N.*gonorrheae* with. Infections that we have no antibiotics to use against remain immensely rare. It is that we don't have *one* antibiotic that we can treat just about everyone with. This is what the CDC is saying - we are running out of one size fits all options. 

This isn't a minor problem. Stopping the spread of infectious disease is much easier if you only have to give one dose of one antibiotic to cure it. But at the same time this isn't the same as N. *gonorrheae* becoming untreatable at all - we can still treat it in the vast majority of cases, it is just that we have to work out *what* we can treat with.

There are lots of really interesting rapid antibiotic resistant testing technologies these days, and hopefully these, as much as new antibiotics that will help fix this problem. Even ignoring all this there is brilliant evidence that good population level efforts to control antibiotic resistance can be effective at preventing resistance becoming widespread, and eliminating it even if it does. [Sweden has pretty much already done this](http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=19041)

**TL;DR:** There isn't some inevitable perpetually untreatable gonorrhea just round the corner. At any point we can pull our shit together and get resistance under control. It just might not be as straightforward as treat everyone with one dose of X anymore if we don't.",1431731986,"","1431764007",1,80,"todayilearned"

"bbcard1","","","My wife grew up financially disadvantaged but she had a great family filled with love.  We had a nice church wedding with more that 100 guests. Many of the guests said things like, instead of a gift, just let me bake your cake, do your flowers, take pictures.  We had a very nice wedding for less the $500 including the dress which she got at a discount center. We honeymooned at the Red Roof Inn in Hurricane WV and ate at Shoneys (try the spaghetti). That was more than 30 years ago and we are still very much in love, have raised two good kids, have an active church and community life and, yeah, I guess I'm bragging a little bit. I moved straight from my mom's home into a home with my bride.  I have never had a day in my life that I have not been taken care of by a good woman.
