True,Deradius,,,"**The Lazy Bum**

As a teacher, you have a lot of students who have learning disabilities.  Anywhere from 10% to 40% of my classes had some sort of special accommodation.  There's a document for each kid in the special ed system.  It's called different things depending on where you teach, but for our purposes I'll call it a 'Specialized Education Plan'.

Basically it details whether a given student gets to take extra time on a test, or extra time to turn in assignments, or need to have exam questions read to him/her, or needs shorter assignments, etc.   There are about 40 different ways we can accommodate kids with special needs, and each kid has a plan.  So I might have 6 class periods x 5 kids per class = 30 different plans.

I was one of the more involved educators at that school with regard to the specialized education plans (SEPs).   The special ed staff knew me well because I was frequently down on that end of campus, discussing with them how various students learn best, how I could best deal with certain disabilities and meet certain needs, et cetera.  I had a good reputation in the special ed department as being one of the teachers who cared.

I had a kid in my class who was failing.  Hard.  Primarily due to failure to submit work.  He (we'll call him Dave) had a specialized education plan, and I accommodated where I could, but it's tough to grant accommodations when Dave won't do any work at all.   (Sure, I can give him a shorter assignment - but he's not doing it.)

So I had been in touch with his Mom off and on via e-mail.  It was standard practice for me to contact parents via e-mail and stay in touch.  She was upset her son was failing.

One of the special education instructors took me aside in order to 'do me a favor' and give me some counsel. 

Her:  ""Mr. Deradius, I hear Dave is failing your class."" 

Me: ""Yes, Mrs. Jones, Dave is failing my class."" 

Her:  ""Why?"" 

Me: ""Ms. Jones, Dave is lazy and won't submit any assignments.""  

Her:  ""Have you been providing Dave with appropriate accommodations?""

Me:  ""Of course.""

Her:  ""Can you prove it?  Because if this parent comes after you with a lawyer, your butt is going to be in a sling.  It's not good when special ed kids fail.""

The implication here being that my failing this kid was going to get me into trouble.  When you've got as many different kids with accommodations as I had, it's tough to document providing accommodations to every single kid, even when you're doing your best to do so.  The special ed teacher was trying to quietly leverage me into bumping Dave's grade up so she and I wouldn't have this headache to deal with.

Me:  ""Mrs. Jones, I hear you loud and clear.  Let me tell you something.  I'm failing this kid because I feel that he lacks the understanding necessary to function as an adult in our society.  I'm failing him because it would be a shame if he left this school without even a rudimentary understanding of what this state considers to be mandatory subject matter.  

Passing him would be the worst disservice I could do - because once he has that credit on his transcript, he can't come back and re-take this course.  So I'll be sending him out in the world unprepared with no way to recover.  This could affect him for life.

And I'll do it in a heartbeat, Mrs. Jones.  I don't have the money to handle a protracted legal battle, and I can't risk my livelihood over one child.

So you tell me when those lawyers are coming.

And you tell me what grade you want on that kid's report card.

You want a 65?  You want a 75?  You want an 85?

Tell me a number, I'll write it down and I'll forge the numbers.  I'll give this kid a 110 average in my class if it'll save my neck.

I'll cut his throat, and I'll send him out into the world ignorant and incapable.

Because my livelihood is more important to me than his future.

What number would you like me write on his report card?""

She stood there with her mouth agape for a few seconds, then told me to have a good day.

I walked out, and started meticulously documenting everything having to do with this kid.  I went through is accommodation sheet, and made sure that each one was being met.  I e-mailed proof to his mother, weekly, of what I was doing to meet his accommodations.  I made copies of every accommodated assignment / every set of extra notes I made for him..  everything.  I printed out every e-mail I sent to the mother and highlighted it, color coding the highlighting to certain accommodations.

I volunteered to tutor the kid after school every day.  And when he didn't show up for first one excuse or another, I printed out his mother's excuses and quietly collected them in his file as well.

I had incontrovertible proof that I had done every single thing I could to meet this kid's needs, and every failure had to do with a lack of effort on his part or his mom's failure to bring him to tutoring.

Another teacher who has this same student comes to my classroom, shaking in his boots.  ""Mr. Deradius, I heard Dave's mother is going to mop the floor with us.  She works for the special ed department at her school, and she knows all the ins and outs.  She's going to come up here and put a blank special ed form in front of each of us and make us fill out Dave's accommodations from memory.""

I stayed after school late that night memorizing his documentation.

By the end of that evening, I could check every box if necessary and write his student ID in the student ID spot.  From memory.

Within a couple of days, I was called to a meeting.  I was ready for war.

My position is that he's got his mother and the district wrapped around his finger.  He's learned he can manipulate the system so he doesn't have to do any work but passes anyway.  Which is great - but he's not learning anything.  My goal is for him to learn. Their goal is for him to pass.  If this kid is allowed to get away with this now, he's hosed down the road when he gets to the real world.  Your mom isn't going to set up a meeting with your boss about your accommodations.  You're just going to get fired for being lazy and ignorant.

I went to the meeting.

Around the table were the mother, the student, a member of the speical ed staff, the district special ed director, the assistant principal, and the assistant superintendent.

They asked his first teacher,

""Mr. Smith, Dave is failing your class.  What have you done to meet Dave's accommodations?""

Mr. Smith stuttered and stammered.  ""Well, it's not that he - uh- it's not that I'm not doing me job.   He doesn't turn in any of his work, so - uh - he..""

""Mr. Smith, do you have any proof of this?""

Mr. Smith gets quiet.

Next teacher, same thing.

Next teacher, same thing.

I'm sitting in the middle of the table with a stack of paperwork a foot high.  Proof that this kid is lazy, isn't doing his work, isn't doing what he needs to do.  All color coded, highlighted, and cross-referenced.   Several e-mails per week with the mother times about eighteen weeks or so - so about sixty or seventy e-mails.  For any given question they might ask me, I can instantly produce pages of documentation detailing how and why this kid is failing.

They ask the teacher on my left a bunch of questions.

They ask the teacher on my right a bunch of questions.

They never speak to me.

At the end, I speak up.

""I haven't been given the opportunity to speak, but I'm going to weigh in here.  Dave isn't failing because his needs aren't being met.

He's failing because he's lazy.

He's failing because he doesn't care.

He's failing because he's figured out how to work the system.

And if you have any question of that, I have record of every accommodation I've provided him going back for months.  I have given him every tool for success - and he has chosen failure at every turn.""

The district special ed director said, ""Thank you Mr. Deradius."" and the meeting adjourned.

....

Dave's grade in the other teacher's classes mysteriously improved after that meeting.   My guess is they had to bump his grade because they 'failed to meet his needs'.

No one ever spoke to me about Dave.  A few days later an office runner showed up at my classroom door with a transfer paper for Dave.  I needed to sign it, because Dave was being transferred out of my class.

I went to the assistant principal, who had been in the meeting and knew of my frustration.

Me:  ""If I don't sign this, what happens?""

Asst. Principal:  ""Dave gets moved anyway.""

Me:  (Leaves the unsigned paper on her desk, returns to classroom)

*Lesson learned:*  If you try to hold someone accountable for performance, they will simply go around you.  The goal is to get kids out - not to get them educated.

True,PlasmidDNA,med,Immunology,"Full disclosure: I am an immunologist, I work on vaccines and immunotherapies, including those for HPV.

The reason it is not recommended for people over 26 years of age is due to the fact that the pharma companies who make the vaccine - Merck and GSK - have not done a study that provides data to suggest efficacy in this age group.  More to the point - they don't know if/how well it would work in an older agegroup.  Since no study has been done in an older population, the FDA can not/will not recommend it in an older population.

I_am_a_BalbC was on the right track as to why they haven't done this type of study in an older agegroup.  By your mid-20s most Americans have been exposed to hundreds of HPV serotypes.  However, this fact in and of itself is not enough to prevent an HPV vaccine from having efficacy in an older agegroup.  In fact, infection with the low-risk serotypes included in the Merck vaccine can self-resolve, with no protective immunity induced.  This means that people could get infect with HPV serotype 11 (as an example), the infection could clear, and that same person can get infected again because they don't have an immune response that prevents infection.  The vaccines DO drive an immune response that prevents infection, and thus in these types of patients, it MIGHT be efficacious.  Thus, I_am_a_BalbC's response was close, but not correct in this regard.  There are groups of patients that can get infected, clear, and get infected again.  The vaccine could theoretically work in these cases.

Truly, the reason that this type of study WON'T be done is twofold -
1. From a business standpoint it doesn't make sense for Merck or GSK.  They are already hitting the targets that they want, spending money on a bigger study that may or may not allow them to recommend the vaccine to a wider target base just isn't fiscally worth it to them.
2. From an epidemiology standpoint - vaccinating children prior to exposure will help stem/stop the spread of the variants that cause overt HPV disease in the younger generations.  For those of us who are older and may already be infected, the current vaccines that are being marketed wouldn't help clear the virus after infection.  New immunotherapies are in the works by a number of companies to address that need.

True,SwayzeCrayze,,,"This actually happened to a lady who is a close family friend.

 At one point, she worked at a convalescent home; not just for old people either. It was for folks who were a little nuts and couldn't take care of themselves. One lady there has this disorder. She thinks EVERYTHING is food, as in she'd eat her dinner and then start trying to eat the napkins. As you can guess, she ended up morbidly obese. She was too fat for the showers, so they had to take her out back and hose her down like an elephant. Since she was so fat, she had a lot of rolls, and they couldn't get everywhere.
Now, one day the family friend is making her rounds of the complex, and was stopped by this dude in a wheelchair. He mumbles something at her. ""Bitch stole my Doritos..."" ""What?"" ""That fat lady stole my Doritos and SHE WON'T GIVE 'EM BACK!"" ""Okay, okay, calm down. I'll get your chips back for you.""
She goes into the fat lady's room. She's in their with the chips and nothing else. Buck naked, with her legs spread. There's this thick almost gelatinous discharge in the fat lady's vagina. And she's dipping the chips. And eating it. With that cheese drip on pizza stretch effect. She apparently had this big smile as it dripped down her chin.

True,wanderlusterer,userTeal,Samsung Galaxy Note 4,"I've been saying this quite a few times in the past few weeks; the FCC *is* releasing bandwidth to cell telecoms.  Two reasons why: 1. To help offset the national debt (deficit) which is a farce, because the recent bill passed in congress to reduce taxes, more or less will counter it.  Why? Because the average Jane and Joe will be paying more on their bill for it.  Seriously, no company is going to absorb the entire cost, and passing on the buck is just common practice in today's world.  So essentially, we'll in effect be paying for a tax break, and truly will never receive the benefit of it, because it'll go in one pocket, and right out the other.  2.  Because the FCC believes that the telecoms will help with creating a *fully functional* national emergency alert system.  I won't elaborate on this.  It shouldn't take much for people to understand that this will be an awful process.

The U.S. government really needs to make sure that the benefits of selling the bandwidth truly outweigh the cons.  Right now they aren't.
