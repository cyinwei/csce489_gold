**EDIT** No source for the pic that I can find, but if this is porphyria, it is one of the rarest and severe types:

Congenital erythropoietic porphyria (CEP), or Gunther disease: autosomal recessive and rare, with 200 reported cases.

CEP disrupts the fourth step in the HBP and results in the buildup of the hydroxymethylbilane metabolite. More than 35 mutations of the UROS gene can result in a dysfunctional uroporphyrinogen III CoA synthase enzyme. The most common is the C73R mutation (33%). The age of onset varies and the severity of the disease can range from fatal to severe photosensitivity and transfusion dependency, and finally, mild photosensitivity.  Severe photosensitivity can be seen after birth, and red blood cell (RBC) hemolysis can occur. Sun-exposed areas of skin can have massive blistering and scarring, often resulting in ruptures and infections. Extensive damage to sun-exposed appendages like the nose, lips,  ears, fingers, hands, and feet may occur. Hypertrichosis (excessive hair growth) on the face and hands is common. Patients may also have deposits of porphyrins in the teeth that give them a reddish-brown tint called erythrodontia. Anemia may occur because of a shortened life span of RBCs; this shortened life span increases heme synthesis and can result in a worsening of symptoms.",1423856137,"","1423865980",1,1374,"WTF"

I dunno how many of you canyoneer or hike or climb, but the general opinion among the climbing community, along with the search and rescue community, is that AR is a complete dumbass, undeserving of everything he's received in light of this. 

In doing what he did - go off and run a slot without telling anyone where he was going - he committed one of the cardinal sins of the sport. Akin to doing motorsports without a helmet. Hell, it's probably even dumber than that. People like AR are the ones that give the rest of us fits, and cause most of the 'lost hiker' callouts. They also tend to be the ones that die in the backcountry.

Just because he managed to extract himself from that situation does not mean he isn't a complete dumbass for causing it. It wasn't an accident - it was a direct result of his own lack of foresight. Also, boulders don't generally just 'come loose' and land on your hand. In all likelihood he cut it loose himself.

I should also mention that SAR personnel put their own lives at risk by simply responding to this kind of incident. I have at least an hour drive to many of the trailheads my team responds to. SAR people die on the freeway before and after callouts, while not even in the backcountry. That's before you even touch a rope or a patient. While AR was in there paying penance for his mistakes, volunteers were our putting themselves in danger on his behalf, and were doing so because he was too lazy or inconsiderate to simply tell a buddy where he was going.

This also relates directly to the severity of his injury. Had he filed a flight plan, he certainly would have been found within 24-48 hours, and most likely could have kept his hand (but lost the book deal, alas). Furthermore, the kind of ischemia he had in the hand (combined with the fluid loss through dehydration) made cutting and breaking the hand significantly less painful than if you tried it right now. Balls of steel? Meh.

I end up ranting about this a fair amount (as you can probably tell). What I always say is that there were many thousands of smart hikers, climbers, and canyoneers out on that day enjoying the great American West. AR was the fuckup that didn't make it back because he was lazy and/or dumb. The ones that made it home without incident are the ones you should respect. Ralston does not deserve your respect, much less your money.

"pitchko","","","I was born in souther russia and my grandpa lived through the worst parts of the famine there. This is a story that we know about him:

When he was really young (6-8 or something) his mother no longer had enough to feed him and all his siblings, so she gave him up for adoption in hopes that they would get fed better. 

After a few weeks though a neighbour of theirs secretly gave them a cow, and they were able to keep it in the house and bring it grass from the outside. This way no one knew they had a cow and would not kill them for it. 

Once the cow started to produce milk she decided she could go and grab my grandpa back from the orphanage, but when she went there they just told her he was dead. She demanded to see the body and they took her to the gymnasium that just had a pile of naked corpses in it, one of them was my grandpa. 

when she found him he was still breathing however so she took him home and he got better. 

He also told me stories about how he was chased at night by people wanting to eat him when he visited a neighbouring village. 

Later when my grandpa went to war he came back to every one in his family dead, and his house that he had lived in just a bunch of tank tracks in the ground. 

SURPRISINGLY!!! 

my grandpa was a very kind and good individual and became fairly successful, he had a bunch of kids and they had a bunch of kids and he only passed away a few years ago. 

Edit:

This is a picture of him before he died: http://imgur.com/zwF8Mhd

When my grandfather came back from the war he met my grandma at a train station, he kind of lied to her a bit about where he was headed (because he had recently found out he had no where to go) and told her he had a house in Rostov (the closest big city) she ended up coming out there to visit him and he at the time lived in a horrible apartment. He was emberaced by it and his lie so when they met at the train station he just carried her bags around as he showed her the whole city. Never inviting her home to his house until finally it was really late. She was horrified at first by his living conditions and that he lied to her but then he told her the full story and she decided to stay, and then they got married. They stayed married for almost 50 years until he passed away.

"Shayla06","","","I could reply to everyone here, but instead I'll just make my own post. The owner was clearly a DOG FIGHTER. The dog was abused and attacked because of hatred for the person in question. If you look at the picture there is a plastic stick that looks vaguely like a spear. That stick is a tool used in the dog fighting industry. It's called a ""breaking stick"" and is used to break apart two fighting pit bulls when they are fighting outside of the ring.

Proof via ASPCA: https://www.aspca.org/fight-cruelty/dog-fighting/gallery

The dogs ears are clipped, a tradition only common amongst dog fighting circles done to keep their naturally floppy ears from being grabbed or torn in fights. The dog has scars all over, further indication he was used for dog fighting. His eye is not ""rolled back,"" he has a ""cherry eye."" It's a common eye injury. He is not ""smiling,"" but he is relaxed as you can tell from his body language. This dog is not inherently dangerous. He's just finished fighting and is covered in blood, but he's standing calmly on a leash less than a foot away from another person. If it were rabid or otherwise ""crazy,"" it would attack everyone, not just one person and be done. Considering the injuries, the person likely tried to grab the dog when it was scared. A fighting dog is trained to go for vital points such as the throat or chest first, not break a wrist. Attacking the wrists implies the person put their hands on or between his body and the dog. This could have been a defensive gesture, but it was likely taken as aggressive by the dog. His only other injury appears to be on the side of the head. He could have been tucking his head down to protect his face, or he may have been already on the ground. Regardless, the dog would not have been able to reach his head and hands if he were standing normally.

These cells act like independent organisms, live for about 3 months, then die. The dead cells are consumed by the next generation of iris cells. This is the reason some people claim their eyes change colors with the seasons...They do, but only because the dead cells are replaced with new ones (which may or may not be a different color...Depends on the person's genes). The color of the iris, also dependent on a person's genes, are caused by light diffraction in the wormy iris cells. However sometimes an iris-cell will mutate in such a way that it'll attach itself to parts of the eye it's not supposed to. This is one of the causes of eyesight degeneration.

"AriBanana","","","I live in Montreal and this is like a 7/10 on the odd- metro station- occurrence scale. I remember once a really wasted lady tried to get on at Atwater but fell and lay there just as the doors closed, getting pinned. Suddenly, she sprung to life and climbed through the pinching doors, which pulled down her jeans. I guess she figured ""Well I'm halfway there, Tabernac!"" because she just squatted down and started peeing right there in the front of the train car. She stood, pants still on her ankles, and screamed as we took off.
 
While she shuffled around angrily a beautiful thing happened. Strangers, looked at each other, silently motioning warnings as the pee moved up the aisle. Spreading just a few seats before the icky river, the human spirit showed itself in nods and pokes and nudges and gestures. No one wanted to alert her to their unique presence so this was a subtle game. Feet and purses where silently lifted and as we pulled into Guy-Concordia a communal sense of relief was felt. We had been the perfect faceless crowd and yet spared each other from urine soaked shoes. 

Before having to choose if I should get off or not, two burly STM cops came and wrestled her out. So I stayed in my seat, and warned a new passenger of the source of our small stream. Most people just stayed on and played the foot-lift wave until our respective stops. The pee flowed back and forth with each stop and was oddly mesmerizing.

The combination of friction and pressure had allowed his hips to almost completely erode away exposing parts of his pelvis and femurs. He had a collection bag for fecal matter, but no way to use it effectively, which caused fecal matter to collect in his wound. I was informed that he had fecal matter in his bloodstream, something I had never heard of, before.

My task at the time was to clean and redress his wound. Cleaning the still living yet rotting flesh and bone of a person is definitely an experience, and though the smell was bad, it was nowhere near the stench level of changing an ileostomy bag.

He had severely poor nutrition, impaired cognitive function, of course poor mobility even with his chair, and because of these and other reasons did not frequent the hospital or anywhere else to receive the care he desperately needed. I remember that he was admitted with his belongings, and he was quarantined, not just for the infectious diseases and microbes he carried, but for the roaches that came in with him.

I never saw him, again, after the few times I cleaned and redressed him. That poor, poor man.

&gt;This afternoon around 3:30, there was a severe accident north of Jiaxing Haining city Biyun bridge.  A construction truck crashed into a small white sedan during a left turn, and flipped on its side crushing the car leading to the deaths of the two men inside the car.

&gt; **Crushing the sedan**

&gt;Witness Mr. Cai told ZheJiang Online reporter that when he got to the scene, the accident had already occurred.  The sedan was completely crushed under the truck, and the dirt from the truck completely buried the sedan.

&gt; Mr. Cai gave us some footage from the accident.  In the footage, right before the accident, the truck was traveling from south to north through the intersection, and the sedan was turning left from south to the east.  The two vehicles collided in the middle of the intersection and the sedan was crushed in the process.

&gt; **The two men on the car both died**

&gt; ""At the time, the truck was going pretty fast, so after jerking the steering wheel it fell onto its side.  I heard the sedan was just purchased from the 4s dealer (car dealership), but none of us would have thought this would happen right after they drove it out from the dealership.  Recently, the old city is being renovated, so there are a lot of construction vehicles around, and when they enter the city they're going pretty fast from the bridge.  It's quite dangerous"", says Mr. Cai (the witness).

&gt; After the accident, HaiNing Fire Dept. hurried to the scene.  According to the Dept. , after cleaning off the dirt, they found two male corpses.  Both were from JianXi.

&gt; **Footage shows neither vehicle was disobeying the traffic light**

&gt; From the footage Mr. Cai provided us, the light at the intersection was flashing green (means it will turn yellow very soon).  According to traffic laws, neither car was running a redlight.  But under normal conditions, the sedan should have yielded to the truck, but as for the actual reason of the accident, more investigation is needed.

And presumably Mr. Cai is the security guard that was watching the cctv

I grew up on a military base in NJ in the early 90's. The entire base was fenced off with Barbed wire, and was heavily forested inside. There were deer in the woods, and the deer tick population went wild. People on the base contracted lyme disease, but the doctors either were not familiar with it, or denied its existence if they were. My whole family had it, and I went untreated for over a year. My mother was told by the base doctors after bringing us in multiple times that if she returned again, they'd have her committed. You couldn't step outside without shoes or you'd get ticks up and down your legs. Total epidemic that was swept under the rug. 

One winter, my mother spotted a stray dog. It was skittish, and would run if we approached. Over a few months, my mom lured the dog in by leaving dog food on our porch. When she finally got the dogs trust and managed to get her in the house, she found that the dog was infested with deer ticks. She literally picked around 50 ticks off this dog, and hadn't even started. Not having any better idea on how to get the dog healthy, my mother called animal control. The dog was picked up, and we all cried as the poor thing was dragged away by animal control using a long pole with a noose at the end. We felt like we'd betrayed the dog by luring her in, only to have her dragged away like this.

4 days later, we heard a scratch at the door. The dog was on our front door step, completely tick free. Our only guess is that she was cleaned up and then some how escaped. He took her in and she was then one of the most loyal dogs I've ever had. 

She would shake uncontrollably sometimes, and was super over protective. I think she may have had some issues from lyme, but I don't know if or how that translates to dogs.

Oh god, the smell :C I cleaned up all the puke I could get to, he's been drinking bloody mudslides, kitchen stank of manshit and baileys. Called Mum(she was out with her friends) and she's also drunk, too drunk to care or come home to help. Thanks Mum. Dad puked again, still unconscious, so I panicked and called for an ambulance. Paramedic came in and managed to get Dad awake, Dad swiped at him and told him to ""fuck off out of my house you cunt"", then apologised after he realised the guy was a paramedic, thanking him for doing a good job. No hospital for Dad tonight. Paramedic can't(or won't) help me move him though, fuck. Stayed up all night making sure Dad didn't roll over and choke on vomit. Yay New Years.

It's up to you if you want to declaw it though.  Don't use fear mongering to keep people from doing it.  It's not the equivalent of cutting off the last segment of your finger.

EDIT: Let me clear some things up.  This is the field I'm studying.  I know about it, and I care about it.  That aside, I've owned cats all my life.  They've all been declawed (not my choice) and have all been fine.

First of all, if you want to have an indoor/outdoor cat, obviously keep its claws.  They are completely defenseless without them, not only for attacking but also for hiding and climbing in trees.  Do not, however, have a cat that is mostly outdoor.  The average lifespan of an outdoor cat is three years.  In addition, cats are responsible for a staggering number of deaths of birds and other animals.  Some birds have gone extinct because of cats.

Make sure, if you do get your cat declawed, to talk about it at length with your vet and do research on it.  Issues can arise if the procedure is improperly performed, as with any procedure.

In order to properly own a cat with claws, know a few things: It will scratch you and your things.  It's going to happen.  Buy toys to keep it from focusing its energy on your furniture, and keep the nails trimmed.  Start trimming the nails as soon as possible.  Kittens are very receptive to new things and ideas, but only while they're kittens.  You will never have a cat that is okay with you trimming its nails unless you did it frequently while it was a kitten.  Also, punish the kitten for clawing furniture and people, and reward it when it does something desirable.

Spaying and neutering is extremely important because it manages to population.  There are a staggering number of cats and dogs without homes, and there doesn't need to be more.  By neutering and spaying your pets, you prevent the suffering of homeless animals.  There are also benefits in that it stops undesirable behavior associated with estrus and mating in general.  But that's sort of beside the point.  Declawing, however, is purely for the owner's benefit.

"MisterBearcat","","","They're called [Velella velella](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velella). Recently drove to the Oregon coast to collect some for preservation. They're very strange creatures, the beaches are/were just littered with them. Their movement is controlled entirely by the wind, so when wind currents shift around, they will strand en masse on beaches. Happy to answer any questions people have about them. 

*Edit: someone asked a question about their sails and why I went out to collect them then deleted their question, so here's my answer:*

Yup, that thing on their back is their sail. Soft bodied animals tend to maintain rigidity via water-filled tubes or cells (think of the advantage of having a stiff water balloon vs., well, just goo). The skeletal makeup of Velella velella does seem to be a chitinous composite. See [*Design of a Small Cantilevered Sheet: The Sail of Velella velella*](http://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/handle/10125/508/v39n1-1-15.pdf?sequence=1} for a really good explanation of their sail (a really cool structure). One of my favorite facts about them is that their sails can be oriented in two different ways--they will ""sail"" in opposite directions depending on which way it's oriented! 

I just went out there for fun. I'm a biology student and I became interested in the species after reading about them in the news, so when I had some free time I drove over to the coast with a bucket. Brought about 50+ back, most still ""alive"" (kind of hard to tell, can't exactly take their pulse). I tried to collect valella that were washing in at the time rather than the dried up ones. I then realized that some of the professors in my biology department might be interested in obtaining specimens, so I emailed a bunch. I got in touch with the director of the invertebrate collection/museum at my university, and she coincidentally had been wanting to collect some! I had (luckily) frozen a bunch, so she was able to preserve those properly; I had tried preserving them with things like isopropyl alcohol and/or ethanol. 

In terms of finding out more about them, I think start with wikipedia entry of valella, then work on understanding their relationship to other soft bodied organisms--the [phylogeny of Cnidaria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cnidaria#Family_tree). The research article I linked to provides some really good info on their structure. I think one of the weirdest things about them is thinking about how they ""right"" themselves. When I observed them at the ocean, they would just kind of blow over and then float upside down. The way that their supposed to be positioned is with their sail on top (as you would think), so the question I have is, do they just spend more time right-side up then upside down? Or were the ones washing into the beach somehow damaged, different than the ones way out to sea? Research-wise, I'd love to study their neurotoxin. Poisons and toxins are super interesting, and often illuminate the normal functioning of organisms in a way that we hadn't previously understood.

&gt; I haven't seen one of these.
&gt; 
&gt; Others die intact. Ruptured inside, you understand, but un-harmed to look at. There may be a thin, trickle
&gt; of blood from an ear or nostril.
&gt; 
&gt; It annoys you, subconsciously ... you wish they'd raise a dead hand and wipe it away.
&gt; 
&gt; Death is not instantaneous.
&gt; 
&gt; Rather, it comes in a matter of minutes. There is no pain as we know it ... nothing sharp, exquisite, searing. It is an inner numbness, a bubbling frothing thing and a terrible inability to breathe.
&gt; 
&gt; They are winded, punched in the stomach by a ton of metal moving at 60 mph or more, shattering
&gt; every bone in the body as a fist would shatter a wine glass wrapped in a rug.
&gt; 
&gt; They never breathe again.
&gt; 
&gt; I've seen a number of these.
&gt; 
&gt; Men die with their trousers on, which somehow lends them dignity.
&gt; 
&gt; Women die with their legs apart in a lewd display.
&gt; 
&gt; Children die most horribly because they are seldom properly seated or braced. And they
&gt; are very small. They are thrown through jagged windscreens to roll and skid along road surfaces
&gt; as abrasive as cheese-graters.
&gt; 
&gt; Or, cradled in their mother‚Äôs laps, they are sandwiched between her and the unyielding dashboard. Mummy might just as well have jumped on the child from a third-storey window.
&gt; 
&gt; Without meaning to, of course.
&gt; 
&gt; Some people are burned to death.
&gt; 
&gt; They are not incinerated, as you'd imagine, but tend to bake or char.
&gt; 
&gt; Their clothes burn off them‚Äî if it is wool it forms a ghastly black""crackling""‚Äî and the skin bakes into quite a hard rind which makes a hollow sound if you tap it.
&gt; 
&gt; When the corpse is lifted from the wreckage it is as rigid as a papier mache dummy.
&gt; 
&gt; Often it is set in a sculpted, lifelike posture, but unnaturally stiff, like the little plastic drivers that toy manufacturers put in the front seats of model cars.
&gt; 
&gt; I've seen a couple of these, too.
&gt; 
&gt; I've seen men‚Äôs faces buried in the stringy bark of a tree trunk; fixed there, seemingly, by
&gt; a gob of sticky red gum.
&gt; 
&gt; And men hanging from halfopen car doors; fl ung rag dolls of men embracing steel power pylons; men skewered on steering columns; men whose faces are gone, as if nibbled by rats.
&gt; 
&gt; I've seen men survive.
&gt; 
&gt; Dragged from the back seat, soaked in a shandy of blood and beer, the shards of smashed bottles glinting in the frantic blue of the revolving police light.
&gt; 
&gt; Carried into casualty on a stretcher, hurt, frightened, shocked.
&gt; 
&gt; Men without dignity, crying while other men cut away their blood-soaked rags and yet other men explore abdomen and groin with fingers that feel like fence-posts.
&gt; 
&gt; Men blinking through blood and tears into bright lights while probes and tweezers remove chunks and slivers of glass from facial wounds ‚Äî eyes, cheeks, gums ‚Äî that big bit was a tooth. Two teeth, actually.
&gt; Having trouble talking.
&gt; 
&gt; Panic-stricken men with crushed rib-cages trying to breathe through broken bellows. Grey-faced, incoherent, being asked questions:
&gt; 
&gt; What's your name? Are you married? Where do you live? Where does it hurt ... here ... here ... does THAT hurt? Any children?
&gt; 
&gt; Thighs as flexible as a rolled-up towel, pushed back into shape and splinted. Men wheeled into the X-ray room and laid this way, then that while the ragged edges of a broken pelvic girdle scrape together. Got to get a good picture.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Men denied pain-killers while an eternity of assessment passes and other men pierce their arms and insert tubes and hold up little canisters of blood ... blood donors love life, but butter eaters make better lovers.
&gt; 
&gt; Then sliding blissfully into euphoria as the pain-killing injection hits and they are wheeled into the operating theatre.
&gt; 
&gt; And I've seen men survive this, too.
&gt; 
&gt; The Russians were criticised in the 1930s for severing a dog's head and keeping it clinically alive for a number of hours.
&gt; 
&gt; Alive enough to salivate at the smell of food.
&gt; 
&gt; I've seen men in the quadriplegic wards at the Austin Hospital and at Mont Park who might just as well not have bodies, although their heads are alive.
&gt; 
&gt; The unlucky ones are mentally unimpaired and strive for months and years to learn to write with a pencil held in their teeth, or to type by flicking one of the few remaining responsive muscles in their bodies.
&gt; 
&gt; Their intelligence is sharp, their appetite for books and learning is gargantuan, their role in life that of the eternal spectator ... eternity being, in some cases, a ""lif"" expectancy of 50 or more years.
&gt; 
&gt; They make the best of it, but many wish for death.
&gt; 
&gt; And I've seen the lucky ones, those with brain damage, whose minds were shaken loose in the
&gt; cataclysm of car with car.
&gt; 
&gt; Men with glazed, half-lidded eyes, with neither bowel nor bladder control who sog in bed with no sensation below the shoulders so that bowel obstructions, appendicitis, bladder problems go undetected
&gt; by the normal warning systems which we know as pain.
&gt; 
&gt; Men whose total sexual impotence is parodied by an apparent state of constant sexual excitation.
&gt; 
&gt; Men who were mothers' sons, wives' husbands, girls' lovers, children's fathers. Men who recognise no one.
&gt; 
&gt; Or men whose eyes ignite for a brief moment with recognition, whose mouths open to speak a flubbery sound like deflating bubble gum, then sink exhausted into the pillow.
&gt; 
&gt; I've seen things that make me sick to the heart. I thought you should know.

"iia","","","Alvin saw Katrina from across the swap meet. He knew he had to introduce himself to her; she embodied a thick femininity which spoke to the most primal depths of his soul. 

He approached her tentatively. She was even more beautiful from up close. Soft, doughy cheeks framed a thin, pink mouth. Her eyes were the color of dried molasses cookies. She stared at him with a gentle, bovine gaze. 

Alvin introduced himself. Katrina blushed. She wasn't used to men approaching her. She shook Alvin's hand and was immediately taken by his grasp. His hands were rough and calloused. The hands of a worker. His fingers were long and slim with chipped, brittle nails which reminded her even more of the hard work he must do. She was smitten.

Katrina's blush deepened when Alvin whispered something in her ear. Now her head was spinning. Was this really happening? She felt herself nodding her head and, before she knew it, was being led to an alley behind the local Planned Parenthood.

When Alvin kissed Katrina's mouth, his lips enveloped her own. He sucked on her teeth and tongue, swallowing all the saliva she could produce. Katrina mooed softly. She felt her nipples harden and she reached to her waist to carefully pull them. Suddenly, she found herself being turned around and pushed over the side of a garbage can.

Alvin unwrapped Katrina's rump with the vociferous excitement of a retarded child tearing the wrapper from a Payday bar. Before him were two pale half moons. He knew this was his lucky day. 

Moses himself couldn't have parted the cheeks as reverentially as Alvin. A scent of umami roundness filled the air. It was thick and hearty, reminding Alvin of his childhood home near the local paper mill. Katrina moistened audibly. After taking in the beauty of the grayish-brown circle, he made his move.

Alvin's tongue lapped and lapped. Katrina bellowed with unbridled excitement, thrusting her hips back against Alvin's face. She could feel his calloused hands and long fingers spreading her open. She'd never been so exposed, but Alvin made her feel safe. Loved. Warm.

Minutes passed. Then hours. Katrina's body carried out its various processes as they were, for the time, one wanton digestive tract. Once Alvin was finished, he turned Katrina back around and kissed her. He was mildly disappointed that her mouth was less inviting than where he'd just been spending his time.

""Yeah!"" ""So you're saying because people online were mildly amused at your incoherent ramblings all at the same time and one of them had reddit gold to give away, you're all the sudden king ding-a-ling and therefore better than I?""

"hikingboots_allineed","","","We had a similar thing with our cat, Sparky. She went missing one night in November 2013. My Dad found her body almost a year later under an ivy that he was clearing. We think she got hit by a car and then crawled under the ivy since it was a dark space. The weird thing is that on windy nights, we could hear the bell on her collar ringing. My sister is really into the paranormal so assumed it was her ghost whereas my parents thought that maybe she preferred life as a stray but returned home occasionally at night. The reality was just that the ivy would have been brushing against her bell in the wind. :(",1429711915,"","False",1,677,"WTF"
