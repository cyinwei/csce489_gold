"cocobandicoot","","","It sounds like OP downloaded this album way back when iTunes had DRM on 128kbps audio tracks. They've since removed the DRM, and all tracks purchased from iTunes are now 256kbps DRM-free and can be played back on any device, no iTunes required. This change was around 2008-09.

So now, six years later, OP still has those original, DRM-encrypted versions from ""years ago"" (as OP states). The good news is that, ever since iTunes made the switch to remove DRM, they've given you the option of removing the DRM from those tracks with a stripping process they call iTunes Plus, which will remove the DRM and ups the song quality to 256kbps.

However, if you're still keeping those old, DRM-encrypted songs, and if you forget your password that you used to purchase them, you're going to have to reset your password, which might be difficult if it was years ago.

"just_hating","","","Threesomes are usually fun. Usually take a little getting in shape first though. I have had a couple and for the most part this is what I can tell you to expect:

Trim your pubes down a lot. Near the quarter inch (few mm if you are anywhere other than the US).

Abstain from masturbation. Try to only get off to copulation or during fellatio. Keep your mits off of yourself.

Go running often. Start at 2 miles a week, and double biweekly.

Switch to boxer briefs while running. Compression shorts if you are over weight.

Eat more fruit. It'll make you smell better. Abstain from eating too much meat or starch.

Take your vitamins.

Stop watching porn. Lay naked with your wife when you are feeling horny. Think of pavlovs dog. When you smell your wife when you are horny, the smell alone will make you horny even when you are not.

Rent the suite at a local hotel. Something with a big enough tub for the three of you. 

Yoga is a good idea. Gets the rust loose on your joints, increase blood flow, makes the knees not hurt so much.

Do this over the course of a couple months. If your wife sees you making drastic improvements to your health over something that excites her, it will happen again. What happens after the clothes drops is up to you three, I am just giving good advice if you have an aging body, and want to have a threeway. They are fun if you don't have hangups about being with another person and your wife. I know this sounds like a lot of work, but trust me, if you go for the threesome you are going to want to be in tip top shape.

Also see if you can get a couple Viagra or any other boner grower from your doctor, and to see if it is safe for you to take them. There is no shame in having a back up plan in case you get stage fright.

Also don't worry about your penis size or what your body looks like too much. After 30 it is a bitch to lose weight and this should be more about trying something exciting and not performing a fucking fashion show. 

Last thing: Communication is king when you are doing one of these with a spouse. It's not like some drunken night at the local cantina where you get two senioritas drunk on too much anejo and you take them both back to your hotel room because there is rum and a hot tub.

"raging_asshole2","","","i was a pretty happy only child at 4 years old when my little brother came along and ruined everything.  suddenly the world wasn't all about me.  it was about this gross little baby, everyone cooing and fussing over him, obsessing over his little eyelashes and such while my lifelike drawings and awe-inspiring stories went unheeded.  my towers of blocks were suddenly ""unsafe"" instead of admired.  my place in the big bed was lost.  all in all, i was pissed.

so i decided to level the playing field.  a day came where my mother and aunts could not stop talking about how he had the longest eyelashes of any baby that anyone had ever seen.  they were so glamorous and amazing, these eyelashes.  they were the center of my mother's world.

what if, i asked myself, he didn't have those eyelashes anymore?  surely nobody could love such a noisy little lump without eyelashes, right?  it would be the perfect crime, and it would vault me back into the spotlight.

the plan formed, i bided my time and waited for nightfall.  the house was quiet.  my parents had retired, and my brother lay snoozing, defenseless in his crib.  from under my pillow, i pulled the deadly sharp manicure scissors i had secretly lifted from my mother's dresser.  i crept to his crib and dropped the side wall, oh so slowly, oh so carefully, making sure not to risk waking anyone.

his chest rose and fell slowly, and this hateful little demon that had stolen all my attention away was mine for the taking.  his eyes closed, those perfect beloved eyelashes resting gently on his cheeks.  with the slow steady hands of a bomb squad technician, i brought the scissors to his face.  i opened the blades, and ever so softly rested the bottom jaw on his cheek.  i glided forward, gathering all the lashes i could in the throat of the scissors.  and with a smooth, decisive squeeze, i closed them, snip, and his lashes tumbled away onto his face.  

emboldened by success, i brought the scissors back up and down again near his other eye.  a murmur rose in his chest, and i yanked the scissors back, took a step back, head whipping around and eyes darting, sure that i was caught.  false alarm.  just a regular nightly stirring.

suddenly gripped with the notion that maybe, just maybe what i was doing was wrong, i knew that it was time to commit or flee.  a baby with no eyelashes was something to ignore, but a baby missing half his eyelashes?  that was suspicious, that was a question waiting to be asked, that was **trouble**.

so i doubled down.  i stepped in, i slid the scissors into place, and snip snip, the rest of his eyelashes fell away.

silently, i crept back to my room.  i lay down and looked at the ceiling, then at the deadly little scissors still clenched in my hand.  it was done.  the attention stealing was over.  i had bought my parents love back.  and with that thought, i drifted off to sleep, a smile on my face and scissors clenched in my grasp.

until the next morning.  i was rudely jolted from slumber by the sound of my mother screaming my name from across the house.  the tone of her voice told me that i had perhaps made a miscalculation in my plan somewhere.  but i knew better than to keep her waiting.  i ran to her at a sprint, into my brother's room, and gave my best casual, ""hi mom.""

""WHAT THE HELL DID YOU DO?!"" she screamed.  ""WHAT ARE THOSE?!"" she demanded, pointing at me.

i looked down, and there clenched in my little hand were the manicure scissors.  betrayed by my own hubris, i had never thought to hide them or even put them down.  ""uhh..."" was the only response i was capable of.

but my mother was a genius.  she put it all together instantly.  the creeping, the planning, the removal of the eyelashes.  i saw on her face the horrible knowledge, dwarfed only by fear.  she turned back to my brother, her face pressed to his, looking for the smallest nick, a cut, an eyeball bearing a poke.  but he was fine.  not so much as a scratch.  not a single mark on him, but not a single eyelash either.

i'll wrap up this tale by saying that this stunt absolutely got me tons of attention from all kinds of family members (and child psychologists) - just not the kind i expected.  i certainly never handled anything sharp for a long time, and i found things i had never wanted to touch before were now clearly out of reach.

and now, nearly 30 years later, that little bastard STILL has the longest eyelashes you've ever seen.  my mom still comments on them.  and she still uses clippers instead of manicure scissors.",1431721550,"","False",1,110,"AdviceAnimals"

Back in the early 90's, my parents hit a rough stretch financially. My dad worked in the aerospace industry from the mid 70's through the 80's. When the early 90's came around, the bubble for aerospace had burst, and most places were looking for young, fresh out of school kids, with fresh ideas. Not 50 year old 20 year veterans of the industry. In the course of a year we went from having a home in Orange County, a 5th wheel, and two new cars, to living out of and old yellow Chevy Nova, with our life's possessions stored in a friends barn.

I was only 11 at the time, didn't really fully understand what was going on, but could see the desperation on my parents faces. We slept at a rest area, my parents cozy in the front seat, and me in the back seat.

We would use the showers at the rest area, and when I was at school, my dad would do odd jobs for cash, so we could have enough for the showers, and to do laundry once a week. I only had 3 days worth of clothes, so I constanly mixed and matched my shirts and pants, and had to re-wear some stuff, but never two days in a row, because my mom didn't want to raise anyones suspicion at school.

Every Wednesday we would go by the McDonalds that was on the way to school, and my dad would by me and egg mcmuffin, and mom and dad would have a cup of tea, and a hashbrown.
We did this for a couple of months, and it become our regular routine.

One day, dad came back with is tea, and my mcmuffin, and had a tear in his eye. I asked him what was wrong, and he simply said ""someone decided to bless us today"", and left it at that. When we went to leave, the manager came over and gave me a happy meal, so I could take it to lunch. Usually I just had a cheese sandwhich, so it was a real treat to get a happy meal.

It wasn't until years later that my dad explained to me that, when he went to go pay for the egg mcmuffin, and pulled the last dollar bill out of his wallet, that the manager told him he wasn't paying for his breakfast anymore, because ""your son can eat free"".

Wednesdays became the one bright spot in that very sad and somber 4 months we spent living out of the car. It gave me something to look forward to, and made life feel just that little more normal for us.

It was only an egg mcmuffin and a happy meal, but it made my parents happy to see me excited, and I think the staff there at the mcdonalds knew that, and went out of their way to treat us with kindness.

Now some 20+ years later, it still makes me emotional thinking about it. That someone cared enough to give us a helping hand when we were in a place seemed like we would never get out of.


We did eventually get out of that hole. My dad took a job as an apartment complex maintenance manager, and an apartment was included as part of the pay. And we finally had our own roof over our head, and a place to call home. And for what its worth, my dad found that job sitting at the table, reading the paper, in the mcdonalds on a Wednesday morning, while we had our mcmuffin and tea. Had it not been for the kindness of the staff, we may have never found that job, and my life may have ended up very differently.

So thank you OP. Something as simple as helping people with their food, can sometimes make a major difference in their life that you could never imagine. Thanks for being awesome.

"Grizzant","","","Airlines buy fuel contracts which guarantee a price for a fixed amount of time (known as hedging). this fights against rising fuel costs; so its a good idea to get into one when prices are expected to rise. if prices unexpectedly drop however, they are still bound by the contract to buy gas at X dollars a gallon even if gas costs less than that.

from wikipedia: Typically, airlines will hedge only a certain portion of their fuel requirements for a certain period. Often, contracts for portions of an airline's jet fuel needs will overlap, with different levels of hedging expiring over time.

During the 2009-2010 period, the studies for the airline industry have shown the average hedging ratio to be 64%. Especially during the peak stress periods, the ratio tends to increase.

I do admit its gotten a little easier since my son started Kindergarten. I think it will be easy as shit once he is in school for a full day. But right now this is how my day goes. Wake up at 6:30 make my coffee and iron my sons clothes for school. Wake him up at 7, get him fed and washed up and ready for school. 8:10 out the door to drop him off at school. 8:30am back at home or hit the gym depending on day. 10am start cleaning. One day its bathrooms, another day is mopping and vacuuming, then dusting and other misc, then laundry, etc. I am usually cleaning up until 12:30pm when its time to pick him up from school. Grab him now he is hungry so I have to make him a snack. After his snack its homework time. That is usually an hour. 30 minutes of his HW packet, another 30 minutes of reading. I might chill for another hour then I have to start dinner. Dinner is ready around 5pm which is when my wife gets home. We eat and as soon as we finish eating I start cleaning up the kitchen and doing dishes and packing the wifes lunch for the next day. So now its around 6:30pm we might watch some tv or play with my son for a while. At 8pm its time for the boys shower. Then I put him to bed. My wife is usually in bed by 9pm.

Let's say they're going somewhere relatively nice. Not expensive, but not McDonald's. And let's say it's for no reason other than to break the monotonous cycle of eating ramen, ketchup, and whatever is on clearance. 

Yes. How **DARE** they enjoy something for an hour or so. Wether it be by themself, or with their family. How dare they treat themselves once in a while because their life is fucking difficult, like most of ours will be at one point or another, for *any* number of reasons. It doesn't have to be that they aren't good with money. Another user above (edit: /u/sweetpea122) posted several good reasons they could be in this situation.

And even IF maybe they aren't too good with money, they could be going out to eat just because it'll help them make it through the week without falling into depression and all of the consequences/side effects that come along with it.

.Some of you, particularly  those who think they have recently lost a dog to “death”, don’t really understand this.  I’ve had no desire to explain, but won’t be around forever and must.

Dogs never die.  They don’t know how to. They get tired, and very old, and their bones hurt.  Of course they don’t die. If they did they would not want to always go for a walk, even long after their old bones say:” No, no, not a good idea.  Let’s not go for a walk.”  Nope, dogs always want to go for a walk. They might get one step before their aging tendons collapse them into a heap on the floor, but that’s what dogs are. They walk.

It’s not that they dislike your company. On the contrary, a walk with you is all there is.  Their boss, and the cacaphonic symphony of odor that the world is.  Cat poop, another dog’s mark, a rotting chicken bone ( exultation), and you. That’s what makes their world perfect, and in a perfect world death has no place.

However, dogs get very very sleepy.  That’s the thing, you see. They don’t teach you that at the fancy university where they explain about quarks, gluons, and Keynesian economics. They know so much they forget that dogs never die.  It’s a shame, really.  Dogs have so much to offer and people just  talk a lot.

When you think your dog has died, it has just fallen asleep in your heart.  And by the way, it is wagging it’s tail madly, you see, and that’s why your chest hurts so much and you cry all the time. Who would not cry with a happy dog wagging its tail in their chest. Ouch!  Wap wap wap wap wap, that hurts.  But they only wag when they wake up.  That’s when they say: “Thanks Boss!  Thanks for a warm place to sleep and always next to your heart, the best  place.”

 When they first fall asleep, they wake up all the time, and that’s why, of course, you cry all the time.  Wap, wap, wap.  After a while they sleep more.    (remember, a dog while is not a human while. You take your dog for walk, it’s a day full of adventure in an hour.  Then you come home and it’s a week, well one of your days, but a week, really, before the dog gets another walk. No WONDER they love walks.)

Anyway, like I was saying, they fall asleep in your heart, and when they wake up, they wag their tail.  After a few dog years, they sleep for longer naps, and you would too. They were a GOOD DOG all their life, and you both know it. It gets tiring being a good dog all the time, particularly when you get old and your bones hurt and you fall on your face and don’t want to go outside to pee when it is raining but do anyway, because you are a good dog.  So understand, after they have been sleeping in your heart, they will sleep longer and longer.

But don’t get fooled. They are not “dead.”  There’s no such thing, really. They are sleeping in your heart, and they will wake up, usually when you’re not expecting it.  It’s just who they are.

I feel sorry for people who don’t have dogs sleeping in their heart.  You’ve missed so much.  Excuse me, I have to go cry now.

"Hannibal_Montana","","","EDIT 5: Replied to this post with a summary of main counter-arguments to my theories. Check the comments.

A lot of wrong in here. I'm an analyst that covers U.S. energy, so let me weigh in real quick. 

First of all, it's nowhere near consensus that low gas prices are hurting the economy, you're obviously reading crappy news. I'm not making fun, I'm not saying nobody thinks that, I'm just saying they're wrong. The ONLY support for that argument, which is not a horrible argument, just a short-sighted one, is that most estimates point to about 0.6% - 1.0% of U.S. GDP growth since the financial crisis came from the explosion in U.S. shale gas. 

That being said, low prices do not affect all gas players evenly. For one, there's a difference between natural gas (""dry gas"") producers and oil and gas producers. Most of the fracking in the northeast is dry gas, just straight gaseous methane, with about 6-10% of the production being liquids, including petroleum. Almost all of them require high prices on oil to offset the high cost of production for relatively low priced natural gas. Those producers are much more threatened by low oil prices than producers who produce predominately crude oil. The majority of oil and gas producers are profitable at oil prices over $60/bbl. 

Now two things: For one, I know oil prices are currently below $60/bbl, however this is not a sustainable price. It does not reflect current supply-demand balances and is an overreaction both to the geopolitics around falling prices, and to a rising U.S. dollar. Both of those things should correct over the next couple of months once the markets settle down, and then we'll be able to observe how the actual supply and demand fundamentals actually play out over the medium term (1-2 years). The second thing, is that the vast majority (70-80%) of producers with substantial debt (those who would be in financial trouble first) are hedged 90+% for 2015 (meaning they have already pre-sold their production at prices back when oil was higher priced) and for decent (20-30% by most estimates) for 2016. So they can weather at least one year of low prices, because they'll be selling at higher prices. 


As far as low oil prices helping the economy, in America this is absolutely the case. Anything that allows the American consumer (which accounts for ~70% of our GDP) to spend more is a good thing. While I have not seen the actual study and cannot attest to its rigor or accuracy, the following chart from an Oxford research paper outlines GDP boost for various countries if oil stays at $40/bbl vs. $84/bbl. 

http://www.bloomberg.com/image/i4W2YOzoccF4.jpg

I think that covers the basics. I'm not going to go into the geopolitics but I've addressed it in /r/investing before so I guess just backread my post history? Sorry about having to scroll through all the comments during the Patriots game last night...

EDIT: Ok wasn't going to talk geopolitics, but please stop saying OPEC as if they're acting in unison on this. It is not. Saudi Arabia has been the marginal producer for years, fluctuating their ~2 MMbbl/day of capacity to control prices. However, prices fell after other OPEC countries refused to help Saudi Arabia support prices by cutting additional production to facilitate oil coming back online in Libya and Iraq. They expected Saudi Arabia (and possibly Russia) to bear the full brunt of it and cut their production. They reached an impasse and decided to revisit the discussion in six months (decision was made 11/27/14). Some theories point to a U.S. involvement in KSA's decision in an effort to put further pressure on Russia. I'll copy and paste a previous comment I made about how there are several other geopolitical motivations for KSA to allow prices to fall beyond any coordination with the U.S.:

1. In the near-term, inflict pain on the other OPEC memebers that have thusfar refused to participate in production cuts to accommodate the return of Libya and Iraq production

2. Destabilizing Iran and Iraq (read: ""Shia""). Low oil prices are a none-too-subtle proxy war waged by KSA on Iran over their nuke program, and also their version of Islam. In Iraq, you're also talking about destabilizing an impotent Shia regime that, if the country were to find peace tomorrow, could begin developing what most estimates believe is 9 million bbl/day of capacity, with a completion date of 2020.

3. Saudi Arabia enjoys its position of power in the context of the greater US hegemony. Destabilizing the Middle East, and slowing the massive capital formation in US shale both serve to keep Western eyes and ears focused on the Middle East at a time when the US continues to shift its foreign policy priorities to Asia.

EDIT 2: Accidentally called it methanol, it's methane. Methanol is bad, you get that from improperly distilled liquor... your body breaks it down into formaldehyde and it kills you. Which is bad. So do yourself a favor and avoid your meth head neighbor's hooch. 

EDIT 3: Well hell, I didn't want to keep editing but for gold (2x?!) I gotta. Thanks for the appreciation. Please know that a lot of this is my opinion but I hope that even in that I've helped to frame the way you should be looking at this... whether you choose to disagree (I question this stuff every day, it's when I stop questioning my convictions that I get most worried that I missed something). Keep reading people!

They tried it again and sure enough there was sizable movement.

They went to her husband and explained what happened, telling him, ""As crazy as this sounds, maybe a little oral sex will do the trick and bring her out of the coma.""

The husband was skeptical, but they assured him that they'd close the curtains for privacy. The husband finally agreed and went into his wife's room.

After a few minutes the woman's monitor flat lined, no pulse, no heart rate.

The nurses run back into the room. ""What happened?!""

"Darth_Cosby","","","As a lawyer, I can tell you that they are asking you to come in early tomorrow so they can have you sign something that releases them of responsibility for damages due to defamation and wrongful termination. Whether you want to keep your job there or not, do not go in without an attorney present. Given the chain of events in the case, I think it likely that you can find an attorney that will work on contingency. Check with your state bar association and they will be able to refer you to someone competent in your area.

The good news is that right now the HR director who fired you/corporate office is shitting their pants.

Edit based on what I've seen or answered elsewhere: 

1. Stop sending e-mails to the company. They will be entered as evidence in any lawsuit. Your attorney will be your intermediary and will ensure that you won't inadvertently hurt your case. Your company's legal counsel will absolutely be advising the CEO and HR head about any correspondence with with you.

2. I don't work employment law, so someone may contradict me, but if you need to take a personal day tomorrow rather than attend the meeting alone, you should do so. I think in this situation, it would unreasonable for the company to demand that you are back tomorrow. Just know that this will tip them off that you are most likely exploring your legal options. Like I said, someone more knowledgable in the field may contradict me. Follow your attorney's advice about this more than mine.

3. Try not to contact coworkers about the firing and realize that they may be reticent to testify in your favor despite being on your side for fear of professional harm. Your lawyer will take care of this, but until then you may be saying things that could come out later in court and at the very least putting your friends in a difficult position.

**Final Edit** (while I'm on lunch):

People are chiding OP for selling out, which I think is unfair. OP reached a resolution that gave him personal closure and helped provide for his family. A lot of people (and some lawyers) would say take them to court for every dime you can but they probably haven't seen the toll of drawn out cases, heavy attorney fees and years of financial insecurity until cases reach resolution. Nevermind that defamation suits are far from a sure thing and he'd be up against a hard hitting legal team. If he's satisfied with what they offered and an apology then hopefully he's off to a better, happier future.

My advice is to pay down your debts, look into the best way to make that money work for you, and take your family/counsel out to a nice dinner.

So I started ordering more food, but then I explained my wife was eating for two to the pizza guy.  Next, we inevitably had more children.  Eventually I got to yell ""Hey kids, it's pizza time!"" and I'd rig my computer so that it would play a sound file of kids screaming in the other room.  Then I'd make little jokes about the kids and how much they look forward to pizza night.  Sometimes we'd have friends over, or I'd place a super big order for the Super Bowl.

You go from being the wise, strong, dependable provider for your family to being a mentally and physically frail liability to them.

The longer you live, the more they come to resent you. Not for lack of deserved appreciation, but because for the first time in cultural history, parents are living long enough to become financial burdens on the next two or three generations—thanks to a perfect storm of inadequate social security, sky-high private medical costs, and a poorer-than-ever middle/lower class.

Grandchildren and great-grandchildren—who never knew you as you wish to have been remembered—will only ever see you as a sad, unrelatable dependent on their parents. They will correctly see time and resources poured into your continued existence as waste that should have gone to them.

They are not selfish. You have given all you can and have nothing left to live for. This doesn't make you sad, this is something you are proud of. What depresses you is the fact that while you wish to die defined by your achievements and intact personality, archaic expectations and social etiquette will bind your family into keeping you alive for as long as the available technology (though not the financial resources) will allow them to do so—ensuring that your final moments are colored by pity and followed by shameful, but apparent relief.

PPRECIATE IT.

EVERY SINGLE DAY HE SAID PPRECIATE IT.

I've heard this bloke from down the hallway talking to random people and I could mouth along with him, ""how you doing, ppreciate it."" He was like a fucking NPC!

Turns out that it gets a bit annoying after a while. No matter how nice this dude is you can only handle PPRECIATE IT so many times before it starts to sound fake as fuck. So one day I was heading to the bathroom, which was way  down the hall. He was walking several yards ahead of me, turned around, nodded, but I refused eye contact and was thus shamefully spared of  my daily PPRECIATE IT. This guy was going to the bathroom too, and he reached the door a full fifteen seconds before I did. So I kept walking... but after he entered the door, it didn't close behind him. I was like ""what?"" I was getting closer and closer to the door-- this was like, ten seconds of sluggish moping and counting-- and the door did not close.

Then it dawned on me. This crazy kindhearted bastard was spending close to thirty seconds just standing there in the bathroom holding the door open for me. How did he even know where I was going? Why was-- IT'S STILL OPEN!

I wasn't even walking anymore. I had frozen in my tracks. There was this rectangle of light pouring from the bathroom into the hallway and I knew it would burn my skin if I touched it. I didn't budge. And it just stayed there. He was just out of view, hovering, ppreciating.

So I turned back around and headed to my room. I'd hold it. No way I was gonna ppreciate that guy holding the bathroom door open, standing there waiting for going  on  a minute now. Like wow.

So after a few minutes I returned to the hallway and the door was closed. Now's my chance! I sprinted forward, I reached the door, as closed as a Sabbath Chik-Fil-A, and I grabbed the handle, and I wrenched it open, and there he was, drying his hands on the way out of the bathroom.

"copious_hyperbole","","","I remember once I was at a wedding with a bunch of friends. They were all dancing and having a good time and I was sitting and having a good time. They decided that their good time would be better if they ruined my good time. ""Come on copious_hyperbole, it's fun"" they said. ""You'll have a good time"" they said. Despite my pleas and my assurance that I have danced before and genuinely disliked it, they would not be swayed from their terrible goal.

They eventually dragged me, and I mean that they literally dragged me to the dance floor. The song that was playing ended almost immediately when we got to the dance floor. I thought perhaps my luck would change and my former friends (for that is what they had become) would allow me to retreat. Alas, it didn't happen that way.

Then it happened. A familiar tune began playing. Everyone on the floor began screaming. People were rushing to the dance floor to dance to this song. Somehow in all the confusion, I realized that everyone had formed a circle and to my horror, I was standing alone in the center.

The music pulsed and built up and I felt strange as if my body wasn't my own. I was almost to nervous to realize that I no longer had control of my senses. Suddenly Lil Jon screamed through the speakers ""Fire up the loud, Another round of shots!""

"Javin007","","","I love that this is getting so many upvotes on reddit.  As a bee keeper that would LOVE to get a free hive of bees that are acclimatized to the local area, I will gladly collect a swarm free of charge.  I also don't charge if the hives are easily accessible.  I will, however, have to charge for any sort of removal that requires a ""cut-out"" (or cutting away of material to reach the bees) just due to the danger involved.  There's also a contract to sign that says that any damage done to the property is the responsibility of the owner to get repaired.  (Having done small scale construction, I do at least know enough to do the least amount of damage humanly possible).  

There's other reasons not to spray the bees, other than the obvious fact that it kills perfectly friendly and important honey bees:  You ever smelled a bunch of rotting brood in the summer?  Imagine that scent going into your house every year.  Not to mention that you may be able to kill off the hive, but after that poison eventually dissipates, other bees will find the hive and rob it.  So for at least a short time, you'll end up with more bees flying around, and you won't know if they're moving in to set up shop, or just stealing the honey.  Then there's the fact that an established comb is an attractive target for more bees (or wax moths, cockroaches, etc.) to move in and set up shop.  Presuming you seal the hole up well enough, you still have to contend with the scads of ants that will eventually find the old honey/brood.  

There's plenty of reasons to simply have the comb professionally removed.  Even cut-outs tend to be very cheap in the scheme of things.  

But PLEASE let me make ONE suggestion.  Before you call a bee keeper to remove the hive/swarm, *get a picture of one of them*.  Even a blurry picture is easy enough to identify for anyone experienced with the critters.  

[This is a yellow jacket.](http://www.pesticide.org/Alternatives/phase-2-solutions-for-consumers/YellowJacket.jpg)  Not a honey bee.  These are highly aggressive, and can sting multiple times (until their venom runs out).  This is the single most common call I get.  Their nests are made of paper, and can range from ""[normal and small](http://img.thrfun.com/img/018/855/yellow_jackets_nest_s.jpg)"" to ""[sweet holy Jesus burn the whole town to the ground.](http://www.pestid.msu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/YellowJacketNestInCarInterior.jpg)"".  They will build nests *anywhere*.  Inside trees, hanging from trees, in bushes, in garages, in the ground, doesn't matter.  Worse still, they are carnivorous, and I've even witnessed them *eating my bees*.  I can't describe how much I hate these things.  They are an [invasive species](http://cisr.ucr.edu/german_yellowjacket.html), and I would recommend anyone that sees them stock up on RAID and do your part to help these bastards go extinct.  Worse still, an estimated 1 in 1000 are deathly allergic to their venom (compared to anywhere from 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 50,000 allergies to honey bees.)  

The [Honey Bee](http://www.atlanticpestsolutions.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/honey-bee-md.jpg) is furrier, cuter, and friendlier.  They can only sting one time before dying, and they know it.  Typically, they will ""ping"" you (bounce off of you) as a warning if you get too close (seriously close, like within 3-6 feet) to their hive.  The vast majority of people that get stung each year are stung for reasons that have nothing to do with aggression on the part of the honey bee:   

1.) The bee got tangled in hair, and people panic and start swatting instead of letting it untie itself and fly away.   
2.) The bee landed on someone (they'll drink sweat) and they panicked, and smashed it, getting stung.  
3.) The bee was just checking you out because you looked interesting (they like bright colors) and you panicked, and swatted it, causing it to land on someone else, or inside of your own clothing.  
4.) The person stepped on them bare-footed.  

I don't have statistics, but I'd personally estimate that (if you take domestic bee hives out of the equation) that would probably account for 99.99% of honey bee stings each year.  Even ""Africanized"" honey bees (which are far less frightening than the media makes them out to be) don't go out and hunt people down.  They only respond (with lethal force) to people disturbing their hives.  

So rambling aside, honey bees are generally friendly, wasps are not.  Honey bees you can seldom, if ever, see the nests, wasps you can ([mud daubers](http://pestcemetery.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/picture-42.png) are another common nuisance wasp, but not nearly as aggressive as the yellow jacket).  

Then there's [carpenter bees](http://natural-japan.net/photos/Xylocopa_appendiculata04.jpg).  These idiots are the ""Scrappy Doo"" of bees.  The females have stingers, but they tend to be docile, and hide out in their holes.  The males, on the other hand, are *very aggressive* and will fly around in your face all scary-like, despite the fact that they don't have stingers at all, and the best they can do is bump into you angrily.  While they're harmless to people, [the damage they'll do to your house](http://www.pestid.msu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/LarvaeInGalleries.jpg) makes it important to exterminate them on site.  

But all of this said, bee keepers will *only remove honey bees*.  We are not exterminators.  But we're usually glad to come out and pick up a free hive (they cost us close to $200 a pop to get a hive shipped to us) and in a perfect world, we'll find a [swarm](https://planbeeproject.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/bees-swarm-bicycle.jpg) that hasn't established itself yet.  (Swarms are lazy, gentle, and not at all interested in stinging anyone.  They are far more interested in finding a new home than in attacking anyone, as they're full of honey they loaded up on for the trip.  They look scary, but they're the *least* dangerous thing you'll find.)

This guy who was killed by an elephant was a major contributor to wildlife management and habitat restoration both in Africa and North America.  I have seen him in many hunting expos giving speeches about restoration of wildlife habitats and how crucial it is for others to be law abiding citizens and do things such as dedicate time and resources so that we, the people, can preserve habitats that way our children and their children can have what we have and see species of animals that if it was for us conservatives, they would go extinct.  We lost a very nice man who probably valued the land and respected it and the animals more so then most people do who are anti- hunters.  Granted you know the risks you take hunting game such as bears, lions, Cape buffalo, rhinos, moose, and elephants.

"SyrupLicker","","","**""Hey guys, Techie Todd here, and today I'm going to show you how to change your screen resolution in Windows 7 with just four clicks!**

I've been getting a ton of requests for a tutorial like this from PC users who have purchased a new monitor, and don't know why their display is all blown up and pixelated. Well, today we're gonna break it down for you and teach how to solve this in just a few seconds.

Now, real quick before we get started I wanna give a quick shout out to all of you who have been supporting and donating this last month. Thanks a lot guys, it's because of you that I'm able to keep doing these videos! I really appreciate your help. And hey, if you're a first time viewer, that's great too! Hopefully you'll find this video helpful, and maybe even become a subscriber or donator yourself! There's also lots of videos in my channel, addressing some of the most common computer problems and solutions, as well as special livestreams of tech event coverage! Feel free to click the links after my video, or check my Twitter feeder for chances to win free PC gear every month!

Okay, so back to today's tutorial: *Changing your resolution*. If you've recently purchased a new monitor, you might notice when you hook it up to your PC that the desktop, icons and text are way too big! As you can see here, I have a monitor with an improper resolution. See how the picture is blown up and pixelated?  This is because the size of the of the pixels, and the dimensions of the screen, are not properly matched up to the size of your new monitor. Most monitors these days have wider screens, and require a resolution much wider than that used for older square-shaped monitors. What you have to do is change the resolution of your screen to one that fits the size and dimension of whatever new monitor you've purchased.

Thankfully, Windows makes it fairly easy to change the resolution of your system with only a couple clicks. This can be done through control panel, but I'm actually going to show you a shortcut that allows you to bypass all that and get to the same menu without dealing with the start bar.

Now the first thing you're going want to do is start up your computer with the new monitor plugged in. If you're computer is already on, go ahead exit or minimize any programs you have open, and go out so you can view your desktop screen. Okay, now I'm gonna show you here, what happens when you click on the desktop. If you do the standard left click you're, of course, just going to either click an icon or create a selection box. However, that's not what we're gonna be doing here. Instead, I'd like you to click the right button of your mouse on the desktop. Now, if you do it on an icon or folder it's going to take you to the wrong context menu, so go ahead and make sure it's on a part of your desktop where there's no nothing else to click on.

Now you'll notice, when I do that, there's a submenu bar that pops up on the right. At the top you're gonna see ""view, sort by..."" and other options. Below that are a series of options related to selecting, copying, pasting, etc. This is mostly for dealing with files and folders, so we're just going to ignore that for now. Instead I want you to scroll down past all those options, to the very bottom where it says ""screen resolution""

Now, you're going to first see a diagram of your monitor at the top. Below that are three drag down bars with various options. The one we're going to want to focus on is the ""resolution"" bar, as this is what will allow us to change our system's resolution to one that matches our monitor. Go ahead and click on it, and you'll see a list of various options. Most will be numbers, and this actually shows you the pixel measurements of both width and height of your screen. Now, a really cool feature in Windows 7 is that the operating system can actually detect what kind of monitor you have, and recommenced a resolution size for you to use. So, I'm going to scroll down to the recommended resolution which, in my case, is 1920 x 1080, but yours might be different. After that, I'm simply going to click ""okay"".

And there you have it! As you can see, my resolution is now the proper size. The desktop doesn't look too big or pixelated, and the icons are small and the text readable. If for whatever reason the recommended setting doesn't work, you can always try different ones until you get it right, but usually the recommended one should be okay. 

Well folks, that's how you quickly change your resolution in Windows 7. Hopefully that solves all your problems. If there's anything I left out, and any problems you still have, go ahead and leave me a comment in the comments section, and I'll try to address in the next video if I have time. Also, if there's any requests for future tutorials, go ahead and put something in the comments as well. And as I said before, a huge to thanks to my donators and subscribers, and please consider subscribing if you found this video helpful. Allright guys, well until next time, this is Techie Todd and thanks for watching!
