Our O-line was stellar early and was failing late. We had Bell running a dominant run game at the beginning, then started handing it over to Riddick and Bush and forced Stafford to throw it most of the time, and that's where we got into trouble -- we became predictable.

Our D-line was great all game for the most part, particularly Suh. Dallas somehow scrambled enough to run our secondary ragged.

BUT THAT SAID:

Fowler wasn't going to be the missing piece that made the Jaguars competitive this season.  That honor belongs to Bortles, the line, and more generally speaking, the offense as a whole.  If they take a step up, the season will be a success.  If they don't, it won't.  It's just that simple.  Fowler not being out there is going to suck.  But the defense gave the offense every opportunity to win last season and it was the offense that just didn't get it done.  That can't happen this year, and having Fowler off the field won't break the season.

I'll miss seeing him out there.   I hope he comes back fully recovered; he's young, I expect he'll be fine next year.

"relaximapro1","panthers","Panthers","I know it usually falls on deaf ears, but this being a Steve Smith post... to hell with it.

Prime Steve Smith is one of the greatest wider receivers *ever* in my opinion.  You give him some consistent QB play over that span and he would've put up straight video game numbers.  For an elite wide receiver, he had some of the most inconsistent and straight up worst QB play of any of them.  I'm not even going to list the names, because it was a straight up carousel.  He only had about 2 1/2 years of good Jake (and even ""good"" Jake was inconsistent as shit).

He's had 2 HOF caliber DBs (Barber and Taylor) just recently call him the toughest assignment they ever had, with Revis recently saying something similar - and Revis has only faced him twice IIRC... once with Steve as an old man, and another time with 2009 Jake Delhomme throwing interceptions every 5 passes.  Quite a few other DBs who's names are drawing a blank right now have shared similar sentiments.

From the article:

&gt; Among players ranked in the top 25 for career postseason receiving yards, Smith's average of 91.0 per game ranks first. Michael Irvin (82.2) ranks second, with Jerry Rice (77.4) third

The guy has always been straight money in the playoffs.  If no one else showed up for the postseason, Steve was there to give you 150%... even if as an old man it wasn't quite as much as it used to be.

&gt;» In a revealing article highlighting the diminutive receiver's career dominance, Football Perspective's Chase Stuart notes that Smith's 2005 season was the best in modern history in terms of receiving yards per team pass attempt. Smith's 2008 season is the second best.

Played on a heavy run first team with an average at best QB where he was the *only* receiving threat throughout his entire career - other than 2003 (which was his breakout season) with Moose and Proehl.  Faced double and triple teams on the regular through his prime years.  Was quick as lightning with cat-like balance/reflexes, tough as nails, surprisingly hard to bring down, strong as a mule, with a ridiculous vertical... all traits that allowed him to play way above his size and as a *legitimate* #1 threat that does everything - even regularly ran fade routes at 5'9 (and the best WR we've ever had at it)... not strictly a gadget WR or strictly slot receiver that only line up on the outside on occasion that many other smaller receivers most the time are asked to be.  Steve made his living on the outside eating up double teams.

&gt; Since the 1970 merger, Smith (2005), Rice (1990) and Sterling Sharpe (1992) are the only players to win the wide-receiver triple crown, leading the league in receptions, receiving yards and receiving touchdowns.

&gt;Per Stuart's metrics, that 2005 season ranks as the 12th-best by a wide receiver since 1932. Smith then added 373 yards from scrimmage and five total touchdowns in three playoff games.

&gt;From 2005 through 2008, Smith was the most dominant receiver in the league. In 48 games with Jake Delhomme at quarterback over that span, Smith averaged an astonishing 101.3 yards from scrimmage to go with 38 touchdowns.

Sorry, just a sad Panther fan venting who feels that Smitty isn't recognized nearly as much as he should be, and feels he was one of the best straight up football players of his generation.  Even taking the homer glasses off, in all my years of watching football Smitty has to be top 3 of one of the toughest SOBs I've ever seen step foot on the gridiron.  He caught a pass in a game against the Giants once... Safety completely snapped his arm in half with the insuing hit... Steve bounced off, kept his balance, and kept on running towards the endzone for a touchdown.

Given a Brady, Manning, Brees, or hell... even just a consistent top 10 QB for his career and I don't have a doubt in my mind he'd be a HOF lock right now.  The guy has just had pretty tough luck for most of his career.

&gt; CTE is not real

Yes, it is.  It is a legitimate medical diagnosis accepted by the scientific community.  Unless you have some groundbreaking research in this area that has yet to be published, your claim has as much validity as someone who says that the Earth was created 10,000 years ago and rests on the back of a giant turtle.

&gt; The brain scans of players with ""CTE"" are highly consistent with the brain scans of long time alcoholics and users of cocaine. 

This may be true, but we don't know, since a brain scan wouldn't be done on a player suspected of CTE.  It would be waste of time, since CTE can only be confirmed by an autopsy after the player dies.  Again, unless you have some evidence of this claim, it's turtles all the way down.

&gt; All these former players from the 60's and 70's and 80's and 90's all were rich for their respective eras. and guess what people with money do for fun?

You're speaking from ignorance again.  Johnny Unitas tiled floors in the off-season.  Jim Brown was a marketing rep - not a paid spokesperson - for Pepsi.  Lou Groza sold insurance.  It wasn't until the early-to-mid 1980s that football became a year-round job and players made enough money from the sport to avoid taking a second job in the offseason.  Did some guys waste their money on drugs and pussy even back then?  Absolutely.  But people also live drug free and buy really big boats and really fast cars, so unless you have a documented history of what every player diagnosed with CTE did in their life, your assertions are hearsay.

&gt; One of the more recent incidents was the death of Rob Bironas, a kicker, whose brain was revealed to have signs of ""CTE"".

Source?  Bironas died in a car crash, and a toxicology report was released.  Some writers suspected CTE, but I don't believe his brain was ever tested for CTE.

&gt; It's a combination of substance abuse and the mental shock you go through when you fall out of the lime light post career (see: Junior Seau). You go from the world treating you like royalty to people not giving a shit about you in a matter of months. You see it happen in CEO's all the time when they step down. They're dead within three years of retirement.

That may very well be true.  Could you direct me to a peer-reviewed study that shows this, and not repeated brain trauma, is the case for ex-football players?

&gt; But do a little research and stop buying into the sensationalism. 

Perhaps you should do a little research as well.  The link between football and CTE is not as well-established as, say, the link between smoking and cancer, but it's certainly pointing in that direction.  And while CTE is a boogeyman of sorts, in that the media likes to throw it out any time an ex-player runs into trouble, it's almost certainly not the mirage that you claim it is.

&gt; Do you have any idea how much the lawyers in these cases stand to gain?

A lot.  How is that revelant?  The lawyers in Big Tobacco cases had millions to gain as well.

&gt; Edit: I'll head off the rebuttal arguments right now. You know which sport has the highest rate of suicide? Cricket. Followed by baseball, then futbol, then football. You know which sport has the highest rate of autoimmune diseases like ALS and MS? Basketball.

Did you also know that SpongeBob lives in a pineapple under the sea?  I'm asking because that fact has about as much relevance as your cricket fact.  I mean, it's almost as though suicide can be the result of a number of factors, many of which aren't related to sports at all.  Unbelievable, I know.  Are some of the NFL suicides blamed on CTE due to something else entirely?  Sure.  CTE is convenient and there's a class action suit, so I'm sure people are jumping aboard that money train.  But is anyone claiming that NFL suicides are the due solely to CTE?  No.  Is anyone claiming that the NFL has the highest suicide rate of any sport?  No.",1424048020,"","False",1,9,"nfl"

"JudiciousF","broncos","Broncos","I've finally been convinced that Brady is better than Manning, and probably the greatest of all time. And to be perfectly honest, while it took him winning the Super Bowl while performing so well against a D (albeit an injured D) that crushed Peyton to convince me of it, even if they had lost it wouldn't affect my arguments for believing this now.

Football requires luck to win. Being the best team, doesn't give you a super bowl win. So the only thing you can do is be consistently good enough to win a super bowl, then wait for the circumstances to line up right. The Patriots success has a lot to do with Belichick, which is the only possible argument against Brady in my opinion, but really the key word is consistency.

What Brady gives you a consistent reliable performance, regardless of circumstances. When I watch a Broncos game, with Peyton I have that moment where I wonder, is this gonna be one of the games where Peyton can't possibly miss, and just absolutely scorches the other team every time he's out on the field, or is it gonna be an off day where he's just throwing ducks into tight coverage? Brady has off days like that too, but way fewer, and more imporantly they seem to be 100% uncorrelated to how tough his opponent is and to how important the game is. The thing Brady has that Peyton doesn't is consistency, composure, and confidence. He brings his A game every time, he doesn't get rattled when he's struggled throughout a game, and he never believes he's out of any contest.

I used to think those were just side effects of playing on a Belichick coached team, but at this point its clear he has them in a way that other people on the Patriots don't. He's as much of a source for the confidence and composure of his teammates as Belichick is. 

These traits, Confidence, Composure, and Consistency, don't translate into gaudy stats, but they translate into wins. This was the reason it was so hard for me to accept that Brady is the best, because I'm not actually that impressed by his QB skills. I don't watch individual games and think, ""Holy shit he's good."" the way I think that about Rodgers or Peyton. But somehow I always flinch when Brady comes on the field, I just know that somehow he's going to find a way to ruin my day. I know this because he ALWAYS does it. It's not any individual performance that's convinced me of this, its his entire career looked at as a whole.

I'm willing to entertain the idea that Brady would've been NOTHING without Belichick. That without Belichick there to game plan for Brady's specific skills, and to coach a crazy defense capable of winning three super bowls in four years, that Brady would not have been able to develop the confidence and composure he has now, that if he had been put on a different team he would be inconsistent, and likely out of the league at this point. However, he did have Belichick, and the result of his entire career is the best result of any QB's entire career in history. At least in my opinion.",1423157410,"","1423157673",1,183,"nfl"

2. By having Mohamed as a threat to the pass rush, it prevented Frederick and Leary from sliding to the right since Leary have to account for Mohamed initially so Frederick had to take on Jamison. By having Jamison to take on Frederick, they now have 1 on 1 matchups with Free/Reed and Martin/Watt which gave them lots of space to execute their stunts.

3. It clearly threw Leary off and made him go late at sliding to his right to take on Jamison. That split second delay allowed Jamison to control Frederick and not allow him to slide to his right to help against the stunt.

""Well this game is done, Russell Wilson isn't can't make this deficit up if he had 4 extra quarters""-said when the Patriots went up 14-7 near the end of the half. 

""I thought the Seahawks were a good team? Their defense is mediocre at best"" -tie game, 3rd quarter. 

""Seacocks""-11 points sometime during the game. ""HAHA HOWS IT FEEL SHERMAN YOU BITCH""- end of the game. 

""I'd take Cutler and Palmer over Wilson""- post game. 

""Haha wow I'm surprised you still have that flair, I didn't think I'd to see anymore after today""-post game in response to a seahawks fan's opinion on something was stated (a pretty good argument at that, as well). 

OH and this one had 35 points last I saw: ""I'd rather my QB put the team on his back and fall apart in the Championship game than go to the Super Bowl so he can audible out of the play so he can be the star and throw it all away"" -some thread where Luck vs Wilson came up just like 90% of threads.

I know these ones are cherry picked a little and have recency bias but I'd bet money you can all think of comments similar to these in the past. It's time to stop pretending this sub doesn't have a fat bias against a group simply based on the flair they pick and that it's all ""their fault"" the place treats them so bad.

"Tabemaju","vikings","Vikings","Since this was a copy from our sub, I'll go ahead and copy my response, because I am totally sick of people justifying his cap hit:

I hate to break up the circlejerk, but I hate this article.  He starts off with his homer justification by saying this:

&gt;  The Vikings are one of the better salary cap managed teams in the NFL, and never have to make draconian cuts just to get under whatever the cap number is going to be.

Oh, so because the Vikings are good at managing their cap, it's okay for them to pay a player *$6 million more* than the next highest paid player.  That is **not** good cap management, and no amount of excuses will make it good, but for arguments sake, let's take a look at what he has to say:

&gt; So let's look at some cuts the Vikings could make, not including Peterson, and see how their cap situation stands then.

This has nothing to do with whether it is financially responsible to be paying AD as much as we are.

&gt; Um...so what? Is it your money? No, it isn't? Okay, then. If the Vikings have the cap room to do everything they need...and they will...what does it matter?

Awful argument.  I can't have an opinion because I'm not spending my money on a player's salary?  What about the money I spend on merchandise? To go to games?  What about the money I spend in taxes to pay your stadium?  To say I have nothing invested in the team and how the team is managed is not only ridiculous, but **insulting**.  Great teams are great teams because they give a shit about their *fans*, not their profitability, because they know that the two are not mutually exclusive.  I want a well-managed team - hell, I **deserve** a well managed team after decades of fuck ups.  Don't give me the ""it's not your money"" bullshit - fuck you, it *is* my money.

&gt; The Vikings paid out Jared Allen's contract in full, which was an astronomical $17 million against the salary cap.

And how did that work out for them?  Was it economical?  Could we have used that money somewhere else?  *Of course!*  We paid a player we were going to lose in free agency a ridiculous amount of money to put up mediocre numbers *and you're using it as an example of why we should pay Peterson*?

&gt; Did Allen's contract prevent the Vikings from doing what they wanted in free agency or the draft?

What kind of stupid statement is this?  You have no idea what the Vikings would have done in free agency with an additional $17 million.  Like we were somehow a good team with no holes on Allen's contract year!

&gt; The Vikings aren't afraid to pay out contracts if the player earns it, so cutting Peterson just to cut him doesn't seem like something the Vikings will do.

Earned it?  Yes, he had a great 2012, a decent 2013, and *he didn't even play* in 2014.  And we paid him!  How has he ""earned"" it?  I have no problem with making him the highest paid RB in the league, I have a problem with making him the highest **by $6 million**.  It blows my mind that people excuse Peterson's off the field issues, and think we somehow owe him an apology, when in fact *he* is the one that owes *us* an apology.

&gt; kay, so I've just showed you that with two cuts, the Vikings are sitting at $30 million in cap space. There's no one in free agency...NO ONE...that is worth throwing a huge contract at, and $30 million allows the Vikings to go after anyone they want, at any position.

Bullshit.  Absolute bullshit.  We have a *lot* of holes to fill, and acting like we have unlimited spending money because no one player is worth $30 million is ludicrous.  Good teams don't justify bad cap moves, and great teams don't put themselves in the position in the first place.  It's a bad contract, and I will be incredibly disappointed if the Vikings bend over and agree to pay it.  I have no doubt that the Vikings will pay it if they are forced to, but Peterson is not worth $15 million, even if he puts together another 2,000 yard season.",1423932373,"","False",1,159,"nfl"

"pastamagician","bengals","Bengals","OK this explains everything. The Patriots underinflated the balls before the game, and the officials only gave it a squeeze test instead of using a pressure gauge so they didn't notice. The Patriots then had a ball boy deliberately deflate 11 of their 12 game balls in the bathroom outside the officials' locker to give Tom Brady an even greater advantage at passing the ball and so that they would never fumble. Then one league official stole a kicking ball to sell, and he gave another unauthorized kicking ball to McNally. McNally knew that the new kicking ball was unauthorized, but he figured it would give the Colts a disadvantage, so he tried to pass it off as genuine to the officials, who noticed it was fake, which made the officials suspicious that the Patriots were doctoring their own balls. In the meantime, Brady threw an interception to D'Qwell Jackson, who noticed that the game ball was underinflated because of a combination of the ball boy's efforts and the cold weather. D'Qwell Jackson handed it off to an equipment manager, who gave it to Grigson, who had conspired with Harbaugh and Kensil to run a sting operation to catch the Patriots in deflating the balls. But in order to make sure the Patriots got in trouble, before handing the intercepted ball over to Kensil, Grigson further deflated the intercepted ball. And also the Colts overinflated their balls above 13.5 PSI before the game so that they would fall within the correct pressure range when the balls were measured at half time as part of the conspiracy sting, which the officials again did not notice because of the squeeze test's inaccuracy. Kensil assembled the Patriots' balls and individually measured and inflated them two times: once in the second quarter where most balls were between a few ticks and 1 PSI under 12.5 PSI, and this resulted in a Colts' ball being used by the Patriots' offense while the Patriots' balls were unavailable, and once again during half time in the officials' locker room where balls were 2 PSI under 12.5 PSI, which resulted in a delay at the beginning of the third quarter.

&gt;Tim Tebow has reached agreement on a new deal with the Eagles, two sources said Sunday.

&gt;Tebow is scheduled to arrive in Philadelphia -- and get a deal done -- in time to be in attendance for the start of the Eagles off-season program Monday.

&gt;Philadelphia has finalized an agreement with the 27-year-old Tebow, the framework of which was put into place when he worked out for the team last month.

&gt;Before signing Tebow, the Eagles first wanted to try to trade backup quarterback Matt Barkley. But when the team could not get enough in return, it decided to bring in Tebow anyway so that he could be present for the team’s entire off-season program.
Tebow now will join a crowded Eagles’ quarterback roster that includes Sam Bradford, Mark Sanchez and Barkley, giving Philadelphia three former first-round picks at the quarterback position in addition to another decorated college player. And it also will reunite Tebow and Sanchez, who were teammates with the New York Jets. 


&gt;Football’s most interesting team this off-season, the Eagles, just got even more interesting – if that were possible. Tebow now will attempt to jumpstart an NFL career that has been on hold since he played his last NFL game in 2012. Since then, Tebow continued to train for two full seasons with the noted throwing coach, Tom House, who also has worked with New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady. 

&gt;Tebow, who has been working for ESPN and as an analyst for the SEC Network, last played in an NFL regular-season game when he was with the Jets after playing two seasons with the Denver Broncos.

&gt;Tebow went to training camp with the Patriots before being released in August 2013. He struggled to find consistency with the Patriots, completing 11 of 30 passes for 145 yards and two touchdowns and two interceptions in three preseason games.
""I will remain in relentless pursuit of continuing my lifelong dream of being an NFL quarterback,"" Tebow wrote on Twitter after he was released by New England.

"chadpatrick","lions","Lions","Johnny Unitas was a fucking amazing football player.

Unitas was one of the first pure passers.  He could read defenses like no other QB at the time.  Like most QBs of the time he called his own plays.  What made him so different was his ability to take advantage of what he saw.  

More than this though, Johnny U was the undisputed leader on the field.  Players who stepped into his huddle knew that he was in charge and listened completely.  Tight End John Mackey is famously quoted as saying, *""It's like being in a huddle with God.""* 

The Colts players didn't just play for the team, they played for Johnny U.  The respect that they showed him was well earned.  On one play in particular Mackey dropped a deep pass that he should have caught.  The Colts fans we vocally upset.  When the players got back into the huddle John just said *""Same Play""*, looked at Mackey and said *""Silence the crowd.""*  And broke huddle.  

The result:  Touchdown Mackey.

Also Unitas was tough as hell.  Raymond Berry, said that what made Unitas so good and so different,  *''was his uncanny instinct for calling the right play at the right time, his icy composure under fire, his fierce competitiveness and his utter disregard for his own safety.''*  Near the end of the fourth quarter in the 1958 Championship Game he took the field with three broken ribs. Pat Summerall and the Giants were leading 17-14.  In less than a minute and a half Unitas took the team down field with 7 completions and set up the game-tying field goal.  Johnny then lead the Colts to an overtime victory with an 80 yard drive capped off by a TD run by Al Ameche. 

In another game his nose was bleeding badly.  A ref was trying to see how badly he was hurt because blood was pouring out of his face.  He yelled for the ref to get the hell out of the way so he could call the play.  One of his linemen stuffed his nose with dirt to stop the bleeding long enough for John to throw the game winning TD.

***tl;dr***  The coaches never admitted to paying for injuries (despite what /r/nfl would have you believe). They said there was a pay for performance pool, which paid for interceptions, fumbles, and yes, big hits - but players didnt get paid if a hit was illegal or flagged. Goodell also never produced any solid evidence to back up injuries - just circumstantial evidence and evidence backing up the pay for performance pool.


---------

Roger Goodell claimed the Saints had a system from 2009-2011 where they would pay to specifically injure other players. He claimed to have several thousand pages of evidence of this, but refused to show it to anyone. Instead, he *said* what *some* of the evidence was, and the media went to town taking his word for it.

The coaches and players never admitted to any bounties - only to a pay for performance program, where you would get bonuses for interceptions, fumbles, big hits, etc. 

But by then, public opinion was easily swayed by the media showing one hit on Kurt Warner, a few hits on Favre, and playing one audio tape by Gregg Williams, over and over and over and over, while *still* not asking to actually *see* any of the other evidence Goodell had.

To further advance the farce Goodell brought in a ""special investigator"" Mary Jo White, who claimed they had received a signed confession from a player, so the case was basically open and shut.

But then the NFLPA leaked the ""confession"" and it wasnt a confession. 

Goodell said he had the bounty ledger, full of pages of a history of payments for ""cart offs"" and other injuries. Except when they released a page that had ""cart off"" payments on it, it was for a game where no one had been injured. The NFL quickly revised their statement saying it was actually for a different game.... that also didnt have any injuries in it.

The NFL then said they had a powerpoint presentation from Gregg Williams to the defense that specifically references bounty payments.  Except the NFLPA leaked that one too, and it was a ridiculous Dog the Bounty Hunter themed presentation that was just creating metaphors for their gameplan to the popular-at-the-time TV Show.

Those are just a few examples. Basically, any time Goodell said he had evidence, and it got leaked, that ""evidence"" didnt say what Goodell said it did.

And yet no one in the media really cared about all the inconsistencies. They kept writing their articles about how shameful all this was. Getting on their soapboxes. Pete Prisco, in 2011, had said the Falcons shouldve injured Drew Brees to keep him from breaking the passing record against them. But then he became the biggest critic of ""Bountygate"".

The whole thing was a giant media shit storm created by Goodell, because the league needed a scapegoat to look like they were ""tough on player safety"" ahead of the retired players concussion lawsuit. And it apparently worked, because the league got off BIG TIME with the relatively small settlement the judge awarded.

Basically, Gregg Williams is an over-exaggerating asshole who uses harsh language to fire up his team. But to this day there is no solid evidence of any payments for actual injuries. The details of the pay for performance plan even specifically pointed out that players didnt get paid a bonus for any illegal hits. And from 2009-2011, the Saints were near the bottom of the league in personal fouls and opposing team injuries.

Now, pay for performance was certainly illegal in terms of violating the salary cap. But the media firestorm and outrage wasnt over the salary cap violations - it was over the injuries. Which were never proven. We had several players suspended for a year, Coach Payton suspended for the year, our GM Mickey Loomis suspended for 8 games, and ou assistant coach Joe Vitt suspended for 4 games. We also lost two 2nd Round draft picks, and were fined $500k.

Paul Tagliabue was later brought in and voided the player suspensions. Goodell also said that if the Saints cooperated, and helped the league start several safety initiatives in high schools, we would get our 2013 2nd Round pick back. Benson never spoke out against Goodell, and was entirely cooperative with anything he wanted. We never got our 2nd Round pick back.

Many people will claim there is proof of a $10k bounty on Favre from Vilma, or that it wasnt from Vilma, but actually from Mike Orenstein (who was in jail at the time and couldnt have actually sent anyone anything). There's never been any proof of these things - these all come from just one source, Mike Cerullo, who had actually been fired from the Saints for several reasons and had to be escorted from the facility by the police. Seeing as how he's the *only* ""witness"" Goodell ever had, it's pretty easy to call into question his reputation.

Tidbits (paraphrased, but to help people get the gist)


On potential relocation to LA:  
Relocation policy is very clear. There will be at least one, if not multiple votes, among owners before a franchise was able to move. No determinations have been made about any team going to Los Angeles, but several alternatives have been suggested and several teams are interested but trying to resolve their own local issues first.

On lack of games in Mexico since 2005:    
We want to get back there, but it's a factor of stadium capabilities and standards. We are looking at other markets (than London), including Mexico

On potential of conflict of interest, with NFL paying independent investigators and how this affects league credibility:  
I don't agree with that, we hire people who have uncompromising credibility and their integrity is impeccable.

A number of players have been vocal about criticising you. How is your relationship with players and how will you improve it?  
There are close to 3000 players in the NFL, I communicate with most of them privately on a regular basis. We talk to former players and the NFLPA for their perspectives. We won't always agree but I have respect for the players both on and off the field. Their wellbeing and future are important to me.

When Sean Payton was suspended for Bountygate, you said ignorance is no excuse. Will the same standards apply to the Patriots?   
These are individual cases. The Bounty case was unacceptable, and I hold the head coach responsible in that case. We don't know who is responsible in this case, and when we do we will take action against that person.

Will you make yourself available to media every week like with players?  
I'm available to media almost every day as part of my job.

"30K100M","raiders","Raiders","1. I'm using [this](http://i.imgur.com/nwNdcwa.jpg) as a reference. On play #1, the Texans had Crick at 5 tech, Powe at 1 tech, Watt at 5 tech, and Reed at 9 Tech. On play #2, they had Watt at 7 tech, Pagan at 3 tech, Powe at 1 tech and Reed at 9 tech. Although the Texans are rushing the passer on both plays, it's a more obvious pass rush alignment on play #2 due to the amount of bodies on the back side compared to play #1 which is more balanced because of down/distance and the amount of time left (Play #1 is 1st and 10 with 8 minutes left while play #2 is 2nd &amp; 11 with 36 seconds left).

2. Firstly, having 3 hands on a defender (who only have at most 2 hands) will generate more power on your blocks because you're using the strength of more than 1 person, no matter how weak the help is. Secondly, having 3 hands on an opponent allows you to block the defender from a wider variety of angles which would otherwise only be possible by holding if you only have 2 hands on him. This allows the blocker being helped to maintain leverage, disrupt the defensive line, make it harder to penetrate, etc. Thirdly, having only 3 hands on the defender compared to, let's say 4 hands, allows the uncovered O lineman to keep his eyes up and look for unblocked pass rushers or when the O lineman from the other side is losing leverage towards his side. All these factors enhances the OL help that you already discussed at the beginning of your post.

3. The nose tackle tried to gobble up double teams towards the right side A gap between the C and the RG so that they'll have 1 on 1 matchup on the blind side defensive tackle and defensive end. Obviously it didn't work out (due to the action in the 3 hands screenshot) and the blind side defensive tackle got double teamed instead, which took away any interior pressure. This is one of the examples why people value good defensive tackles/nose tackles so much. Otherwise both OTs worked really well on their islands against edge rushers. If the Texans blitz Brian Cushing on this exact same play, DeMarco Murray would've chipped him and get open which will give Romo a quick checkdown and at the same time slowing the blitz. With the open field ahead of him and Dez Bryant 1 on 1 with his defender (Dez is a good blocker), I would say that they might be able to get that first down also.

4. I think they are responding to the defensive alignments that they're up against. The Texans have a more balanced defensive front on play #1 while they are loaded on the blind side on play #2. The Cowboys slide their protection accordingly and so far they made the right calls and allowing Romo enough time to throw.

5. The first key 1-on-1 is Tyron Smith vs JJ Watt and the second is Doug Free vs Brooks Reed. In the case of Tyron Smith vs JJ Watt, Tyron Smith was able to engage JJ Watt early and didn't allow him to gain any depth to the backfield untouched which really slowed down the edge rush. On the other side, Brooks Reed is able to get a lot of depth untouched due to his 9 tech alignment, but Doug Free won through pure lateral agility and was able to stay squared up with Reed throughout the play.",1429021205,"","1429061284",1,7,"nfl"

By rule, there are 11 players on the field at any given time.  6 of these 11 are ""eligible receivers"" - i.e., it's not a penalty if they catch a (non-deflected) pass.  (Before people tell you that I'm wrong, because there are only 5 eligible receivers, they're forgetting to count the quarterback, since quarterbacks virtually never catch forward passes, despite being eligible to do so.)

The 5 players who are not ""eligible receivers"" are, intuitively, ""ineligible receivers.""  If they catch a pass, it's a penalty on the offense.  These 5 players must be on (interpreted as within 1 yard of) the line of scrimmage.  Typically, these are your offensive linemen (left tackle, left guard, center, right guard, and right tackle).

By rule, there must be a total of 7 players on the line of scrimmage.  The two players on the line of scrimmage closest to the sidelines are, by rule, eligible receivers.  The other 4 eligible receivers must be at least one yard behind the line of scrimmage.

So a typical, traditional formation might have the 5 ineligible linemen on the line of scrimmage, with a tight end ""covering"" the left tackle, one wide receiver on the line of scrimmage close to the right sideline, a wide receiver just behind the line of scrimmage near the left sideline, the quarterback directly behind the center, with two running backs behind him.

There are strict rules in the NFL about player numbers.  Specifically, players must wear numbers in a range allotted by the NFL to their normal position (for example, wide receivers must wear a number between either 10-19, or 80-89).  Players whose normal position is a RB, QB, WR, or TE (...or, technically, kickers and punters, but special teams formations are beyond the scope of your question) are automatically considered to be eligible receivers *unless they specifically tell the referee otherwise before the play begins*.  Likewise, players who play a position where they would typically be considered an ineligible receiver must report to the referee if they're going to be lined up in the position (and role) of an eligible receiver.

The referee generally announces this over the stadium PA system, and at minimum must inform a defensive captain about this, so they know who to cover, and who they can ignore.

Aside from punt or field goal formations, it's pretty rare for players to switch roles (not many offensive linemen are going to line up as a wide receiver, or vice versa).  The Patriots, however, *have* been doing this a lot recently.  Other teams don't see it much, so they're often confused.

And that's the point.  The Patriots, while doing everything perfectly inside the rules, are trying to catch the other team off guard, and get a big play out of it.

The Patriots had a play last night where they had their big left tackle declare himself eligible, and didn't have any other receivers line up on the line of scrimmage between him and the sideline.  But what was tricky about it was that it *looked* like a normal formation.  But it wasn't, because there was nobody wearing a traditional ""eligible receiver"" type number lined up on the line of scrimmage between him and the sideline. When Brady threw the ball to a 350-lb lineman, the Colts were surprised, since it's not something you see much.  But it was perfectly legal, and the referee *specifically told the defense that it was a possibility*.

tl;dr - the Patriots are doing things *unconventionally*, not *unfairly*.

Woody said that if he had know he could have gotten Revis for the contract he was currently on with Patriots he would have done it in a heartbeat. 

The point of the anti-tamper policy is such that players can't leverage another teams valuation of them over their current team at the bargaining table. 

What Woody did was say that he believed Revis was undervalued at his current deal, and that he would love to have him back. If we can follow 1 + 1 = 2 then we can easily see that implies when the Patriots cut him before the 20m salary kicks in, Woody is going to offer him a bucket load of money. As a result, Revis feels obligated to hit the open market and see how many islands Woody is going to buy for him. It's his leverage at the table. 

Kraft on the other hand publicly stated that he didn't value a Revis as highly. A player under contract for the next 5 years, as opposed to for all intensive purposes free agent. Revis just got paid. There is no leverage needed.
