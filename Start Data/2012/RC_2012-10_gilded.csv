True,[deleted],,,"My vet office sent my family a card when our pet died, it had this poem printed on it. 

Just this side of heaven is a place called Rainbow Bridge.

When an animal dies that has been especially close to someone here, that pet goes to Rainbow Bridge.
There are meadows and hills for all of our special friends so they can run and play together.
There is plenty of food, water and sunshine, and our friends are warm and comfortable.

All the animals who had been ill and old are restored to health and vigor; those who were hurt or maimed are made whole and strong again, just as we remember them in our dreams of days and times gone by.
The animals are happy and content, except for one small thing; they each miss someone very special to them, who had to be left behind.

They all run and play together, but the day comes when one suddenly stops and looks into the distance. His bright eyes are intent; His eager body quivers. Suddenly he begins to run from the group, flying over the green grass, his legs carrying him faster and faster.

You have been spotted, and when you and your special friend finally meet, you cling together in joyous reunion, never to be parted again. The happy kisses rain upon your face; your hands again caress the beloved head, and you look once more into the trusting eyes of your pet, so long gone from your life but never absent from your heart.

Then you cross Rainbow Bridge together....

I have this recurring dream where I'm having dinner with my friends in an huge, ancient cathedral but it's totally empty except for us. We're dressed in our best clothes and there's a lavish feast on the table before us. The sound of our voices echoes with every word. We can see the dust hanging in the air, swirling in the rays of early sunlight penetrating through the windows.

We're having a great time, cracking jokes and reminiscing about our youth. Everyone's stepping on each other's sentences, eager to share a pleasant memory. I hear boisterous laughter, clinks of wineglasses. Surrounded by people I love, I feel warmth and togetherness. The table is small, but there's just enough room for each of us, cramped together with our elbows nearly touching. But we're old friends; we grew up together. We're so close there's almost no space between us. We're so close we're breathing the same air, from one pair of lungs into the next, full of that thick dust hanging there that gives me an unusual feeling I can't name, like somehow we've been sitting at that table for years.

I sit back and admire the scene, my belly full, heart content, face aching from smiling all night, when the conversation turns to one of the boys that's sitting there with us. My friends start describing him: ""A fine, outstanding young man,"" they say, ""with a good head on his shoulders."" They start saying things like, ""I can't believe it's been three years."" and ""I miss him so much!"" Something strange is going on. They're talking about him like he isn't sitting there at the other end of the table, laughing and drinking with us. 

Confused, I turn to look where he's sitting, and the chair is empty. There is only silence. In my dream I'm utterly baffled. Wasn't he *just* sitting right there? I'm frightened and I look around the table, but my friends are continuing their conversation as if everything's normal. 

And then I remember what really happened. He committed suicide three years ago. Some days I forget that he died, and I hallucinate that he's sitting among us, listening to our conversations. But when I remember that he's dead, his image abruptly disappears and I realize he was never actually there. But it seems so real. These days I can never be sure what's real or what's a dream. A moment ago he was sitting right there, I saw him. Didn't you see him too? Guys, I know I'm not crazy.

True,voice_of_experience,verdi,,"Ima gonna start with Bach, the rebel. The badass. The original mind-blowingly genius composer IMO.

Even before the famous Bach was born, his family was already famous for being musicians, so much so that the word ""bach"" was local slang for ""musician"" in his area. But the famous Bach himself was a bit underwhelming as a young man. He was a mediocre keyboardist and violinist, and only made it into music school because he was a good choir singer. The school (Lüneberg) was in a town with a famously awesome organ, and he got a fair amount of exposure there to what REAL organs and organists were like. Around this time he figured out that he wasn't much of a singer, and he'd rather play the organ anyway, so when he graduated he applied for jobs as an organist. He was only accepted at one place, the relatively lame chapel of a Duke. 

Actually, the job sucked. He was the equivalent of a modern-day intern, getting people drinks, doing a lot of cleaning, and basically getting pissed off that they didn't ask him to do much music. But in his spare time, he played... and played... and played. He actually built up a big enough reputation that another town invited him to inspect and inaugurate their new, state-of-the-art, well-tempered (ie modern tuning) organ... and eventually just offered him the kapellmeister (basically ""boss of everything musical, especially the choir and organ"") position.

Bach HATED his job at St. Boniface's. They paid him well and didn't ask for much, but he bitched about the job in letters to his family and friends. He thought the singers sucked and the audience wouldn't know a great organist if one kicked them in the teeth. He was shitty to his employer, and every once in awhile he would just stop showing up to work for a little while to go and study with someone who HE considered a great organist. As he wrote in a letter to his family, ""they see me rollin', they hatin'.""

One of the most famous incidences of playing hooky from work, was when Bach wrote to the most famous organist of the day, Dietrich Buxtehude (who only early-music people have ever heard of but who wrote some awesome stuff), to ask if he could take lessons. Buxtehude was actually very famous at the time... on the scale of ballsiness, he may as well have been writing to Justin Bieber. Buxtehude had better things to do than read his fan mail, so he didn't reply. So Bach just ditched work for a few months, and decided to show up on Buxtehude's doorstep. He didn't have a lot of money, and Buxtehude lived literally at the opposite end of the country, but that doesn't stop someone like JS Bach. He *walked* 250 miles to Buxtehude's city, and showed up at the practice studio asking for lessons. Buxtehude slammed the door on him. Bach came back the next day, and the next, and by the end of the week Bach had convinced the celebrity to let him just sit in the corner and WATCH him practice. 

Ultimately they became great friends, and when Buxtehude was looking to retire he even offered to name Bach as his successor. There was a pretty big catch though - the position came with the hand of his boring, ugly daughter, who he hadn't been able to marry off any other way. Bach said ""bitch, please!"" and peaced out.

Of course, by then Bach was a badass at the keyboard, too. So he had no trouble finding work, and pretty quickly made it back to that same Duke's court as their official composer and concertmaster. He spent the rest of his days composing, performing, teaching, and fucking - he had ~20 children IIRC, several of whom became famous composers in their own right because of their daddy's teaching.

But he wasn't particularly famous as a composer... more as a musician and teacher. After his death, people stopped caring about his compositions at all. It wasn't until about Mozart's time that people took a second look and realized that this guy composed significant music. In fact Mozart considered Bach as the ""father of harmony."" 

Still, in retrospect we can look at Bach's music and see what was amazing. In order to really get it, you have to learn a leetle bit of counterpoint (the rules of composition; music theory at the time). Counterpoint actually had legal force in some places. It came from the Church's doctrine about what made a melody or pair of melodies ""acceptable"". Note that I didn't use the word ""harmony"" - it's because they didn't think of music VERTICALLY the way we do now. Polyphonic music was considered HORIZONTALLY... like a set of melodies and complimentary melodies that play at the same time, rather than a set of chords. 

In order to understand what makes him incredible, I'm going to show you a little bit of basic counterpoint. I want you to put yourself in the horizontal, counterpoint frame of mind. Pull out a sheet of score paper, or use the [noteflight demo](http://www.noteflight.com/demo), and try writing a 12 note melody - anything at all - that follows these rules:

* each note and it's neighbor form an interval. The only allowed intervals are major 2nd, minor 3rd, major 3rd, perfect 4th, perfect 5th, or octave. for example, if you're on a C, you're allowed to move to D, Eb, E, F, G, or a C one octave up.
* you may not have two consecutive intervals which add up to a tritone (C -&gt; F#) or a 7th (C -&gt; B/Bb).
* you can use a minor 6th MAYBE, if you then leave the note by going down one step.
* If there's a leap between two notes, the next note should be stepwise in the opposite direction.
* never write more than two leaps in the same direction. If you HAVE TO, the second leap should be smaller than the first leap. And the interval between the bottom of the first leap and the top of the second leap has to be in the ""allowed list"" above.
* The final note must be approached by step. 

The first thing people discover when writing counterpoint is: it's really hard to be original. It's also really hard to write something catchy, or interesting, or fun, or emotional. Once you get the hang of the rules, it's very easy to be boring, though. Now try writing two melodies together, and include these rules for the relationship between the two (the ""counterpoint""):

* The interval between the first two notes must be in the ""allowed list""
* the interval between the last two notes must be in the ""allowed list""
* whenever possible, the voices should be moving in opposite directions.
* if the interval between the two melodies is going to form a perfect 4th or perfect 5th, it cannot approach it with both voices moving in the same direction.
* The interval between the two voices should never be more than a 10th

This starts to get hard. There were particular cases where you could bend or relax the rules a little, but fundamentally this rule bound method was the approach to composition. And Buxtehude was doing it in 4 or 5 voices at once (which is why Bach was so interested in his work). If you're a masochist or a music student (or both!) try writing a piece in 5 voices with these rules. Just go for 4 measures of quarter tones, that will give you a taste.

Now that you have an idea of how frustrating and restricting that is,

Bach *IMPROVISED* pieces like this.

BAM. Mind blown. Some pieces were certainly written down in advance, but his chorale preludes in particular, and lots of his performances in general, involved extensive improvisation, often in 4 or more voices, in perfect counterpoint.

True,Khiva,,,"I wrote this a while ago when I was stuck in an airport with little else to do:

You are a young, white male in your early twenties. You did well enough in school, although you didn't particularly excel - a fact you ascribe more to an overall lack of effort on your part rather than any inherent deficiency. If you'd tried harder you could have done it, but you either didn't want to or things just kept distracting you.

You've had friends, but you would pause and struggle were you asked to name friends you've been seriously close to (you were, for example, not considered popular in high school). This leads to a certain sense of loneliness and isolation that you have channeled into hobbies (gaming, perhaps, or programming or certain fantasy universes) and pseudo-social activities such as internet forums. Part of the reason you love reddit like you do is because so many other people are of similar backgrounds, and because electronic conversation removes so much of the awkwardness of face-to-face communication, something you have never really felt entirely comfortable with.

Two facts about you that determine much of who you are - you do not believe that the world has ever given you enough credit for being smart, and (related to the first) you have an intense dislike for authority. This leads to a number of salient personality characteristics.

You seethe with contempt. It is one of the defining features of your life. Every time you walk out the door or pick up a newspaper you are confronted with a level of idiocy you cannot stand. One of the greatest secrets of your life is the fact that you conceal the intense amount of disrespect you have for nearly every person you meet in your everyday life. ""Surrounded by idiots"" appears to be the cross you have been forced to bear in this world.

Another thing which defines your life is the intensity of your beliefs and passions. While a quick glance at your living space and/or your accomplishments in life might belie this fact, on certain topics you become intensely strident. You insist on purity and have very, almost impossibly high moral standards. Note that this exists on an almost entirely abstract plane - no one would suggest that in your personal life you are a paragon of virtue, a phenomena which is fascinatingly similar to the behavior of many young, intensely devout Muslim males. Such views might regard politics (ultra-liberal or libertarian), religion (not just atheistic but anti-religious), gaming, intellectual property, grammar, etc. What unites these interests is, again, intensity and highly vaulted moral standards. Moderation or pragmatism as concepts fall somewhere between uninteresting and distasteful.
Because much of your life you have struggled with feelings of isolation and alienation, you crave intimacy. This has led you to pursue relationships with a certain eagerness which women have found off-putting. For this and other reasons, you find women frustrating to deal with and harbor a certain amount of resentment and suspicion towards them.

Now, having sized you up, and I shall proceed to point out areas in which your conception of yourself is incomplete.
You consider yourself an intellectual, but you don't actually read. You have an intense attachment to some books you read in high school, but outside of that you haven't really done much exploring in the intellectual domain. The problem is that you are constantly comparing yourself to others in your immediate vicinity - if they haven't read it, then you are comfortable in your sense of superiority (which is central to your self conception). You might have read Guns, Germs and Steel, A Brief History of Everything, or Malcom Gladwell but not a whole lot more. You could have made it through the entirety of Dostoevsky's ouvre in a fraction of the time you have spent on the internet. You most certainly have not sought out books which might challenge or discomfort your world view.

You feel an intense need to differentiate from American culture in general. Liking something which is liked by the masses would discomfort the precarious sense of hierarchy which you treasure. You treat music the same way hipsters do, but you can't admit to this fact because you don't want to admit that your tastes in music are determined by anything other than reason (centrality of intelligence again). The notion that you pursue individualism in a way which is subject to trends, in precisely the same manner as others also trying to be different, is an irony which causes minor cognitive dissonance but doesn't trouble you deeply. It's all about trying to be different from those immediately around you - so long as you are, then the goal is achieved.
Another irony in your pursuit of individualism is that it leads you to intensely (again, intensity is key) reject American culture period, when the pursuit of such individualism is itself the very core of American culture. One is never being more American than when he, in the attempt at difference, rejects America altogether in an attempt to stake out an individual identity (compare this to, say, France where achieving Frenchness involves the passionate embrace of all things French). The foreign visitors to this site (and I could write paragraphs about you guys too) evidently feel a certain delight at the spectacle of self-disgust and exult in the attention, but what they do not realize is that this is a game being played by Americans primarily for the benefit of other Americans, and they are only players in it, decorations in the dance of difference.

Alienation, contempt, intensity, purity, and differentiation. These are the themes which guide your life.

The most important, thing, though, is that you have read all this and said to yourself ""Ha! That really applies to everyone else on here.""

I was approached by one of the charity organizers to see if I could wear a seagull outfit to entertain people. 

So I bounded around looking a fat seagull when I see when of my friends dressed of as a pirate (no idea why, silly billy). I jumped on his back and said: Aaarrrrrrr, ye be needin' a bird for yer shoulder cap'n, let's commaner a vessel.

I looked behind him and saw this girl. A bit short, black hair cut short, piercings all event the place, a year or two younger than me. I thought: Hmmmm, she looks interesting. 

So after avoiding suffocation of the seagull and swarms of aggressive small children I staggered over to where they were sitting.

I looked at their again and felt my world cave out. You know that moment when you look and someone, you get sucked into their amazing eyes and feel something go *click* ? That's what that was. 

I had never seen her before, and within five minutes we refused to leave each others side. I felt a huge surge of panic when I lost her in the crowd which made me think: I need to find this girl. 

I tracked her down, bought her coffee, lots of coffee (both extreme caffine addicts). I spent the night curled up next to her, unable to sleep, memorizing the feeling of... Acceptance? Methinks is a good word for it yes.

I found out that she was only there because the friend whose back I had jumped on and dragged her out into the outside world, she was adamant that she was going to stay indoors. 

Within twenty minutes we clicked. In an hour totally trusted each other. In two hours I knew her life story and she knew mine. Twelve hours later I was curled up listening to deathcore metal and chatting about random bullshit.

We've been going out for seven months now, been through hell and back, and back again because I left my keys on Satan's kitchen bench.

True,Freeeeeman,,,"Alright OP. I'll try and help you for some reason.

Trust issues is code for a fear of emotional intimacy, which can manifest in a variety of ways. For example, whenever I felt like someone had me figured out, that they knew why I said what I said and how I felt about any particular situation, I'd get paranoid that they were trying to control me. Manipulate. Fool. I'd start acting very bizarrely, try to mix things up to remain aloof. I'd do this without really realizing what I was doing, much less that I was doing it out of fear of being close to someone and trusting that they loved me, which in turn was because I didn't particularly admire myself. This is fundamentally your problem, and it's going to keep being your problem until you are determined to change it.

&gt;Knowing that I'm possibly feeling attraction and not love kind of makes me happy that I've yet to experience ""love"". I feel a bit sad that what I've felt before was just superficial. And I'm scared to think that all the paranoia of if she liked someone else, if I'm delusional to think that she likes me, or if reply to my text is taking seemingly forever because I said something wrong, is just the tip of the iceberg of paranoia that I'd feel with real ""love"".

Trust me, it's not even anywhere near close to love. I'm actually surprised you haven't figured this out yet. I'm very familiar with the paranoia you describe, but it's really absolutely nothing like that when you love someone. Love is about trust, about familiarity, reliability; any relationship where paranoia is a key element isn't a good relationship. Love is something that takes time and work, that can *only* take time and work. 

You're infatuated, because you see women as objects. Yes. As mere figurants for your own emotional fulfillment. Keep up the guise of ""I don't want to be in a relationship"" if you want, but all the self-deprecatory pity bullshit is fundamentally all about you, it doesn't have anything with concern about her feelings. You chase after whatever random girl catches your interest out of low self-esteem, fuck yourself over because of intimacy issues, and claim chivalry and respect for her emotional wellbeing to justify your shitty behavior. If you actually had respect for other people's feelings, you wouldn't flirt and chase after girls so quickly. You wouldn't 'fall in love' with them purely on looks. You'd take time to get to know them well by being their friend (protip: despite the much-cursed friendzone, you really don't want to be in a relationship with a girl you're not friends with) and only after getting real with them would you try to make it into a relationship. Until you come to terms with your actions and how they're A. insane and B. disrespectful of other people, you're just going to feel worse and worse.

My advice? Stop thinking about relationships for a while, just try to be friends with girls using the same criteria you use when making friends with other boys (this is far more difficult than it seems). Don't even think about a girl's viability relationship-wise when you meet her, whether she's attractive enough or whatever. If something's there it'll happen naturally.

True,Jive_Turkey_Mofo,,,"It's not about just 'pounding her for an hour', it's giving her the most erotic, pleasurable night of her life!  Most of my scenes last between 45 and 90 minutes, but I am *not* in great shape; when I get tired, I pull her on top, if I'm getting to into it and ready to pop, I switch positions or slow down.  I get really into it.  I will start off slow, maybe cuff her hands to the top of the bed ""this is for your protection"", then tell her, ""this is going to feel really good""... basically giving her permission to just relax and enjoy the moment.  I'll kiss every inch of her softly, turning her skin electric, and instead of going *straight* for her nipples or pussy, I'll tease around... *way* too long - until she is squirming and thrusting up to me.  Even then, I'll lick extremely slow.  I know what she wants, *she* knows what she wants, but I make her suffer my pleasures.  Between her legs, just BARELY kissing her lips, I will lick as slowly as possible... just a few more strokes and she will cum... then I stop... and look at it... make some comment about how delicious or pretty it is... then lick some more.  Keep her kind of close to orgasm, but only close enough to frustrate her.  When she starts struggling, I will get a little more intense, maybe add some fingers, but still not let her cum.  When she gets close, I stop and pull up to her face, grab her hair and and growl ""Don't even *think* of fucking cumming without my permission""...and that is when shit gets good.  While most guys are just *trying* to get her to cum, I won't let her.  And her needing to ask permission makes it even more exciting.  So I'm back licking, fingering, more intensely and she asks ""can I cum"".  I stop for a second ""Not yet"" and continue to lick.  Less than a minute later she'll ask again, ""No"" a little more stern this time.  I'll do this 3 to 5 times depending on how much she can take, the last time I will say ""NO"" but I won't stop... I keep going.  She will now be begging ""Please let me cum!"" I continue, harder, ""NO"" as I push deeper.  Again, she has spent every minute of her sexual experience with guys who just wanted to get her to cum... now she is with a guy that won't *let* her... but she can't resist for long.  She will cum, and when she does I push harder and faster (this is usually how you get a woman to squirt their first time) ""Oh you dirty girl, I told you not to cum"" my words only a faint echo in her ears as she cums harder than she ever has before...
Normally after an orgasm like that, she'll need some recovery time, but I don't give it.  You HAVE to stop a bit because her clit is just WAY too sensative and kind of hurts, but I'll push my warm hand onto it and cover it, or use my mouth (just for pressure) until I hear a moan... then I pull my face to hers, maybe put my hands around her throat (never actually squeezing) and say ""I told you not to cum, now you are going to get it"" as I enter her in a long, smooth thrust.
That's just the warm-up... if she has some experience you can deny her orgasms for up to about 15 minutes, but after that, you have to tear her up.  She'll cum a few more times pretty quickly, but after I get tired, I switch it up; tie her up, tell her to get into a new position, or discipline her for cumming without permission... but again, this is where 'normal' vanilla sex would have ended with the male orgasming, put off your own pleassure until she is COMPLETELY satisfied.  
The KEY is confidence (and give her a safeword to stop things).  The goal is not *your* orgasm, it's to give her everything she can take, to *worship her as a Goddess by fucking her like you paid for it*.  Pay attention to her body, it will tell you what to do.

&gt; talent with *real-life application*

Despite the oxymoron, /r/learnuselesstalents does have a lot of interesting things you can learn. 

**To the OP**: 

Congratulations, you just asked the **ultimate** /r/IWantToLearn question: 

*""I want to learn something new. But what?""*

I'll open frankly: the universe is [bigger than you can even imagine](http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/science/xdf.html) and there are an infinite number of different answers to your question. In the post to follow, I'll try to provide some answers. I will list out some of the more obvious things that you can do with little equipment, not that much money, and nobody else to do things with. But first, I want you to recognize this: this is, *at most*, an incomplete list. You will have different opportunities based on the environment you put yourself in. No matter what, your mileage will always vary. Regardless, there will *always* be new things to learn or do, you just have to get up and seek it. Let's begin, shall we?

First and foremost, you could learn to **play an instrument**. Knowing how to play at least one instrument can be one of the most rewarding hobbies a person can do. Not only will it teach you about music and music theory, but playing an instrument can be relaxing, fun, and intellectually stimulating. A secret: used instruments and garage sale equipment can be extremely inexpensive. Check your local [listings](http://www.craigslist.org/about/sites). Another secret: a lot of people have unused instruments sitting in their attics or closets and are willing to lend them to prospective musicians. All you have to do is ask nicely.

Ideally, you would want a music instructor who will guide you through the basics and outline what you should practice. Unfortunately, instruction can be expensive and in some places, unavailable. Thankfully, there's plenty of resources online to self-teach yourself. On reddit, check out [these posts](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/piano#GettingStartedasaBeginner) from /r/piano, [the FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/guitarlessons/comments/zxhrw/a_totally_bodacious_beginners_guide_to_playing/) from /r/guitarlessons, the sidebars and top posts on /r/clarinet, /r/saxophonics, /r/trumpet, and /r/drums. Not only that, but there are numerous of Youtube videos and online tutorials out there for learning how to play instruments. I highly recommend that everybody at least tries to learn an instrument at least once. Or learn many, like [this guy.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT9C_NmImjM) The music you learn to play and the experiences gained from musicality will stay with you for the rest of your life.

Let's switch to a less common hobby. You could pick up **lockpicking**. As strange as it may seem, lockpicking has plenty of legal real-life applications as well and is a fun, calming hobby that plenty of people enjoy. There are very few feelings better than opening up a multi-tumbler lock. Just be sure to read your local laws on what you can and can not do.

Another great part about lockpicking: you can [self-make your own equipment](http://www.instructables.com/id/Make-lockpicks-from-what-you-can-find-in-a-garage/) or [buy it online for very little money](http://www.lockpickshop.com/PXS-14.html). On reddit, there's a fantastic lockpicking community on /r/lockpicking and here's [their beginner's guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/lockpicking/comments/bzq80/where_do_you_start_start_here/). There's also plenty of tutorials and videos online. [For example, here's a fantastic online video series by the controversial competitive lock-picker Schuyler Towne on learning how to lockpick.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVSL0liiWoc) If you want to cut directly to the lockpicking and skip all the videos about locks and pick making, [start here.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmhQ1la6Lgw&amp;feature=channel&amp;list=UL)

If you have access to a computer, you can learn **programming**. It's a large, fun skill that has an incredible number of uses. [This guy](http://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/11pbj1/dude_you_guys_i_apparently_nailed_my_very_first/) in /r/webdev turned his career completely around in 18 months and landed himself a web development job. There's plenty of resources online for learning programming. [Here's the starting FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/faq#HowdoIgetstartedwithprogramming) from /r/learnprogramming that a lot of redditors are referred to when they ask about learning to code.

The FAQ can be kind of dry and demotivating, so [try an interactive tutorial.](http://www.codecademy.com/#!/exercises/0) They're more exciting and helps you ease into the flow of things better. I gave you a link to a Javascript interactive tutorial. Don't be afraid to consider different programming languages and don't feel belittled. Learning a programming language is like learning a new spoken language, you have to start from the very basics, despite how simple they may seem. Self-plug: [here's a guide to learning how to go from knowing nothing about Java to making your own 3D renderer in Java I wrote a few months ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/nqiwo/anyone_knows_of_an_up_to_date_book_on_game/c3b8w0l?context=3)

You can also learn **graphic design**. With free tools like [Paint.Net](http://www.getpaint.net/) and [GIMP](http://www.gimp.org/), you can learn how to make visual products that look nice. You can teach yourself to make a well-designed logo, to choose a typeface accurate for any given situation, or design a handout for a public event. You can apply concepts like color theory and negative space to almost anything. There's a million practical uses for design, but it's also *very, very difficult to master*. Like with drawing, skill and mastery comes with years of practice.

Thankfully, you don't have to do it by yourself. Like any other digital skill, there's an incredible amount of resources online. [Check out this guide from PSDTuts](http://psd.tutsplus.com/articles/inspiration/teach-yourself-graphic-design-a-self-study-course-outline/) and read online resources like /r/design, /r/graphic_design, and /r/Design_Critiques. There's also plenty of other websites out there that will offer free resources and tutorials. Look to them for inspiration. Don't be afraid to mimic other people's style as well, it's how a lot of beginning designers learn. Just don't directly copy them. Once you understand the basics of whatever tool you're using, the best way to get better is to simply practice. Challenge yourself with new tasks every day and set the bar higher and higher each time.

Similarly, you can pick up **sketching and drawing**. Frankly, learning to draw primarily comes from practice. Spend ten to twenty minutes every day sketching something new. Or better yet, try /r/sketchdaily. Similarly, don't feel demotivated if you start off as a not-very-good artist. I assure you, with practice, you will definitely get better.

Want proof? [Check out this conceptart.org thread.](http://conceptart.org/forums/showthread.php?870-Journey-of-an-Absolute-Rookie-Paintings-and-Sketches) Check the date. Over the next sixty pages and seven years of drawing, you'll find the OP working a little bit every day and developing from a beginning hobby artist to an art teacher. Want to see some of his last posted works? Check [here](http://conceptart.org/forums/showthread.php?870-Journey-of-an-Absolute-Rookie-Paintings-and-Sketches&amp;p=2152389#post2152389) and [here.](http://conceptart.org/forums/showthread.php?870-Journey-of-an-Absolute-Rookie-Paintings-and-Sketches&amp;p=2949247#post2949247) That's what passion and practice gives you.

Let's say that drawing is too easy for you and you want to pick up something slightly more challenging. Try **3D modelling.** It may seem daunting at first, but through the development of habits, 3D modelling can be not that difficult. Here's how: download [Blender](http://www.blender.org/) and follow [this online book](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro) step-by-step. It's the best book I've found that goes into extreme detail on learning how to pick up 3D modelling. It has an amazing pace and is incredibly easy and fun to learn. There's obviously a million uses for 3D modelling, from making model architecture to product design to designing 3D assets for a game or film.

You could also **improve your penmanship**. Every day, spend a little bit of time and develop a unique style of handwriting. Write out the alphabet a few times and add nuances to your lettering to make them stand out. [Here's a nice starter on practicing your abilities with a pen or pencil.](http://www.paperpenalia.com/handwriting.html) Like with sketching and graphic design, don't be afraid to look at or copy parts of other people's styles. Seeing [good handwriting](http://www.reddit.com/r/PenmanshipPorn/) and [other people's handwriting](http://www.reddit.com/r/handwriting) can be a great place to find inspiration and motivation.

It's not a talent per se, but you could do the awesome thing and **read**. No library? [Look at this, it's more books you can read in a lifetime all put in a single place **for free**.](http://www.gutenberg.org/) Try to at least spend a little bit of time reading every day and better yet, immerse yourself in the books you read. If you don't know what to read, look up the exact same question on subreddits like /r/books and /r/printsf or visit /r/booksuggestions. Be sure to go back and read classics that you were forced to read in school at your own pace. You'll might find the experience enlightening. Reading will help improve your openness to other ideas and are fantastic references and conversation makers. Reading will generate creativity, expand your knowledge and vocabulary, and improve your ability to write. Most importantly, *it's fun.*

Like reading, you could **practice writing**. Write more and with purpose. *Expand your vocabulary* by writing with a new, difficult word every single day and reusing it later on. Learn to convey ideas with short sentences but with beautiful prose. Learn to tell a story and learn to objectively state the facts. Check out /r/writing and try writing short little stories every day or every week and submitting them to /r/nosleep (for horror) or /r/shortstories. Maintain an unread blog. Keep a journal in your pocket all day. Write stupidly long posts on reddit. Write more! Try out /r/shutupandwrite if you're having trouble staying motivated.

I also highly recommend **working out and getting fit**. Not only is it physically beneficial in terms of losing (or gaining muscle) weight, but it's also emotionally and mentally rewarding as you feel better from it. You'll feel better, healthier, and more confident from it. Here's a fantastic [start-up guide](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/Fitness#GettingStarted) from /r/fitness. There's not much to say about this one. *You should be doing this already!* If you're not, do whatever it takes to motivate yourself to get physically active. For example, try listening to music while working out. It'll make the time pass much quicker and make you less self-conscious if you're in a public place. Most importantly, don't push this off.

If you want some music to listen to, you could try to **expand your music appreciation** to the harder-to-pick-up genres. A lot of people say they like jazz or classical and can only cite pieces like [Take Five](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmDDOFXSgAs) by David Brubeck or Beethoven's [Moonlight Sonata](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQVeaIHWWck) as examples. That's all great and fantastic, but there's a *MASSIVE* genre out there filled to the brim with fantastic music. Learning to love it will supply you with a near endless amount of music. All it takes is a little patience and a little know-how.

The patience comes from you. Here's some of the know-how: check out [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/IWantToLearn/comments/jhypp/iwtl_how_to_appreciate_classical_and_jazz_music/) post from this subreddit and check out [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Jazz/comments/eho2z/im_new_to_jazz_where_should_i_start/) from /r/jazz and check out [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/ehaft/) from /r/classicalmusic. Take some time and patience and learn to love the musical nuances that defined genres like classical and jazz. Soon enough you'll be humming out motifs from Coltrane's [Giant Steps](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kotK9FNEYU) or a [Mahler symphony](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH_v9niFoVc) like the rest of us.

If you have some music theory knowledge, you can also try **composing and making your own music.** As it turns out, once you have the music theory basics covered ([try this](http://www.musictheory.net/lessons) if you want to learn basic music theory and [use this](http://www.iwasdoingallright.com/tools/ear_training/main/) if you want to practice ear training to recognize pitches, keys, and chords), making ""reasonable"" electronic and pop music really isn't that difficult, but hard to perfect. It's also really fun and entertaining. /r/WeAreTheMusicMakers  has a [terrific guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/WeAreTheMusicMakers/comments/igns0/) for getting started at making your own music. This is a great starting point for the massive amount of resources like [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9thbaXOAGM) also available online on learning how to make your own music (See a theme here? Lots of resources online. Just gotta learn to seek them out.)

If you need a DAW (a digital audio workstation), [LMMS](http://lmms.sourceforge.net/) is free and not that hard to use. It shares similar functionality to the ever popular [Fruity Loops/FL Studio](http://www.image-line.com/documents/flstudio.html) DAW (which costs money, is professionally used, and is professionally laughed at) but lacking in some advanced features.

Let's keep up with the music theme. You can also **improve your singing.** You could get a vocal coach, or you could do the hard work and practice. The best thing you can do is both. But if you don't have the money, do the latter. [Start here](http://www.reddit.com/r/IWantToLearn/comments/ledpe/iwtl_to_sing_without_attending_classes/c2s1p9y) then practice. Practice! Belt it out to your favorite songs and don't care. Sing in the shower, sing in the car, sing whenever and wherever you can afford to have the people around you listening (so no singing during business meetings). When you're at home, sing while listening to a song and *record yourself* with a mic and a recording program like [Audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/). Play it back with the original song and see how you do. Sure, you'll think you sound terrible at the beginning, but like with all things, you get better over time.

Another thing: you're probably not going to enjoy listening to your own voice. *Don't.* You're just not used to hearing yourself in recording compared to the sound bouncing around through your head. First of all, it's your own voice. It's not going to change. Learn to love what you've got. Some people are short. Most of them learn to embrace it and take it in stride. With practice, you can make slight changes to your tone and voicings that will improve your ability to not only sing, but will improve your ability to talk with people and give speeches emotively. Plus, there will be that day when your friends force you to sing some karaoke against your will and you'll have your months and years of practice ready to go. Show them what's up.

Another small thing you can learn is learning how to **meditate**. I'll re-post [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/IWantToLearn/comments/107xzk/iwtl_meditation/c6b8xl6) because it covers the gist of it extensively. You might not see or feel instantaneous ephemeral benefits, but spending 10-20 minutes meditating every morning will dramatically improve your lifestyle.

You could do the obvious and **pick up sports**. Ask around in your local communities. There's almost definitely people out there who gather in local parks and facilities to play sports together at different levels. If you're not the interactive type, **learn to swim**. It's cheap, easy, fun, and doesn't require other people to enjoy. Learning to swim is one of the most important things you should do, even if you live in the middle of a desert. You simply don't know when you might be in a position where knowing how to swim could mean life or death. Plus, swimming is relaxing and not that hard on the muscles. 

Here are some other physical activities you could pick up without relying on other people or a vast array of equipment: **biking**, hiking, rock climbing, martial arts, skating, surfing, skiing, and gymnastics. Having a good instructor could be extremely helpful though and is almost always preferable than not. I'll put a little bit more emphasis on biking because it's an incredibly useful skill to know how to do well. Biking is a cheap, ecologically friendly way of getting to local places quickly. Apply liberally.

You already mentioned **learning a language.** I'll be frank and tell you I'm terrible at learning languages. I'll tell you what I've heard from other people. First of all, the number one most recommended method of learning another language is the following: surround yourself with people who will speak the desired language often. Better yet, travel to it. Within weeks, you'll know the basics. Within months, you'll be practically fluent. Dead serious. 

If you can't move yourself around, try [this website](http://www.memrise.com/welcome/). I've heard good things about it. You could also try classes. Generally, they have mixed results, but it forces you to practice in a friendly environment which is better than practicing by yourself with little to no motivation. Most languages have a subreddit dedicated toward them: /r/chineselanguage, /r/korean, /r/spanish, /r/french. Check out their sidebars or top posts to find some guides on learning each language.

Oh, and there's **dancing**. I haven't put much effort into learning how to dance... [but check this out.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IWantToLearn/search?q=dance&amp;sort=top&amp;restrict_sr=on)

There you have it, a not-so-short list on the things you can do in your free time. I might add a few things every now and then if it comes to memory. **You now have [no excuse](http://www.noexcuselist.com/) to be bored and let your ennui catch up to you.** You don't have to master every single thing. If you enjoy it, pursue it. If you don't, move on to the next thing. Life is too short to not do what you enjoy.

* Inside the Game is an SC2 talkshow hosted by SC2 caster djWHEAT.

* Last night djWHEAT [casted](http://www.twitch.tv/onemoregametv/b/336653494) Inside the Game with progamers iNcontroL, Idra (Both of whom belong to SC2 Pro Gaming Team EG), and Painuser.

* Everything was going smoothly until the topic of the ""Fall of SC2"" and the SC2 Reddit drama post, more specifically [Destiny's post](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/11m21k/starcraft_2_will_be_dead_before_legacy_of_the/), started being discussed.

* Idra, djWHEAT, and iNcontroL started saying how the SC2 Reddit community was going at the situation all wrong and how Destiny is wrong in what he did. They said that nothing was wrong in the SC2 scene and that people were being drama llamas. 52 minutes on the VOD.

* Destiny joins the call to defend his post and defend the actions of the community. Idra, djWHEAT, and iNcontroL begin arguing against him. In the middle of when destiny was talking iNcontroL stands up and heads over to Idra to give him a high five. [Gif](http://www.overloadtv.net/gif/highfive.gif).

*But the kernel popping doesn't stop there ladies and gents.*

* The arguments get more heated, popcorn falling out of their pockets, nobody getting anywhere. Finally, Idra tells Destiny that he should go back to playing League of Legends. Destiny replies, """"I think the idea is that all the Koreans leave SC2 for LoL, so players like Idra and iNcontroL can win tournaments now."" (Taking a blow out how neither player has been successful in tournaments recently.) He immediately leaves the stream after saying that.
[The part in the VOD.](http://www.twitch.tv/onemoregametv/b/336653494?t=1h27m28s)
* djWHEAT, the moderator of the show, explodes on stream and starts yelling into the microphone profanities at Destiny and calling him out for what he just did and saying arguing with him was like arguing with a child.

* Show ends and out come the [inevitable](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/11z8pg/destinyi_think_the_idea_is_that_all_the_koreans/) [reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/11zmh2/who_else_was_disgusted_when_you_saw_incontrol_and/) [posts](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/11zqu6/steven_i_dont_even_blame_you/). In short, the community sides with Destiny and is disgusted by the actions of djWHEAT and iNcontroL. The only one to come out unscathed was Painuser. Anyways, this is an extension of the whole SC2 drama that's been going on the last three weeks or so.

4th.  Get up early in the morning.  Don't stay up late.  You need your rest and you need to attack the day.  Go to bed like midnight.  Straight up gremlins rules.  You want to be rested and ready to go so be in bed by 11:30.  No caffeine after 9:00 PM.

5. When your alarm goes off feet hit the floor.  Immediately it's the best trick I ever learned.  Alarm off. Feet hit floor.  You are up.

6.  Next thing you do is exercise.  Cardio for 30 minutes.  That's all you need.  Walk around your dorm/apartment complex.  Go to the track. Ride your bike.  Just move.  You want to move forward than you have got to move.

7. Eat a good breakfast.  This is your fuel for the day.  Your body is the most valuable thing you own. Put premium petrol in that motherfucker.

8.  Success is about doing the small things consistently to improve.  There is no other blueprint.  People look at the big picture and then look at their life and that's where discouragement happens.   Fuck the big picture.  Focus on the small things you can control and the big picture will come into focus.  If you try to chase greatness you will never catch it because you aren't chasing the right thing.   Chase effort.  Effort leads to results, chase effort and greatness will start chasing you.

9.  Focus on doing the small things and developing strong routines.  Study, go to tutoring/study groups.  Fuck that introvert shit this is about learning, and your mind needs nourishment.

10.  Get pissed at video games.  Get rid of steam, sell your xbox / console. Uninstall all that stuff.   You know what you are missing?  Fucking nothing.  You will be missing a time sinkhole of button mashing where buttons are pressed and nothing ever really is accomplished as there is another game and another game and another game. Fuck that shit.  Your life and time are valuable, and only things that grow you as a person will hold your attention.

8. Eat lunch and keep hydrated, eat snacks like almonds and things for extra boost.

9.  Chunk down large tasks into small manageable bites.   You have to read 12 chapters.  Set an hour for two chapters.  Break for 10 minutes.  Write down what you learned.  Go into hour two the same way.  Break things down into small chunks and smash the fuck out of them.  Let that momentum build.

10.  Be obsessed with doing the small things well and be passionate about challenges.  No Pressure, No Diamonds.  Embrace adversity and be passionate to show yourself that you are mother fucking baller and can get shit done.  Setbacks happen, but it isn't about the setback... it's how you respond to it.  Do you tuck your tail between your legs, fuck no you don't.  You get after it harder.

Do all this. Build on it daily. Start small, chunk it down, and be excited about the opportunity and you will be doing amazingly well.

You'll be getting good grades, being accomplished, and fucking bitches in no time.

**Typography**: Find a font pairing that works well together. The easiest combination is two fonts of similar x-heights, incorporating different weights. Alternatively, use a serif and sans-serif. Google Webfonts is great for easy combinations.

**Background** [Subtlepatterns.com](http://subtlepatterns.com/). Thank me later.

**Floating Squares** I'm not a huge fan. I would get rid of them and just use text.

One thing that could fix a lot of this is a standard skeleton or grid. Think about using Skeleton Boilerplate, or [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/examples/hero.html).

True,[deleted],,,"There are a lot of very glaring UX (User Experience) problems with this site, but I understand this may not be your main priority as you mention learning backend design is the main goal.

But there are a ton of glaring UX problems which are made obvious by just trying to use the site.  

Here is a brief list of a few 

- Query? What the hell is that? I bet your Mom had no idea what ""submit query"" would ever do. Tailor actions to easily understandable calls to action that reflect the action. 

- There is nothing to distinguish links on the main page.  How does a user know that | Route links to something?

- Lack of metaphor continuity.  You are using ""Wanders"" so that should be everywhere.  What is a route? What is a Journey? What is a walk? What is a tour? They are all the same thing.  They are all wanders and you should use the same terminology everywhere.

- You are trying to convey WAY too much information on the homepage.  Think about what is most important and focus only on that.  Is seeing other existing wanders most important? Is creating new ones most important? Should I care about longest, shortest, newest, or favorite wanders the most? Pick one and feature only it. Other functionality can be put inside the other pages of the app.

When thinking about your app think ""How do I want people to USE this app"", not ""What do I want people to accomplish with this app"".  Applying this line of thinking will allow you to see the glaring UX problem in the inner pages (Map is way too huge, actions hidden below the fold, no real calls to how I am supposed to use the app)

42floor.com is the site I usually show people who are trying to make these types of apps.  I realize your just learning and arn't a rockstar developer or designer but you can learn a lot just by adopting user experience philosophies.  

I would suggest using something like twitter Bootstrap because it will give you a much better baseline for User Experience (and it looks great out of the box).

* [Peerblock - Blocks nosy computers probing into your stuff](http://peerblock.com) EDIT: Okay, yes, it really doesn't do much.

Right now, I'm using avast! instead of avira. I like it 'cause of the user interface. Honestly, as long as you don't go for something weird, any of the free AV programs will work. Courtesy of thornae, here are some more (eliminating the rather user-specific):

- [CDBurnerXP](http://cdburnerxp.se/) - if you still burn CDs or DVDs, this is probably the best free option.

- [Paint.Net](http://www.getpaint.net/) - GIMP pissing you off? Try this.  
- [FileZilla](http://filezilla-project.org/) - if you're using FTP at all, you want this.  
- [wget](http://users.ugent.be/~bpuype/wget/) - if you're comfortable with the command line, this is one of your best friends for downloading stuff.  
- [Calibre](http://calibre-ebook.com/) Got a few ebooks? You probably want this.  
- [HandBrake](http://handbrake.fr/) For all your DVD ripping needs.

True,D_EndroPhile,,,"I lived with my grandmother for about 6 years, while she was beginning her slide into madness from Alzheimer's/Dementia, until she had to be hospitalized. Alzheimer's is very funny, in a cruel way. You don't forget everything at once. It works in layers, like peeling an onion off. At first,she would occasionally ramble, or have an odd thought. She lost the ability to edit what she was thinking from what she was saying. 

She would wake me sometimes, telling me she knew what she was seeing wasn't there, but it was terrifying her, and asking me to walk to where the hallucinations were, so she would see me, and know I was real, and they weren't either. Around this time, she would start to forget who I was specifically. She knew me, knew we were close, but not how. I could still remind her though, with pictures, or stories to jog her memory. 

Eventually, she lost me as she continued to lose herself. I no longer existed as myself, but I wasn't a stranger. It was possible, but rare, to get a spark to her, and rekindle her recollections. At those times, she thought I was my father, coming home from school. It was better than nothing. 

Finally, she was gone, or at least, the woman who was my grandmother was. Her body had two kinds of pacemakers, and was incapable of dying, more or less, through heart failure. She developed inoperable cancer. But Kay had died long before the cancer killed her body. Medicine kept her alive, but couldn't keep the decay from her mind. 

I connected with this episode like I never have before. I cried. From when Marceline started singing in the kitchen straight through the end. My wife was holding me, and I was shaking.

* [Spelunky](http://spelunkyworld.com/) is a roguelike inspired platformer made by Derek Yu. The Xbox remake heavily expands upon the original game in every single way. The PC version has also [a lot of different mods](http://mossmouth.com/forums/index.php?topic=834.0) which you can download. If you're going to download the original PC version, then I highly recommend you download [the unofficial 1.3 version](http://mossmouth.com/forums/index.php?topic=1257.0) of the game. It fixes a lot of bugs and it also runs much smoother.

True,jonesrr,,,"You are operating under the false dichotomy that the system either, must favor a small group, or must try to make everyone better off by dumbing itself down.  These are not the only two logical choices.  The assumption that underlies your entire argument is that same quality = high quality, which is prima facie bogus (as the USA has proved well).

Many educational systems that outperform us, do it across the board.  Iceland's lowest 20% is significantly brighter than our top 40%... particularly in the field of mathematics.  
Why? well there's craploads of reasons.  A major one is that besides Iceland history, the #1 subject taught by total classroom time is math there.  

The upper class in the US are fine as is, they don't even go through the same broken system everyone else does... so I reject your theory as intellectually dishonest.  My future children, for instance, will learn trig by the time they're 6 or 7, from myself... My grandfather taught it to me, over the course of a weekend no less, when I was 8.  It's actually quite attainable for kids.

American education is getting worse, not better.  Additionally, our broken tax system, that encourages companies to hide profits overseas, coupled with an inept workforce of highly indebted college grads who, by and large, are no brighter than when they entered, are the reasons America is going into the 2nd world within the next few decades.

True,crunkjuicer,anthro, Cultural Anthropology ,"Here it is indeed. Gladwell wildly throws out ideas from medieval history and cognitive science, tracing unsupportable lines of causation to explain a multifaceted contemporary phenomenon. Let's try to break down some of what he says:

&gt;Even fractions are easier for Asian children because they are more easily understood and conceptual. For example one-half (fifty percent) is understood as 百分之五十 (bǎi fēn zhī wǔ shí) or literally, fifty parts out of 100 parts

This is faux-cognitive science at its worst. What does this statement even mean? Per cent, from Latin, literally means ""for [every] hundred"", so 50% would likewise mean 50 out of one hundred. But American children learning fractions probably have as much conception of this fact as a 14th century Chinese rice farmer speaking a dialect of Chinese that is mutually unintelligible with Mandarin (or a contemporary rural Chinese child who likewise speaks dialect in every setting outside of the classroom). And even if the Chinese numbering system is more intuitive, that does not explain a complex and socially situated phenomenon that results in Chinese people scorer higher on math tests. If you want to understand this phenomenon, don't  parse sentences - talk to people! 

And about those 14th century rice farmers. Suggesting that the mode of production from 500 years ago explains contemporary patterns in immigrant populations is, quite frankly, absurd. It's like taking a very crude Marxist determinism (the mode of production determines culture) and sending it through a time machine. Sorry, but I don't buy it. At the very least, can you make an interpretive argument about specific cultural practices that invoke this flimsy historical connection? 

If you want to learn about how to investigate phenomena of culture, there are many ways to do so. These methods are debated in academia (and are the Social Sciences) and taking a course or reading on these subjects can easily be done (for free thanks to the internet! Or maybe even on this subreddit) But Gladwell *has no method at all*. Surely you can see a problem in making assertions as he does about various phenomena without tying them together.
