&gt;A Crustacean Sensation across the Nation

If getting comped free things by local businesses is a such a red flag (relevant to the NFL), I have something to tell you about a lot of star athletes in college programs. Probably the worst offense Winston has committed (that's been proven), but if that's the worst...

&gt;The Soda Thief

Through both the linked article, and the TMZ article, you'll notice that the manager actually never says it's Winston on the 911 tape. All the NY Daily News article (which is a tabloid, remember) says is ""It's claimed that Winston was one of the trio."" [by who?] As far as I know, Winston has never been connected to the crime by a witness or investigator. If somebody has an article that demonstrates it beyond hearsay, then I'll accept that.

&gt;Fisher and Winston: Clemson, Part 3

&gt;Well, somehow, someway, Winston didn't get the Memo he wouldn't be playing, and came out in full padding to warm up. Jimbo Fisher then gets into another visible altercation with Winston. I think it goes beyond ""What, why are you in pads?

Winston is given a one game suspension, and you think that him dressing up in pads is indicative of what...that he thought he was going to play? Really? Why else would you be harping on him for dressing up? For all we know, some trainer set out his stuff for him, or he never thought that dressing up would be a big deal since it's (supposedly) his first ever suspension. Who cares if he accidentally dressed up for the sidelines?

&gt;Winston then made himself appear like an ass on National TV throughout the game

Huh? Dude was jumping and hollering on the sidelines because his team fought back to beat Clemson in overtime. It's more sounding like you have already made up your mind about Winston well before you set out to research his full history of character issues.

&gt;Fisher and Winston: BCS Practice

&gt;Fisher and Winston: Oregon

&gt;Fisher and Winston: Georgia Tech

Wow, Winston and Jimbo get into disagreements during stressful close games. This usually spells trouble for coach-QB duos. It's amazing they got to 27-1 with such an immature hothead under center.

Frankly I think that these ""red flags"" have been seriously *overplayed* for two years. Him doing dumb little shit with friends is something people tend to grow out of, especially with someone who now knows how much is on the line. He's not doing drugs or beating people up outside of bars or driving drunk (\*cough* PJ \*cough*) or sticking guns down his sweatpants. He's not going Johnny Football every weekend.

It's fine if you don't want Winston (as a non-fan of his potential destinations, I honestly couldn't care less where he ends up but am excited to see how he does), but judge it based on shit that matters, not beating a dead horse on these little tabloid headlines you're blowing out of proportion.

&gt;Tim Tebow has reached agreement on a new deal with the Eagles, two sources said Sunday.

&gt;Tebow is scheduled to arrive in Philadelphia -- and get a deal done -- in time to be in attendance for the start of the Eagles off-season program Monday.

&gt;Philadelphia has finalized an agreement with the 27-year-old Tebow, the framework of which was put into place when he worked out for the team last month.

&gt;Before signing Tebow, the Eagles first wanted to try to trade backup quarterback Matt Barkley. But when the team could not get enough in return, it decided to bring in Tebow anyway so that he could be present for the team’s entire off-season program.
Tebow now will join a crowded Eagles’ quarterback roster that includes Sam Bradford, Mark Sanchez and Barkley, giving Philadelphia three former first-round picks at the quarterback position in addition to another decorated college player. And it also will reunite Tebow and Sanchez, who were teammates with the New York Jets. 


&gt;Football’s most interesting team this off-season, the Eagles, just got even more interesting – if that were possible. Tebow now will attempt to jumpstart an NFL career that has been on hold since he played his last NFL game in 2012. Since then, Tebow continued to train for two full seasons with the noted throwing coach, Tom House, who also has worked with New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady. 

&gt;Tebow, who has been working for ESPN and as an analyst for the SEC Network, last played in an NFL regular-season game when he was with the Jets after playing two seasons with the Denver Broncos.

&gt;Tebow went to training camp with the Patriots before being released in August 2013. He struggled to find consistency with the Patriots, completing 11 of 30 passes for 145 yards and two touchdowns and two interceptions in three preseason games.
""I will remain in relentless pursuit of continuing my lifelong dream of being an NFL quarterback,"" Tebow wrote on Twitter after he was released by New England.

"drain_patience","redskins","Redskins","The idea that something like under inflated footballs somehow tarnishes the patriots' legacy is a joke to me. 

John madden is in the hall of fame. Plenty of Oakland raiders from all Davis' heyday are. No asterisk applied to their glorious history. And yet they cheated constantly. They didn't just do things that weren't regulated until the NFL made it against the rule, they also straight up cheated. All the time. 

But they were not paying off referees. They weren't purposefully losing or paying other teams to purposefully lose. They sought out and found ways to break rules that the NFL wasn't very good at enforcing. They constantly probed for advantages like that and when they got caught, they accepted punishment.

New england and bill belichek are no different. And from varying reports, most teams function this way, but ever since mangini ratted belichek out, coupled with his success in the NFL, they're under constant scrutiny. 

I would argue that Dallas and Washington choosing to load up salaries in an uncapped year when, legally or not, the NFL wasn't allowing teams to do so, would provide a way bigger advantage than under inflated footballs or video taped signs from 100 feet closer than the rule allows but neither team has been anything close to the dominant juggernaut the patriots are. 

Belichek will be punished and he will laugh it off because the reason he's got rings and AFC championships has nothing to do with spygate or deflategate. As a matter of fact, the only thing in common between his success and his scandals is that they both come from an all consuming desire to win and be the best. Belichek constantly probes the league's rules and regulations and constantly makes sure his franchise is always pushing the allowance of those rules and regulations. He approaches coaching players and developing schemes the exact same way. It's why he is so great. 

Anyone concerned about this 'tarnishing' his legacy or the patriots' need only look at how the Oakland raiders of old are currently viewed. 

Belichek doesn't hurt the integrity of the game and that is what is most important. Until he does, he will be the devilish pest that constantly pushes the NFL to do a better job of running the league and enforcing rules. He's not paying off refs. He's not paying people to hurt opposing people. He's not buying victories.

That is a big red flag.  That said, we really don't have anything to say that the Pats are great at developing QBs.  You really don't know who is good at it because if a team has a good QB, they won't be going through a bunch.  If they don't have a good QB, teams go through a bunch and get labeled ""bad at developing QBs"". 

Malletts first game was very good, though I don't think it was quite as good as the numbers suggested.  I saw a QB with lots of talent, but in need of plenty of seasoning.  Having an entire offseason with the team may help immensely.  

I am very curious to see how he plays out.  I would like to see him succeed just because I'd like to see the Pats get taken in a trade, but I also have my doubts that he can be the long term answer.

Based on Philbin's record and seeing him in Hard Knocks, I really can't see him being an effective coach, motivating players, or putting players in positions to maximize their talents and succeed.

Fowler wasn't going to be the missing piece that made the Jaguars competitive this season.  That honor belongs to Bortles, the line, and more generally speaking, the offense as a whole.

1 and 2 - J.J. Watt's mission is to absorb two blockers on the outside (Martin and Free) to open the B gap for Brooks Reed to break inside. By the time Martin disengages from Watt, just a second too late, he realizes that Reed has a clear path to Romo. 

3 - Note that the Demarco Murray lined up behind LG has his eyes locked down field. It seems he misses an ample opportunity to engage Reed with at least a chip block to impede his pass rush. Instead, Murray is unaware of the threat to Romo as his eyes are locked down field (perhaps looking for an open passing lane). 

Additional thoughts: Martin realizes that Reed is going to break inside just a moment too soon, thinking that both Watt and Reed are going to bull rush from the outside. 

Excellent play goes to Brooks Reed here for masking his rush, Watt for absorbing two blockers with ease. 

Extra laps go to Demarco Murray for lack of awareness, and perhaps Martin for reacting to Reed just a moment too late.

"30K100M","raiders","Raiders","1. I'm using [this](http://i.imgur.com/nwNdcwa.jpg) as a reference. On play #1, the Texans had Crick at 5 tech, Powe at 1 tech, Watt at 5 tech, and Reed at 9 Tech. On play #2, they had Watt at 7 tech, Pagan at 3 tech, Powe at 1 tech and Reed at 9 tech. Although the Texans are rushing the passer on both plays, it's a more obvious pass rush alignment on play #2 due to the amount of bodies on the back side compared to play #1 which is more balanced because of down/distance and the amount of time left (Play #1 is 1st and 10 with 8 minutes left while play #2 is 2nd &amp; 11 with 36 seconds left).

2. Firstly, having 3 hands on a defender (who only have at most 2 hands) will generate more power on your blocks because you're using the strength of more than 1 person, no matter how weak the help is. Secondly, having 3 hands on an opponent allows you to block the defender from a wider variety of angles which would otherwise only be possible by holding if you only have 2 hands on him. This allows the blocker being helped to maintain leverage, disrupt the defensive line, make it harder to penetrate, etc. Thirdly, having only 3 hands on the defender compared to, let's say 4 hands, allows the uncovered O lineman to keep his eyes up and look for unblocked pass rushers or when the O lineman from the other side is losing leverage towards his side. All these factors enhances the OL help that you already discussed at the beginning of your post.

3. The nose tackle tried to gobble up double teams towards the right side A gap between the C and the RG so that they'll have 1 on 1 matchup on the blind side defensive tackle and defensive end. Obviously it didn't work out (due to the action in the 3 hands screenshot) and the blind side defensive tackle got double teamed instead, which took away any interior pressure. This is one of the examples why people value good defensive tackles/nose tackles so much. Otherwise both OTs worked really well on their islands against edge rushers. If the Texans blitz Brian Cushing on this exact same play, DeMarco Murray would've chipped him and get open which will give Romo a quick checkdown and at the same time slowing the blitz. With the open field ahead of him and Dez Bryant 1 on 1 with his defender (Dez is a good blocker), I would say that they might be able to get that first down also.

4. I think they are responding to the defensive alignments that they're up against. The Texans have a more balanced defensive front on play #1 while they are loaded on the blind side on play #2. The Cowboys slide their protection accordingly and so far they made the right calls and allowing Romo enough time to throw.

5. The first key 1-on-1 is Tyron Smith vs JJ Watt and the second is Doug Free vs Brooks Reed. In the case of Tyron Smith vs JJ Watt, Tyron Smith was able to engage JJ Watt early and didn't allow him to gain any depth to the backfield untouched which really slowed down the edge rush. On the other side, Brooks Reed is able to get a lot of depth untouched due to his 9 tech alignment, but Doug Free won through pure lateral agility and was able to stay squared up with Reed throughout the play.",1429021205,"","1429061284",1,7,"nfl"
"skepticismissurvival","vikings","Vikings","1. The Cowboys are prepared for two blitzers with this protection: Tuggle (who is Murray's responsibility), and Cushing (Martin's responsibility). Ignoring his stance, I think Reed would have been most successful. If we're only counting Tuggle and Cushing, I think Cushing would be most successful. It's a numbers game. Tuggle could have two men blocking him while Cushing only has one.
1. Reed's stance is a clear indication he's not rushing the passer but is instead setting up outside leverage for coverage on Witten. The reason this is clear is because his stance shows that his weight is shifted toward the back, which means he plans to backpedal at the snap. If he planned to rush the passer, he would be leaning forward more to get a better jump off the snap. The foot placement is especially telling. If Reed were blitzing his stance would look a lot more like it does [in this picture.](http://i.imgur.com/T1Hjv37.jpg)
1. I see it in two places. Martin gets a hand on Powe, which pushes him a step the the left. Smith and Leary are left double teaming Watt (really, with Murray right there, it's more like a triple team). Smith's hand doesn't do much in my opinion as I think Watt was moving that direction to try to set up the spin move inside anyway.
1. I don't really know who calls protections for the Cowboys (either Frederick or Romo) but I'd imagine they noticed Reed's stance and called the protection to not include him.
1. By the result, advantage Cushing. Cushing is an experienced player, and quite strong. He gets leverage on Martin and drives him back.
1. It looks like the Cowboys might be at least a little concerned by the possibility of a blitz by the Mercilus, judging by the way Smith kicks out. I think it's pretty clear that Murray is assigned to block Tuggle if he blitzes. So, because the blitz came from the other side, it looks over defended on that side. With hindsight, if I were drawing up the protection, I would put Murray on Romo's right instead of his left.

---

1. The Cowboys are (to an extent) double teaming Watt with Smith and Leary. I mentioned the possibility of a Mercilus blitz before, but another reason to have Smith kick out like that is if Watt tries to go around the edge (with his presnap alignment I wouldn't expect it because he's heads up on Smith and that just seems like a waste of movement, but it's a possibility). Watt goes inside, and that rush is clearly Leary's responsibility.
1. Part of his job is to get in the passing lane, which he clearly tries to do. Another part might be deception, where they're trying to draw Martin to his right to clear up the rush lane for Cushing.
1. A couple of things - Cushing does a good job of using his hands to control Martin. First, he gets to push him back using ""one arm is longer than two"" principles, and then gets both hands back on him before Martin can reset. The other reason is that Martin's base is too wide and his feet end up to far apart for him to hold his ground. Oh, and also because Cushing won the leverage battle Martin is off balance, and falling backward.

1. Houston tried to cause some level of confusion by returning to a previous formation earlier in the game but blitzing a different player on a zone blitz.
1. Dallas has a double team on Watt, a double team on Powe, and Free assigned to block Pickett, with Smith, Murray, and Martin assigned to watch for blitzers.
1. Sticker to Cushing for a strong bull rush. Stickers to Free and Frederick. I'm not sure if Smith/Leary deserve stickers because they got an advantage but they *were* facing JJ Watt.
1. Laps to Martin for losing leverage. Laps to Dez for the drop. Laps to Tuggle for taking a terrible angle while presumably trying to tackle Dez.",1429102881,"","False",1,13,"nfl"

&gt; CTE is not real

Yes, it is.  It is a legitimate medical diagnosis accepted by the scientific community.  Unless you have some groundbreaking research in this area that has yet to be published, your claim has as much validity as someone who says that the Earth was created 10,000 years ago and rests on the back of a giant turtle.

&gt; The brain scans of players with ""CTE"" are highly consistent with the brain scans of long time alcoholics and users of cocaine. 

This may be true, but we don't know, since a brain scan wouldn't be done on a player suspected of CTE.  It would be waste of time, since CTE can only be confirmed by an autopsy after the player dies.  Again, unless you have some evidence of this claim, it's turtles all the way down.

&gt; All these former players from the 60's and 70's and 80's and 90's all were rich for their respective eras. and guess what people with money do for fun?

You're speaking from ignorance again.  Johnny Unitas tiled floors in the off-season.  Jim Brown was a marketing rep - not a paid spokesperson - for Pepsi.  Lou Groza sold insurance.  It wasn't until the early-to-mid 1980s that football became a year-round job and players made enough money from the sport to avoid taking a second job in the offseason.  Did some guys waste their money on drugs and pussy even back then?  Absolutely.  But people also live drug free and buy really big boats and really fast cars, so unless you have a documented history of what every player diagnosed with CTE did in their life, your assertions are hearsay.

&gt; One of the more recent incidents was the death of Rob Bironas, a kicker, whose brain was revealed to have signs of ""CTE"".

Source?  Bironas died in a car crash, and a toxicology report was released.  Some writers suspected CTE, but I don't believe his brain was ever tested for CTE.

&gt; It's a combination of substance abuse and the mental shock you go through when you fall out of the lime light post career (see: Junior Seau). You go from the world treating you like royalty to people not giving a shit about you in a matter of months. You see it happen in CEO's all the time when they step down. They're dead within three years of retirement.

That may very well be true.  Could you direct me to a peer-reviewed study that shows this, and not repeated brain trauma, is the case for ex-football players?

&gt; But do a little research and stop buying into the sensationalism. 

Perhaps you should do a little research as well.  The link between football and CTE is not as well-established as, say, the link between smoking and cancer, but it's certainly pointing in that direction.  And while CTE is a boogeyman of sorts, in that the media likes to throw it out any time an ex-player runs into trouble, it's almost certainly not the mirage that you claim it is.

&gt; Do you have any idea how much the lawyers in these cases stand to gain?

A lot.  How is that revelant?  The lawyers in Big Tobacco cases had millions to gain as well.

&gt; Edit: I'll head off the rebuttal arguments right now. You know which sport has the highest rate of suicide? Cricket. Followed by baseball, then futbol, then football. You know which sport has the highest rate of autoimmune diseases like ALS and MS? Basketball.

Did you also know that SpongeBob lives in a pineapple under the sea?  I'm asking because that fact has about as much relevance as your cricket fact.  I mean, it's almost as though suicide can be the result of a number of factors, many of which aren't related to sports at all.  Unbelievable, I know.  Are some of the NFL suicides blamed on CTE due to something else entirely?  Sure.  CTE is convenient and there's a class action suit, so I'm sure people are jumping aboard that money train.  But is anyone claiming that NFL suicides are the due solely to CTE?  No.  Is anyone claiming that the NFL has the highest suicide rate of any sport?  No.",1424048020,"","False",1,9,"nfl"

"the_termenater","falcons","Falcons","Lets do some math:

The NFL rules state that a ball must be inflated to a pressure between 12.5 PSI and 13.5 PSI for a game.

Now lets assume that the patriots were inflating their balls to the bare minimum of 12.5 PSI because they knew that would make them easier to catch during the game. This was most likely done inside the locker room, because of the rain during the game. Now, with 50+ NFL players in the locker room, it is not unlikely that the temperature could rise to 90 degrees or higher inside the room. From various sources, the volume of an NFL football is ~4.24L. Now for the math:

The ideal gas law is a pretty basic concept:

Pv=nRT, where P is pressure in atm, v is volume in liters, n is mols of gas, R is the gas constant of .082 atm*L/mol*K, and T is temperature in Kelvin.

12.5 PSI converts to about .851 atm=P

V=4.24L

n=?

R=0.082

T=90f=305K

First we solve for n, the number of mols of gas which will not change with the temperature:


.851 x 4.24=n x .082 x 305


We find that n=.1441 mols

Now, the temperature of the game was in the mid 40s (assume 45F)

If we alter the equation for the change in temperature, this time solving for pressure we get:

P x 4.24=.1441 x .082 x 280

Solve for P, and you will get a pressure of .781 atm, which is equilvalent to 11.475 PSI. That is over 1 PSI less than the NFL requires, which can cause the ball to feel deflated. Some balls may have lost air over the course of the game as well.

However, a slight disclaimer: Although the ball may have had less pressure due to the temperature, the mols of gas would remain the same as would the weight of the ball. If the referees found the weight of the ball to be insufficient then it was likely not caused by a temperature difference.

EDIT: Another point that I see being made is that there are much colder games played all of the time and that this never happens then. However, the moderately cold temperature and rainy conditions of this game are the perfect conditions for this to become an issue: in extremely cold weather the leather of the ball can harden up and feel harder than normal, making it harder to notice any deflation. Also, the rainy conditions of this game probably helped in softening the leather, adding to the pliability of the ball which would also make the deflation more noticeable. Interesting stuff! 

EDIT 2: As /u/tarheel91 has pointed out, this could also have been achieved with Gay-Lussac's law which demonstrates the direct relationship between temperature and pressure",1421690215,"","1421697556",1,202,"nfl"

"Tabemaju","vikings","Vikings","Since this was a copy from our sub, I'll go ahead and copy my response, because I am totally sick of people justifying his cap hit:

I hate to break up the circlejerk, but I hate this article.  He starts off with his homer justification by saying this:

&gt;  The Vikings are one of the better salary cap managed teams in the NFL, and never have to make draconian cuts just to get under whatever the cap number is going to be.

Oh, so because the Vikings are good at managing their cap, it's okay for them to pay a player *$6 million more* than the next highest paid player.  That is **not** good cap management, and no amount of excuses will make it good, but for arguments sake, let's take a look at what he has to say:

&gt; So let's look at some cuts the Vikings could make, not including Peterson, and see how their cap situation stands then.

This has nothing to do with whether it is financially responsible to be paying AD as much as we are.

&gt; Um...so what? Is it your money? No, it isn't? Okay, then. If the Vikings have the cap room to do everything they need...and they will...what does it matter?

Awful argument.  I can't have an opinion because I'm not spending my money on a player's salary?  What about the money I spend on merchandise? To go to games?  What about the money I spend in taxes to pay your stadium?  To say I have nothing invested in the team and how the team is managed is not only ridiculous, but **insulting**.  Great teams are great teams because they give a shit about their *fans*, not their profitability, because they know that the two are not mutually exclusive.  I want a well-managed team - hell, I **deserve** a well managed team after decades of fuck ups.  Don't give me the ""it's not your money"" bullshit - fuck you, it *is* my money.

&gt; The Vikings paid out Jared Allen's contract in full, which was an astronomical $17 million against the salary cap.

And how did that work out for them?  Was it economical?  Could we have used that money somewhere else?  *Of course!*  We paid a player we were going to lose in free agency a ridiculous amount of money to put up mediocre numbers *and you're using it as an example of why we should pay Peterson*?

&gt; Did Allen's contract prevent the Vikings from doing what they wanted in free agency or the draft?

What kind of stupid statement is this?  You have no idea what the Vikings would have done in free agency with an additional $17 million.  Like we were somehow a good team with no holes on Allen's contract year!

&gt; The Vikings aren't afraid to pay out contracts if the player earns it, so cutting Peterson just to cut him doesn't seem like something the Vikings will do.

Earned it?  Yes, he had a great 2012, a decent 2013, and *he didn't even play* in 2014.  And we paid him!  How has he ""earned"" it?  I have no problem with making him the highest paid RB in the league, I have a problem with making him the highest **by $6 million**.  It blows my mind that people excuse Peterson's off the field issues, and think we somehow owe him an apology, when in fact *he* is the one that owes *us* an apology.

&gt; kay, so I've just showed you that with two cuts, the Vikings are sitting at $30 million in cap space. There's no one in free agency...NO ONE...that is worth throwing a huge contract at, and $30 million allows the Vikings to go after anyone they want, at any position.

Bullshit.  Absolute bullshit.  We have a *lot* of holes to fill, and acting like we have unlimited spending money because no one player is worth $30 million is ludicrous.  Good teams don't justify bad cap moves, and great teams don't put themselves in the position in the first place.  It's a bad contract, and I will be incredibly disappointed if the Vikings bend over and agree to pay it.  I have no doubt that the Vikings will pay it if they are forced to, but Peterson is not worth $15 million, even if he puts together another 2,000 yard season.",1423932373,"","False",1,159,"nfl"

I'm going to try real hard not to sound too sympathetic for all you salty hater-chips out there who wanted nothing more than to see Tony Romo fail, but bad officiating happened all game long, and this bad call just happened to come out in our favor, and it just happened to be close to the end of the game.

And the refs? Fuck them for opening this debate in the first place with their shitty, inconsistent calling. Fuck the journalists and commentators for feeding into the shit by *NOT* bringing up the facemask, and not bringing up all the no-calls that hurt Dallas in that same game.

We should be talking about what a tough game the Cowboys are going to have in Lambeau Field this weekend, and how Romo showed a lot more resilience and mental toughness and maturity than he used to to not give up, and how Cole Beasley stepped up and is tough as hell, but instead, we get this shit show, thanks to the REFS and the shitty officiating staff.

EDIT: Speaking of Suh, the man played his ass off. I think he's guilty of playing dirty sometimes, but he played real hard yesterday, and I'm glad he was there.

And the better team did not lose the game. The Lions defense played hard all game long, but the offense didn't show up in the second half. We all saw it, one bad no-call doesn't change that, neither do the countless other no-calls in detroit's favor. That's not being the better team. Just for shits and giggles, however, let's say they get a FG (and the way they played in the second half, that's all I give them), then everything else plays out just the same. They shank a kick, we get a touchdown, and Matthew Stafford forgets how to hold the ball.  Same outcome, except we win by 1.

"anchist","ravens","Ravens","The most damning portions: 

&gt;**Based on the evidence developed in connection with the investigation and summarized in this Report, we have concluded that it is more probable than not that New
England Patriots personnel participated in violations of the NFL Playing Rules and were involved in a deliberate attempt to circumvent those rules.** In particular, we conclude that it is more probable than not that Jim McNally and John Jastremski participated in a deliberate plan to circumvent the rules by releasing air from Patriots game balls after the examination of the footballs by NFL game officials at the AFC Championship Game. We believe that McNally and Jastremski were aware that the inflation level of the Patriots game balls following pre-game inspection by the game officials would be approximately 12.5 psi and planned for McNally to deflate the balls below that level following the pre-game inspection using a needle provided by Jastremski. **Based on the evidence, we also have concluded that it is more probable than not that Tom Brady was at least generally aware of the inappropriate activities of McNally and Jastremski involving the release of air from Patriots game balls.**

This is the general stuff, basically outlining their findings. 

&gt;Our conclusion that it is more probable than not that McNally and Jastremski participated in a deliberate effort to release air from Patriots game balls after the balls were tested by the game officials is significantly influenced by the substantial number of communications and events consistent with such a finding, including that the same person (McNally) referred to himself as the “deflator” and stated that he was “not going to espn……..yet,” was involved in a series of communications about his impact on the inflation-level of Patriots game balls and using a “needle” surrounded by cash and sneakers (when his legitimate responsibilities as a locker room attendant did not involve the preparation, inflation or deflation of footballs), violated standard pre-game procedure by removing the game balls from the Officials Locker Room without permission of the game officials, brought the game balls into a bathroom before the game (for a period long enough to deflate them), and received valuable items autographed by Tom Brady the week before the AFC Championship Game. 


This is some heavy shit right here. A charitable interpretation would be that it is just a big coincidence the guys in question received valuable merch, but read on...

&gt;Similarly, the evidence establishes  that John Jastremski knew that McNally had referred to himself as the “deflator” and stated that he was “not going to espn……..yet,” was involved personally in a series of communications with McNally about the inflation and deflation of footballs using a “needle” and providing McNally with a “needle,” was involved in providing McNally with items of value, and had himself received a particularly valuable autograph from Brady earlier in the season. In addition, Jastremski spoke with McNally almost immediately when suspicions first arose (speaking by telephone three times in the hours after the game for a total of 37 minutes and 11 seconds) and **
communicated with Brady by telephone or text message with significantly increased frequency in the following days, as described below.**

Orders came from Brady: 
&gt;Evidence of Brady‟s awareness appears in text communications between McNally and Jastremski. For example, in text messages exchanged with McNally in October 2014 discussing Brady‟s unhappiness with the inflation level of Patriots game balls, Jastremski told McNally that **“[h]e actually brought you up” and “said you must have a lot of stress trying to get them done.”**

&gt;Moreover, taking the text messages as a whole, Brady is a constant reference point in the discussions between McNally and Jastremski about inflation, deflation, needles and
items to be received by McNally. In response to Jastremski‟s offers of sneakers and clothing, for example, McNally identifies Brady as the catalyst for those offers (“Tom must really be working your balls hard this week”; “Tom must really be on you”).

&gt;**Additional evidence of Brady‟s awareness includes a material increase in the frequency of telephone and text communications between Brady and Jastremski shortly after
suspicions of ball tampering became public on January 19 suggests that Brady was closely monitoring Jastremski.** After not communicating by telephone or text for more than six months (according to data retrieved from Jastremski‟s cell phone), Brady and Jastremski spoke twice by telephone on January 19 (calls lasting a total of 25 minutes and 2 seconds), twice on January 20 (calls lasting a total of 9 minutes and 55 seconds) and twice on January 21 (calls lasting a total of 20 minutes and 52 seconds) before Jastremski surrendered his cell phone to the Patriots later that day for forensic imaging. These calls included conversations relatively early during the mornings of January 19 (7:26 a.m. for 13 minutes and 4 seconds), January 20 (8:22 a.m. for 6 minutes and 21 seconds) and January 21 (7:38 a.m. for 13 minutes and 47 seconds). **Brady also took the unprecedented step of inviting Jastremski to the QB room in Gillette Stadium on January 19 for the first and only time that Jastremski can recall during his twenty-year career with the Patriots, and Brady sent Jastremski text messages seemingly designed to calm Jastremski (“You good Jonny boy?”; “You doing good?”). For his part, Jastremski sent Brady text messages confirming that he was okay (“Still nervous; so far so good though”) and cautioning Brady about questioning (“FYI...Dave will be picking your brain later about it. He‟s not accusing me, or anyone...trying to get to bottom of it. He knows it‟s unrealistic you did it yourself...”).**

None of that is in itself damning, but taken as a whole it paints a dark picture. 

&gt;**In addition, we believe it is unlikely that an equipment assistant and a locker room attendant would deflate game balls without Brady‟s knowledge and approval.**

For the record, neither do I. 

Later: 
&gt;**As discussed above, Brady‟s refusal to provide us with his own emails, text messages and phone records on relevant topics, in response to our narrowly tailored requests**, limited the evidence available for our review and analysis.

Referee Pete Morelli with Pool Reporter Todd Archer

Archer: Can you talk about the decision to overturn the call and why you overturned the call?  
Morelli: The back judge threw his flag for defensive pass interference. We got other information from another official from a different angle that thought the contact was minimal and didn’t warrant pass interference. He thought it was face-guarding.

Archer: Which official?  
Morelli: The head linesman.

Archer: What did you see?  
Morelli: It’s not my responsibility. I’m a hundred miles away.

Archer: Face-guarding is not a foul?  
Morelli: Face-guarding is not a foul. It is a penalty in college but not in professional football.

Archer: What is the process you go through after you announce the call? Should you have waited before you
announced the call?  
Morelli: Probably, yes. The information came and then the officials got together a little bit later, after it was given to me, the first information. It would have probably been smoother if we got together.

Now, after reading these comments made by fans of other teams (both in this thread and across /r/nfl in general) I hope he has his greatest season in his career, and drapes his ballsack across the rest of the league.

Salaries are divided into a number of different categories: guaranteed money, signing bonus, roster bonus, incentives, etc. These are all used in the calculation of the cap hit.

A simple example: if I signed a 3-year, $30m contract this year with the Jaguars ~~that included~~ in addition to a $6m signing bonus, it would look like this:

$10m/year salary. $2m/year signing bonus (pro-rated over the life of the contract). My cap hit is $12m.

If they cut me after year 1, they would lose out on $4m because they only accounted for $2m of my signing bonus against the cap. The cap hit would be accelerated into 2016, so they would have $4m less next year, but no penalties after that. This is called ""dead money"".

OH and this one had 35 points last I saw: ""I'd rather my QB put the team on his back and fall apart in the Championship game than go to the Super Bowl so he can audible out of the play so he can be the star and throw it all away"" -some thread where Luck vs Wilson came up just like 90% of threads.

I know these ones are cherry picked a little and have recency bias but I'd bet money you can all think of comments similar to these in the past. It's time to stop pretending this sub doesn't have a fat bias against a group simply based on the flair they pick and that it's all ""their fault"" the place treats them so bad. 

And don't even get me started on the pathetic shit being said on /r/packers. I mean I know we're mad but the desperate attempts to patch up egos is just embarrassing. ""Oh man my team lost fair and square. But hey at least I'm a better person and fan than them because  I didn't pay attention to them till recently so they must not have been before then right? RIGHT GUYS PLEASE right??"" And I know it's reddit but the shit being thrown at Wilson's beliefs is the kinda shit that could make half the sub mods of /r/atheism.

"DonEliado","falcons","Falcons","In 1995 the Braves won the world series in game 6 by a score of 1-0 off a David Justice homerun. It was bittersweet for Atlanta fans who Justice had called out for their lack of support. 

The next year Justice was traded. He was extremely upset and badmouthed the City and the Braves organization. A few months later his marriage to Halle Berry fell apart. 

It is my belief that shortly thereafter, David Justice entered into a deal with Satan to curse the City of Atlanta to nothing but heartbreak and failure for all eternity. The city he had won a championship for exiled him and ruined his life. He wanted to make sure they would pay. 

In the nearly two decades after, the curse has claimed all the cities major franchises and even nearby college football teams. The braves continued their success but never won another championship. The Falcons rose up in 2012 only to blow a halftime lead in the NFC championship game while a wide open Harry Douglas fell down in what should have been the game winning touchdown pass to send them to the Super bowl. You already know what will happen to the Hawks this year. Streak into the playoffs, and get bounced out in the first round. 

It is the curse of David Justice. Not only to lose, but to get your hopes up enough, to be just good enough that you start to believe, and then  WHAM, heartbreak. 

So to answer the question, Dan Quinn needs to go offer David Justice a hefty coaching contract and the City of Atlanta needs to issue him a formal apology so he agrees to lift the curse, maybe an exorcism. ",1426701251,"","False",1,67,"nfl"

"JudiciousF","broncos","Broncos","I've finally been convinced that Brady is better than Manning, and probably the greatest of all time. And to be perfectly honest, while it took him winning the Super Bowl while performing so well against a D (albeit an injured D) that crushed Peyton to convince me of it, even if they had lost it wouldn't affect my arguments for believing this now.

Football requires luck to win. Being the best team, doesn't give you a super bowl win. So the only thing you can do is be consistently good enough to win a super bowl, then wait for the circumstances to line up right. The Patriots success has a lot to do with Belichick, which is the only possible argument against Brady in my opinion, but really the key word is consistency.

What Brady gives you a consistent reliable performance, regardless of circumstances. When I watch a Broncos game, with Peyton I have that moment where I wonder, is this gonna be one of the games where Peyton can't possibly miss, and just absolutely scorches the other team every time he's out on the field, or is it gonna be an off day where he's just throwing ducks into tight coverage? Brady has off days like that too, but way fewer, and more imporantly they seem to be 100% uncorrelated to how tough his opponent is and to how important the game is. The thing Brady has that Peyton doesn't is consistency, composure, and confidence. He brings his A game every time, he doesn't get rattled when he's struggled throughout a game, and he never believes he's out of any contest.

I used to think those were just side effects of playing on a Belichick coached team, but at this point its clear he has them in a way that other people on the Patriots don't. He's as much of a source for the confidence and composure of his teammates as Belichick is. 

These traits, Confidence, Composure, and Consistency, don't translate into gaudy stats, but they translate into wins. This was the reason it was so hard for me to accept that Brady is the best, because I'm not actually that impressed by his QB skills. I don't watch individual games and think, ""Holy shit he's good."" the way I think that about Rodgers or Peyton. But somehow I always flinch when Brady comes on the field, I just know that somehow he's going to find a way to ruin my day. I know this because he ALWAYS does it. It's not any individual performance that's convinced me of this, its his entire career looked at as a whole.

I'm willing to entertain the idea that Brady would've been NOTHING without Belichick. That without Belichick there to game plan for Brady's specific skills, and to coach a crazy defense capable of winning three super bowls in four years, that Brady would not have been able to develop the confidence and composure he has now, that if he had been put on a different team he would be inconsistent, and likely out of the league at this point. However, he did have Belichick, and the result of his entire career is the best result of any QB's entire career in history. At least in my opinion.",1423157410,"","1423157673",1,183,"nfl"

"pastamagician","bengals","Bengals","OK this explains everything. The Patriots underinflated the balls before the game, and the officials only gave it a squeeze test instead of using a pressure gauge so they didn't notice. The Patriots then had a ball boy deliberately deflate 11 of their 12 game balls in the bathroom outside the officials' locker to give Tom Brady an even greater advantage at passing the ball and so that they would never fumble. Then one league official stole a kicking ball to sell, and he gave another unauthorized kicking ball to McNally. McNally knew that the new kicking ball was unauthorized, but he figured it would give the Colts a disadvantage, so he tried to pass it off as genuine to the officials, who noticed it was fake, which made the officials suspicious that the Patriots were doctoring their own balls. In the meantime, Brady threw an interception to D'Qwell Jackson, who noticed that the game ball was underinflated because of a combination of the ball boy's efforts and the cold weather. D'Qwell Jackson handed it off to an equipment manager, who gave it to Grigson, who had conspired with Harbaugh and Kensil to run a sting operation to catch the Patriots in deflating the balls. But in order to make sure the Patriots got in trouble, before handing the intercepted ball over to Kensil, Grigson further deflated the intercepted ball. And also the Colts overinflated their balls above 13.5 PSI before the game so that they would fall within the correct pressure range when the balls were measured at half time as part of the conspiracy sting, which the officials again did not notice because of the squeeze test's inaccuracy. Kensil assembled the Patriots' balls and individually measured and inflated them two times: once in the second quarter where most balls were between a few ticks and 1 PSI under 12.5 PSI, and this resulted in a Colts' ball being used by the Patriots' offense while the Patriots' balls were unavailable, and once again during half time in the officials' locker room where balls were 2 PSI under 12.5 PSI, which resulted in a delay at the beginning of the third quarter.

Play 1:

Crick in a 6 tech on Smith's outside shoulder. Powe is playing a true nose but is shaded to the left to Force Frederick left. Watt is playing a 5 tech over Free. Reed is playing a wide 9.

Play 2: 

Watt is an 8 tech. Pagan is a 3 tech. Powe is a 1 tech. Reed is again playing as a wide 9.

2.) Without Frederick's shove there is a good chance that Powe overpowers Martin and gets pressure up the middle which is one of Romo's weaknesses.

3.) Free's presnap read is Cushing, if that blitz comes than he would grab him leaving Reed for Murray.

4.) Tyron locks down Watt with his long arms. Free manages to shade outside with good technique and cut off the edge from Reed. Free does have problems with this type of player had a Bruce Irvin or Von Miller been here this play could have likely been a different story.

**Matchups**

1.) Frederick's assignment is the left side A gap from the get go, but due to the NT in the A gap on the opposite side he provides a a quick shove to help Martin get a hat on his guy.

2.) Leary knows he doesn't have help on his outside shoulder so he cuts off the B gap to force the 3 tech into the A gap where he gets negated by Frederick's double team.

3.) Tackles are taught to take the inside man, his eyes are on the linebacker in front of him in case Mohamed blitzes. When the ball is snapped he reads correctly and takes Watt.

3b.) Tyron gets his power clamps on Watts shoulder pads because of his unnaturally long arms. [On this still](http://i.imgur.com/jD7JAKI.jpg) you can see that Watt's arms are fully extended just to get to Tyron's shoulders while Tyron's arms are bent. Tyron knows how to use his physical gifts to his advantage.

The cog on this play is Frederick. He knows he needs to help Martin because of where Powe is presnap but he also knows that Leary is on an island against Pagan. Luckily Leary forces Pagan inside where he has help. Smith and Free are watching the linebackers in case of a potential blitzer with the secondary objective to take the edge rushers.
