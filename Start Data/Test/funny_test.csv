"FalseHistoricalTales","","","You are honoring a long tradition of practical jokes in the arts.

One of the earliest known instances of this types of joke appears in the early renaissance era (very fitting, given your post content!) This type of art is known as ""accanto a scherzare"", which roughly translates to ""juxtaposed art joke"". The tradition is believed to have started somewhere in Northern Italy when famous traveling french artist Claude Monsoisse painted the first example of this type of joke. In this painting, he painted a local lord standing in front of his castle, and he included two pigs copulating at the edge of the picture. The picture actually hung in the castle for years before someone noticed the obscenity. He continued this comical brand of art until his 48th birthday, when he was finally caught mid-act while painting a portrait. Claude got a little too daring when he included several phallic symbols while painting a retired knight (it was noticed by the knight's squire). The knight challenged Claude to honorable combat. The duel was finished within minutes, and Claude died of internal bleeding several hours later.

"what_comes_after_q","","","For people who don't have ADHD, it doesn't so much mean you don't want to focus or do work, it's that you can't. Everyone procrastinates and goofs off. But ADHD is a condition where people will often sit down to work, *want* to work, but are not able to actually work productively. Another symptom of ADHD is a need for stimulation. In kids, this means its hard to tell which kid just wants to goof off and not work by acting out, and which kid is unable to work, and is seeking stimulation by acting out. ADHD is really hard to diagnose in children, it's much more easy to define and understand in adults, but like many conditions, treating it early can have a huge impact in children's lives.

When someone goofs off, it's because the work they want to do is boring, or they are distracted, or any number of reasons. In ADHD, the patient will sit down to do the work, but ideas and thoughts don't form clearly. If the work is a writing assignment, they might have many ideas come to them, but none are directly related to the topic at hand. They can try to focus on the topic, but the thoughts never actually focus. So really the association between ADHD and lack of focus is misleading. They *can* focus, but suffer in implementation and productivity.

Thus a pretty brilliant solution was found organically and spread as a meme (in the actual anthropological sense of the term), young women desiring casual sex but needing to avoid the negative social stigma simply convey 2 messages at once that while seemingly contradictory, are actually directed at 2 entirely different groups

The message ""no hookups"" is for society as a whole, while the pictures are to potential sexual partners stating ""I'm trying to maintain plausible deniability, but we both are aware of why each of us is using Tinder and therefore I am not inherently opposed to hooking up with you"".

Sooban doesn't just have a manager breathing down his neck, he has a productivity scorecard to meet as well. This is a list of intense metrics that all call and chat centre staff have burned into their brains. If you don't meet scorecard, you're fired. And usually the turnover is so bad, your manager won't remember you long enough for you to get a reference. You miss scorecard, you're fucked. 

Scorecards are usually pretty unachievable unless you're *really* excited to chat all day to a bunch of angry arseholes who prefer the anonymity and cowardice of trolling on the chat systems, as opposed to screaming on the phone like real human beings.  

They have average handling time metrics, which mean you have to fix complex issues in an average of about 12 minutes or less. Most of the systems don't work, so it's nearly impossible to process anything quickly. And concurrency - this fucker of a metric means Sooban is helping multiple customers at the same time. With complex issues. In about 12 minutes or less. Endlessly.

Wow. I'm just dumbfounded by the reddit commando research brigade on this one. 

First. 
The Slow Loris in this video was born in captivity, in japan. It has it's teeth. It didn't have them cut out with nail clippers. While yes, this happens in the illegal pet trade because people pay stupid amounts of money for people to hunt them in the jungle. 

Second : 
The Slow Loris is NOT poisonous or venomous.
Yes. Slow Loris bites cause a reaction in humans. However it is an allergic reaction. It is NOT a toxin. And it is NOT a venom.
It's an allergic reaction some people have similar to a bee sting.

The Slow Loris produces an oil to make it's coat shiney from it's armpits. It then uses it's teeth like a cat would use it's tongue to groom itself and keep it's fur healthy.

"KicksButtson","","","My theory has always been that when Kyle Reese fucked Sarah Conner he screwed up the whole timeline and set into motion what is essentially a self fulfilling prophecy of sorts, and kills his boss who is the original John Conner.

To remove the inevitable paradox associated with sending your dad back in time to fuck your mom, let's assume the original John Conner was fathered by a completely different man. John grows up normal and then SkyNet takes over. He learns how to defeat the Machines the hard way. He becomes a general in the human resistance and wins the war. Everything that happens is thanks to luck, hard work, and his own ingenuity.

But the Machines sent back assassins as their last resort before being defeated. John sends back protectors to defend his mother, himself, and his comrades from these assassins. The one who went back in time the furthest to stop the T-800 assassin is Kyle Reese because they assume their best human soldier could easily stop a single obsolete T-800 terminator, even with old school weaponry. Likewise, that's probably why SkyNet sent the T-800 back the furthest, because it assumed that sending the most obsolete model back the furthest would maximize the terminator's effectiveness.

But what John Conner didn't expect is that Kyle couldn't keep his dick in his pants. You can't really blame him because Sarah Conner looks smok'n hot in her 80s perm, and he only got a crash course in time travel technology before leaving. (Technically they could have put him through time travel college for seven years and then sent him back in time with a damned doctorate in time travel technology. When you have time travel technology there's no real hurry to get anywhere.) 

So Kyle Reese either doesn't realize his mistake when he fucks Sarah Conner, or he does realize what he's doing yet thinks that the so-called paradox was meant to be, that this was meant to happen. But by the time he knocks up Sarah Conner she already knows everything that is supposed to come true involving the son she will inevitably have and the war with SkyNet after the nuclear holocaust of Judgement Day.

By pure chance the child that Kyle and Sarah conceive is a boy, and this leads Sarah down a long sequence of events where she fulfills the prophecy Kyle taught her even though the child she has in her womb isn't really John Conner. She names the boy John Conner and teaches him what he is to become, and since Judgement Day and the rise of the Machines is inevitable then the information he is given will inevitably become valuable as well.

The first John Conner was a brilliant and lucky tactician who learned how to defeat SkyNet the hard way. The new John Conner (which I refer to as the ""proxy"") is a shadow of the original man who only succeeds due to the information he was given as a child and the fact that he is following in the footsteps of a greater man who already paved the road for him.

It's as though a time traveler went back in time and fucked your mom and told her she'd one day give birth to a redditor named [insert name here], she would be likely to name the kid after you and raise the child to be a redditor without even realizing that you're not the same kid because originally your dad wasn't a time traveler and you found Reddit appealing by innocent curiousity, not because you were told to. Yet that proxy of you would end up with the same name and be a Redditor and end up reading this same post one day assuming it was meant to be, yet it wouldn't really be you.

**EDIT:** I do not believe this theory in any way represents the actual model of the terminator universe as intended by the creators of the franchise, however I do think it's a good way to view the film and the concept of time travel as an audience member. It kind of helps explain why the characters now seem to be in this never ending cycle of events where nothing really ever is accomplished and the war never ends.
