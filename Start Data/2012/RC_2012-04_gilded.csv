*· Update May 4^th (comments updated June 27^th because I'm easily distracted): small revisions, 1 new unique comic, now available as an [Imgur album](http://imgur.com/a/faLz2)  
· Update April 3^rd 12:45am PST: 81% longer; more of everything  
· Early April 1^st through April 1^st 5:15pm: constant updates  
· Comics and location data scoured from all 2025+ comments, across 5 reddit threads and 1 xkcd forum thread. Haven't read all of the xkcd forum theories.*

Okay, I think I figured it out. The alt-text reads:

&gt;*Umwelt is the idea that because their senses pick up on different things, different animals in the same ecosystem actually live in very different worlds. Everything about you shapes the world you inhabit --from your ideology to your glasses prescription to your browser window size.*

As geary and [same3chords (via googledocs)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OUhPBmrsbp2L9LTJGzJOmMJ7JIm7ydEJBRVXXmd_RM0/edit) mentioned, it's using the **referrer** (your ""**ideology**""), and/or **geographic location**, **browser**, **ISP**, and **OS** to determine which comic you see. Many comics also change depending on the **magnification of your browser** (your ""**glasses prescription**"") or your **browser's window size** (your ""**browser window size**""... okay that one was straightforward).

[[Short, non-technical explanation for how xkcd can deliver different content based on your location, browser, etc.]](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ro2n3/what_comic_comes_up_when_you_load_xkcd_today/c47w3i3)

· Like several other comics, this one changes depending on the resolution width of your browser (based on combined window size with magnification). It is made up of four panels, where the first one is always the same, the second has five variations, third: four variations, fourth: seven variations (for a total of 17 panels, creating up to 140 full-comic variations) to create the desired width. (Note: will collapse to smallest only, if browser is very short, regardless of width.) *thanks to Qaanol on the xkcd forums for finding all 17 panels*

· *martndemus: ""[this] is the one you would get if it didn't know anything about you""*

* No strong leads yet on why some people seem to default to the Snake comic and others to the Tortoise, Dinosaur, or Landscape. Location reports vary greatly for each one, so they are either not location-based or they are large clumps of areas. The Tortoise may be more common in Restoftheworld (non-US); the Snake seems more evenly distributed everywhere; the Landscape seems to appear in flat areas more; the Dino is least common, and seems to happen mostly/only in The States (US).  
· Some people have reported getting the same one across multiple browsers, while it changes between browsers for others. Interestingly, it seems to stay consistent for one user across time, which together suggests that the server is neither randomizing nor using just one piece of data, but combining multiple pieces of data (e.g. location+browser) to determine the comic. (This may also explain individuals' variation from Unknown comics to location-specific comics, which is very common.)  
· (Also note: where location data is shown, many locations have several data points, not just one. For example, with Tortoise: most states came up a few or several times, but other states did not come up at all. Not the expected distribution if it affects all states.)  
· Can anyone challenge this theory?

True,karmanaut,,,"Your submission was removed from IAmA. IAmA's should focus on something uncommon that plays a central role in your life or a truly unique and interesting event. Your AMA would be better suited for [/r/CasualIAmA](/r/CasualIAmA)!

**Edit:**

I can see that you’re all unhappy about BLB’s IAmA being removed; the many courteous and polite replies have made that clear. Unfortunately, in delineating what a subreddit is for, sometimes popular content gets moved elsewhere. IAmA itself came about because they were removed from /r/AskReddit despite being very popular there. Being removed doesn’t make the content bad, it just makes the content in the wrong place. He’s welcome to post it in /r/CasualIAmA (as I suggested), or somewhere more relevant like /r/adviceanimals. 

So, why doesn’t this fit within IAmA’s guidelines?

Well, first it isn't an ""event"". That part of the rule is there to allow something like ""I was at woodstock"" while disallowing something like ""I farted"".

Second: it's not particularly unique. There are new ""memes"" every day, and growing. And it isn’t just meme pics that we allowed; viral videos, popular gimmicks, etc. Where’s the line between “A photo of me is on the top of /r/adviceanimals"" (which would seemingly be allowed) and ""A video of me is on the top of /r/videos""? Is that allowed? And if you allow that, why not ""My question is at the top of askreddit""? There would be a very low standard of what our subreddit was for; seeming ly anything on the front page would be worthy of an IAmA. 

And third, we should look at what IAmA was for. It was supposed to be about Redditors being able to share their experiences from **outside of Reddit** and the internet. It's about what they do with their lives. That's not the situation we have here. The actual ""bad luck brian"" person has nothing to do with the meme. Again, that's why the ridiculously photogenic guy one was different: this had led to a huge media blitz for him, to the point where his life has been significantly impacted. In this very thread, Bad Luck Brian said that it hadn't really affected his life at all.

True,[deleted],,,"I'm reading a lot of what other people are saying and it's very true, but it seems like you want physical reactions.  Here's something to keep in mind before I try to describe them: 

Guys are very much about how something looks, or at least it's that way to me.  I'm not talking about in a shallow way, I'm talking a visual stimulation, whether you actually see it, or you imagine it from the outside, can set you off very easily.  I'm told that for women it's more about feel, which I assume isn't necessarily like feelings, but like if someone touches you a certain way, bites you in just the right place, or you feel a hot breath on your neck.  Something like that.  For me (and I'm just gonna go with personal experience because I don't feel like I'm normal or can speak for most guys) the thing that sets me off can be anything from an exposed neckline to body language.  Certain things, some of which I might not be overtly aware, start this whole process a lot easier than others and they may be things that I'm not completely aware of.  This is why I look at boobs, though I try to be as discreet as possible.  I look in order to size them up and so that I can try to imagine what they look like and, when I see them, I kind of do a mental comparison.  Usually, the real thing will supersede the mental image and be better about 90% of the time, and I'm really imaginative, so...  I have a feeling this is sounding a lot more shallow than I'm really intending, but I'm just gonna keep going anyway.

For physical things it varies.  If you're in lust your body reacts completely different from if you've just seen a girl that kind of sparks something, and this is different from how your body is when you are REALLY into someone, almost to the point of love.  How each makes my body react is different.  I'll start with the simplest and work my way up, I guess.  This is gonna get pretty NSFW pretty quick.

If I see something simple like a girl's neck that I really like, or a girl with a really cute face and whose body I'm reasonably attracted to and I get a little turned on then this is usually what happens: My heart rate picks up a little.  Sometimes it'll feel like my heart jumps into my throat for a second, but then it settles back to a mild chest-tightening, but this usually doesn't happen if it's not someone I know and I just catch a glimpse of a hot girl that turns me on.  It's not major and it doesn't last long.  As far as the nether regions go it's gotten to the point any more where I don't necessarily just straight pop a boner, but if I do it will not just be hard, it'll be hot, especially when it's laying against my leg.  It's a little uncomfortable to say the least, and depending on penis positioning can be outright painful.  Also, as I'm sure you're aware, when guys get REALLY aroused they will sometimes leak precum from the tip.  This can be a little awkward as it doesn't dry up real fast and you can feel it for a while, which leaves a little nagging in the back of your mind that you were horny and why, so you get to have that playing through your head all day, which leads to other boners sometimes.  The other thing to make note of here, especially when dealing with prick position, is that depending on where it is/how it's situated in the pants you can feel it get hard.  If mine is pointing down one leg and I pop a boner while I'm sitting in class I can feel it get bigger.  It feels a bit like an inch worm working its way down your leg as slowly as possible, but you also feel like you're the inch worm too.  Because you're horny your tip is sensitive so you can feel it as the material rubs over the head, plus you can feel the warmth of your dick as it gets bigger against your leg.  It's odd, but for me it's a little bit hot.  I dunno.

Now in the case where you are really just lusting after someone then things get really fucked up really fast.  All the stuff I mentioned above happens instantly.  This is the time when it can REALLY hurt if you get a boner because it happens so fast that, if it's not positioned properly, it can smash into your jeans and it hurts like a mother.  Not as bad as gettin' kicked in the balls by any means, but it is definitely uncomfortable and leads to a re-situation of your plumbing really quick.  That's if you're trying not to let it on too much.  If it doesn't matter, then you very much want to fuck the hell out of the person that turned you on like nobody's business.  You really just want to bend them over and shove it in.  Really, if it's bad enough, you don't even care what hole.  At the point, like others have said, it becomes a primalistic instinct.  The problem is that, if you're in public (at least for me) you start envisioning all this and it doesn't make the problem any easier.  If this happens sometimes I can get sweaty palms or feel flushed all over.  It's one of those times when I have to take a really deep breath and desperately try to think of things that turn me off in order to settle down.  I would say that when you pop a boner that fast you might also get a tingle just because you have the blood rushing to one spot so fucking fast that your nether region doesn't know what to do with it.  Also, if it's bad enough, (again for me, cuz I have an extremely active imagination) when you imagine doing...*things*...to a girl or whatever, then you can actually feel it.  Maybe not down there, necessarily, but it's almost like you have their hair in your hands, or you can almost feel their skin or pain from scratches or whatever.  The heart rate definitely picks up in this kind of stage and it will cause you to need to catch your breath a little bit, but it's not because you've got feelings for this person, it's because you have to breath harder just to keep in the almost overwhelming urges to throw caution to the wind and fuck the shit out of the nearest hot woman just to get it out of your system, even if that girl isn't what set it off in the first place.  ...This is almost a scary state of carnal frustration, let me tell you.  It's not like it's not manageable.  I don't see myself raping anyone ever, but it's something that you do in your mind, even if you don't do it in actuality, so it's a little frightening to say the least.  I think, a lot of times, this is why you see those rage comics where guys talk about being disgusted after watching porn or whatever.  It's because subconsciously your conscience or what have you sees that your body was aroused and considered going through the act to such an extreme detail that you, maybe just subconsciously, are appalled that you'd ever consider it... Or the porn you're watching is just really fucked up, in which case it kind of proves what I'm saying about your state of mind.  You don't think, you just do in this state, especially if you're given a free reign.  &lt;_&lt;;;;  Your mind really gets cloudy in this state, but I feel like it's almost like you're acting on pure instinct and your body wants to just *do* stuff, whether your mind says it should or not.  

Alright, so the last type of state that I feel like there is happens when you're not just physically, but emotionally attracted to a person.  I've had this a couple of times, but not nearly enough and both times were entirely too short.  For my tastes at least...  Anyway, for this type it's like you're half-way into the lust state that I described before, but you're still in complete control.  At this point, though, your heart is hammering so hard that you feel like it's going to literally burst out of your chest.  The only time I've ever had this type of heart hammering was when I had my 5th 5 hour energy drink within a 17 hour window, but the heart hammering that I'm describing doesn't hurt, but it's just as hard.  Your stomach is doing flips so much that it feels like the world is moving too slow and you're going a million miles a minute.  Sweating may occur, but if it does it's usually just your palms, I think, but this may also be because of nerves.  It's this state that's bordering anxiety and nervousness so closely, and your body is flipping out so much, that you can almost get sick if you don't pull it back a bit.  When you actually get to be with the person in this state then every touch feels like a fire.  Every kiss or bite or nibble makes you almost hungry.  It's like no matter what you do you can't get enough of that person.  And, what makes it worse, is when they react.  When a girl reacts to the things that you do, especially when you're nervous or anxious, intensifies everything.  I think the reason for this is because you're in such a heightened state, but when she reacts it makes it where you feel more confident and because you're no longer nervous the nerves aren't holding you back, so you can do more and suddenly the touches, bites, and anything that she does to you feels 100x better because you want her and she wants you back.  That emotional quality adds this new layer that's hard to describe and, really, in this state the emotions mix so vividly that it makes it hard to distinguish what's physical and what's not.  That's probably why a lot of these guys have been talking about things in almost over the top metaphors and analogies.  It's this state that muddles your mind, like the state of lust, but you still have a measure of control.  If you lose that control, though, it can easily slip into that state of lust.  

I hope all that I've said kind of makes sense and helps.  Really, though, if you're talking about the purely physical aspect of it, dick placement is very important.  Depending on where it lies in the drawers will determine what it feels like when you get a boner in the middle of whatever you're doing.",0,1334245945,,0,True,1,c4bfduq,t3_s54zx,t1_c4bfduq,t3_s54zx,,1428706681,177,False,AskMen,t5_2s30g,177

**Before it was a genre trance: 1990-1992** 

This was the era when trance wasn't trance yet.  The true pioneers.  Music that sounds so unlike the music we call trance now.  I mean, can you expect anything better? Dance 2 Trance, Age of Love...classics.

His first debut.  

**Progressive Trance Take 1: 1996-1997**

This era is when trance fans started to become separate.  Kinda like the whole trance/trouse split going on right now to an extent.  A lot of ""purists"" if you will felt this new progressive trance lost the dark, simplistic ways of ""real"" trance.  In fact, many went over to goa/psy at this point.  For most of the current generation, these are the songs that are classified as the really old classics, or when trance started to really become trance.

**Epic/Anthem Trance (aka ""old school"" to most people): 1998-2001**

One of my favorite eras.  Probably why there is so many here. This was the rise of Epic and Anthem trance led by many Dutch producers.  For today's DJs, when they need old school, this is what comes to mind.  Real old school trance lovers say this is when trance went from underground to mainstream and took a turn for the worse.  Still, can't beat the sounds.

[Paul Van Dyk - For an Angel](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfRq3j2tvxY)

I had this song on one of my Motorola phones back in the day.

[Ayla - Ayla](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH3K9UjQvWk)

[Push - Universal Nation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnBeTPpr98g)

What happened to this music?

[Art of Trance - Madagascar](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXFwOjm0_MU)

Personally speaking, I prefer the [Ferry Corsten Remix](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuH_nYKXqHM&amp;feature=related) myself, which is what most people think of when trying to remember this song.

[Binary Finary - 1998](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKwK-ZhTurg)

Yes, yes, yes.

[Der Dritte Raum - Hale Bopp](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=als2LeCe3Ss)

[ATB - 9 PM \(till I Come\)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ri6Efk1SPJc)

Definitely more main stream, but ATB made a name for himself with this one.

[Armin - Communication](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bn1ycNxQMvk&amp;ob=av3n)

Armin made it big time with this one.

[York - The Reachers of Civilization](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INaqvTWOu08)

Was the intro to the best compilation CD, ISOS 1.

[Solar Stone - Seven Cities](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9s-hcVOP1I)

Most people recognize [Armin's take](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nff-8aLN3vQ) on this beauty.

Massive tune.

[Delerium ft Sarah Machlachlan - Silence \(Tiesto Mix\)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcJJMk81ZSw)

One of Tiesto's best remixes.

[Coast 2 Coast ft Discovery - Home](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5v37J-4T_9g)

Absolutely loved this song along with Susan's remake last year.  Have the original vinyl for this song too.

Man, I would have loved to been a concert go'er back then.

So this is more ""newer"" stuff old school wise, but still good.

[Way Out West - Mindcircus \(Gabriel and Dresden Mix\)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXwcMAGhgRA)

Love the vocals on this one.

[Oakenfold - Southern Sun \(Tiesto mix\)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlC-bAb7d6o)

The other top Tiesto mix of all time.

[Solar Stone - Solarcoaster](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-wV1LJCXF8)

Classic by one of the few producers still making ""pure"" trance.

[Andain - Summer Calling](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfBTinQry_4&amp;feature=related)

Original.  Many remember this song from the Josh Gabriel mix.

[Oceanlab - Clear Blue Water](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anPl757OPf4)

Justina's vocals are amazing.  A start of a career that would produce some amazing OceanLab singles and CD.

[Paul Van Dyk - Nothing But You](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9u2DtCJde8)

I remember the Cirrus mix from Need for Speed.

[Motorcycle - As the Rush Comes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNwsFop9vHU)

This it the *ORIGINAL* mix.  Most people have heard or prefer the[ Armin van Buuren Universal Religion Mix](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYV39ohfKxA) or the [Gabriel and Dresden Sweeping Strings Mix](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0riQRkNBVA).

[Holden &amp; Thompson - Nothing \(93 Returning mix\)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdhIwGZxtLA)

[OceanLab - Sky Falls Down](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvrdN89E5uU)

[Solar Factor - No Return](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tssUJ_NJMxU)

Definitely more an old school vibe despite it's release date.



I'm going to stop here for two reasons:

- That took way to long to link all the songs

- Anything past 2002-2003 to me isn't ""old school, vintage"" yet.


I know I missed a ton of songs, but these are the ones that stand out for me.  Personally, I'm a fan of the 1997-2001 era of music for ""old school.""



EDIT: Per Wheaties466 comment, added System F and Cosmic Gate tunes.  Per sassanix, added Vincent de Moor tunes.  I knew I forgot big ones.  Also added Cosmic Baby to Early Trance.  Added Darude and Ian van Dahl to 1998-2001 Trance Section.  Yes I know they are ridiculously popular and overplayed.

True,torchlit_Thompson,,,"Hip Hop is a **reflection**, not a *projection*. T.H.U.G. L.I.F.E. isn't just something Tupac had tatted on his stomach. It's an acronym that explains that it's our own cold, ruthless society that breeds the legends of our nightmares.(**T**he **H**ate **U** **G**ive **L**ittle **I**nfants **F**ucks **E**verybody)

People like Sharpton, Beck, Jackson, and Limbaugh are two sides to the same bigoted coin. If they could just shut the fuck up and listen, watch what's going on, they might actually see what our real problems are. But they're not in business to solve society's ills. They traffic in controversy and turmoil, and if we listened to those voices, we'd never do anything but blame others for things we can all do something about, however small.

Every truism I've ever heard spoken aloud has offended someone, but that's because the truth hurts and they wouldn't be so shocked if they hadn't had their heads up their own asses in the first place.

If my generation hopes to accomplish anything meaningful and leave our children with a better world than this shitshow we inherited, then we're gonna have to offend a whole lot of people. If we let the Baby Boomers dictate the public discourse until they are all dead and buried, they'll bleed us dry and keep us fighting the culture wars of the last century out of pure vanity and shortsightedness.

Anyone in 2012 who is offended by words or thoughts isn't worth the effort to reach out to. Just let them yell at the tv or the radio, hopefully they'll get so mad that they all have massive heart attacks, strokes, embolisms etc. and we can get out of subsidizing their senility.",0,1334487198,,0,False,1,c4chbob,t3_sad7y,t1_c4chbob,t1_c4cg6t4,,1428725060,237,False,todayilearned,t5_2qqjc,237

True,stashew,,,"About 10 years ago, I lived in Savannah, GA. I had moved into a carriage house with 3 friends of mine. I knew there was a bit of a spider problem because when I was moving into my room, I found a dead spider curled in the corner of the room that was roughly the size of my closed fist. At that time I was full-on arachnophobic, and was completely unprepared for the horrors that living in that house would subject me to.

Shortly after moving in, the pilot light on the water heater went out. The problem was, the water heater was in the attic. I borrowed a ladder from work, went home and attempted to access the water heater via the...er...um...attic hole? Upon opening the attic hole in the ceiling I saw something that still chills my blood to this day. The entire ceiling of the attic was covered in what I can only describe as Tim Burton's wet dream. 

The spider webs were so thick, it looked like someone had gone too far with the Halloween decorations. As I scanned the attic ceiling with my flashlight from the relative safety of the living room, my flashlight beam caught on, and reflected back two green glowing eyes that were about the size of green peas. Attached to those demon eyes was a spider that looked vaguely like a gaunt tarantula. The spider was clinging to the ceiling in a stance that said, ""I swear to arachni-god, if you come one step closer I will fucking end you."" The reason for such hostility was, the silver dollar sized egg sack that clung to the bottom of the spider. 

After fighting to keep the screams and vomit in my throat, I realized that I couldn't handle the task alone, and my roommates wouldn't be home for a while. I needed to go get reinforcements. I left the house with an overwhelming case of the jibblies, and headed to a local coffee shop that I frequented, knowing I would find someone there that I could enlist to help me.

After finding and persuading my friend High School Pete to help me, we returned to the house. Upon seeing the spider still sitting in the same spot, High School Pete exclaims, ""Holy mother fuck that!"" and immediately walks out the front door, never to return. 

I sat for a while pondering how I could get into the attic without disturbing the spider when two of my roommates came home. I showed them the spider and after a few minutes of shrieking like little lady girls, we started to devise a plan of attack. 

We decided that our only two true weapons were a vacuum cleaner with a hose attachment and a can of Raid. Seeing that the can of Raid didn't shoot very far, we opted for the vacuum cleaner. The plan was to use the hose to simply suck the spider off of the ceiling and go on about our business. The problem again was distance and our reluctance to get close to the spider. So, I quickly attached the hose to the end of a broom handle using my belt, effectively doubling the distance between me and the spawn of Satan, mother to be.

I climbed the ladder, got the hose as close to the spider as I could and told my roommate to turn it on. When the vacuum cleaner came alive I put the hose directly on the spider only to have it nonchalantly WALK AWAY. 

We realized we needed another plan. What happened next will be burned into my memory for all time as the simultaneously funniest and scariest thing I have ever witnessed.

My roommate Brandon somehow grew an extra set of testicles and decided that he would climb the ladder and shoot the spider with the can of Raid. He then pulls the hood of his sweatshirt onto his head (effectively making him look very suspicious) and pulled the draw strings tight leaving himself a very small anus-like opening to look out of. With Raid can in hand, he started to climb the ladder. 

While two of us had flashlights trained on the spider, Brandon reaches the top of the ladder, and after what seemed like an eternity, he let a burst of Raid fly at the spider. Now. It was on. 

The spider immediately dropped from the ceiling to the attic floor and started coming after Brandon. At this point the three of us in the living room just started full on [screaming](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=W6d1rn-eEA0#t=30s)

Brandon then drops off the ladder, skipping all of the rungs, lands on the living room floor, does a ninja roll backwards, and stands up and points the can of Raid at the ceiling, waiting for the spider to come out. What he didn't realize was while he was doing his acrobatics off the ladder, the spider had already dropped out of the attic onto the floor and was coming right for him. 

The rest of us stood there trying to alert Brandon of his impending doom. The problem was, we were all in full blown caveman mode and all we could do was point and scream. With the spider covering ground very quickly, Brandon realizes where the spider is, and starts to empty the contents of the Raid can onto the spider.

At this point, the spider is still coming at him despite the deluge of chemicals being sprayed into it's demon eyes. Eventually the attack becomes almost too much for the spider. I say almost because the spider then, in complete disregard for its motherly instincts, DROPS ITS EGG SACK leaving it behind, and CONTINUES to go after Brandon.

A few more seconds and the remaining contents of the Raid can later, the spider finally starts to succumb to the effects of the poison. We watch as it slowly takes its last dying steps, still trying to get to Brandon, and curls up into a ball of demon death.

After standing around in slack-jawed disbelief, we realize that we still have two problems. The first being the egg sack that the momma spider left behind. We knew we didn't want to squish it because that would probably launch us into a full on war with thousands of little versions of the most determined spider I have ever witnessed. So I gingerly picked the egg sack up using a dustpan, took it outside and lit that fucker on fire. 

The last remaining problem was the water heater. After all this, I had yet to successfully get into the attic to light the pilot light.  I slowly climbed the ladder and peered into the attic with my flashlight. As I scanned the dark recesses, I noticed several pairs of eyes glowing back at me from the corners of the dusty, web ridden attic. There we no less than a dozen spiders hanging dead in their webs. Each one of them was the size of my hand.

Realizing that they were dead and I was relatively safe, I completed the climb into the attic and approached the water heater. Just as I lit my lighter a tiny little house spider rappelled down on its web right in front of my face. 

Before the earlier incident, the sighting of this tiny spider would have sent me shrieking and running. But I simply scoffed at the spider, lit the pilot light, and closed that attic hole/portal to hell satisfied in knowing that it was that day that I was no longer arachnophobic knowing that I would most likely never experience anything like that ever again.

tl;dr Fought a ""pregnant"" demon spider. After she dropped her egg sack and continued to try and kill my friend, we eventually won the day. ",0,1334934563,,0,False,2,c4ek9z2,t3_sj7oo,t1_c4ek9z2,t3_sj7oo,,1428761137,121,False,pics,t5_2qh0u,121
True,yishan,,,"SdotM0USE's note about [viewing reddit as akin to a city-state](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sk1ut/iam_yishan_wong_the_reddit_ceo/c4en44e) is on-base.

But two principles are this:

1) If you're not paying for a product, you *are* the product.

2) We should try to come up with as many ways for our users to pay us money as possible.

[credits go to two reddit employees who originally cited/articulated these two principles]

One of the ways Digg started to go off the rails is because they became too beholden to their advertisers.  Ultimately, you are beholden to the people who give you money.  Thus, I want an arrangement where most of our money comes from *redditors*.

This doesn't mean ""charge to use reddit.""

What it means is that I want reddit to be good enough and useful enough that enough redditors find it worthwhile to give us money.  This will likely mean the addition of value-services, or new features.  Or simply developing a somewhat different advertising model where most of the ads come from members of the community, because they will be more likely to be sensitive community norms, not to mention relevant.
