"K4S3-R","picard","","Okay, look:

(Caveat: If you *are* in fact one of The Youth or whatever you should probably skip this. Old people tend to go on for *waaay* longer than they need to about stuff. And I've been told time and time again that I do this. This is gonna be wordy, and nerdy, and oh my *fuck* it's gonna be too long. Basically if you're one of those people who cringed at the word ""caveat"" you shouldn't be reading this.)

**I was born in 1973.** That's cool. I'll wait.

Okay? I am fucking *[geologic](http://masschill.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Granny-Grandma-Internet-old-people.jpg)* in Reddit-years. I lived *most* of my life BSN (""Before Social Networking""). But the problem is, all the things I like are things I'm supposed to fear/scoff at. Games. Nerd-stuff. Internet Jokes. Whatever is happening right [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/fifthworldproblems/). That kind of thing. It's a problem.

In real life, I've never had many ""[friends](http://i.imgur.com/iDoqPHP.jpg)"" (well, any, honestly), but the people I get along with tend to be younger. I think part of this is the fact that for a good dozen years of my life I was tramping around the world in a state juuust shy of that of a hobo, and so these days I tend to have lots of grocery clerk/substitute teacher-type jobs we barely-employable people tend to get stuck in, and so my social demographic is comprised of the *other* half of that workforce, i.e., twenty-two-year-olds.

My point is that in real life, I tend to do pretty well around younger people. My sense of humor just clicks with them or whatever. As an emotionally immature person, my peer group tends to be literally half my age. 

(To the people cringing right now: oh piss off. A), I'm married so no, I'm not in fact fucking my way through the Coffee-bar staff at work, 2), yes I am *aware* that my social life is a direct result of my failings as a person, thank you very much and D), my self-loathing is such that your being creeped out that I'm hanging out with Millennials doesn't even come fucking *close* to hurting my feelings.)

But this does not correlate AT. ALL. in an internet setting. I only discovered Reddit about two years ago (context: about to move back to the States, was told the site was ""a good way to make friends in a new town"". LO[LOL](https://ravenvinnie.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/first-day-on-the-internet-kid-10-women-in-my-hometown-550x250.jpg?w=470&amp;h=140&amp;crop=1)OLOLOFML) In that time, I've had fun watching other nerds flail around for my amusement, but there has always been a limit to how much actual *interaction* I can take. There *is* a Hivemind on Reddit, and that hivemind seemd to be alarmingly Young.

It's everywhere. Any post that even *hints* at nostalgia, or one that even slightly evokes a commonly-held belief (something that once upon a time was sought out as a *comfort* to people) will have a top-rated comment braying DAELOL1LOL!1LOL!1!1! in a desperate attempt to napalm any connection to other people or to the past. That right there is the most alienating, the most depressing thing about Reddit.",1427209597,"","1427387965",1,395,"AdviceAnimals"

"Halafax","","","Fell in love, got married.  Her parents couldn't/wouldn't help with the wedding.  She wanted a big wedding (she already had a kid, was very embarrassed and wanted to get her reputation back, she didn't even let her own son come to our wedding).  

I had a very nice chunk of change from surviving a fairly horrible work situation.  20k, she spent it all.  Put another 10k on credit to cover the honeymoon she insisted on and some other expenses.  I went from 20k in the black to 10k in the red.  

She got 70% of her dream wedding.  A few corners were cut, but overall it looked very nice.  In retrospect, I think she was siphoning quite a lot off of the top, the numbers don't add up.  

She insisted on going to Jamaica for the honeymoon, to an ""all inclusive resort"".  I couldn't afford the one she wanted after the wedding, but booked at a similar venue.  She had a shit-fit, decided she was ""afraid of black people"" (in Jamaica) and wouldn't leave our room.  I think we had sex once, we mostly watched hbo.  It was miserable.  

4 months later, I got nasty-grams from the caterer and photographer.  She never paid them.  I dug around and covered the debts.  

I was married for 8 years.  In that time, she destroyed the finances over and over again.  My credit before marriage was great, afterwards I couldn't get a loan for anything.  

Her boyfriend came back on the market, and she divorced me.  Hid the kids, drained the accounts, tore me apart in court.  No fucks were given on my account, I ended up paying all the lawyers and court costs.  Lived in poverty, missing my kids most of the time.  

She's in prison now.  I have the kids back.  My credit is slowly climbing back up.  She's getting treatment for borderline personality disorder now, she wouldn't go to psychological professionals before.  I think she knew there were big problems, she just didn't want it ""made official"", and I couldn't force her to go.  

No moral here.  I screwed up, put all my trust in someone that couldn't keep my trust.  Once I knew how fucked up things were, I was afraid to leave for fear of custody court.  It was much, much worse than I feared.  

Keep your money.  Keep separate accounts.  Get a pre-nup.  Build and maintain boundaries.  Some people are screwed up, it's harder than you think to sort out which ones are which.  Keep yourself safe, keep yourself sane.

Around the year 2000, Metallica had this mega tour with Korn and System of a Down as opening acts.  They were playing football stadiums.

Anyhow, James hurt his back during the tour.

Instead of canceling shows, they still played.  They came out before the show to explain the situation, and they said, ""Tonight, you get to sing for James.""  The crowd sang all the songs, but members from the other bands (like Serg and Jon Davis) came out to sing as well.  Also, some of the guitarists came out to play James' parts, too.  Apparently, Daron Malakian learned to play guitar by listening to Metallica, and he played a bunch.

Probably one of the best shows that I've ever experienced.

Then, once James was feeling better, Metallica came back a few months later and gave free shows to all the ticket holders.

So i got used to staying in and drinking alone or with grams watching the ball drop and usually passing out around 1am. First person who ever joined me was a at the time girlfriend who is now my wife and we used to until our kids were born keep the tradition going.

Grams has since passed away, but some of my best memories of her are just hanging out on new years, me getting drunk and us just having a good time shooting the shit waiting for the ball to drop. Once in a great while she would even have a drink with me which was unusual for her.

EDIT: Thanks Whats_Up_Bitches for the gold! and thank everyone else for making this my new top comment. Sure makes my new year and is a great belated Christmas present. Really enjoy all the comments about how this makes everyone want to spend next new years with their grandparents, i say dont wait till then though, if you enjoy time with your family spend it whenever you can. Besides my sister and people ive adopted as family (close friends and my own household which is my wife and our two kids) im running low on family, so enjoy them while you got them. I like to treat each day as it may be mine or someone close to me's (myself? mines?) last and it hasnt really done me wrong yet.",1420114999,"","1420149135",1,995,"AdviceAnimals"

"keystothemoon","","","I work in early childhood education and this happens all the time except I am the one who ends up saying ""Oh that's okay.""  Why?  Because sometimes what the child is doing is actually okay (and maybe the parent is being needlessly overbearing), and sometimes it shows the child that when someone messes up slightly, we should all still accept and forgive that errant behavior.  

Case in point:  Just today I had a puppet.  A little girl wanted to pet the puppet.  Her mom reprimanded her.  I said it was okay.  It actually was okay.  The puppet was out there to be petted by the children and to interact in a whole host of ways with them.  The mom just didn't know the rule.  She was being a bit overbearing and forbidding her child from doing something that we were actually encouraging.  No big deal.  But the ""That's okay"" is totally appropriate.  

Another case in point: the child actually is executing a social faux pas.  You point it out and someone says, ""That's okay.""  This person isn't undermining your parenting.  He is teaching the child an even deeper lesson.  He is modeling tolerance.  You are teaching the child to behave by society's norms and the stranger is teaching your child to be tolerant when someone doesn't behave by society's norms.  You are teaching your child proper expectations and the stranger is teaching your child compassion.  Both of these are valuable lessons.  ",1424560063,"","False",1,173,"AdviceAnimals"

"baseball_guy","","","I'm pro vaccine, but I don't actually agree with this bill.  
  
The biggest fact that people need to factor into their decision making is to recognize that we do not actually have a wide-spread anti-vaxxer problem of anything like the proportion people tend to believe. The percentage of kids with zero vaccinations is at about 0.7% of the population nationally, and that includes religious and medical exemptions. In truth, the movement of liberal anti-vaxxer soccer-moms that everyone so hates, essentially doesn't exist. 
  
There are lots of *under*-vaccinated kids, but that mostly correlates to poverty. When you see a statistic about this or that school with 20% non-medical exemptions, that's not 20% unvaccinated, that's 20% under-vaccinated, i.e. missing at least one of the vaccinations kids are supposed to have by that grade level. If you look at the [CDC data](http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6334a1.htm), the archetype for the parent of an under-vaccinated kid shouldn't be some wealthy soccer mom... it ought to be some single mother on food stamps.  
  
The bill might force some idiots to vaccinate, but what it will mostly do, statistically, is get poor kids thrown out of school. One might say that's a sum gain of some sort if it improves herd immunity even a little bit, but it really does seem to me more like bowing to hysteria for political points.  
  
But, just for the sake of argument, lat's say that the bill succeed in forcing some parents to get their shit together, and improves vaccination coverage by a few percent. That still has to be weighed against the costs.  
  
We'd be adding a whole new layer of bureaucracy and legislation into medical decision making. At this point, doctors and parents are in charge. The AAP is a reputable organization, but if it were ever corrupted by lobbyists for some big pharma company (Cough! Monsanto FDA), doctors and parents would be forced to adhere. At this point, there are vaccination guidelines which the vast majority of people follow with only occasional variation, but they're only guidelines. Making it strictly regulated introduces a whole new avenue for abuse that we've never had before.  
  
So, the legislation attempts to fix a problem that we don't have (or that would at least be better fixed by improving access to health care), and for the cost of creating the potential for pretty serious consequences if the governing agency in charge were ever to be co-opted by corporate greed. And even beyond that, it would introduce more wasteful bureaucracy to even further distract our school system from attending to the job of teaching.  
  
I mean, I get the idea. Anti-vaxxers are idiots. They are, and if they were 5-6% of the population, I'd absolutely support some sorts of drastic legislation such as this to ensure that we effectively protect against preventable epidemics, but that is simply not the case. There were just enough idiots to put a few on TV for a big ol' media freak out in the tradition of Ebola, and Swine Flu before it, and nowhere near severe enough of an actual movement to justify such drastic legislation. I mean, I can find you somebody who says the moon landing were staged, but that doesn't make it a movement.    
  
If this legislation passes, you can be sure of several things.  
1)School money will be wasted reviewing paper work.  
2)Doctors will waste more time and money creating paper work.  
3)Parents will buy millions of manila envelopes to transfer around said paper work.  
4)Kids with disorganized parents will be prevented from going to school for having lost/misplaced their paper work.  
5)There will be a new dangerous potential for government corruption.  
6)It is possible that some minuscule number of idiots will get vaccinated who otherwise wouldn't have... although they could just go to private schools or home school instead.  
  
Actually, as long as this rant is on a trajectory of degrading into this level of disorganized free association, I may as well point out that, if someone were stupid enough to think vaccines were going to harm their children, do you think they'd just change their mind for the luxury of attending public school? Parents don't act that way. They don't just endanger (in their minds) their kids for the sake of education. The real anti-vaxxers this bill is aimed at would be exactly the sort or people who would be crazy enough to pull their kids out of school to avoid this legislation. It is sure to *only* miss the target, entirely. The only people who really need this law would dodge it, leaving only the poor to endure the additional complications of attempting to navigate the additional bureaucracy this bill would create.  
  
And finally, the thing that gets me the most about all this is Pertussis. It's on the rise... 70,000 cases over the past two years. It kills babies. It's a real epidemic that's re-surging to dangerous levels. The culprit? [The vaccine wears off faster than expected](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-whooping-cough-vaccines-are-wearing-off/)  
  
So, after all of this, the most important thing we could do to improve vaccine coverage would be to require vaccinated adults to get their pertussis boosters. Maybe we could make it a requirement to renew your driver's license? How many would applaud *that* legislation that actually requires personal responsibility rather than just scapegoating a lunatic fringe at the expense of the poor?  
  
Yeah, anti-vaxxers are dumb, but that does not mean we need a dumb bill to take an inefficient effort to correcting a minor aspect of an exaggerated problem. ",1429787857,"","1429789412",1,39,"AdviceAnimals"

- If you are over 35 any beer, bottled or not, is for thirst or taste. Just a couple. If you get buzzed on beer, you're gonna regret it. Wine is swiftly moving into this category as well. Be advised.

- Once you are over 40, liquor is your best friend. Tap your inner Don Draper and embrace cocktails. Some extra water and an Aleve or two before bed will find you bright-eyed and bushy-tailed come morning.

"Reddiculouss","","","Being sexist doesn't mean you hate women or are mean to them, it just means your internal perception (however intentional or not) of women is less than men. If do have these thoughts, you really are sexist, but it doesn't mean you're an asshole. You might be a genuinely nice person to men and women, but the fact of the matter is that the way you've been raised, the people you've surrounded yourself with, and generally the experiences you've had has affected the way you view women. If you really *don't* want to be sexist, it's important to make sure you're informed about women; if you find you're immediately dismissing a news article about a woman because of an internal sexist thought, challenge yourself to go ahead and read the article and give the person a chance. Overall, stop the thoughts when you have them, and ask yourself the question why it is you have that thought and give people the benefit of the doubt in your thoughts. Actively doing this in your thoughts will have a bigger effect than you think.

When I look at my facebook/twitter feed I see people on each side of the political spectrum totally getting bogged down and losing sight of the issues and/or conflating the issues all together. 

I see people on the conservative end going on and on about ""thugs"" and making statements like ""Oh wow burn down your own neighborhood real fucking smart."" They focus only on the looting and not the global scale. Hey guys, didn't you see the video a week ago of a dude getting shot in the back 8 times as he casually walked away from a cop? Have you not noticed the pattern of police brutality that has gone on and on and now with video is even more glaring and ridiculous? Stop focusing on just what you want to focus on and admit there is a bigger picture!!

Then I see my far left friends who put up article after commentary after news clip about the police brutality and about privelage and about how there are really only a ""tiny percentage of looters"" and how it's all about the media portrayal. And I'm thinking yes these are all issues but don't deny the decay of inner city culture (across all races) and how poorly these folks respond to a lot of things (from disobeying and arguing/fighting with cops in the first place to looting and rioting). These people aren't all angels who are being picked on. They certainly have reason to have issues with police but if you all stay home and don't start burning shit down you'll have much less of a police problem I promise you. Either way, again the folks on the left also focus on one part of the issue that THEY WANT to focus on and ignore the whole picture. 

We're human beings. We're intelligent. Why the hell can't we all be honest about the immensity of these issues and actually discuss them all without defending our politics by focusing on one corner of the argument? It doesn't make sense.

You talk in some of your responses to other comments here about that ""look of disappointment"", and I know that face quite well. I might be packing a little more than you downstairs, but I'm overweight on top of that, so that REALLY doesn't help. I absolutely hate that face that a woman can give you and am very, very glad that I will - hopefully - never have to see it again. 

I did the same thing you're doing. For years I just didn't pursue relationships or even anything casual because I didn't want to have to try and fight past things that I can't change. I spent years following the advice in this thread - good with my hands, good with my mouth, impressive (especially for a fat dude) in my stamina even. Really nothing matters or helps - not even trying to be sneaky and taking your pants off while you're going down, getting the condom on, then just inserting sight-unseen. The problem is primarily, it's true, in your head - but it's *not* a fabrication of your mind. It's how your head is reacting to their reactions. And there is literally nothing you can do to control that, and there is no amount of positive thinking that will make that ""face"" they get not be hurtful and disheartening to you. 

Depressed yet? Here's the good news! Just keep doing what you're doing. Most people will say buck up, keep trying, stay positive, ""we support you!"", etc. Fuck all that. Do exactly what you're doing. Pursue nothing. Get comfortable - or as comfortable as you can - with the idea that you're sexual life is over. Get comfortable with the fact that, yeah, that might mean you'll end up being a bachelor forever and that you'll ""die alone"" or whatever. Keep doing that - keep letting it become more and more okay that you've made this choice consciously and for your best interests. Why? Because then, out of friggin' NO WHERE, you'll find this random chick who totally just *digs you*. She's into you completely, and because you're actively trying to be a non-sexual creature, it will have *absolutely nothing to do with sex*. She's just totally into you. 

This happened to me, and it can happen to you. My girlfriend is AMAZING. She has only been with one guy previously, and we've talked about it at this point. Dude was evidently hung like a damn elephant. She hated it, and I actually believe her. She's totally happy with what I've got going on, and she's downright THRILLED with the skills I've developed trying to compensate. 

Of course, maybe that won't happen. But will that matter? If you're already willing to give up on sex/relationships, and you stick to that and work to focus on making your life happy without those things... won't life still be happy? That's always the way I looked at it, anyway. 

Take the time, OP. Get okay with yourself. Don't live by other peoples expectations or their standards even. Be by yourself for a while, focus on things that make you happy. Jerk off... just constantly, because you will. It's fine. You are no less of a person for choosing to ""give up"" on sex and relationships. It's valid. You're valid. And someone is bound to recognize that... once you do.

"djc6535","","","I am a former fat person at the Gym. Went from size 52 to 32.  No I did not get made fun of.  Not even once.

I *was* painfully self conscious though.  Try to understand the mindset of a fat person in the gym:  We know everything we are doing looks pretty pathetic.  It is also an admission to you and everybody around us that we are fat (which is a surprisingly tough leap for a fat person to make:  A typical defense mechanism is to self deny).  We are also *used* to people making fun of us.  All the time.  So going to the gym for the first few times is us at one of our most vulnerable states.  We feel naked.  Especially around others who are examples of peak fitness who make what we are struggling at look so easy.

*Any* attention we receive (even if it's just perceived) *feels* like judgement and derision because judgement and derision is what we expect and are kind of doing to ourselves anyway.

That's not your problem.  It's ours to get over.  Truth is no one ever said anything to me or about me.  Why? Because they are normal people going about their day who don't give a fuck about what I'm doing (unless I'm hogging their machine).

"zzzombiezzz","","","If anyone came in here looking for an actual honest review/explanation of hulu, i'll give it to you.

For each basic half hour show there are usually 3 unskippable commercials that are either 15 or 30 seconds long. One at the beginning and 2 during the show. I think the length of the commercials varies based on the popularity of the show, but this is the most common format. A lot of the time, the commercials are hulu advertising other shows on hulu. So that's how the commercials work. 

It has new episodes of shows the day after they air on tv and it seems like they only have the most recent season of most shows. I think whatever hulu doesnt have is what netflix has. Its like they share licensing between new and old seasons and when it leaves hulu it goes to netflix. (I have netflix and hulu both.)

It has a HUGE archive of anime. I love anime so its really a plus for me. Subbed and dubbed both for most shows. Dubbed is usually lagging behind subbed but i dont think thats something hulu controls.

Movies. Let me tell you about the movie selection. It is shit. You will never, ever, in your wildest dreams find a movie on hulu worth watching. Never. OK maybe an anime movie. But you will never even browse the movie section because it is so bad.

There is a spanish section for spanish shows. I know basically nothing about that other than it exists.

It has a movie trailers section for... if you like watching movie trailers i guess. idk.

"JBlitzen","","","Some of the Fedoras in here are saying that you shouldn't help out in an accident without being a doctor or otherwise being licensed and specially trained.

**They're wrong**.

Doing nothing isn't noble, it's pathetic.

First off, if you're really that concerned about hurting someone, the American Red Cross runs constant classes all over the country on basic first aid and CPR.  They're short, inexpensive, and always filled, because quite a few jobs require them, like lifeguards and babysitting and coaching.

Secondly, even without that basic knowledge, about the only way you can make the situation worse is if you move someone's spine around, or mess with an open wound or fracture and open it more or fracture it more, both of which would take a pretty conscious and stupid action, barring good reasons like an obvious fire or drowning risk.

Third, here are ways you might have to help, which won't hurt anything:

1. Applying pressure to a bleeding wound.

2. Directing traffic safely around or away from the accident to prevent additional accidents.  Flares and other signals can help, or do it yourself or grab other bystanders and have them do it.

3. Checking on the other occupants for the driver, like children and pets.

4. Talking with the victims and offering comfort and hope, in part because it's important, and in part because it can reduce physiological symptoms of shock.  This includes distracting scared and crying babies with toys or jangly keys or whatever.

5. Providing a blanket or coat or umbrella or water or food or other immediate needs, like if if the weather isn't perfect.

6. Witnessing comments and actions that may help later on, like if one driver runs off before the police arrive.  You could provide them with a description of him or her.  And if you witnessed the accident itself you should always speak up.

7. Helping a victim get unstuck from the wreckage if it's a danger to them.

8. Performing CPR if a victim isn't breathing.

9. Organizing other response efforts like making sure someone has called 911 and that people are helping direct traffic and prevent additional accidents and that nobody has better medical training than you.

10. Calling a victim's family or employer or something for them, if they're busy.

Etc.

**NOBODY** in this thread should be telling bystanders to stay away from an accident or to do nothing beyond calling for help.

If nobody's doing it, and it has to be done, then it's your job to get it done.

"shakethatbearr","","","I supervise a before and after school program for elementary aged kids. I've been getting complaints over the past few months that one of the children (we'll call him Luke) was bullying some of the other children and making them cry. He's in third grade; the other children were all kindergartners (that doesn't look like it's spelled right, but google says otherwise). I think the issue was that Luke and all of his friends are very sarcastic with one another, sometimes even abrasive and kind of mean. I can sympathize, I do the same thing with all of my friends. But the kindergartners were taking all of his comments at face value and I'd have a child sobbing hysterically that I then had to calm down and talk to.

I talked to Luke a few times before going to his dad. Luke made an effort to be nicer after these talks but it never lasted longer than a week or two. His father's a single parent (and a doctor, to boot, he always looks exhausted)  so I felt bad asking him to stay after the program but it was necessary. I've had similar talks with parents over the years and they've never resulted in anything but ""I'll talk to them when we get home"" and then nothing changes. Dad says he'll talk to Luke and I write it off.

Dad goes above and beyond, coming to talk with me the next day. He goes through the talk he had with Luke the night before and asks to be kept informed of how he behaves going forward. Then he sets up a meeting with me and Luke, and then with the other children and their parents. All of the other parents were impressed by the lengths he was going to do right by their kids (and his own). The meetings were really productive and it made a noticeable difference in the kindergartner's moods afterwards.

At first I was kind of annoyed (because of all the time I had to spend out of work that I wasn't getting paid for) but then I realized I was being a hypocrite. I complain all the time about parents who don't care enough and here was this guy who was making an insane amount of effort to get his son to change his behavior. It was the least I could do to spend a couple of hours outside of work mediating.

Luke's behavior has changed DRASTICALLY and now all the kids are friendly enough that they are having playdates outside of the program. One of the kindergartners even invited Luke to his upcoming birthday party. One of the others thanked me for talking to luke and ""now it's like he's a different person"".

Anyone who works with children can attest that dealing with parents is a nightmare sometimes, and I just wanted to give this dad some internet props for being a good father.

At the end of the day, he and I were the last to leave. He stopped me on the way to the car, and I thought he was going to let me have it. He told me a joke:

&gt;A farmer goes out one day and buys a brand new stud rooster for his chicken coop. The rooster struts over to the old rooster and says, 'OK, old fart, time to retire.'

&gt;The old rooster replies,' come on, you can't handle ALL these chickens. Look what it's done to me. Can't you just let me have the two old hens over in the corner?'

&gt;The young rooster says, 'Beat it! You're washed up and I'm taking over.' The old rooster says 'I'll tell you what, young stud, I'll race you around the farmhouse. Whoever wins gets exclusive domain over the entire chicken coop.'

&gt;The young rooster laughs, 'You know you don't stand a chance old man, so just to be fair, I'll give you a head start. 'The old rooster takes off running. About 15 seconds later the young rooster takes off after him. They round the front of the farmhouse and the young rooster has closed the gap.

&gt;He's already about 5 inches behind the old rooster and gaining fast. The farmer, meanwhile, is sitting on the front porch when he sees the roosters running by. He grabs up his shotgun and BOOM!, he blows the young rooster to bits.

&gt;The farmer sadly shakes his head, 'Damn,...third gay rooster I bought this month.'

He was a great supervisor, and he always had my respect after that. I also learned not to fuck with people that have more experience in this world than I do.

Edit: He totally called me a bundle of rooster sticks and issued a veiled threat. I respected his tact though. If he had done it in front of the whole crew the scenario would have played out differently. You don't have to like your co-workers but maybe you should respect their experience because not all experience is earned on the job.

Edit2: Some people missing the point: Dont fuck with people who have experience. The old rooster could be the younger more tenured employee. It could also just as easily be the older, newer employee messing with the younger less experienced employee. I dont care how well you know your copy machine, young buck.

"Lumos_de_Fortuno","","","So this is meant to be reassuring, but when you first read it I'm just going to sound like an asshole, my apologies.  You don't get into art to ""make it"", not really.  If you'd really wanted to be rich, there are plenty of nearly guaranteed paths to wealth (dentist, plastic surgeon, hedge fund manager, international drug dealer, etc.).  If you'd really wanted to be famous there are loads of jobs that will make you famous (porn, reality tv, etc.).  If you'd really wanted to be respected and well admired, there are tons of jobs that guarantee that (missionary/priest, social worker, dedicated teacher, civil rights attorney, nonprofit organizer, etc.)

Now I don't know your personal reason for making art, but mine are that I want to make the world a more beautiful place to live in and I want to change the way the people who look at my work see the world.  Would being rich and admired rock? Totally! Famous? Fuck no I'd hate that.  I'm an artist because I want to make art and I feel dead inside when I'm not making it (like right now, because of shit living arrangements).  

So Forbes had an amazing article about what it takes to make a living as an artist without essentially winning the lottery, and I have to say I really agreed with the article.  Now I can't remember everything they said but the one thing I agree with the most (their most important thing), it stuck with me because I realized that it was 100% true of all the artists I know who make a living from their work.  The number 1 thing to do if you want to make a living as an artist is to own your own brick and mortar gallery that shows your work, that you sell work out of.  To begin with, the key to selling a piece is exposure, if enough people see your work, eventually someone is going to want to buy it.  Even the woman who was the first person to get kicked off work of art got enough exposure that she was able to develop a following.  If its just your work, and your gallery is somewhere that people are going to walk by on a regular basis, people will see your work and someone will fall in love with it.  No one is going to see your work if its sitting in your studio.

Secondly, most galleries take between 50-90% of all sales.  If you're able to make ends meet with that 10% price, you'll be able to price work more competitively to sell and be able to keep a larger profit margin.


The third thing, is get as much exposure as possible.  Start a daily blog where you talk about your work and take pictures of what you're working on.  Start a youtube channel about your art, your shows, invite people who love your work to come on an talk about it, whatever.  Post videos of time lapse photography of you doing a painting from start to finish.  Apply to every juried show, residency and grant you possibly can.  TAKE EVERY SINGLE GRANT WRITING CLASS YOU CAN!!!  If you can get an art career manager.  When you've got a show coming up, if you can pull together the scratch, take out a full page ad in the local artsy free weekly. Be sure to have some pieces that will fit on someone's wall and are within you average joe's price range.

I was made redundant 3 years ago today. It was tough deciding what to do (i was in advertising/graphics design) so I started my own business. At the start of the year my best friend left his full time job to come and work with me as a partner. Since then we've hired two more staff and things are looking great. 

Being self-employed can be tough but my advice to anybody thinking about it is if you have drive and ambition and can ride the bad times through - go for it - it's the most rewarding thing you can do away from the grind.

"Mayor_of_Browntown","picard","","Something similar like that happened at my childhood home. My parents were gone at the chicago auto show, my brothers and I were at home eating pizza in the kitchen, I was in Jr High at the time. We all of a sudden heard a large bang coming from the room next door, I thought our breakfront mystically fell over

The breakfront was in the front corner of our house, I was the first to get up and went into the dining room where to my surprise, no broken china. I quickly noticed a grey sedan outside the windows to my left, it was jammed into the corner of our stone foundation. More surprisingly, out the front windows to my right, 15 feet from our porch, was an upright, but obviously rolled, police car with lights flashing.

For some background, we lived on the corner of a main road, only 25 mph through our part, but people seemed to love crashing outside our house, no one however had actually made it up on the lawn passed the sidewalk. Our home was a 3 story victorian built in 1892, the stone foundation on this amazing house was 4-5 feet tall and at least a solid 2 feet thick, as a result, the grey sedan's hood was caved in pretty deep, windshield smashed to hell and doors flung open. They still had to have been going at some speed.

The police car had made a mess of the lawn, smashed up our magnolia tree a little bit, and, as we'd find out later, the front steps to our porch. As we pondered whether to call the police about the police car in our lawn, more cops from the town over started showing up. There was some shouting outside and we open our door and come out on the porch, there's cops shuffling around the grey sedan, as well as the rolled cop car. 

An officer starts heading our way when another shouts ""Get in side and lock your doors! there's one missing!"", my brothers and I follow his instructions. 10 minutes or so passes, more cops, ambulances, yadda yadda, they find this guy dead under our evergreen tree after a while. We started to smell gas during this, and it dawned on us that the gas line was right where the car hit. A fireman checks and tells us to get outta Dodge, my brother grabs Mr. Bo, our dog, and I carry my rather irritated cockatiel's cage, into our coach-house.

It took a while to get the gas shut off, during which our parents came home. Everything generally got cleaned up after, they towed the sedan but left the police car. The next morning the gas hadn't been repaired, it was Monday morning in February and I had to go to school, so I took the shortest, coldest shower in my life. As I left for school it was pretty surprising to me how many shoes were left on my lawn, there was even a child's.

In the end, we found out a guy ran from a simple traffic stop the town over, with his girlfriend and her kid in the car. Suburban cops decide it was smart to go chasing after them going 60+ on residential roads. Our town's bumbling Law&amp;Order: Convenience Store Unit (seriously there's always a cop there) hurried over from the 7-11 2 blocks down to 'intercept', as in t-bone the fleeing vehicle as it passed our intersection. Sending them spinning over our front yard and into our house.

The girl nor the kid died, they were in the back luckily. I remember the weekend after I was mowing the lawn on our riding mower, as this procession of people come out all with air-sprayed t-shirts saying angel and RIP with this guys face on it. They hung around the parkway for an hour or two in circle, then had the audacity to erect this huge 4' by 4' sign to memorialize him right on our front lawn! The man who killed himself and greatly endangered at least 3 others running from the police. The family never even asked us, even though they had seen me mowing the lawn. 

Since we lived on a main road, people, mostly house realtors, were always trying to advertise their shit on our lawn. If anyone asked we actually would've let em, but few if any ever did, so we'd break the sign and toss it in the street for them to find. People would sometimes argue, but they got the message in the end.

We weren't as crass this time, but my father and I tore that shit down as soon as they left. Some family member came back the next day to try and put another one up but my father was not having it. The man tried to argue, not ask, that he could put the sign up, saying it was public way. The man did not know our lawyer father's history with signage on private property.

And that, my friends, is how we got a new free porch.

"brainbanana","","","Who are these people who supposedly get, like, a single nose-full of snot that they can just blow into a tissue, solving the problem for at least a day?

When my nose is running, be it due to allergies or a cold, or whatever...y'know what? It's running. My head is producing snot on a literally continual basis. Sure, I can blow it. But then, literally within 15 seconds, the same amount of snot appears again, to the point that I'm sniffling.

So, really and truly, what the hell is the point of blowing it out into a tissue *literally every 15 seconds*? Sniff-and-swallow is just more sensible **and also less likely to blast pathogens everywhere**.

And don't hit me with ""it's gross to swallow your own snot."" Maybe it is, but there isn't jack that anybody can do about it. The way the nasopharynx is set up, at **least** half of the snot your body produces goes straight down your throat, without any opportunity to blow it out your nostrils. Look at the pictures on wikipedia, if you don't believe me.

So, again, why should anybody blow their nose? I think it's a useless affectation that worsens contagion, wastes paper, and irritates noses.

EDIT: and if you're talking about sniffling noises being distracting? Ummmm...the sound of people blowing their noses is INFINITELY MORE DISTRACTING, AND YOU KNOW IT. You know damn well, every time you've been taking a test and somebody actually *did* blow their nose, you did not just carry on doing what you were doing, without noticing. It totally interrupted your train of thought in a way that quiet, low-key sniffling sounds never could.

There is a fundamental difference between the two. The peace officer is all about context. He's the kind of guy who makes judgement calls; the law is a tool he uses in order to keep the peace and ensure the safety of the public. The law enforcement officer lives in a world that is black and white. He does not work to protect the public, he works to uphold the law, regardless of the situation. The law enforcement officer doesn't necessarily see the community as an ally but rather as an enemy that can threaten the rule of law.

"Aarondhp24","","","My Step-Father was married to his wife, Susan for 26 years. They were madly in love, and had 4 children. About 6 years ago, she was diagnosed with, and died suddenly from breast cancer. My Step-Father started dating quickly, simply because he didn't know how to live alone.

My Mother was the opposite. She had many relationships that never panned out, and was very close to giving up on love altogether. But they met on eHarmony. They fell in love. They got married.

Why am I telling you this? My Mother *knows* she isn't the love of her husbands life. She has come into his world, near the end. He has had his children. She has had hers. We're all grown up.

So she tells him very early on: ""If you want to feel sad, or just cry for Susan, that's ok with me. You never have to hide that you will always love her more than me.""

It's such a bittersweet thing. My Mother needed this man to come around when he did, but that meant his late wife had to pass away when she did. And Mark had to be the kind of man who would allow himself to look for love again.

They are the happiest people I have ever seen. My Step-Father is also the only man my mother ever dated I would call ""Dad"". I'm about to turn 28 haha.

The point is, you can feel sad and miss her. That won't stop you from loving someone else, or get in the way of a new love. You never fell out of love with your wife, she simply left this world, still madly in love with you. 

That kind of love doesn't have the opportunity to die. It can't end. You will always love her, and her you. You aren't crazy for calling out her name. Nothing that was her has left this planet. All her energy, all her warmth, and all her cells. They remain. They have changed form, but they are not gone.

We may never understand what comes after death, but your wife forever changed the way your brain will function till the day you die. Her mark is forever left on the world, in you. Carry that light with you, and be sad if you feel like it. Just don't let it burden you. 

True love is boundless by time or death. You must carry on for her.

Edit: Many kind words and personal stories of loss have been shared, and I feel truly humbled. Give OP, and those that shared, your love, your thoughts, your prayers, and your support. ",1427945831,"","1427963004",2,759,"AdviceAnimals"

"earthboy17","","","I'm a pastor. Let me know if I can help.

Fwiw, I also struggle with trusting God... Trusting that he'll do what I want him to do.  We see prayers answered, and we see prayers unanswered.  We see a lot of pain and a lot of sorrow.  I've lost an infant.  In the midst of it it is hard to have perspective and to see the goodness of it all.

But when we zoom out and see our lives in perspective, we see the basis for trust in his goodness.

I had a terminal disease called ""sin"" and I was healed of it. I came into this world with nothing, and I'll leave with nothing. But since I gained Christ, I come out ahead.  That promise, and Gods enduring faithfulness, is reason for trust.  Everything else good is gravy on top, and everything else bad is bearable in perspective.


I won't be sucked into arguing things on this post, but OP if you want to talk, send me a message and we'll connect.
God bless.

"daelin9000","","","Fucking excellent job dude, keep doing what you're doing. So long as you're not in debt or letting the debt you're in get worse, any money in the bank is good money. I'm 28 and just had to dump my personal savings on car repairs, but it felt great to handle it on my own and not have to worry about how I'm gonna pay for it, or having to involve my SO. Keep on with it, and never forget how it feels.

It's easy to look at other people and feel like everyone has something figured out about money that you don't, but it's just not true. With so many people living paycheck to paycheck, having any money to yourself, let alone enough to survive (without accruing debt) something like your car breaking down can be a huge victory.
