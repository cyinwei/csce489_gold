Well, we can measure that, using the Doppler shift of their engine sounds!

First of all we need to get the audio, and present it properly: Time vs frequency, as seen [here](http://i.imgur.com/hftOYJW.png). Those big blobs of noise are cars going by. Kinda messy, but if we look at the right range, we can pick out particular sounds.

[Magnify, enhance and so on](http://i.imgur.com/YQibQK4.png). Those lines shifting down in frequency is the Doppler shift, caused by the source of the sound accelerating relative to the observer. It'll shift *down* as it gets closer, and then *down again* as it begins to move away. As it gets further away, the velocity relative to the observer will tend towards a constant value (discounting the fact that the track isn't straight, including that detail would make this calculation very complicated). Anyway, by looking at the change in frequency, we can estimate the velocity of the source. I picked out two instances where there seems to be a clear line, and with a bit of calculation...

vs - (vs * 0.315/0.574) = 153.41m/s

Where vs is the speed of sound: 340m/s. Now, this value is *the total change in velocity* relative to the observer, and since the car is moving closer, and then moving away, that change is going to be double the average speed of the car.

153.41/2 = 76.71m/s = **171.6mph**

And we can do this for the other instance I picked out, too:

vs - (vs * 0.308/0.515) = 136.66m/s

136.66/2 = 68.33m/s = **152.8mph**

So it's a bit *inconsistent*. Our main limitation here is that the cars don't emit clear, noise-free sound. It also doesn't help when there are multiple cars whizzing by one after another in close proximity. I think we're roughly in the ballpark though; some further enhancing might help matters: [More enhancing](http://i.imgur.com/QPT9Dp3.png).

That one is a bit clearer. The same calculation as before with this one yields the result **172.4mph**.

Science, bitch.

But 9/11 was not a big deal in terms of human lives, at worst it was a big deal in financial terms.

EDIT 2: Some commentors seem to be under the impression that I'm advocating for men to face-stomp women if they're assaulted (or any combination of genders in the fight). Not the case. As I've said above, ideally, no one should be causing anyone physical harm in the first place. Even after being hit, in an ideal world, the situation would be defused without escalation. However, that's not how things tend to work, so one should not be expecting special treatment in a fight for any reason, and thus should not be surprised when a punch or slap is met with a similar strike, regardless of gender, size, or most other factors.

If nothing else, look at it from an education standpoint. I would be doing my future daughter a massive disservice (and would be potentially putting her in dangerous situations) if I told her that she could strike a man and expect him to just take it because ""men shouldn't hit women."" As Whoopi has pointed out, if she hits a man (or anyone else, for that matter), she shouldn't be standing there aghast if a fist comes back at her.

The history of leftist political thought in the last fifty years is the history of a particular social class trying to barter their way out from under the guillotine - ""Hey, if we pretend it's actually about race and gender instead of class, we can call ourselves 'allies' and maybe they won't notice that we're going on about *The Struggle* from our million dollar homes!"" Corruption and evil is not skin-deep, Suey. Every oppressor I have had in my entire life has had one thing in common - a fat bank account. White men, black women, doesn't matter - wealth, and wealth alone, is the means to social power, and unlike someone's *goddamn skin color, you fucking bigot,* the mere possession of wealth in the United States can cause harm to others (for instance, my brother-in-law is a security guard at a phenomenally wealthy residential area. A ""suspicious vehicle"" warrants an immediate response of four police cars. In the very same town, I was walking the dog at 3am when I heard four gunshots, a woman screaming, another gunshot, and silence. I ran home, called the police, and three hours later, a single patrol car shows up, shines their spotlight around, and leaves. The bodies weren't discovered until a day later. This was in the poorest neighborhood in the county.)

If the social order inevitably revolves, all your ""hard work"" on twitter won't ingratiate you to the proletariat.

1. It's legal to enter an intersection when the light is yellow in Georgia (where OP lives). [Here's the proof](http://www.drivinglaws.org/resources/traffic-tickets/moving-violations/running-red-lights-and-stop--8).

2. Federal legislation doesn't mandate a specific time for how long lights should stay yellow, but everywhere I looked, the absolute minimum was 3 seconds. Nothing less was acceptable and Chicago was sued for being under that. See [Question 19](http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/knowledge/faqs/faq_part4.htm) for more details.

3. At a little past 10 seconds into the video, the light changes to yellow. OP enters the intersection and t-bones the woman at exactly :14, roughly 3.5 seconds after the light changed to yellow.

4. There is a 1.3-second (minimum) pause between the time one direction goes red and the other side changes to green at 30mph ([Look at chart 5-11 of the Federal guidelines](http://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/fhwahop08024/chapter5.htm#5.3)).

5. Based on when OP's light turned yellow, the other driver would not have been able to legally be where she was (3-seconds yellow + 1.3 seconds transition = 4.3 seconds) and she was traveling at full speed). Her light *couldn't* have turned green until OP was already through the intersection.

6. OP was 100% legal and the woman he hit was 100% in the wrong unless the times of the lights were outside of federal and state guidelines.

"Atlante45","","","This has nothing to do with photographic memory, he is using the [~~3OP technique~~](http://homepage.ntlworld.com/angela.hayden/cube/blindfold_frontpage.html) [3-style technique](https://www.speedsolving.com/forum/showthread.php?39409-Noah-s-3-Style-Tutorial).
This is still very impressive though to be able to do it this fast.

If anyone is interested in blindsolving, here is an easier method called [classic Pochman](http://www.stefan-pochmann.info/spocc/blindsolving/3x3/old.php). Anyone that knows how to solve a cube in 2 min and less can do it, it just takes a little bit of commitment.
It took me about 2 weeks and 5 attempts at a full blindsolve to get it right, but don't despair, that feeling of taking the blindfold off and seeing a solved cube is amazing.

EDIT: Some more explanations on what's happening:

Each corner sticker has a letter associated between A and X (same for edge stickers)
At the beginning he is identifying and memorising what is called cycles.

This is the order in which he will solve the pieces. And this order tells him exactly where every piece is and where every piece goes.

Since there are only 20 movable pieces on the cube, this comes down to memorising 20 letters in a certain order.
An easy way to do that is to group them by pair and associate a word to each letter pair.

VT would be Vault, QS would be Quest, OK would be Oak, etc.


So now we have ten words to memorise in order. An easy way to do that is to make up a story.

""To find a mythic Vault, you go on a Quest that will lead you to a big golden Oak"" the craziest the story, the easier it is to remember.

Then once the blindfold is on, we tell the story back for each key word extract the letters and each letters correspond to a specific algorithm to execute.

Once at the end of the story, the cube should be solved if everything goes according to plan.

This is greatly simplified but it is basically how this goes.

"Mangekyo11","","","He is actually an alien that is in fact made of water, who takes over human beings by sneaking inside while they're on the toilet. They have and will do this until the promised day, when they will rise^up like a great tidal wave from the world's oceans, the place where they have been patiently waiting for ages. Watching, always watching(ever wonder why there's more water than land on our planet? Wasn't always that way!). On that day, the great one will rise from his slumber, deep down in the dark, his sunken citadel.. The old one has been gathering his power, biding his time until the day he can slither his way above the surface and take this planet for his own. These water beings have, since before the dawn of written history, taken over portions of the population. Using their meat suits as the perfect disguise to sow discontent and chaos throughout the globe, weakening the already tenuous grasp that human kind have on mother earth... or as they will call it, *Splish Splash*.  Unfortunately not all of them have the ability to pass for true humans and this is a good example. Although we totally just thought he was tripping out so we messed up the one chance we had at figuring out their horrid machinations before it was too late. As you read this, I am traveling to witness the rebirth of our new Master.... I give you just this one small, fleeting hope, a tiny hint to help you try and survive in the terrible eons to come...

"Ajones0473","","","My little brother, David, had EB. He had EB recessive dystrophic, inside and out. He passed away at 16 weighing 36 lbs. I cannot express to you how tragic this disease is. Not only the constant pain but how it keeps you isolated. David was wrapped from his neck down in white gauze. If he had a bad infection, you could smell it. If he had an open site on his neck, you could see it. EVERY time you leave the house, you get stared at. People pull their kids back when you walk by. They ask your parents if it contagious. It is dehumanizing. He was the loneliest person I've ever known. 
 Not only was his life hard but his death was heartbreaking. The amount of suffering he endured during his life and death (especially his death) broke something in me that I don't know will ever be fixed or soothed. 
 I just want to say, if this video has moved you, do something. Spread the word about this disease. Volunteer time. DONATE MONEY. Whatever, just don't move on to another video, to another day without doing something.

Edit: Thank you to everyone for some of kindest words I've ever been on the receiving end of. 
Talking about David has always been so painful that I shy away from it. I cannot tell you how good this has felt to tell you all about him and about my journey as his sister. And to EVERYONE that was donated because of this....I can never thank you enough. It has been a very humbling experience. I think I needed this more than I would have ever known.

It was my first day and I was tasked with handling the equipment, and being an idiot, I never took it quite seriously mainly because it is not the kind of thing that you typically hear about, granted it was not the kind of thing I would have thought to happen. It was then I realized how sensitive triggers can be. Before I knew it, I grabbed the gear with my finger on the trigger, not knowing how sensitive it was, only to have shot a customer in the face. Never have I been so terrified at that moment in time.

1. The key condition is to get a camera that is able to make its output to the TV in negative colors. That way when the camera sees the negitive on the screen, it negates that back to regular. 

2. The other condition is to have a camera that can mirror it's output. So when the camera sees it's own mirrored output, it magnifies the effect making much more vivid and long lasting fractal patterns. 

[THIS VIDEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulPmf6ZPPwI&amp;list=FL_Dq1v9jmEdHUtTbRXoJ2tg&amp;index=6) shows the best example of all 3 of the conditions.

"[deleted]","","","The only reason you guys are supporting this shit is because they are black.

It is a black kid getting slapped around by his own father, so you guys really don't give a shit. You are not seeing the broken heart of a son, you are seeing a potential future gang member being set straight. Just because something makes sense doesn't mean its the truth.

If his father showed his son love and had frequent positive communication in the first place he would not have to slap him to keep him out of a gang in the first place.

This kid is not a psychopath or he would have hit back, its as clear as daylight he is joining a gang for acceptance, something he wouldn't have to do if his father had more compassionate channels of  communication.

 He might not join a gang, but he will not grow up to be a very loving person after this

Take a good look at your comments. *""Father of the Year""?* Really? Do you really have such a low perception of black people that this is considered the prime example of a father?

"Cloudy_mood","","","I'm a server in a fine dining restaurant in the US. I also like to eat at restaurants as well. At the place I work at, we receive a little info sheet about your past, or favorite drinks or dishes or if it's your birthday. I read every single guest to see if they like a server to be present or if you want to eat and get the hell out of there. 

I'll recommend the best cocktails, wine, or sodas- whatever you like to drink. If you're not sure, I'll give you a few choices. You like red wine, but want fish? I'm not going to judge you, you're paying the money- so I'll start talking about reds. 

I'll tell you where the specials are, I'll point out the popular dishes based on what kind of food you like(maybe determine it by what you chose to drink), I'll explain them in detail and make them sound appetizing. There are one or two dishes that are underwhelming-so I'll steer you away from those without making them sound bad. 

I'll have a nervous breakdown if your apps, salads and entrees don't come out on time. Not in front of you, but if your items aren't getting to you when they should- I'll most likely take that item off your bill. Your water will never be lower than half. My server assistant and I will make sure of that. I'll always politely ask if you want another cocktail, and get it to you in record time. I make sure each course is perfect- if not, we fix it for you immediately. Birthdays and anniversaries are handled above and beyond(no, we don't sing or clap- we do something else but I don't want to say because I signed a contract I won't talk about my particular store on social media), and if you're cool- I'll have my manager take care of your dessert. I invite you to come back to the restaurant, because you're keeping the place open. I work at 100 percent energy to make sure you will never forget your experience at my place and because of the incentive of a 20% tip. 

I've never experienced what I do anywhere else. I've had great servers- but no one who goes out of their way like myself and the other servers that I work with. We are a well oiled machine. 

Because I work in a big city, I've waited on every nationality.  I wait on a lot of people who bring their culture with them and screw my night with some made up tiny tip because they don't tip in their country. (By the way- if I'm ever lucky enough to visit your fine country, you can bet your ascot I'll do my research and learn what the proper etiquette is at a nice restaurant.)

 I wait on a lot of rich people, and I've waited on people that can't afford to eat where I work. I've waited on celebs. Everybody. And regardless of class- and even what they tip- 98% people I wait on know how good they were just taken cared of. My staff and I deserve 20% because the attention you get is ridiculous. We don't always get it, and it's always a shock because our restaurant is designed to go above and beyond. That doesn't change my attitude, because everyone is spending money, and everyone deserves the best experience. Not every tip is 20%, and I don't lose my mind over it, tips just vary- as long as I'm paying bills- I'm happy. 

I work my ass off to make good money so I can support myself and my son. I'm a single dad(no Chris Rock, I don't need a medal).  I'm yelled at by ignorant people, I wait on con artists, people who call and lie so they can get things for free- people who don't tip anything, but the truth is every job is hard and there's always down sides. But I work at my restaurant because it's the best. 

If you take tipping away, we'll all have to find something else to do, but you will most likely not get your drink on time, you'll get your food however it comes out and it certainly won't be comped if it's wrong. You will get special spiels like--(We have salmon and Mahi Mahi tonight served with...rice...and it's 25.95...ready to order?) instead of the protein, starch, veg, and sauce description. Why is this dish good? What makes it unique?  Servers who don't know or care anything about the food or drinks(one server at a really nice place I went to didn't know what a vodka Gimlet was; I certainly didn't judge him but was surprised), and you'll basically be waited on by someone who doesn't give a shit. 

The funny thing is, most people *want* great service, and that attention to detail. I've waited on SO many families that you can tell they're dying for a good drink and a dinner they didn't/or don't know how to cook at home. But if the initiative is taken away, you're going to get half assed service and be more stressed than when your boss is yelling at you while you're at work. So take tipping away, and be prepared for an eye opener. 

**TL;DR** Take tipping away, fine- we'll have to find different jobs. But you'll have the service equivalent of Walmart at your favorite restaurant.

"featherrocketship","","","There is a lot of worthwhile info in this video, and I appreciate that it exists and has been posted here. My only concern is that it's easy to misconstrue this video as an argument that sexist practices don't exist when it comes to the job market. Yes, wage gap statistics are misleading, and we ought to know what we're actually referring to when we talk about this thing, rather than assuming that women in the same jobs as men, at the same level, with the same amount of experience, etc. etc. get paid ~70% what their male counterparts do (sometimes this happens, but if Maddox has reviewed the information accurately, the frequency of this kind of pay discrepancy is not as common as the statistics have been used to suggest).

At the same time, this video admits that part of the discrepancy comes from differences in gender distribution within factors like occupation, economic sector, and willingness/ability to negotiate salary. It is worth taking a critical eye to the fact that these factors effect so significantly the average salaries of men vs. women. Why are men more likely to have jobs in professions with high average salaries? Why do women feel unwilling or unable to negotiate their salaries more often than men do, on average? Are there cultural factors at work here that operate on a sexist level? Are women are encouraged/incentivized culturally to value and to choose certain professions over others (and men encouraged and incentivized to choose other ones) on average? Are men told that they have to be assertive, upwardly mobile, ambitious, and financially self-sufficient, while women are often taught to emphasize and value being respectful, gracious, grateful, and able to ""balance"" domestic life with their professional life?

I think you can tell that I believe the answers to these questions are ""yes,"" but I don't think there's a ""big sexist conspiracy,"" to use Maddox's phrase, because that would imply these issues exist primarily on the basis of intentionally malicious policies that were *designed* to promote sexism and preserve a gender gap. No doubt *someone* believes there is a big sexist conspiracy of this sort, but I have never met such a person, so using the phrase as a kind of stance against which Maddox set himself up seemed a little bit straw-man-y. It's worth looking critically at these questions not because we need to figure out who is perpetrating such a sexist conspiracy and how to stop them, but because it's important to recognize when our cultural and economic systems are having sexist effects, so that we can work together to improve things for everyone.",1429749458,"","False",1,51,"videos"

"Belletrix","","","This was an excellent video to me. I saw this back when this debacle was playing out in ""real-time."" What jumps out at me, is the fact that Park had her belief structure toppled with a simple challenge to the parameters of her game. SJW's main method of controlling discourse and raising the hackles of a legion of online keyboard warriors is to define the game in their terms, to draw the lines where they want, and to move goalposts when they need to.

Park's downfall was believing that  her online reality, where she has surrounded herself in that echo chamber of insanity, was that the Host would just crumple, and give in to her SJW dogma. While there are certainly structures in society and other issues still dogging this country, she shot herself in the foot with that half-wit comment. 

First of all, don't come onto an interview expecting to be able to quash someone from talking or offering opinions about something. It's this guys job to travel those avenues of thought, to ask those questions, and to probe your arguments for weak spots. And furthermore, you don't ever just tell someone they are disqualified from speaking about something in ANY capacity. There's a difference between saying: ""You don't understand what it's like to be a person of color and a woman."" and ""You aren't allowed to talk about this because you aren't a person of color, or a woman.""

Social Justice is all well and good, and I'm a strong advocate for introducing more equality and understanding into this country, and world at large. However, there is certainly a right and a wrong way to do these sorts of things. And if you can't tell, telling people to be silent, and disregarding them on the basis of their race, their sex, their orientation, their blahblahblah... is the ANTI-THESIS of your movement.

"dashdriver","","","This will probably get buried, however something needs to be set straight here.

The ""dip"" (or roll) of the wings at the end was not an aerodynamic stall. The crew reported they had an engine failure after takeoff, so what you are seeing here is a Vmc roll. Vmc is defined as the minimum controllable airspeed with one engine inoperative. When you go below this speed, you can have the controls at the stops to make the airplane go in one direction  and the airplane will start going the exact opposite way. I should add that with an engine out, you can not let go of the controls and assume it will fly straight. In this case, with the left engine out the crew likely had right aileron in as well as a lot of right rudder. The slower you go, the more control deflection you need to keep the airplane going straight with one engine inoperative, and vice versa. Vmc is point (speed) at which the controls are fully deflected (in this case to the right) and you're going in the opposite direction (left)

The reason it's not a stall is:
A.) with a relatively straight wing like this, the wing is designed to stall at the root of the wing and not the tip (thus not a ""tip stall""). This is for the crew to maintain control throughout the stall, because the ailerons (providing roll control) are located at the tip of the wing. 
B.) even if the left wing tip had stalled, there is still another aileron on the right wing PLUS a roll spoiler. That should have been enough to counteract any rolling tendency associated with a ""tip stall"". 
C.) Some multi-engine airplanes are designed to stall before they enter Vmc (the stall speed is above the Vmc speed). That is only usually the case with small, twin engine trainers in which pilots first get experience flying multi-engine aircraft. Large turboprops don't have this protection (Vmc is higher than the stall speed) because it wouldn't allow the engineers to fulfill the design goals and typically these airplanes are flown by professional crews who should never allow the airplane to get that slow in a one engine inoperative situation.

At my airline, the Vmc speed for my airplane is mentioned maybe once or twice throughout our groundschool before we actually fly the airplane. There's no mention of the speed in our manuals anywhere and I couldn't tell you what that speed is off the top of my head. The reason for this is that we have a speed on takeoff called V2 which is defined as the ""takeoff safety speed"". This is the speed that we fly with an engine failure on takeoff. We are taught to NEVER go below this speed. This is because once you start going below V2, and getting closer to Vmc, it gets exponentially harder to get back to V2. In the bottom half of the range between V2 and Vmc you most likely have to start descending towards the ground to regain airspeed to get back to V2, which goes against all of our natural piloting instincts, as if you're too low, you'll hit the ground before you achieve V2 again.

There's a video on youtube of an airplane vmc rolling and it is very similar in the way the airplane behaves to this accident.

It's just the white version of hip hop, except every now and then a hip hop artist with something to say actually gets popular.

In reality, what people HATE is Bro Country. Bro Country is indefensibly shit. It has little to say, and what it is saying is shitty. It erodes the listener's taste in music. It's the height of vapidity in popular music right now. POP has far more depth than Bro Country right now.

Country on the whole still has plenty of gems, like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NJqUN9TClM). Fantastic lyric writing and perfect musical accompaniment. That's what Country is capable of - Something that feels distinctively American, relatable, and heartfelt.

"SixBiscuit","","","This is actually a wonderful demonstration of the way that certain concepts, videos, etc. are framed and how people respond to that framing. I remember seeing the original video, the subsequent video from the girl who debunked him, and now this video. 

His first video was implying that he'd found some hidden knowledge that had been lost for generations. In his rebuttal video, for the most part, he drops that whole schtick and focuses on being just a normal, reasonable, self-effacing guy. 

Look at the difference in the way he talks about the arrows in hand technique: 

[Just look at this segment from the rebuttal.](https://youtu.be/8iLTA43MBuA?t=2m27s)

[When guns started replacing bows... this technique was forgotten.](https://youtu.be/BEG-ly9tQGk?t=3m41s)

So this rebuttal is a bit of a bait and switch. In the original video it was this overly dramatic voice-over. In this video it's him just speaking. The tone is completely different. 

The other thing is that the original video makes a point to speak about draw pulls and how this stuff can penetrate armor, etc. It's made to give the impression that the entirety of the video can be applied to heavy bows including the arrow catching. The criticism from the skeptical girl is also somewhat misstated. She acknowledges that he's a well practiced trick shooter. 

It's a lot like in reddit comments where someone will come out with a post whose tone is say, abrasive, then when someone responds by taking their points apart one by one the original post responds in a completely pleasant tone asking why the poster is upset, etc. 

He's using tone and framing to deflect the overall criticism into the exact specifics about what he said and not really responding to the completely over the top tone and claims made in the first video. After all, the original video was shared because people enjoy watching truly unique things, especially techniques that were used in the ancient world but are now forgotten. The entire video is framed and presented in a way that tries to show him as recovering techniques, like the arrows in draw hand technique, that had been ""forgotten"".

"jecmoore","","","In 2009, a census was done that found that over 1.5 billion Muslims are currently alive today, making it the second largest religion in the world by a large margin. 

Let's say on average there are 2 terrorist attacks per day by Islamic terrorist groups. So 730 per year. That is a highly inflated, and random number, and one could just count up the number of Islamic terrorist attacks listed [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_terrorist_incidents,_2014), but I want to get this over quick. 

Now, let's assume that each terrorist attack is committed by a different group of people, which is completely and utterly false, and each of these groups have roughly ~35000 people in them, which is another completely arbitrary and random number. I'm sure someone could find how many people on average are in the various Islamic terrorists groups, but again. I just want to get this over. 

Now, I'm using completely random, and probably inflated numbers to come to this conclusion except for the amount of Muslims in the world, but that means that 25,550,000 Muslims are involved in terrorists groups yearly, which is a whooping 1.627% of the entirety of the ummah. 

And let's be clear before you say anything. That completely inflated and arbitrary 25.5 million Muslims is just that, completely inflated and arbitrary. It is probably much less that that because (A) there isn't a unique terrorist group for each terrorist attack meaning that there is a ton of crossover in the attacks and (B) there aren't an average of 2 terrorist attacks per day by Islamic terrorist groups. 

But despite this, people love to harp on the less than 2% of the Muslim population that are involved in these travesties. And yes, I understand he isn't just talking about the terrorists, but also Sharia law and things on that side of fence.

"SimpleEmotions","","","If you watch the rest of the videos, this guy is overdramatic about everything, confronts everybody he sees, and something that was a minor issue he blew up into a daily obsession (spreadsheets and all). He shows minor clips in his favor but when you watch every episode, he's actually the one going around harassing everyone, and making problems for everyone involved. He started by yelling at this neighbor for making too much noise at 10 PM on a Friday, seriously 10 PM on Friday. Then, he starts calling the police at 8:01 PM (because the lease technically says to be quiet at 8) for a noise compant in OAKLAND! Then, he's suddenly surprised when they don't take his calls seriously. And when he confronts the property manager, the manager asks him to wait one minute so he can record it too, then throws a hissy fit when the manager isn't fast enough (wasn't even 20-30 seconds). He starts insulting the property manager's mother, then his girlfriend.  He insults two women at the main headquarters when trying to pay rent (who were being extremely nice considering someone just barged in and starts making a huge scene in a quiet office). His whole pattern throughout the videos is everytime the conversation doesn't go exactly his way and people don't do exactly what he tells them to do, he throws a tantrum, flips off the wall, starts insulting anyone and everyone, then wonders why no one involved has any respect for him.
