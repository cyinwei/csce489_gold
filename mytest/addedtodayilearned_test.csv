&gt; **What's bigger: 1/3 pound burgers or 1/4 pound burgers?**
&gt;  
&gt; Do Americans really think 1/4 pound hamburgers are larger than 1/3 pound burgers? Apparently they did in the early 1980s. At least according to the New York Times — and the guy who bought the A&amp;W restaurant chain back in 1982.
&gt; 
&gt; You may have seen this bizarre example of American mathematical ignorance getting passed around lately as a fun fact from ""Why Do Americans Stink at Math?"" by Elizabeth Green:
&gt; 
&gt;One of the most vivid arithmetic failings displayed by Americans occurred in the early 1980s, when the A&amp;W restaurant chain released a new hamburger to rival the McDonald's Quarter Pounder. With a third-pound of beef, the A&amp;W burger had more meat than the Quarter Pounder; in taste tests, customers preferred A&amp;W's burger. And it was less expensive. A lavish A&amp;W television and radio marketing campaign cited these benefits. Yet instead of leaping at the great value, customers snubbed it.
&gt; 
&gt;Only when the company held customer focus groups did it become clear why. The Third Pounder presented the American public with a test in fractions. And we failed. Misunderstanding the value of one-third, customers believed they were being overcharged. Why, they asked the researchers, should they pay the same amount for a third of a pound of meat as they did for a quarter-pound of meat at McDonald's. The ""4"" in ""¼,"" larger than the ""3"" in ""⅓,"" led them astray.
&gt; 
&gt; But is this depressing tale true? I couldn't find it in any marketing textbooks or journals — at least none indexed by Google. But it does appear as an anecdote in the 2007 memoir of real estate tycoon A. Alfred Taubman, who purchased the A&amp;W chain back in the early 1980s.

Beer_is_good_for_you,,,"I am a self confessed lardass that has gone from a chubby teenager to morbidly obese, up to to super fit when I hit twenty (I went from 288lbs at 5ft 8 to 160lbs, then sailed for my county in races, worked out every day and benched more than I weighed comfortably). I went up and down since. I then broke my coccyx and got a herniated disc in my lower spine two years ago, and went from fit, healthy, gym going young man to obese, unfit, twenty-something with somewhat of an alcohol problem and constant pain in my spine and down my left leg.

What I would say from my personal life experience is that weight gain is something that you can't really explain to ""permanently thin people"", or even some fat people that have become thin and now look down upon overweight people. **The mental component for me is 99% of weight loss**. It's really stupidly easy to learn about basic nutrition and exercise, and follow a routine - Google, exercise and low carb are your friends. But the immense battleground is in the mind, and as with my experiences is also overcoming injuries that basically make you feel like an old man.

**I'm not one to defend fat lifestyle choices, or imply that I'm a great role model, or even think I should ""own my new look"" of being 300lbs, unhealthy, unfit, in constant pain and genuinely depressed.

My personal Dudeist philosophy is that we all have within us a Dude, a Walter, and a Donny. The Dude is what really ties the Trinity together. He's the main man and the one we should all aspire to be, even though the Dude himself is not perfect. He's pretty chill and alright, but he lacks motivation and direction. The Walter within us is the rash, emotional person in us, short-fused and suspicious. We should try to limit the amount of Walter we exhibit, though he is not without his positive qualities. He is also bold and loyal. And then there is Donny. The Donny within us is the reserved, quiet type who is content with just going along with it. Donny also has his good and his bad; he's shy and awkward and just not confident, but he's a good listener and humble.

So the Trinity is represented by the three holes in the bowling ball ying-yang. Each of the three has its own counter-part, but they are are together, and without each of them you can't bowl straight.

""he case was delayed on the court's docket when Bright Tunes was placed in receivership. During the interim, Harrison's contract with Klein was terminated in what proved to be a bitter parting of the ways (and another lawsuit involving the Beatles). After Bright's affairs were put in order so as to enable it to continue the case, settlement negotiations between Bright and Harrison resumed.

After much discussion, Harrison's best offer of $148,000 was made in January 1976, a few week's prior to the trial on the issue of whether or not MSL was too similar to HSF. That sum represented 40% of the writer and publisher's royalties earned in the United States by MSL, and further provided that Harrison would retain the copyright for MSL. The attorney for Bright viewed the offer as ""a good one"", but did not accept the offer, but rather raised its demand from 50% of the U.S. royalties to 75% of the worldwide receipts, and surrender of the MSL copyright.

Why did Bright turn down what was viewed as a good offer and make a counter that was so harsh to Harrison? What Harrison didn't know was that Klein had again entered into discussions with Bright Tunes to purchase all of Bright's stock, except at this time, he was not attempting to buy the stock for Harrison, but rather for ABKCO.""

TL;DR:  Harrison's manager scuttled settlement negotiations to benefit himself, so the court ordered him to sell the song to Harrison.

""Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), also known as butylhydroxytoluene, is a lipophilic organic compound, chemically a derivative of phenol, that is useful for its antioxidant properties.""

&gt;Acetaldehyde - Known to cause cancer, toxic to reproduction and development, immunotoxin, non-reproductive organ system toxin, skin, eye and lung irritator

It is one of the most important aldehydes, occurring widely in nature and being produced on a large scale in industry.

""The acute oral toxicity of propylene glycol is very low, and large quantities are required to cause perceptible health damage in humans; propylene glycol is metabolized in the human body into pyruvic acid (a normal part of the glucose-metabolism process, readily converted to energy), acetic acid (handled by ethanol-metabolism), lactic acid (a normal acid generally abundant during digestion),[16] and propionaldehyde (a potentially hazardous substance).""

**[The chemical name was incomplete so it took a while to track down but I'm assuming this is what they are referring to](http://www.cdph.ca.gov/programs/hesis/Documents/nmp.pdf). TL;DR... in large amounts over long periods of time this might cause lasting effects such as... fatigue. It also delayed impregnation in lab rats. So far this is the worst of the bunch... and it makes you ... tired... maybe.**

&gt; Alcohol denatured - Also disclosed in the ingredients of Febreze, it's linked to cancer, 

**Oh come on. This is rubbing alcohol. It's used to clean cuts.**

&gt;Butylphenyl methylpropion al - allergen, immunotoxin and and skin, eyes and lung irritator

**[They almost got this one right... almost.](http://cosmeticsinfo.org/ingredient/butylphenyl-methylpropional) It's a possible allergen in susceptible people. That is all. It's a fragrance enhancer often used in skin lotion.**

&gt;Ethyl acetate - linked to developmental/reproductive toxicity, neurotoxicity, organic system toxicity and and skin, eyes and lung irritator

""Ethyl acetate is used primarily as a solvent and diluent, being favored because of its low cost, low toxicity, and agreeable odor. For example, it is commonly used to clean circuit boards and in some nail varnish removers (acetone and acetonitrile are also used). Coffee beans and tea leaves are decaffeinated with this solvent.[3] It is also used in paints as an activator or hardener.[citation needed] Ethyl acetate is present in confectionery, perfumes, and fruits. In perfumes, it evaporates quickly, leaving only the scent of the perfume on the skin."" 

**Hmm... but is it dangerous? It's basically just a derivative of acetic acid aka vinegar.**

""The LD50 for rats is 5620 mg/kg,[5] indicating low toxicity. Given that the chemical is naturally present in many organisms, there is little risk of toxicity.""

**Oh, okay.**

&gt; Geraniol - Linked to allergies, immunotoxicity, organi system toxicity and and skin, eyes and lung irritation

~~""Gerin oil or geriniol is a fictional drug used as a device to criticize religion in articles written by Richard Dawkins. The word is an anagram of ""religion"".""~~

~~Okay... this is fucking amazing... they claimed that FICTIONAL substance is a known toxin. FIC... TION... AL... SUBSTANCE.~~

Correction: it's just essential oils. Thanks /u/_selfishPersonReborn for tracking down the right link. Sad to see that one go, but don't want to have an incorrect link. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geraniol

&gt;Linalool - allergen, immunotoxin, and and skin, eyes and lung irritator

""Linalool /lɪˈnælɵ.ɒl/ is a naturally occurring terpene alcohol chemical found in many flowers and spice plants with many commercial applications, the majority of which based on its pleasant scent (floral, with a touch of spiciness).""

**Yup... natural substance found in flowers... and they put it in an air freshener. Crazy right?**

&gt;Benzaldehyde - neurotoxin, and skin, eyes and lung irritator

""Benzaldehyde (C6H5CHO) is an organic compound consisting of a benzene ring with a formyl substituent. It is the simplest aromatic aldehyde and one of the most industrially useful. This colorless liquid has a characteristic pleasant almond-like odor. In fact, benzaldehyde is the primary component of bitter almond oil and can be extracted from a number of other natural sources.[2] Benzaldehyde was first extracted from bitter almonds in 1803 by the French pharmacist Martrès.""

**Almond oil. Uh huh.**

&gt; Diethylene glycol monoethyl ether - non-reproductive organ system toxicity

**[Little information quickly available. It appears to be a solvent that can be mildly irritating if sprayed in your eyes.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2-%282-Ethoxyethoxy%29ethanol).**

&gt; Ethylhezanol - developmental and reproductive toxin and skin, eyes and lung irritator

**This is an emollient. Likely used to help combine all the disparate fragrance oils with the volitiles (the smelly stuff with the stuff that makes it vaporize and then goes away).**

""Air exposure of 2-ethylhexanol to a human in a case study involving concentrations between 80 and 470 μg/m3 included throat irritation, cough, sore eyes, headache and blurred vision. Other volatile organic compounds were detected in the air as well, but 2-Ethylhexanol was of the highest concentration.[6] Another study involving several people exposed to 2-Ethylhexanol reported headaches, dizziness, fatigue and gastrointestinal disorders, but the concentration of 2-Ethylhexanol in this case is not known.[6] According to animal studies, 2-Ethylhexanol does not seem to be carcinogenic.""

&gt;Hexyl cinnamal - allergen, immunotoxin and skin, eyes and lung irritator

**This scary sounding chemical name is the essential oil of chamomile. Yeah... the same chamomile they make herbal tea out of.**

MyOldSocks,,,"I am a schizophrenic in America, and can at least confirm that my voices are typically negative. 

While I hear a vast amount of different voices, I have a few with names that have stuck around since day 1. (I don't name them.) 

22 is a male voice. He's my more paranoid one. ""Is this going to kill us? This is going to kill us."" And as of right now... ""This is a bad idea, they're going to know!"" Haha. What a little bitch. And who the fuck goes by 22 anyway? (If I can't laugh at this, it would ruin me. So just accept my humor, reddit!) 

Henry (Whom is also a visual hallucination - I got fucked hard in the brain department) Is my most violent. ""Kill yourself. You are a no good."" - ""See that car, it's going to hit you, cause you are a loser."" - ""I hope you die in your sleep."" 

Then, I have ""the twins."" I named these ones. They are nameless, and mostly voiceless. They don't talk much, and I see them far more than they speak. But they are full of laughter and joy. ""Come play!"" - ""If we found a ball, would you play?"" - ""We like you!"" et cetera. 

I ignore all of this of course, and have been down this path for years now, so hearing them is pretty much having that one annoying friend that never knows when to shut the fuck up.

Xanza,,,"I think you people need a fucking reality check. It's a Google run Science fair. There are absolutely __zero__ rules stating that all work must be absolutely original or new for that matter--as with any science fair. Back in the 1950s, and many times since, many a science fair was won by mixing baking soda with vinegar for a extremely simplistic acid-base chemical reaction.

The thing that should be focused on here is that three extremely young women were insightful enough to experiment with relatively advanced agricultural and biological techniques to yield very interesting results--so much so that they beat other very interesting experiments such as cleaning up oil sands waste, fruit fly robots, wearable sensors for the elderly, and converting breath to speech for the disabled.

But instead of praising these young women for taking an active interest in science and attempting to spread agricultural awareness to __actually help people who are unable to feed themselves__ we're content at debasing their achievement because it's not entirely original work.

You people are really starting to fucking piss me off.

__EDIT:__ A science fair is not about making any form of contribution to science. It's about celebrating science. Any type of science. Including science that's already been done before.

It's basically coming down to you fuckers hating on three little girls for winning a science competition. Yet none of you said anything about the 2014 winner of the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair:

&gt; Using data from publicly available databases, Han examined detailed characteristics of multiple mutations of the BRCA1 tumor suppressor gene in order to “teach” his software to differentiate between mutations that cause disease and those that do not. His tool exhibits an 81 percent accuracy rate and could be used to more accurately identify cancer threats from BRCA1 gene mutations. [1](https://www.societyforscience.org/content/press-room/intel-isef-2014-top-winners)

Oh, look at that! Another science fair winner who's using __preexisting research__ and is applying it to a specific situation. He must have had PhD parents, too, right?

1. **Understand that leaders don't create riots - riots create leaders.** Once your horrible truth has been revealed, the riot will begin organically. Your job is to organize it toward a focused goal.

2. **Start an act of violence.** It takes one act of violence to turn a protest into a full-blown riot. Start a small fire into the Nabasco corporate office. Others will quickly follow your lead.

3. **Justify your actions.** People need to feel like they're doing something right. Remind them what infuriated them through chants and slogans, such as ""Double Stuff? Double Lies!"" to keep the riot from dying down.

4. **Keep the riot focused.** Only Nabasco has lied to us, and only they must pay. Protect stores in the area.

They talk to it every night.  The spirit that supposedly lives in their house is named Dead Ed.  They bring Dead Ed food and water.  It sits on the edge of the board, and periodically the planchette will mysteriously go to it.  The water level never changes, and the food is never gone, but somehow that's Dead Ed imbibing in their glorious feast.

karmavorous,,,"In just a few weeks you'll get to see the first ever detailed images of the dwarf planet [Ceres](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceres_%28dwarf_planet%29). Courtest of the [NASA Dawn Mission.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawn_%28spacecraft%29)

Unlike New Horizons at Pluto which is just a fly-by encounter, Dawn will actually orbit Ceres and study it for at least a year.

Ceres is between Mars and Jupiter.

From studies from ground based telescopes and Hubble, it appears that Ceres has a LOT of water ice. Possibly more ice than there is fresh water on the Earth. Even though it is a fraction the size, it probably has more water than Mars has.

Ceres contains 1/3 of the mass of the Asteroid Belt. It is the largest asteroid. It appears to be large enough that it is round in shape. It also appears from distant observations that surface does not retain impact craters for as long as Mars or Earth's Moon does - possibly indicating that it has ongoing geological processes - although it is probably something more like ice churning than plate tectonics. It could be periodic cryo-volcanism that is stimulated by the planet's somewhat elliptical orbit around the Sun. This *could* mean that during certain times in the Cererean year, the planet has a tenuous atmosphere rich in water vapor.

Ceres definitely isn't just another asteroid. It is more like a little infant Earth, that early in its development was starved for material by Jupiter's gravitational interactions with the asteroid belt. 

In some ways it is more like one of Jupiter or Saturn's moons. But likely very different because the moons of the gas giants are shaped by tidal interactions with their host planets while Ceres has no real tidal interactions with anything. 

Seeing Pluto is going to be cool since many people alive today remember when Pluto was a planet. Ceres was considered a planet too after it was discovered. And it too go the demotion when astronomers started finding more bodies in it's neighborhood (which is the real reason Pluto stopped being considered a planet). Ceres was discovered 200 years ago, so nobody alive today remembers the day it got demoted. 

However, when Pluto get demoted, at the same exact time, Ceres got promoted to the newly adopted category of ""dwarf planet"" where it and Pluto both reside. 2015 is the year of the dwarf planet. We'll get to see our first two, a glimpse of Pluto and a long duration orbital study of the other.

Pluto is not a place humans will probably think or revisiting any time soon. It takes too long to get there. It would be very difficult to set up an orbital mission, much less a lander.

Ceres might be the next best location to send humans after Mars. It takes twice as long to get there, but you have more frequent opportunities to launch or return. The way the orbital resonances work out, if you go to Mars you have to stay for 2 years before you can return. If you go to Ceres, you have to stay for more like 1.3 years before your next opportunity to return.

Ceres has less gravity than the moon or Mars, but it has more gravity than Comet 67P - where you can jump off the surface. You don't have to worry about things floating away on you, but it takes less energy to return to orbit than even the Apollo moon lander had to deal with. This might make it an excellent place to build a shipyard to build interstellar vehicles. Ceres is conventiently close to the raw materials in the asteroid belt.

New Horizons at Pluto is going to be cool.

Dawn at Ceres will probably blow people's minds.

Mars in big in popular culture because we've had good pictures of it for almost 50 years and it always seemed like the next best place for humans to go in the solar system.

We're all about to get a big ole face full of Ceres. It could be a game changer in a lot of ways.

If you want to hear Dawn scientist say the same things I just said and even more amazing things about Dawn and Ceres, the google hangouts on the Dawn Mission's website are great.

http://dawn.jpl.nasa.gov/multimedia/hangouts.asp

Today, dawn is slightly closer to Ceres than the Earth is to the Moon (Ceres quite a bit smaller than the moon though). Dawn is expected to enter orbit in early March, but there will be a few distant photos taken between now and then. The latest is supposed to be released on January 20th and by early February they will probably release at least one image that is better resolution than the Hubble picture from 2004 on the Ceres wiki page.

The TL;DR is that Frank Darabont assembled a great cast and crew (many of whom had worked with Darabont on prior projects) to sell the production of the show to AMC, and was given $3.4 million **each episode** to produce the first season of 6 episodes. However when renewed for a second season, AMC slashed the budget to $2.75 million **per episode** despite ordering 13 episodes, 7 more than the first season, and decided to fire Darabont over disagreements and strained relationship with AMC executives. However, despite having made the decision to fire him weeks prior, they waited until after Darabont promoted the show at Comicon 2011 to inform him, and subsequently 'pressured' the show's cast and crew to remain silent about the affair.

So I thought I'd give credit where it's due; what spurned me to make this TIL was, in fact, watching his review of The Walking Dead as linked above.

newusername1000,,,"Really interesting. Women are placed on pedestals by men their entire lives; they do not know a world in which men don't treat them in a unique way, and therefore neutral treatment is received as hostile because their barometer has been shifted up. They do not know what they do not know. When they speak about equality they are usually talking about having their cake and eating it too, with very little effort expended to understand how males experiences life (and a LOT of assumptions and generalizations in place of said effort). Now, that's nothing out of the ordinary - males generalize just as much. The problem lies in the current culture surrounding ""gender talk."" Examining female culture is perceived as inherently sexist, as the ""problems with women"" are all said to be injected by external sources (they are not vain - they are pressured by society to focus on appearance; and so on), so there is no examination to be done; you should be examining the external force ""inflicting"" the situation on the female. This obviously goes hand-in-hand with female passivity and the passive perspective (careful now - such passivity isn't a problem; it's ""who they are."" In the same vein, male directness and brashness is not a problem because it's who we are...  /s). On the other hand, examining male culture is treated as inherently progressive; males need fixing, while females do not. There is also the aforementioned problems with generalizations and perceptions of uniformity among males; males who place too much emphasis on their special snowflake status are seen as flamboyant and feminine, while females who do the same are excused or even rewarded for it. That's the current unspoken culture of discourse on the topic, and it is totally laughable.

VeritassAequitass,,,"I am glad people are learning about this. This is a huge problem that touches upon many issues affecting Aboriginal women in Canada, notably in BC. Many of these women originally come from reserves, where there are insufficient resources - financially and otherwise - and where the legacy of colonialism has left a pretty dismal life for many people, especially women. Aboriginal women who are disenfranchised and suffering from poverty, either on the reserve or off, as they try to escape to big cities, often have no choice but to hitchhike to try to get out. They are left, just as they were on reserves or in Vancouver, in extremely vulnerable and precarious situations, leading to these tragedies on the Highway of Tears.

It gets worse though. The RCMP (federal police) often overlook these missing and murdered women. Investigations have been insufficient and the police have been proven to be callous and discriminatory in the way they treat these cases. Not only that, but RCMP officers have actually abused Aboriginal women and girls themselves, without being held properly accountable. So not only are Aboriginal women ill-treated in Canada, leading to things like this happening, but families and entire communities have no way of getting justice, leading to further feelings of alienation and disenfranchisement.

/u/topsmate at /r/Australia [has uploaded a scan of a 1991 Australian magazine](https://www.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/2xe7wi/when_was_the_first_time_you_heard_the_term_mullet/cozdfmr) referring to a young man as ""mullet-haired"". It doesn't say that he ""has a mullet"", so it's not clear if it means ""he has hair like a mullet fish"", but he does definitely have a mullet hairstyle! Good enough for me! It's still remarkable that the quote isn't from the 80's, but at least now we know that The Beastie Boys weren't the first!

We did it, reddit! We made a significant contribution to lexicography! 

Original comment and edits: 

The Oxford English Dictionary entry for [mullet](http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/253382) (referring to the hairstyle) lists 1994 as the earliest date it was used, having been unable to find any earlier examples. They even put up an [appeal to the public](http://public.oed.com/appeals/mullet/), asking if anyone could find earlier examples, because it seems so strange that no one used the word like that until the mid-90s. 

It should be noted that the word ""mullet"" itself is much older. It's been used to refer to [this fish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mullet_(fish\)) since the 14th century. There's also a term ""mullet head"", meaning ""stupid person"", that has been used since the mid 19th century. 

If anyone can find earlier examples of the word referring to the hairstyle, let the OED know, they would surely be very grateful. 

EDIT: lots of people are saying ""no way that's true, I was using it all through the 80's!"". I'd just like to ask: are you sure? Like, *really* sure? Beyond a shadow of a doubt? It's not just that you saw the hairstyle all through that decade, but only found out later (in the mid-90s) that it was called a ""mullet""? Memories are malleable, are you sure that you didn't ""insert"" the word into your memories afterwards?

Because the simple fact is that there is literally no evidence for it that anyone has found. None! Not one printed word, not one spoken line in a movie, not one music lyric, not one barbershop sign. It's true that it might be out there somewhere, and nobody's found it yet, but it doesn't look like it. There are lots of ""mullet heads"" and lots of people talking about fish, but no hairstyles. There's literally the same amount of evidence for the use of the word ""mullet"" to refer to a hairstyle before 1994 as there is for creationism, or that vaccines cause autism. 

Shit is freaky, yo. 

EDIT 2: Ok, to clear some things up, here are answers to common questions: 

**You're full of shit, I've been using it since way before 1994**

See above.

**My coach used to call us ""mullet-heads"" all the time in the late 70's!**

As stated, the phrase ""mullet-head"" is different from ""mullet""; it is a much older term (from the 1850's, at least), which means ""stupid person"". It has nothing to do with hair styles (though it is probably where The Beastie Boys got the term). 

**They said it in Cheers/Cool Hand Luke/Mark Twain!**

All the examples I've seen people point to are using the term ""mullet head"" to call someone stupid, not ""mullet"" to refer to a hairstyle.

**Just because there's no written source before The Beastie Boys, that doesn't mean that it didn't exist! They just used some common slang! We didn't have the internet back then, so nothing got written down!**

While it is a possibility (you can't prove a negative, and all that), the total lack of evidence makes it fantastically unlikely. While it's true that because of the internet, much more of the language is preserved today, the 1980's are not some sort of dark age. There's a massive amount of media from that time, from magazines to books to music to movies to television show to everything else imaginable, not to mention lots of academic linguists documenting slang, and nobody has found an earlier use. And this stuff is easier to research than ever, there's Google Books and LexisNexis and archive.org, and many more massive archives you can search. Not one single use has ever been found. 

Many people say they've heard it since at least the early 80's, which is at least a decade before anyone wrote it down. Do you really find plausible that slang that was apparently that common TOTALLY escaped the massive clutches of American pop culture? No, it doesn't seem likely, does it?

**Just because The Beastie Boys are first in the OED, that doesn't mean that they coined it.**

Certainly possible, but given the fact that the song lyrics ([helpfully posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/2xcl2e/til_that_the_beastie_boys_coined_the_term_mullet/coz2b0j) by /u/zyzzogeton) are basically one long explanation of the meaning of the term, and given that the [Grand Royal magazine article about mullets](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/2xcl2e/til_that_the_beastie_boys_coined_the_term_mullet/coz5ftf) (helpfully posted by /u/BovingdonBug) claims that Mike D coined it, it seems like a safe bet. This is also the opinion of the OED in their etymology section. 

**I hate you. You're wrong!**

I'm sorry! I like you! I'm still not wrong though.

HeyNowka,,,"   I am surprised this exhibit was reopened considering the outcry over the last incident. A local tourist intentionally crushed an otter's hand, breaking multiple bones in its hand and arm. The incident was not immediately noticed and the suspect wasn't found for quite some time. It was a compelling story for the media since the injured otter suffered complications from the surgery and passed away. 

  By the time the suspect was finally captured, public resentment had been building for weeks. Pets are quite revered in Japan, but with real estate at a premium, small residences and/or homeowner associations keep many Japanese from being able to keep pets of their own. Thus, public spaces, especially zoos are a very treasured part of Japanese communities. 

   There was a minor scandal when it was revealed that the suspect had been severely beaten after his arrest. The rumor was that local authorities placed the suspect in a general holding cell despite the notoriety and resentment that followed him. Whether it was the police or others that beat him within an inch of his life was never determined. Bear in mind that Japan has an unusually high conviction rate because authorities tend to wait until cases are slam dunks. Once a suspect is officially named and arrested, it pretty much becomes a case of ""guilty until convicted, told you so."" Don't feel bad for the otter attacker. He later confessed that he did it because he owed a large gambling debt to the owner of the zoo.

  Yup. A deal had been arranged to drum up publicity for the zoo, though neither man expected the cruel stunt to turn into such a fevered situation. Word eventually got back to the local Yakuza outfit, who killed the otter attacker while he was in custody, then burned the zoo owner alive. Supposedly the zoo owner's final word's were, ""Can i get abouta tree fiddy?"" To which he received no response before perishing in the flames. This ran a bit longer than I planned. Sorry.

Those who stay in the South continue to face formal legal segregation.

* *WWII - Drug War* Blacks enlist at a high rate in the military, but segregation within the military generally succeeds in keeping them away from more prestigious positions and attendant benefits; this limits what they reap from the massive entitlements that were given to WWII vets and helped create the post-war boom. The Vietnam war has a similarly negative impact on family stability as it does with all people. Housing covenants and other forms of social stigmas in many northern/industrial cities leads to the rise of ghettos.

Years and years ago I was on a flight from Chicago back home to San Francisco. During the flight something went wrong with the plane and we had to do an emergency landing at a small airfield in the middle of nowhere, I believe somewhere in Wyoming (keep in mind I was 10-11 and this was 2 decades ago so specifics are fuzzy). 

Once we landed we had a very long wait while arrangements were made and eventually we were given the option of taking a shuttle to the closest large airport or chartering a small plane to Nevada. 

My dad wanted to seize the opportunity to allow me to see a small plane, and didn't want me to be afraid of flying after the emergency landing ordeal so we opted for the flight. 

During the flight in this tiny 4 seater plane while my dad was drifting off from our incredibly long day I saw two of these! 

I thought it might be buildings shaped as arrows, I wasn't quite sure. I tried to nudge him awake but that didn't work. When we landed I told him about it and being a kid of course he didn't believe me. Actually no one really did and partially thought I was delirious from lack of sleep, eventually I doubted it myself. Back then you couldn't google something so it remained a mystery.  Now it's solved! 

TLDR; Saw these as a kid, no one believed me. 

Edit: went camping and came back to this comment being somewhat popular... Thanks all! I emailed the story to my dad right away. He doesn't check email often so I'll probably call him tomorrow and tell him to check it out!

PM_ME_YOUR_DALEKS,,,"As a major Beatles fan who's read a lot of McCartney interviews and books about his life, I'm seeing several misconceptions in the comments here. 

Linda was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1995. What Paul said is that they both knew her odds probably weren't great from the start, however they ""tried to block it out"" and focus on the positive. She had surgery and very intensive chemotherapy for about two and a half years, so she definitely fought intensely. But according to Paul the cancer spread to her other breast and finally, her liver, at which point they knew things were bad. He said at one point her primary doctor told him privately that Linda was not going to survive. Paul asked if anything would be accomplished by telling Linda that outright and the doctor said no, he didn't think she needed to know because it would just destroy any positivity she had left. Paul agreed. 

However, Linda did know on some level she was going to die soon. Plenty of her friends attested to that. She asked her daughter to move up her impending wedding by several months. She arranged for birthday and Christmas presents to be delivered to Paul and her children for later that year (she died in the spring of 1998). Before she left on her final vacation to Arizona, where she passed away, Linda called her best friend to tell her she loved her and also sent her a meaningful present. A couple of months before she died, the head of her frozen food company had a long meeting with her where he said Linda bluntly told him she was not going to beat her cancer and needed to make arrangements for the business to carry on in her absence (source: the biography of Linda McCartney by Danny Fields). 

As for treatment, Linda was in no way denied it. She of course knew she had breast cancer and had battled it for about two and a half years by her death, with intensive treatment that made her very, very ill for most of that time. She had private medical care in her home when she died. Paul, Linda and their children all went to their home in Arizona two weeks before she died expressly because Arizona was Linda's favorite place, they were all there and all got to say their lengthy goodbyes to her. The horse riding actually occurred two days before she died; Paul physically assisted her so she would be able to get one last ride because it was her favorite thing in the world, she was not galloping around. She went into a coma the following day after the horse ride and Paul stayed in her bed with her and held her in his arms the entire time until she passed. He said they felt very blessed that she had so little discomfort and went quickly. In thanks to the medical staff who helped Linda, Paul donated $1 million after her death to each of the hospitals who treated her. 

Here's a direct quote from Paul on the subject from a 1999 interview with Chrissie Hynde:

""[After her cancer spread to her liver] We asked, 'Is there anything we can do? Do people ever come back from this?' Yes. Sure. There's statistics which show that people have licked this, which is true -- so we always went with that side of it. Linda never said, 'Oh, I'm going to be a bad statistic.' I think that's what sustained us. She'd say to us, 'You're the best support group a girl could ever have,' and we'd say, 'We couldn't do it without you, babe.' She had such courage. We just couldn't have done it. It's true. We would have fallen apart. But she was just so on the ball. We could be strong because she was. I don't even think that until the last week she even knew. I think the last week, you know, things were going so badly -- but we were riding horses. I said 'Tell you what, babe, I'll get the horses ready, you don't have to even do anything. I'll tack them up, get them all ready, get a little bale of hay and you can hop off of it.' That was always one of our horrors, of being eighty and you can't ride. We'd joke that we'd design a special crane and have you lifted up. Because that was the horror of her life, that she couldn't ride. Thank God that she was able to, two days before she died. And, as I said, the crowning moment was this big rattler  stretched across the track. We just looked at it and felt awed. Like it was some sort of magic sign. I bet it is in Indian folklore.

So, thank the Lord, she went into a coma as they had predicted. Which wasn't the worst of all scenarios, as it happened. She just felt tired, and I said, 'Would you like to sit by the pool?' She said, 'No. I don't really fancy it today.' I thought I'd try her in about an hour's time. I tried her in about an hour's time, she still felt tired. I joked, 'Well you just fancy a lie-in, don't you?' She said, 'Yeah.' The next day she died. She was just in a coma for one day. It was as if she was so smart that something in her said, 'We can't lick this one. Let's get the hell out of here, quick.' And she didn't hang about. As I say, she'd spent that day in bed, the previous day she'd got up, she spent that one day in bed, I went to bed that night with her figuring, 'God, things are getting desperate but we'll just keep hoping.' I went to bed and she got restless in the middle of the night, as they'd warned me she might. So I called the nurse about 3 in the morning and at 5 she died. She didn't hang about. In her last sort of moments she got very peaceful. As she died something told me to just say something to her...It just suddenly came to me at the moment when she was just about to die. I have no idea why, I just thought, 'I've just got to say this.' It was as if I was guided and I said, 'You're up on your beautiful Appaloosa stallion; it's a fine spring day, we're riding through the woods. The bluebells are all out, and the sky is clear blue.'

DBivansMCMLXXXVI,points ,6.0,"&gt;Douglas began hanging out with Lennon and his wife, Yoko Ono. He helped produce some of Ono's music, heavy on experimentation.

&gt;That's putting it kindly. The strangest moment involved a track called Dead Rat. In the middle of the song, Ono left a 20-second gap. ""I had a bad feeling about that hole -- I kept thinking of it as the dead rat solo,"" he says.

&gt;Sure enough, he recalls, when all the tracks were cut, Ono's assistant showed up with a shoe box. Inside was a dead rat. Ono wanted it incorporated in the recording. So Douglas had his assistant place it on a stool and set up an expensive mike inches away.

&gt;""Yoko wanders in like nothing, and says, ""I see you have the rat ready to go -- let's get right to it,""' he says. ""When the 20-second dead spot comes, I push up the fader. I'm listening. There's no noise, and I stop tape, and say to Yoko, ""It's not quite right, is it?' And she says, ""No, Jack, there's something wrong.' ""

&gt;Douglas had his assistant, stifling laughter, move the mike closer to the rat. ""We do it again. I push the fader up, this time with a little smile and I say, ""I think that's much better.' And she says, ""That's a take.'

ShortLobster,,,"My grandmother was friends with Dorothy Binney, Putnam's former wife. She became friends with Earhart and Putnam through Dorothy. We lived in the same town as Putnam. This was in the 60's. 

In about 6th grade I was writing a paper on Amelia Earhart and my mother suggested I call my grandmother, because they knew each other. We talked about a bunch of things, and when I asked about Amelia getting married to Putnam she said ""Well, they were both queer; George needed to be married so he could go to the [country] clubs.""

She spoke with some disdain about Putnam, not for being gay but because he was a ""schemer."" She said that Amelia was very pretty and smart, and they felt very worried for her getting involved with Putnam.  My mother has a picture of my grandmother and Amelia in bathing suits standing in the ocean. 

She didn't say how she knew that Amelia was ""queer"", but made it seem to me as if it were obvious and that many people knew, but that practicality required a marriage.

xebo,,,"All this study is saying is that girls find guys physically attractive (on physical merits alone) when they hit a threshold (Currently top 20%). But Most guys have the ability to be in that ""Holy crap he's hot"" category if they learned how to reshape their bodies. It's 2015 and this shit it very attainable. 

That's good news. You can be a guy that girls are overtly attracted to. It's just a matter of changing yourself. Though some guys are very socially stunted. No advice there. Good luck getting your act together.

EVERYONE wins when you get in shape. Girls want another eligible/hot guy to date. You want girls to be attracted to you. No one loses if you decide to get your physical act together. Same for girls losing weight. Everyone wins. They look/feel better, are healthier, and guys have one more cute girl to get with.

This whole conversation is just irrelevant. 90% of society could be physically attractive to the opposite sex. It's very doable. But most of you seem to be stuck in ""This is unfair and I'm butthurt"" mode. 

You can't argue your way out of natural selection. Just accept that reality isn't fair, move past the bitterness, and do what it takes to get yourself in the winner's circle and your life will be much better for it.

Doggzilla1000,points ,1.0,"Interesting enough, I was listening to the radio and NPR stated that Iran has more Ivy League graduates than the president or any other political administration on earth. The Iranians are not stupid people at all, they tend to place in the top 12 in any given field. 

They are basically the Germany of the Middle East. And one of the few Cou tries to have a multi billion dollar car industry. Ya, they actually make a lot of autos for other countries , and produce licenses versions of European cars as well. So they aren't some backwards country living in caves. They surpass RUSSIA in certain ways.

Toraden,,,"It amazes me that people don't see how bad of an idea this is.

First of all showing those who would attack western countries that we won't be ""cowed by there actions"" isn't going to change their minds, if it would they wouldn't be doing what they're doing right now.

Second, just because a VERY small percentage of a group are assholes does not give you the right to insult or intimidate those who just want to get on with their lives and fit in. The only way extremists bolster their numbers is by bringing more people to their side, and guess what, that'll be a lot easier when they can go 

""Hey! Look! No one in this country RESPECTS your religion. They mock you, they insult you, they make your life difficult because your religion is different, why should you try to fit it with them! Come and join us!""

The only way we can stop people joining their ranks is by showing that we respect their religious beliefs. That doesn't mean accommodating all of our laws to them, but it DOES mean not going out of our way to purposefully piss them off. 

By the same reasoning here we should also have a ""call every Christian you meet a cunt day!"" Because of the WBC, or ""punch every Somalian in the eye week"" because the Somalian pirates.

This kind of action benefits no one and actually goes some way to HELP the extremists. FUCK!

**quick edit** so first. Obligatory ""thank you for the gold stranger!"" Was not expecting that :s

3. The number is essentially an average and averages are tricky. They tend to over represent the extremes. For example, Bill Gates and I have an average net worth of 20 billion. And this number is meaningless. The number is heavily skewed by very high risk pregnancy, weather due to medical conditions or due social factors. Think huge pre-existing conditions or very marginalized people. For the average, relatively healthy women with a modicum of healthcare, pregnancy, while not much fun, is very safe.

The other advantage of this is that the flavors break down much more slowly when stored separately than they would while still in the orange.

Think of a blended whiskey, which seems to retain the same taste year after year despite differences in the raw materials.  The blend ratios might be slightly different, but the goal is to have the same product as you did last year.

The real take home message that I want you to get is that there isn't some guy combining random chemicals which taste nothing like orange into a suddenly orange tasting potion which they then feed to us.  They are adding essences taken from oranges back into orange juice.  Although this is certainly a mechanized and engineered process, it is not quite as deceitful as you might be led to believe.

Also, it's pretty well known if you are a food scientist that fragrance companies and flavor companies are one and the same - it's simply because the chemists they employ are the best at extracting particular taste and aroma extracts from raw materials &amp; at evaluating them (tasting and smelling things isn't exactly a standardized, quantitative science, but these guys have done a really good job of making it in to one).  Not sure why the article felt the need to point that out unless it's to really underline the artificial nature of this process and spook everybody.

When it comes down to it, the whole point is to make something that is harvested once and doesn't last long available year round, and something which changes from year to year consistent.  The chemists that work for these companies are always struggling with the reality of what actually happens and the pressure of making the product seem as  true to ""natural"" as possible.  What they have come up with is essentially ""split it apart and recombine it later"".

Tl;dr - the ""flavor packs"" used in this case are made from the essence of oranges, so while definitely engineered, not entirely artificial.

EKeebler,,,"My favorite Tallulah story was when she was a guest at a dinner party where the children of the host couple were misbehaving loudly. The mother had to excuse herself from the table more than once to go upstairs and try to settle them down. As she rose from her seat to once again tend to the kids, Tallulah stopped her and said, ""oh, dahling, let me see if I can't quiet them down"" The mother tried to politely discourage her without actually saying ""what the hell do you know about kids?"", but Tallulah simply said, ""oh, nonsense, it couldn't hurt to try!"" and swooped upstairs.

After a minute or two, the racket and commotion faded to nothing. All the guests were dumbfounded that she had shown such a knack for children and agreed they had judged her poorly.

He was a Public Defender for close to 40 years, and in a relatively small county like I grew up in, he'd sometimes have three generations of the same family as clients for things like larceny or possession. Sometimes he'd have the 4th or 5th generation of felons in his office, whose family had been represented by his predecessors in the 1960s or '70s.

What he noticed, though, was the families that didn't find themselves in that cycle had a common factor: The parents, after their sentence was up, made an effort to get involved in the education of their kids. Maybe they couldn't control what schools their kids went to and maybe they weren't even educated enough to help with homework, but they would make an effort to encourage their children to be better.

The most effective way to help the kids was reading. The kids who learned to read had better vocabularies, which meant they were better at communicating with peers and adults. They had an expanded worldview from the stories they read, even simple kids' books, and knew how to empathize. 

What surprised him was that *it didn't matter what the kids were reading*. Books, comics, blogs, magazines... as long as they were reading *with their parents* they had a phenomenally lower recidivism rate.

Imagination Library is his favorite national charity because it puts books directly into the hands of kids of all ages and incomes.

Sixstringkiing,,,"LPT: never date a woman who screams and yells during an argument. Seriously.  Ive done time for dateing the wrong type of girl. She kicked me in the balls twice and then called the cops on me when i forced her out of my house. When i was in jail, she ransacked my house breaking everything and fucked some guy in my bed. 

The lesson I learned is... Never date a woman who screams and yells. Period. The first time she raises her voice, dump her.  It will only escalate.  A real lady never yells. Real ladies just slit your throat in your sleep. On second thought, just get gay. Dudes are more logical and easier to deal with.
