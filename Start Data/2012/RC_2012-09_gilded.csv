True,rockemsockemrobot,,,"I consider myself to be an avid conversationalist. I don't know why, really, but I always have, and I think the logic is a bit circular- I am a good conversationalist because I have confidence, and I have confidence because I'm a good conversationalist.

So step one- don't give me that 'I used to be pretty outgoing' or 'diagnosed with depression' stuff. I *realize* that these are serious issues, friend, and I send you as many e-hugs as I can to try and make it better. However, those e-hugs will do *fucking absolutely nothing* because the only one who can fix that shit is you. You need to wake up one day, tell yourself, FUCK THIS, I'M NOT GONNA BE SCARED/SHY/SAD ANYMORE, and then go out there and do it.

Think about a wall. It's in your way, and great social interaction is on the other side. If this was a physical wall, you'd have to do something to get over it, right? The same concept exists in your mind. Except it's *your* mind, and you have way more control over it than you do the physical world. Go around that wall. Climb over that wall. Fucking run through that wall. FUCK that wall. It's *purely mental*, and you *can* do it. You CAN. No doubt, no second thoughts, YOU CAN DO IT. Just stop thinking and do it. 

Right now you're sitting by yourself and you know, for 100%, that you are someone who can hold a conversation, that you are interesting, that you are beautiful. You *know* that- you said yourself that you used to be outgoing. The next time you talk to someone and they seem disinterested, or you start doubting yourself, just think about right now, right now when you know, 100%, that *you* know you're awesome. Fuck whoever you're talking to, because in your mind, you're the fuckin' best. And if you can think of shit that you don't like about yourself, you're young! You got time to fix that shit!

Now that you're all hyped up, I'm gonna throw down some pretty easy tactics for starting conversation. Keep in mind that about 75 percent of this is gonna be bullshit- every situation is different and there's no real way to prepare besides being confident. That said, here.

&gt;Yes, and...
Ever do improv? A big rule in improvisational acting is that you never disagree with who you're acting with. Say you start a duet scene, and you partner says, 

YO BITCH IS THAT A FUCKING TURTLE OR WHAT

and you're like

NO, IT'S A BIRD

What the fuck is he supposed to do? He's stuck, you shot him down, he's disinterested, everyone's disinterested, FUCK. The yes, and... rule allows for you to *build on what they said to include them* and *allow you to add in your own shit*. So say someone at a party is talking to you and they're like,

BRAH DO YOU LIKE, FUCKIN', I DUNNO, BEER

Even if you don't particularly like beer, think of something you can talk about in regards to it. I'm not saying lie, but don't be like, NO FUCK YOU. Say shit like

Yeah I mean I like getting out and being social/seeing hipsters microbrew in their basement/observing the chemical process of hops and shit/the color FUCK YOU I dunno. 

If you find yourself in a conversation where you don't really connect with the person, GREAT! Just get the fuck out, man, you're a good guy, he's a good guy, we're all good guys you two just don't click too well. Fuckin', that happens. 

Here's one more. Answer simple questions with details. Say a girl is talking to you, and she's like,

Where do you go to school?

If you just say UM UNIVERSITY OF SHITNOSE. She'll have to respond to just that, and that alone. Not super interesting. But if you go like

I GO TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MY BUTTHOLE AND I STUDY THE ART OF BUTHOLING

She has the chance to connect to multiple things, so conversation has a bigger place to start. I know a lot of people that are hard to talk to because they take small talk *way* to literally. If someone says, HOW WAS UR DAY, LOL, they don't want to hear UM GOOD. They want to hear something interesting about your day, or something that happened, if you're doing alright, etc etc. They don't ask all those questions specifically because they want *you* to reach out, connect, and talk. That's fuckin', what social interaction is okay. 

So just fucking go to a place with people, right away go to the bathroom, look into your beautiful fuckin' eyes and tell yourself that you're the BEST EVER. Because you are, and you fucking deserve to make yourself happy. Then go out there, talk about a bunch of bullshit with some people, and realize that social interaction is fun. 

IT'S FUCKIN FUN ALRIGHT FUCK
 

tl;dr You're the best. Small talk isn't literal. Talk to people about whatever and if life throws you lemons ask where the lemons came from and maybe she'll sleep with you.",0,1346513424,,0,False,1,c61xhaf,t3_z6h7a,t1_c61xhaf,t3_z6h7a,,1429790652,101,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,101
True,mriparian,,,"I like this. You're divining a feeling that many people experience.

To be honest, it feels chunky. I think your language could be pared down significantly to great effect. If I were your editor, this is what I would return to you:

&gt;Silence strikes like a thousand angry words.

&gt;The moment I had no one to tell of my day to day activities it was as though I was an astronaut that had floated too far away from the space station. I found myself surrounded by a vast and profound emptiness. I saw the stable ground that I held on to drift away at a thousand miles an hour. I had lost it all. 

&gt;There was beauty all around me in the dark expanse of space, but I would not allow myself to see it. I thought, ""I am alone and will continue to float sadly through the cosmos,"" but circling the Earth there were many other satellites. 

&gt;Soon, I became aware of them. I saw them not as foreign, unapproachable ships, but rather new possibilities. These vessels would not take me on the same journey I was on but that was alright. I needed a change of course in order to forge onward. Only then would I discover how truly massive the universe could be.

An explanation of my changes:

First off, join AA. As in, Avoid Adverbs. ""More boldly"" is an obstacle for the eyes, your reader has to climb over it like a mountain to get to the other side of the sentence. If you make the sentence more bold, you don't have to tell the reader how bold the silence was. It's a lone wolf. It doesn't play well with the others. It needs its own paragraph, goddamnit.

I just plain cut, ""It makes broad, sweeping gestures. It lingers and is ever present."" The two sentences are antithetical to each other. At first you're making silence seem open, and then immediately after, suggesting that it's suffocating and claustrophobic. This juxtaposition *works*, but the writing isn't aware that a juxtaposition exists at all.

Also, paragraphs separate ideas, and because we ended a paragraph on silence we can't start a new paragraph about the same subject.

I cut the phone out altogether, because you never bring up the concept of a phone elsewhere in the piece. It's a short piece, so every single word has to matter.



I removed the word ""silence"", because you turned it into a character in the first sentence, so you are no longer able to use it as an object for the rest of the piece. Seriously.

""A thousand miles an hour"" is stronger than ""thousands of miles an hour"" despite that the number is feasibly greater. It's definite -- a speed set in stone. ""Thousands of miles an hour"" is unsure of itself.

Also, I broke that sentence into two sentences, because they are separate concepts that don't have direct relevance to each other.

I changed ""could"" to ""would."" ""Could not"" should be used for actions that are externally denied, ""would not"" should be used for actions that are internally denied. There is a vast amount of difference between, ""I could not take a cookie from the cookie jar because dinner was about to start,"" and ""I would not take a cookie from the cookie jar because dinner was about to start.""

I turned your thought into a quote because I liked the structuring of the sentence, but ""will"" causes a shifting of tense from past to present.

Cutting up the sentence about the satellites creates a good segue into the last section of the piece.

Added the ""but"" before rather. This is not optional.

""With me"" is redundant. There's also a lot of tense changes in this last paragraph. Be vigilant about your tenses.

Despite the fact that I just gave you a huge amount of changes, the basic language of your piece remains unchanged. You wrote this. It's good. Be proud.

True,[deleted],,,"**Since there is no good explanation in this thread yet, I'm putting one here.**

First, the show: 

* The characters are likable and well-developed. Each of them gets at least one episode dedicated to them, and each has some endearing flaw that we can all relate to. Try [this episode (horse race)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2HxErFnSyY) or [this episode (dragon)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEG-bWp-YY8) as examples.

* It's full of good music and good art. The animation is slick and smooth. The colors are pretty, but not garish. I'm willing to bet that most of you will listen to [this song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzsxfO7dBlA) more than once, and will watch [this gif](http://i.imgur.com/ogNpZ.gif) repeat for a lot longer than you're comfortable admitting. Good art draws you in.

* Friendship lessons. This show is FULL of friendship lessons. In fact, Friendship is Magic is basically a step-by-step guide on how to make people like you. If you accept the fact that people who frequently use the internet aren't as good at making real-life friends as people who don't use the internet so much, it's not at all surprising that a show [*that ends each episode with an explicit lesson on how to make friends*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJPyFmg7fx8) should become popular among them.

Second, the fandom:

* Like the show, it's full of music and art. Like rock music? [We have that.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30M767EIYpE) Electronic dance music more your style? [We've got that too.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sryqaS07WaU) It shouldn't be surprising that people who enjoy this show for its art and music should be inspired by the show to make their own--either [tracing the show's characters to learn the style,](http://makintosh91.deviantart.com/art/Queen-Chrysalis-297891416) or [drawing those characters with their own unique spin.](http://selonian.deviantart.com/art/Chrysalis-297720512) And don't forget the [stupid fan-comics.](http://loceri.deviantart.com/art/MLP-Sugar-Games-302430026) Everyone loves stupid fan-comics.

Okay, that's cool, but why is the fandom *so fucking annoying* sometimes? 

* More people are joining, so the shitty stuff outweighs the cool stuff. People are also making fan-related content at a faster rate than anyone can possibly keep up with. So, if you're a recent addition to the fandom, you'll be bombarded with other people telling you to listen to THIS song or read THIS fanfic, which are obviously so much better than all THOSE songs and fanfics. It's annoying when people rub stuff in your face.

* Second, some people watch the show because they think it makes them hip and counterculture. *That's not the point at all*. I repeat, if you want to be hip and counterculture, *do not watch My Little Pony and then post online about how great it is--you will only give the fandom a bad name, because nobody likes pretentious hipsters.* Watch the show because you like the art, or the characters, or the friendship lessons. But if you don't actually enjoy the show, *don't watch it*.

* Lastly, most people that *do* watch the show and like it never thought they *would* like it, for exactly the same reasons that most outsiders are confused. The only reason they gave it a try in the first place is because of external pressure, either from friends or the internet in general. As user [blazemore](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/z8h21/whats_the_weirdest_pop_culture_phenomenon_you/c62rt9t) mentioned, this leaves them with a sincere desire to get other people to watch what they think is an awesome show. This is a phase that most bronies go through and usually goes away once they realize how annoying they are being.

There's an idea floating around called [New Sincerity.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_sincerity) Basically, people are sick of irony and satirism in their media and literature and art and what-have-you. They want to appreciate something for what it is. They want to watch a cute show that doesn't mock other art and doesn't pretend to be something it isn't. And--*ironically*--for a lot of young guys, My Little Pony fits that bill pretty well.

The [Wikipedia article on MLP:FiM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Little_Pony_Friendship_Is_Magic#Fandom) mentions New Sincerity down at the bottom. And [here's one more relevant article.](http://gawker.com/5900835/why-community-is-the-most-popular-show-on-the-internet) It's about Community, not MLP, but it's surprisingly relevant.

EDIT: While I'm at it, I'm going to say that Community and MLP are basically the same show. Each has an array of quirky, yet likable characters, and each is about making friends and getting along with people. The only difference is that Community is designed for adults, and MLP is designed for kids. So if you like Community, there's a good chance you'll like MLP, and vice versa.

""Alright, John, a nurse is coming in shortly with an IV for the anesthetic. I'll be right back to perform the surgery. You won't even know what happened,"" he said with a comforting smile.

The nurse came in and put the IV in my arm, much like when I got my wisdom teeth removed. ""When will it kick in?""

""Any second now."" The nurse replied. And with that, everything became a dream.

I remember bright lights, some muffled dialogue, and some very odd dreams involving my childhood pets turning against me; the kind of nightmares I used to have when my parents brought home that large dog so many years ago. 

In sort of a daze, I find my surroundings. I'm on a white bed, in a white room, with a large glass mirror. I sit up slowly; my head is a little groggy and the motion makes me dizzy. I look in the mirror and see myself conversing with the doctors. Wait, the room's a little different. There are no doctors here. It's a window. I notice the me in the other room has no tattoo. I look down at my own arm.

I get a lump in my throat. This can't be right. My head starts swimming, and my mind starts racing. I get a panic attack, just as I do when I contemplate eternity for too long. Adrenaline is pumping in my veins, and I can't seem to relax. I hop up and start pacing.

I am flooded with realizations. I'm never going to see my wife again. I'm never going to make my children grilled cheese sandwiches on the weekend. I'm never going back to my job that I love, never going to see my co-workers or play that LAN party I had planned for my brother's birthday next month. Never going to finish building that arcade cabinet for my emulator. Never going to repaint the kitchen like I told my wife I would. 

What about when I die? Will I go to my funeral? Will I get to go to my parents' funerals when they pass away? Or am I going to fight all my life in this war I'm not really sure I believe in? What about when my son graduates college? When my daughter goes to her first prom? Will I be there? Will I get to walk her down the aisle when she finds the right man? Will I get to give a toast when my brother gets married?

My life as I knew it was over. Everything I was looking forward to in life was now gone. Taken away from me. Only a war to fight. A war with other people, just like me, with wives they love and children they won't get to see grow up.

True,toldyaso,,,"This is the kind of question that guys have to deal with all the time.  It's always funny to me when a girl has to wrestle with this particular demon, because it's like women have almost no natural defense against it.

As a guy, there are usually at least a dozen women in my life who, even though I may love my wife or GF, I'm totally attracted to these other girls.  And do you know what I do about it?  Nothing.  Nothing at all.  And that's the healthy thing to do in most cases.

You don't HAVE to eat every piece of cake.  You don't HAVE to drive every sportscar.  You don't HAVE to live in every nice house you see.  

Just because you're attracted to this guy doesn't mean you're under some kind of obligation to do something about it.  I mean you're married, he has a GF anyway, and he's also your husband's best friend... so basically for you to do anything about this attraction (which is likely mutual) would pretty much make you as evil as Adolf Hitler and Darth Vader.  

Just be a grownup.  There's a guy you think is sexy.  Big deal.  Just let him be sexy and don't turn your brain inside out trying to figure out what that ""means"".  It doesn't ""mean"" anything except that your eyes still work and your sex drive still functions.

In terms of practical advice, I would say try to work on spicing up your sex life with your hubby a bit more.  If you really don't want to cut this guy out of your life, at the very least you can try to limit your exposure to him a bit more.  Try to focus more on enjoying sex with your husband more, try to at least see this guy a bit less, and certainly cut off any contact that's just between you and him... like, keep your meetings with him confined to only times when it's all three of you talking together, never just you and him alone.

It's just funny to me in a way because a guy automatically, instinctively knows how to deal with this, but women so often have no clue what to do.

True,schifferbrains,,,"First of all, we need to talk about the difference between a DJ and a Producer. 

- A Producer **makes** music

- A DJ **plays** music

That said, keep in mind that almost all Producers are also DJs (but NOT many DJs are Producers). Think about it: with any instrument, lots of people play other people's songs, but very few end up good enough to write their own. Same thing.

In any case, all the big name DJs you hear of are famous for songs they PRODUCED, (though most of them are, as you might expect, incredible DJs as well). All the DJs you named are both.

Finally, as a bunch of other people on this thread said already, there are also DJs that actually produce (make) music **live**. That's pretty cool, but also much more rare, so I don't think that's what you're talking about.

So, what is a DJ doing up there in his (or her) little box.  Well, a number of things:

1) Picking songs

It's not enough to just pick a good song or even a good dance song to be a good DJ; you need to pick a song that goes well with the last song you played. This is very difficult to do for 3 hours straight unless you know A LOT of music REALLY WELL (which is one of the most important things that makes the best DJs so good). Sometimes, DJs just ""know"" what songs go well with other songs (practice helps a lot), but other times, they need to listen to both songs being played at the same time to figure out whether they mesh or not. So, while a song is playing on the speakers, the DJ will play another song in his headphones and, listening to both at the same time, decide whether they go well together.

Of course, because this is so difficult, and because DJs have to do this for hundreds of songs every night, most DJs decide (to some extent) what songs they're going to play in what order before they start their set. In the end though, good DJs almost always have to improvise a little bit because of what they see in the crowd.

2) Reading the crowd. 

A DJ needs to be able to tell what kind of music people like (in general) and what they want to hear (right now) just by looking at them. Are lots of people dancing and singing along to Britney Spears? Does the dance floor clear out when you play Skrillex? Well then, doesn't matter what the DJ likes, he should play more pop and less dubstep. Figuring this out is pretty easy, and the DJ has to do it very early or else lots of people will just leave the party. 

More difficult is reading the crowd's ""mood"" or ""energy."" On one hand, the DJ is supposed to be *setting* the mood, but there's a limit to what he can do. Maybe the DJ plays an energetic song and everyone is jumping up with their hands in the air so he thinks, ""Great! They love this kind of music!"" But if he plays another song like that, and then another, people will stop jumping - they will get tired; they will get bored of being ""super excited."" A DJ needs to see that BEFORE too many people stop jumping so that he can choose a less intense song next.

This is something that DJs have to do throughout the night. They have to see or ""feel"" when the crowd is ready to take it up a notch and when they need to be given a little slack.

So, based on the tastes of the crowd, and mood or vibe that the DJ observes, and his knowledge of what songs go well with other songs, the DJ is constantly looking through his records, cds or music library, listening to songs in his headphones, and planning the next song or next few songs that he is going to play.

All of this has to be done in a very short amount of time, because the third thing DJs do is:

3) Transitioning Between Songs

The first step in mixing music is Beat Matching, which means speeding up or slowing down one (or both) of your songs so that they are playing at the same tempo (speed). These days, this is usually done automatically by a beat matching software, and despite what some people on this thread are saying, even the pros use it because beat matching is very easy and there's not much room for creativity, so it's just not all that interesting to do.

To beat match manually, the DJ pauses a song in his headphones right before the first (usually, but it can be any) beat. Once it is paused, he can fast forward or rewind the song very slowly to find the exact right spot. Then, he listens to the song playing on the speakers and tries to start the song in his headphones at the same time as a beat in the song that is playing. Once both are playing (one on the speakers, one in his headphones), the DJ speeds up or slows down a song (usually in the headphones) to make the beats match each other exactly for as long as possible. He may have to do this several times (pause, wait for a beat, play, adjust speed) before getting it just right.

One of the marks of a good DJ (in electronic music) is having long mixes, that is long periods of time where two (or more) songs are playing at the same time. Beat matching for a few bars (or a few seconds) is easy, because if you're only off by a little, nobody will notice. With longer mixes, small mistakes become obvious as the two songs increasingly diverge, so DJs will often have to adjust the speed of one of the songs as they're going. 

You will notice, for example, that they sometimes seem to be moving the record (or the thing that looks like a record) forward or backwards a little bit at a time, (but you won't hear a scratching sound, there's not much scratching in electronic music). They will do this when they have already adjusted the speed, and now they have to push one of the songs a little bit forward or backwards to ""catch up"" to the other one. (Or else, they're playing at the same speed, but they're not in sync anymore).

The other thing you need to do to have long mixes (but also to do proper short ones) is Phrase Match. This is much more interesting than beat matching and there is no software for it (to my knowledge).

If you think of a song like a story, then a Verse is like a Paragraph, a Phrase is like a Sentence, and a Beat is like a Word or a Letter. It's easy to match two words of the same length, but much more difficult to match two sentences. For example, you don't want to play the part of a song that has words in it at the same time as the part of another song that also has words in it - it'll just sound like a garbled mess. So it's not enough to start a new song on the same beat as the song that is playing, you also have to consider what part of the song is playing, and match the phrases.

All of this stuff - phrase matching, beat matching, is stuff that DJs are doing in their headphones while you're listening to a song play. Basically, they're getting (at least) one step ahead of you. Again, this is something great DJs can do in seconds because they know music so well, and newer DJs spend a lot of time struggling with.

So to get back to your question - what are (great) DJs like Deadmau5, Tiesto and Steve Angelo doing during their set - the beat matching and phrase matching probably isn't taking up much time. They're probably, as you say, playing with knobs the entire time, though these knobs don't simply control the volume.

Some of the knobs are labelled: Highs, Mids, and Lows. The sounds you hear in a song are broadly broken up into these three categories - the high sounds, the middle sounds, and the lower sounds. The deep BOOM BOOM BOOM of the bass is Low, whereas the TSS TSS TSS of a cymbal is high, and vocals (singing) usually comes in the middle (although parts of the voice will come through in the High and Low registers as well.

Sometimes, the DJ only wants to start playing the bass on a new song, so he will turn off the Lows on the song playing, turn down the Highs and Mids of the new song, and then mix in the new song in with only the Lows playing to match the Mids and Highs of the old one. There are a lot of variations on this and DJs can play with it quite a bit.

The other knobs control different kinds of effects that distort the sound in one way or another. For example, they may add a sort of ""stutter"" or echo, or a sort of ""crushed,"" static-y element to a song.

There are also buttons and knobs to make certain parts of a song repeat over and over again. DJs can use this to transition into a new song or also just in the middle of a song.

Then of course, there are the volume knobs and the cross fader. These are used if you want one song to play louder than another, possibly to fade one out while the other one fades in.

4) Mixing

Everything I've just said about Transitioning between songs can also happen in the middle of a song. For example, maybe a DJ only wants to play a small clip of a new song while the other one is already playing, but he doesn't want to switch to that new song in the end.

Basically, a DJ is trying to serve up music in a way that you haven't heard it before. That's what really gets people excited. Hearing a song they like but in a new way. Getting that ""high"" you get from a familiar song, but also getting that ""high"" you get from hearing something for the first time, that maybe none of your friends have heard before. It's that combination of familiarity and surprise that makes DJ sets so cool.",0,1346890822,,0,False,1,c641mix,t3_ze77n,t1_c641mix,t3_ze77n,,1429827338,1899,False,explainlikeimfive,t5_2sokd,1899

True,kingsOTHERjester,,,"Yeah...it's a bit complicated, but there are a zillion places to get info.  Here's the short and sweet:

(*edit:  This isn't even close to short.  Holycrap.*)

Two strains that you care about...1 and 2.  (We'll ignore chicken pox and mono and whatnot.)
Two locations that you care about...mouth and junk.  

Strain HSV1 ""lives"" in a nerve bundle that is located right about your ear.  It's called the trigeminal ganglion.  When  you get an outbreak, the outbreak is stemming from there.  

Strain HSV2 ""lives"" in a nerve bundle that is located around the base of your spine.  It's called the sacral ganglion.  Same rules for that one.  The truth of the matter is that the location of the ganglion that they ""live"" in is the only real difference between the two strains.  They are so close, in fact, that often time testing for one strain will pop a positive for the other because even tests have a hard time distinguishing.

Now if you've ever stubbed your toe, you know that sometimes it takes a second to hurt, really...and that's because the signal has to travel from your toe, up to your head, and then BACK down to your toe, and then BACK up to your head.  It's fast..but not instant.  Herpes viruses have to travel around in your body too, but (And this is where it gets kinda cool) it's much harder for a whole clunky virus to move around than it is for just a little electrical charge.  This limits the mobility of the virus.  If you were to draw blood from the arm of someone with HSV1 (ear herpes) and then from the foot of the same person, the viral load at the foot would be significantly less.  
(*Note:  for those about to yell...I said the viral load...not the antibody*).

Why does it matter?  Because herpes is kindof a stupid virus.  It *usually* (there are rare exceptions, but they are **way rare**) only ever remembers one location on your body...the spot you caught it.  It's like your grandmother who only knows one way back and forth to the grocery store, and refuses to admit that there are other routes..or even other stores.  It's really set in its ways.

This means that if you caught HSV1 on your mouth, the virus doesn't have to remember very far, and it's a lot easier for it to get enough particles over there to cause an outbreak.
If you caught HSV1 on your junk, however, it takes FOREVER to get *all the way down there*...so it usually can't make the trip.  It does still happen, just very rarely, and the amount of particles is typically super low.  So low, in fact, that something like 50% of people never see a second outbreak.  Those who do see outbreaks see super-tiny ones and they get lighter and shorter over time.  Eventually, the outbreak you started on sunday will be gone before nookie time the following friday.  

But lets say it's HSV2.  This one sits in your sacral ganglia...your butt-bone.  If you get HSV2 on your junk, the rules apply:  It's a short trip, so it's not hard to make and the particles can get there pretty easily.  You'll see outbreaks that happen fairly regularly.
If you get HSV2 on your *mouth*, however...you will get a cold sore when you contract it.  After that you're done.  
Really.  *There are no known cases of a recurrant HSV2 outbreak on the mouth.*

Cool, right?  It gets better:

Since the virus are so similar, once you've contracted one of them, your body makes the anti-body.  Once you have the anti-body, your chances of contracting it on any other part of your body or contracting the other form are GREATLY reduced.  Like...it's actually more protection than a condom could give you.  It's an invisible bio-condom.  

This does not mean that it's IMPOSSIBLE to get hsv2 once you have hsv1, but you'd kindof have to work on it.  

This covers the hows and wheres.  Now for the whats:
You've seen a cold sore.  congrats, they're all the same.  There's a slight stigma, but not too much, it's just something you get teased about.  It doesn't disfigure you, it doesn't scar, it's just annoying and embarrassing and makes orange juice a bad idea.

On your junk, it's a slightly different story.  You will see the blisters.  These are not big scary bad-guy blisters disfiguring your junk, these are pretty much pimples.  The first outbreak will scare the all-living-holy-jeebus out of you because you will see between 1 and 3 DOZEN of them.  You will by psychologically scarred.  They will form, ache a bit, itch a bit, and take what feels like 900 years to finally dry up, fall off, and leave you with nothing to show for all  your stress.  During this time, you will wash your hands 47 times a day and freak out every time you touch your face for any reason.
In the end, your junk will look like nothing happened, and  you'll wonder if it was a dream.

No dice, you still have it, but the more time you spend staring at your package with nothing wrong, the more you will come to grips that the virus.....didn't hurt you.
In fact, it didn't do *anything* except scare the all holy loving bejesus out of you.

...and that's it.  

really.  once you see the reality of it...it's really kinda boring.  Zits actually disfigure you and cause more permanent damage and infections than a whole year of herp outbreaks.

True,diablevert13,,,"Dude. Okay. 

3,000 years ago there were these people called Jews and they lived in the  land of Israel whose capital was Jerusalem. There were pretty different from most of their neighbors because they were monotheists, and they had certain cultural practices which also marked them out. 

So, I dunno if you ever went to Sunday school or anything, but have you ever heard the phrase ""Render unto Caesar what is Caesars?"" It's a quote from Jesus. 

That's because, 2,000 years ago when Jesus was alive, there were still Jews and they still lived in the land of Israel, but Israel had been conquered by the Romans and was at that point a Roman colony and payed taxes to Rome (and its head of state, Caesar).  

About 70 years after Jesus died, 100 AD or so, the Jews started a rebellion against their Roman rulers because the rulers were trying to enforce Emperor worship and preventing them from practicing certain other aspects of their faith. There was a war. And the Jews lost. Badly. The vast majority of them fled Israel, their main center of worship in Jerusalem was torn down and razed. 

Most of the time, when stuff like that has happened in history, within a couple generations after losing power and becoming refugees a people tend to end up merging with the population of wherever they fled to. This is why you don't hear so much about the Scythians these days. Not so with the Jews. They stuck together, partially because they had a pretty unique culture that helped them do so (monothesism, a written text of their people's history, laws and religious practices) and partially because they were discriminated against a lot. (More on this in a sec.) There ended up being Jewish communities all over the world --- Ethiopia, India, North Africa, and especially Europe --- which retained their unique culture for hundreds and hundreds of years after losing their home land (The Diaspora, the dispersed people). 

Why were they discriminated against? Because while the Jews were spreading across the globe, Christianity was also on the upswing. And most Christians blamed the Jews for killing Jesus. Around 300 AD, Christianity became the official religion of the Roman empire and spread through pretty much all of Europe. Cue a continent-wide, pathological hatred of Jewish people. (Blood libel, for example.) This lasted --- well, one is tempted to say ""up to now"" --- but certainly all through the middle ages, when Jews were often forced to lived in segregated neighborhoods (ghettos), had discriminatory laws written against them, were expelled wholesale from a couple countries at one time or another (England in 1290, Spain in 1492) and every once in a while in lots of places there'd be random riots where people would get riled up, invade a Jewish neighborhood, and beat a bunch of Jews to death (pogroms). This was basically the situation for Jews in Europe with minor variations up through the 19th century. Hold on to that for a minute. 

Meanwhile, back in the land formerly known as Israel, there were still some Jews left. But following the Roman expulsion lots of people from other nearby colonies moved in and Jews were a very small minority, with most of the rest being a grab-bag of polytheists and Christians and so forth. Around about 500 AD the Roman empire is in decline, local rulers control little bits of its former territory. And then in 600 or so, along comes a guy you may have heard of named Mohammed, who invents a new religion called Islam, and man, is it a hit. By the year 700 or so, basically all of the area we now call the Middle East has been conquered by Mohammed and his followers and gradually begins to convert to Islam (not 100 percent of everybody, but the vast majority of people) including the territory which had been Israel. Around this time, that area is encompassed by a larger area known as ""Palestine.""

So, while the Jews are scattered all over the world being shat on by whoever's in charge, the land that used to be called Israel spends 1,000+ years forming a small part of various Muslim empires, and being lived in and ruled by Muslims, and mostly being referred to as Palestine. This catches us up to the 19th century. 

During the 19th century in Europe, nationalism was a big thing. The countries of Germany and Italy were created --- bascially under the idea that everyone who speaks the same language is a part of one people and each people deserve their own country. Some Jewish leaders noticed this, plus the fact that they were continually being discriminated against, and they said, you know what, fuck it, we're never going to be safe and secure unless the Jewish people have their own country as well. The started a movement called ""Zionism"" which held that Jews from Europe and other place should move back to the area that used to be Israel, start buying land, and work toward creating their own country.

True,zelmerszoetrop,maths,Mathematics | Number Theory &amp; Machine Learning,"Recently (as of late 2012), there has been [some news](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/17/warp-drive-star-trek-feasible_n_1890679.html) that Star Trek style ""warp drives"" - that is, faster-than-light travel - might be closer than previously thought.  What follows is a discussion of ""warp drives"" and what exactly this news means.

The Einstein field equations are a set of differential equations which describe the curvature of space and time in the presence of matter, charge, and pressure.  A solution to these equations is a ""metric,"" or way of calculating spacetime interval (and by extension, curvature, etc.) in the presence of a certain distribution of matter, charge, and pressure.

In the mid-90s, a physicist named Alcubierre came up with a metric that would cut off a region of space from the rest of the universe, and have that region ""ride"" a ""wave"" in such a way that from any reference frames NOT in the cut-off region, the interior of that wave (the ""warp bubble"")would move from point A to B faster than light.  Working backwards from that metric, he calculated the distribution of matter and such that would be necessary. 

This initial solution had several problems.

1. It required more mass-energy than existed in the known universe.
2. It required an equal amount of negative mass-energy, which has not only never been observed, but violates the energy conditions of the universe - a set of supposed rules the universe follows (but we haven't actually proved).
3. There was no way to create the warp bubble - the mass and negative mass would have to be placed superluminally in the first place (ie, you'd need a warp drive to build your warp drive)
4. There was no way to stop the warp drive once it was started, since the warp bubble itself was causally disconnected from its interior.
5. The mass and negative mass would need to be confined to an astonishingly small region - a shell around your starship only a Planck length thick.
6. Once you arrived at your destination, and IF you could shut off your drive (see issue 4), you would spray radiation all over your destination.

The recent news about warp drives is that issue 1, and part of 5, has been solved.  Over the years, the requirements have been brought down, at first to a few solar masses, then to a few Jupiter masses, and now, to a modest few hundred kilograms of mass-energy.  While the greatest conversion of mass into energy that mankind has ever achieved was the Tsar Bomba, which was, if I recall correctly, about 3 kilograms, this particular challenge has gone from *theoretical* to *industrial*.  Part of this advancement came from having a time-varying distribution of matter, but this discovery led to realization that you could expand the distribution of the positive matter larger than a Plank length - partly addressing issue 5.

Additionally, previous research has reduced the quantity of negative mass-energy to only a few milligrams.  This could mean one of two things: if negative mass turns out to be a possible thing, this could be very important if it is hard to produce; if negative mass turns out to be an impossible thing, well, a milligram of unicorns blood is just as imaginary as unicorns.  The only known effect even close to negative energy is the Casimir effect, and it's not quite there yet.  If negative energy is possible, this reduction in the requirements for it completely solves issue 2.  

Furthermore, it is possible to create the warp bubble without placing either the mass or negative mass superluminally if we could form something called a ""naked singularity.""  Naked singularities can be looked up on Wikipedia for those with some familiarity with popular physics; for those unfamiliar, suffice to say that a naked singularity is a black hole without the black, and that most physicists think they are impossible, even going so far as to hypothesize a ""cosmic censorship hypothesis"" that clothes every singularity with an event horizon.  If naked singularities are possible, this would solve issue 3.

All of this progress has come from modifications of Alcubierre's original metric.  One could further ask about the other stumbling blocks (4,5, and 6, above): Can a modification be found so that the bubble is not causally disconnect from the interior, so that you can turn your warp drive off (issue 4)?  Can a modification be found that allows the ""thickness"" of the negative mass-energy shell to be significantly greater, so it is feasible (issue 5)?  Can a modification be found that does not irridate your destination (issue 6)?  To all of these, the answer is simply who knows what the future holds.

At the end of the day, whether you think a warp drive would ever be possible is the same as saying whether you believe time travel is possible.  If you have a warp drive, you have a time machine; if you have a time machine, you have a warp drive.  They are one and the same.  

Some people - some very smart people - suspect Stephen Hawking has the right of it with his [chronology protection conjecture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronology_protection_conjecture), which states that time travel is a fundamental impossibility on any but the smallest scales.  Other people - also very smart people - suspect that time travel, and hence warp drives, may be possible, within the constraints of something called the [Novikov self-consistency principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novikov_self-consistency_principle), which states that time travel may be possible, but time paradoxes are not - you can't kill your own grandpa in 1930, and you know you can't because 1930 already happened and he survived.

While I would say the majority of scientific suspicions lie with Hawking and his no-time-travel, no-warp-drive, no-nonsense approach, the debate is hardly settled, and there are many people who think that both warp-drives and time travel may someday be possible.  

Perhaps, if and when a theory of quantum gravity is discovered, these debates can be laid to rest.  For now, I try treat every new claim with healthy skepticism during the day, and dream about captaining the Enterprise at night.",0,1348005183,,0,1377639272,1,c6a3xm3,t3_103mwp,t1_c6a3xm3,t3_103mwp,,1429932567,217,False,askscience,t5_2qm4e,217

Tupac was fucked from the begging though. He had too many enemies and came from too much of a volatile political family. He spent most of his childhood on the run from the FBI as they where tracking his step father [Mutulu Shakur](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutulu_Shakur) who was on the ten most wanted list for domestic terrorism. His own mother, spent time in prison on a trial for plotting to blow up New York police departments with the infamous panther 21. His God father was [geronimo pratt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geronimo_Pratt) who was targeted by the FBI illegal Cointelpro. And his god mother is [Assata Shakur](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assata_Shakur) who is also wanted for domestic terrorism, that Tupacs step-dad broke her out of prison and is now living in Cuba. Bush in 2003 put a $1 million reward on her head during the revival of targeting domestic terrorists at the start of the war on terror. In 2011, [Jon Stewart and Bill O'Reilly](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=Im8WhG-8FGw#t=91s) had an argument over her, as Obama invited an artist to the white house who supported Assata Shakur. Fox was trying to make that out that by default the president supports her too.  Tupac comes from a very serious committed family, and as a teenager he was the national chairman of the new african panthers, so he was on route to be the next leader of the movement.

Lets look at Tupacs life.

* Spent his childhood running from the FBI due to the actions of the Shakurs.
* At 16 became the youngest national Chairman of the New African panthers, himself then getting FBI attention. His FBI file, only 104 pages out of 4000 are released to the public, the rest 3896 pages are censored for ""National Security"".
* Quit the New African Panthers when he believed the Nation of Islam infiltrated it, the next leader after Shakur was surprise surprise, a member of the NOI.
* Got into a constant war of words with the Nation of Islam throughout his rap career. They would follow him everywhere, trying to make it look like they where associated with him. To get his approval, because he was a Shakur. Tupac hated the Nation of Islam because his family where connected to Malcolm X, and his family blame the Nation for his assassination. 
* Became famous to the general public when released 2pacalyspe now, becoming the legendary rapper. Immediately denounced by the Vice President Dan Quayle due to its anti-american political content. It was obvious they knew who he was by his second name, even if the average rap fan didn't.
* Gets mentioned by name at the Republican Nation Convention 
*  From the help of Mutulu Shakur from prison, starts a movement entitled ""Thug Life"". Tupac helps enforce truces between rival gangs, including the bloods and the crips under ""Thug Life"". The plan was to get them to stop killing each other, unite, police their communities, and eventually fight the government. He was seducing gang bangers and trying to turn them into soldiers. After that his life turns to shit and seems to be getting arrested and targeted by police on a weekly basis, most of which is was baseless, but people only remember him getting arrested, not acquitted. His ""out of control"" image increases. 
* Two Police officers are beating a black motorist. Tupac approaches them and they fire shots at him. Tupac goes back to his car and gets his gun and returns fire, hitting both officers, one in the thigh and one in the buttocks. The charges are dropped against Tupac when it turns out both officers are intoxicated, and the gun they used to fire against Tupac was stolen from an evidence locker. Everyone else just remembers ""Tupac shot two cops"".
* From the help of Dan Quayle and other Republicans, they persuade family members of slain cops to sue Tupac over his music, stating that his music causes the violence. Seriously, [here is even a court video of one of the cases against him in 1995](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vigPk9n5-50) 
* The republicans convince Time Warner to drop interscope records due to Tupac being one of their artists. 
* Two criminals, Haitian Jack and James ""Henchman"" Rosemand try to extort Tupac. He tells them to fuck off and ends up on their hit list. Both later turn out to be working for the FBI since the late 80s until the late 90s.
* Haitian Jack (The FBI Agent) introduces Tupac to a woman, the same woman accuses Tupac of rape and sexual assault. 
* Tupac gets shot by the orders of James Rosemand (another FBI Agent) 5 times in 1994, survives.
* Goes to prison for sexual assault, but found innocent of rape. Released after 11 months when new evidence helping prove his innocence is found. The prosecution states they ""lost it"" and it was not deliberate.
* The Jewish Defense League (JDL) threaten to kill Tupac due to his familys politics. He tells them to fuck off. This is in Tupacs (released) FBI files.
* Tupac refuses to remain silent about Jimmy Henchman and Haitian Jack, announces them as FBI informers, and publicly humiliates any other rappers being extorted by them, or associated with them (Biggie, Puffy, etc).  
* The causes many eastcoast rappers and street gangsters to dislike Tupac.

True,Doctor_Science_Jr,,,"The type of kleptomania being displayed here is fascinating. I've seen this sort of thing before in neglected kids, and it's well, it's *interesting.*

 Just a few points to consider; 

 If you have a child who has been left up to their own devices for long periods of time, you may have someone who doesn't feel safe without a stash of provisions. It's even in the descriptor- 'squirrelling away' small food items (so the squirrel doesn't starve in the winter).

 Established rules are well and good, but be open to change. Rules are arbitrary, intellectual things that don't really help satisfy emotional needs. She may need goods on hand in order to feel safe, and she may need a hidey-hole because she's used to other people (i.e. legitimately hungry siblings) raiding her 'stash'. 

 To me it seems that getting rid of the the real problem (unhygenic food storage and garbage) is important, but not at the expense of the feeling of being secure, which she will doubtlessly find a way to satisfy anyway. Traditionalism needs to be met with healthy adaptation. Have you tried something like a cheap minifridge? Maybe even with a small lock? A place for her to store food, and a maintenence check every few weeks to ensure things are being kept safely. 

 You can't really 'punish away' kleptomania. It has a variety of different influences and factors. It soothes a drive. It manifests in trauma, uncertainty, anxiety and depression. That isn't to say it vanishes completely without those factors, but the feelings are often reduced in environments of comfort and clarity (which is often a catch 22, as hostile social environments are created by in-house theft). 

 As far as punishments go, I would probably stop focusing on the absense theory of punishment. It's common to take away things, but if you're dealing with a child of neglect, living with nothing or going without has already been normalized. Active punishments, like extra chores or duties or more likely to result in rehabilitation. Letters of apology for theft (I'm sorry I did x, I realize that made you feel x, and I like it most when you feel x. I am willing to do x for you, to show that I am sorry.) for example, force a child to think through the consequences of their actions, and come up with positive ways to socially interact with others.

 Taking away things simply enforces the idea the neglected child's security and wellbeing are precarious, and that emotional support and affection may be revoked at any time (as was likely the case in reality). Promote consequences (if you do x, then y will occur) but ensure that those consequences are pointed towards meaningful contribution. 

 Try to stay away from the ideas that love, affection and (basic) food are conditional, and dependant on behavior. Trust reduces anxiety, and reduced anxiety leads to less testing of one's social framework.

 That ring story is very interesting. It's tempting to simply lay down the 'family law' in regards to a child, and expect them to comply in order to find acceptance in the new structure. Always remember that the opposite is in play, that even though a person may have been debilitated by powerlessness, they still have rules and the 'law' that must be followed in order to have the new family be accepted by the child.  To me the story of the ring is the child showing that the new family, at least to some extent, has been accepted as family by the child. 

 I'm not sure if you have ever had the experience of truly living on charity, but it is not a pleasent one. And yet, you cannot expect a child to maintain feelings of obsequiousness at all times, as growing children need to develop independance, identity and autonomy. 

 Just a note to enure that the idea of full acceptance is being given more promotion and effort than 'you exist here only at our grace, remember your place and where you came from'. One tends to produce socially secure children, and the other deviant, manipulative sociopaths who learn how to milk the system to ensure they are cared for.

If the OP wanted a picture, they could have just asked and I could have smiled :) However, I'm not embarrased or even humiliated by the attention [negative and positve] that this picture is getting because, it's who I am. Yes, I'm a baptized Sikh woman with facial hair. Yes, I realize that my gender is often confused and I look different than most women. However, baptized Sikhs believe in the sacredness of this body - it is a gift that has been given to us by the Divine Being [which is genderless, actually] and, must keep it intact as a submission to the divine will. Just as a child doesn't reject the gift of his/her parents, Sikhs do not reject the body that has been given to us. By crying 'mine, mine' and changing this body-tool, we are essentially living in ego and creating a seperateness between ourselves and the divinity within us. By transcending societal views of beauty, I believe that I can focus more on my actions. My attitude and thoughts and actions have more value in them than my body because I recognize that this body is just going to become ash in the end, so why fuss about it? When I die, no one is going to remember what I looked like, heck, my kids will forget my voice, and slowly, all physical memory will fade away. However, my impact and legacy will remain: and, by not focusing on the physical beauty, I have time to cultivate those inner virtues and hopefully, focus my life on creating change and progress for this world in any way I can.

Pros of the fairtax.

1. It taxes consumption, and avoids taxing savings &amp; investment. This is a good thing.

2. There is a fairness argument here: income taxation penalizes the thrifty. [3](http://www.themoneyillusion.com/?p=7091)
3. There may be large economic efficiency gains from streamlining the tax code. Currently Americans waste 6 billion man-hours yearly and $200 billion in tax preparation. [4](http://money.cnn.com/2011/01/05/pf/taxes/IRS_tax_study/index.htm)

Cons of the fairtax

1. As implemented, it's a really awful way to tax consumption. It's a flat tax at point of sale, combined with a small rebate so that really poor households don't pay any net taxes. It'd be much better to tax consumption progressively, and not at the line-item level.
2. As a flat tax, you'd need a very large tax rate; on the order of 30% at point of sale. Now you have to balance that with the fact that everybody's income also just went up by 25% or more due to the lack of income taxation, so it's hard to say where the total effect on aggregate demand goes. It's probably a wash to a first-order. However, the transition would be really, really messy.

Ideally  to implement a consumption tax: you'd get a tax form, write down your income, write down your savings, subtract the two, and apply a progressive tax scheme to the remainder. That way you avoid

1. The regressivity of point-of-sale taxation (though I find the regressivity overstated for a variety of reasons, but I'll take it as given because I don't want to make that argument tonight)

True,micktravis,,,"Please excuse any typos or grammatical issues.  I just typed this in one sitting and haven't proofread it.  This is part one.  I'll wait for questions and write the second, and last part, then.  This replaces the much shorter, kind of half-assed post that used to be here.

Section A

Like most art forms there are two components to photography:  the technical part and the aesthetic part.  Traditionally with any art form a great deal of time is spent on the rudiments before anything of merit can be produced: a lot of piano practice and theoretical study is required before playing or composing a complex piece.  Sculpture, painting – they're all the same in this respect:  people generally learn the craft before getting good at creating art because the technical stuff is such a barrier to entry.  Learn the basics and the barrier goes away – suddenly your trombone stops making farty noises and you can really learn to play.  Until quite recently this was true of photography – because you had a limited number of shots on a roll of film (typically 24) and it took time and money to see the results it made sense to do a bit of homework so that you wouldn't get 23 dark or blurry shots back.

With the advent of digital cameras there's a trend towards reversing this order.  Because you can pretty much take a camera out of its box, turn it on, point it, and get a picture, in my experience most people buy nice cameras and never learn how to photograph.  I'm a firm believer in learning the (very simple) basics of photography first.  And the way I'm going to explain it requires you take a lot of test shots to make sure you understand what I'm talking about.  As you do this you're going to be stretching your aesthetic muscles without even realizing it.  

Bottom line:  if you and another equally proficient person pick up identical cameras and use them for a month (you following this document and the other guy just mucking about) you will be a dramatically better photographer than the other guy.  I guarantee it.

Ok.  There are three components in every camera:  The lens, the shutter, and the film (or image sensor.)  I'm going to explain in as much detail as you'll probably ever need how each component works, and then how they work together.  As you progress through all of this make sure you have a camera handy to experiment with.  The more you shoot the faster you learn.  And as daunting as this may seem once you “get it” it's all really simple, and you need to know it if you want to be a good photographer.

The three camera parts operate in very simple, predictable ways.  I'll start by explaining each component.




Lenses are actually made up of two components:  the glass part which focuses and zooms, and the aperture, which limits the light which passes through the lens.  First let's figure out the lens part.

Lenses are described by their focal length, measured in millimeters.  The longer the focal length the higher the magnification, and the magnification increases linearly, or proportionally to the focal length.  This means that a 100mm lens provides twice the magnification of a 50mm lens, and a 200mm lens provides 4 times the magnification of a 50mm, and so on.  The focal length is derived from the diameter of a theoretical glass sphere.  Take a 50mm glass sphere and slice a piece off, any piece.   It doesn't matter if you cut it in half or take a tiny contact lens slice.  The resulting piece of glass (flat on one side and curved on the other) is a 50mm lens and they will all have the same magnifying power.  But a simple lens like this is prone to all kinds of optical errors and flaws so camera lenses use multiple glass elements which, when added together, both eliminate many of the flaws and result in the same magnification as the simple single element lens.

Prime lenses have fixed focal lengths.  They don't zoom, but the images they produce are generally of a much higher quality, certainly dollar for dollar.  So a prime lens is described by its focal length:  a single number like 50mm or 35mm.  On a typical DSLR a 35mm lens will produce a field of view that's about as wide as what you see with your naked eye.  Zoom lenses are described by the minimum and maximum focal lengths, like 70-210mm or 24-70mm.  These lenses can operate at any focal length between the first and second numbers.  Beware the incredibly wide range lenses like 20-300mm.  While it might seem like this one lens can do a lot there's generally a tradeoff in quality.  Professional photographers (if they use zooms at all – I rarely do for reasons I'll get into later) generally have 3 zooms, roughly:  18-35mm, 24-70mm, and 70-210mm.  Each one is engineered for optimal image quality over its range, something which can't be said for the tempting 20-300mm cheapie.

Lenses all have a focus ring which can be set manually or automatically.  Auto focus  allows you to pick some high contrast picture element and let the camera do the focusing for you.  It doesn't matter.  If you dial in “5 meters” and stand 5 meters from a tree, the tree will be in focus just as if you let the camera do it for you.  Sometimes it's difficult to find something to focus on so manual focus will be your only option.  This differs from camera to camera and playing around with it is the only way to know when to switch to manual focus.  For the time being stick to auto.  There's more to focus which I'll get into when I explain how this all fits together.  

Lenses all have apertures at the camera side of the lens housing.  An aperture is like the pupil in your eye – it's a (roughly) circular opening that can change size from small to large.  Obviously the bigger the opening the more light gets through, and vice versa.  The way the aperture is measured is a bit tricky but worth understanding.  Short form:  it's precisely the opposite of what you would think.  

The aperture size is measure in f-stops.  The f-stop is derived by taking the focal length and dividing by the actual diameter of the size of the opening.  Because the opening is the denominator the bigger the f-stop the smaller the aperture, and vice versa.  This is very important:  f/22 is tiny, and f/2.8 is huge.  It will take a little while to get used to this so just keep in mind that, with aperture, small is big and big is small.

If you think about this for a second you'll realize that the actual size of the aperture opening to let through a specific amount of light for a 50mm lens is smaller than the size required for a 100mm lens.  This is why the formula includes the focal length.  F/2.8 on a 50mm lens lets exactly the same amount of light through as f/2.8 on a 100mm lens, but the opening on the 100mm lens is twice as large as on the 50mm.   F-stops allow you to forget about the focal length because they are universal.

Another tricky thing is the fact that, in a zoom lens, the aperture opening size for f/2.8 at 24mm is a lot smaller than the size of f/2.8 at 70mm.  A lot of clever engineering is required to make a zoom lens that can open up to f/2.8 all the way from its shortest to longest focal lengths.  Such lenses exist but they are expensive.  Typically a cheaper zoom can't open up as wide at the longest range, so these zooms are described with both minimum and maximum focal lengths, and the maximum aperture at each end of the focal range, like 70-210mm f/4.5-5.6.  This means you can open up the aperture to 4.5 when it's zoomed all the way out, but only to 5.6 (which is smaller, remember?) when you zoom in.  Zoom halfway in and the maximum aperture will be somewhere between 4.5 and 5.6.

Why the weird f-stop numbers?  Why not easier numbers like 2, 3, and 4?  There's actually no reason other than convention and one other thing:  each f-stop results in precisely half (or double) the amount of light passing through.  Many lenses have half or even quarter stops you can dial in but here is a list of full stops.  Compare these to what your lens can do.

1  1.4  2  2.8  4  5.6  8  11  16  22  32 ….

You may notice that these numbers correspond to 1/sqrt(2)^0, 1/sqrt(2)^1, etc.

Some lenses will have f-stops in between these numbers (most will, actually.)  And you don't need to memorize these full-stops, although you will end up knowing them anyway.  1.4 lets in half as much light as 1.  4 lets in twice as much light as 5.6.  It's pretty simple, and it doesn't matter what lens you use.  F/4 is f/4 is f/4.

So you've got a lens that can focus light onto a plane that sits somewhere behind the back of the lens.  This light passes through the lens elements, through the aperture, and hits what used to be a piece of film but is now a digital sensor.  This sensor is designed to require a specific amount of light in order to produce a properly exposed image.  More on sensors in a moment, because before the light passes through the lens and hits the sensor it has to get past the shutter.

True,bobbyfiend,,,"One of the points that resonated with me from this piece (in addition to what has already been discussed here) was the question hanging in the air: to what extent does suffering confer authority? Eng has suffered immensely, so does that mean his version of events should not be challenged? 

This came up for me recently in a different context. A friend of mine posted from Afghanistan (he's retired military and now a contractor of some sort doing business there) that we needed to thank our troops because, if they weren't fighting the terrorists over there, all those car bombings and civilian attacks would be happening ""on American soil!"" I took him to task on his last assertion; I don't believe it but, more importantly, I don't believe he has the privileged knowledge to *know* that it is true. Some of his buddies (I guess) responded with what I consider pretty standard patriotism-intimidation language, and I left the conversation. I felt like there was a blowtorch-level disdain or even contempt for questioning a *soldier* about *terrorists.* I started wondering if it's reasonable to believe that, due to being ""on the ground"" and suffering for the nation, soldiers should get an automatic aura of authority when they make prognostications of the behavior of their enemies. For that matter, should sexual abuse victims be considered experts on sexual abuse prevention or the treatment of sex offenders? Should teachers be given a privileged voice in interpreting the data that drives education policy? And, of course, should victims of genocide be deferred to, when discussing factual matters relating to the war crimes they experienced, even when empirical evidence seems to cast doubt on their claims?

I think, as demonstrated well (though, of course, the sensitivity can be questioned) by this RL episode and the comments here, victimhood is a mixed bundle of things. Most people probably don't think, rationally, that being a victim of a horrible act should allow you to truly dictate reality, but most people also think victims should be treated with sensitivity and respect.

For me where it gets the messiest is in the fact that people don't like certain kinds of victims, though they are forced--in public--to treat their suffering with respect; and they often use factual issues as a proxy (or something) for their discomfort. I think this applies to victims whose experiences highlight things we don't want to think about, and the suffering of the Hmong may fit that profile in various ways. Many people in the US seem to look for ways to dismiss the suffering of sexual abuse victims, of the poor, of victims of US military policy, etc.; and it's plausible to me that there may be a tendency to dismiss the suffering of a group of indigenous people from the other side of the world who remind us of the ugly details of the Vietnam war and its aftermath. And one way to rationalize (though, clearly, not justify) dismissing someone else's suffering is to question some part of their narrative or their interpretation of their circumstances. Aiken conflated ""forcible rape"" with ""legitimate rape,"" for example; some conservatives assume that anyone who is poor is simply not trying hard enough; Middle Eastern citizens of repressive regimes simply don't care enough to exercise their political power; etc. 

Questioning the narrative that yellow rain was chemical warfare might be seen as (and might actually function as) a means to dismiss or minimize the genocide that the Hmong experienced. It's not logical, but it is how human social hiveminds work. Eng may not have had the physical facts on his side in protesting RL's interrogation of his interpretation of events, but perhaps he had a better understanding of the social reality and potential consequences of such interrogation.

The spiritual pain of Jesus' soul on the cross is what horrified Jesus in Gethsamane but He endured it for YOU!  

You may loathe God now for putting you in this position but trust that He is good and that all that happens to us in this life is done to make us into the image of Jesus and bring God glory.  Even in the most extreme suffering the Christian can say ""I trust God"" because we know God is good and will never cause us to suffer in vain.  If you've placed your trust in Jesus for the forgiveness of your sins God is actively shaping and molding you into the image of Jesus until the day that *God* says it's time and He brings you home.  

You can be sure of God's love for you because He has not dealt with you according to your sins.  If you truly got what your sins deserve you *would* be in hell and you would be in constant agony exponentially greater that what you're experiencing now, and without any hope.  **But you do have hope!**  You have Jesus!  Because of the hope of Jesus and the forgiveness of your sins you can have confidence that whatever pain you have in this life it is the closest to hell you'll ever be because you're part of God's family!  The sufferings of this life will be forgotten when compared to the glory of heaven and dwelling forever with God.  (Do not see that as a further reason to contemplate suicide!)  If I may quote Revelation 2:7, *""He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one who conquers I will grant to eat of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God.’""*

God gives us His Holy Spirit to overcome all of life's trials and sufferings!  As Paul says in Romans 8:37, *""We are more than conquerors through Him who loves us""*  This is the same spirit that raised Christ Jesus from the dead!  Through the Holy Spirit we can become *more than conquerors*!  Christians literally have the power of God dwelling inside them to fight all of life's tough battles.  Your suffering is intense and unyielding, but God is stronger!

I hope you consider the words I've just typed and not lose hope.  While we live there is always hope because we have Jesus and the promise of eternal life and the forgiveness of our sins.  Let me close with some of the sweetest verses from all of Scripture, Romans 8:35-39,
&gt;	Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword? As it is written,
	“For your sake we are being killed all the day long;
		we are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered.”
	No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. For I am sure that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers, nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.

I'm praying for you brother!  Don't lose hope!  You have God on your side who is far stronger than your suffering!",0,1348840376,,0,False,1,c6enqzi,t3_10lnm5,t1_c6enqzi,t3_10lnm5,,1430012563,4,False,Christianity,t5_2qh6c,4
True,_gtz_,,,"As others have said, it's fine that the sexy options are there. Totally fine! The problem is choice. 

I'm genuinely *bored* by the endless battlekinis and combat heels. I love when I get to keep a reasonably feminine silhouette but have her covered in armour and oversized gear and vicious spikes. I also love being able to add scars and menacing stares -- why is it so hard to find anything truly monstrously/ugly feminine, as opposed to the uniformly beautiful?

In my mind, my characters are the sexiest and most compelling when they look like they are going to *fuck your shit up*, as opposed to providing easy-target cleavage windows. ""Fuck your shit up"" classes are what I play, and running in combat heels makes no sense for my playstyle.",0,1348845879,,0,False,1,c6ep0vq,t3_10lwh5,t1_c6ep0vq,t3_10lwh5,,1430013153,23,False,GirlGamers,t5_2rfec,23
