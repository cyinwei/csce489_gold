I just started poking around reddit a couple of days ago, and follow /r/atheism.  I've been rather surprised at what I've seen here.  Surprised because atheists are a group that are often stereotyped in negative ways, stigmatized, etc.  And what I've seen on the front page from /r/atheism, more often than not, are things attacking Christianity because it is anti-logic, anti-homosexual -- even racist?

On the one hand, I understand why people say that.  There are stupid people in every group, and Christianity isn't immune.  Sadly it seems that stupid ""Christians"" are adept at getting cameras and microphones pointed at them.

It bothers this Christian as much as -- no, more than --  any of you to see a gay person get a vaguely threatening Bible verse on his car.

Actually, I think many Christians (or religious folks in general) have a lot more in common with atheists than is commonly acknowledged on either group.  Both groups are broad and diverse.

Personally, I am an advocate for gay marriage, a strong pacifist, one that thinks that religious people that get hung up about who others are having sex with are seriously missing the point, a person that doesn't think that atheists are going to hell, a person that doesn't agree with many formulations of hell in the first place, a person that embraces thinking and questioning, a person that doesn't think that any particular belief brings eternal happiness, someone that isn't bothered by whether his friends are religious or not, someone that thinks the Bible is not meant to be and can not be taken as literally true, and still a Christian and -- yes -- even a Kansan.  So there's only one point that paragraph that would make me seem to be different from others here.

Some Christians choose to take the Bible literally.  Some choose to take Genesis literally.  Others, such as me, don't, for probably the same reasons that you don't.

I had the opportunity to ask then-Sen. Sam Brownback a question at a town hall once.  This was as he was contemplating a run for governor of Kansas.  I asked him along the lines of, ""How can you reconcile opposition to health care for all with your religious beliefs, which mandate support for 'the least of these' and the poor?""  I didn't get a good answer, and frankly I to this day do not understand Christians that are opposed to universal health care.

The full story of that little discussion was on my blog at http://changelog.complete.org/archives/1179-sen-brownbacks-visit, along with my favorite ever comment from Brownback: ""This state blows, and it’s got lots of wind, too.""

When we can all stop demonizing (the Linuxer in me would say ""daemonizing"") each other, perhaps the temperature of the rhetoric can go down, and we can all look at each other as simply people.  Not religious people, gay people, atheist people... just people.

True,mr_maroon,,,"If you're going to understand the Klan, you've got to understand that it existed in three distinct iterations: The Klan of the Reconstruction era, the Klan of the 1920s and the Klan of the 1960s - present. 

By the late 1800s the Klan had fallen out of favour and was left to simmer at the very recesses of the American collective consciousness. In 1915, two things happened: In Atlanta Georgia, Leo Frank, a Jewish pencil factory owner was (probably falsely) accused of raping and murdering a 13 girl in his employ. He was awarded the death sentence, but fought it down to a life sentence. A lynch mob formed shortly afterwards, broke him out of prison and hanged him. This contributed to a flashpoint of anti-semitism and 'corruption of values' and incited a media frenzy. At the same time, *Birth of a Nation* was released, which glorified the (now faded) Reconstruction Klan, and propagated ideas like the [Lost Cause] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Cause_of_the_Confederacy).

William Joseph Simmons identified these two events as an opportunity: he was something of a dreamer, and loved the mysticism and ritual of the Klan. It doesn't hurt that he'd made a fortune as a recruiter for the Woodmen of the World, another popular fraternity at the time. (Another point to bear in mind is the popularity of fraternal organisations at the time - they'd become something of a craze). Simmons sought to reform the Klan, and took a number of eager recruits (many of whom had formed the lynch mob that had lynched Frank) to the top of Stone Mountain in the middle of the night, where they lit a cross and performed a ceremony (incidentally, Simmons nabbed the cross lighting idea from a Thomas Dixon novel, which drew on old Scottish traditions). The Second Klan was formed.

Still, Simmons had to market the organization, and here's where we get to the idea of mysticism. Simmons created the titles that are so infamous today, as well as vast majority of the strange rituals and codes (as mentioned, there's no documented evidence of the Klan burning a cross before 1915!). The popularity of fraternity and fundamental human curiosity meant that the weirdness of the organisation tantalised outsiders, and would be part of the reason the Klan would grow to such huge numbers in the 1920s, despite not pursuing an outwardly racial agenda.

True,baddely,,,"It's interesting that, despite how badly you were treated, you still hold up this first, failed non-relationship as true, mad deep love.  It tells me that you think of love as suffering, as drama, as sacrifice, as denial.

Let me tell you something.  Love is kindness, and generosity, taking care, being there for each other, and having sex.  Love is *what you have now.*  Your current girlfriend is a goddamn secular saint.  You might not be with her forever, but she has already done so much for you in the healing department, and you don't even recognize it.  She took a guy whose sexuality had been deeply twisted by the one-two punch of fundamentalism and porn, a guy who had just come out of a traumatic failed first sexual experience and she helped make him into a guy who has successfully sustained a five year relationship.  *Saint*.

You say you're ""angry, jealous and cheated"" that she got to fulfill her sexual desires while you didn't.  That's understandable.  But why are you angry at her, instead of your upbringing?  You should be thankful that she rescued you.  Listen, bro, if this girl hadn't come into your life, you could be a 27-year-old porn-addicted virgin.  You could have had your first sexual experience with a hooker, or with someone as callous and drama-seeking as your first ""girlfriend,"" (a week of cruelty and drama does not a girlfriend make), someone who would have taken your inexperience as a cue to inflict you with yet more mockery and pain.  Instead, you got a sensitive, sane, caring woman who gave you the gift of her healthy sexuality.  You should get down on your knees and thank whatever you think of as your god.

Here's the thing about the secular saint you are lucky enough to be in a relationship with, the saint who thinks sex isn't tied to love.  *She's right*. And you know she's right- you jerk off to porn, and you know that's not love.  In fact, somewhere deep in your fundie brain, you think sex is the *opposite* of love, that sex is the demon tied to angel love's feet.  You're really the one who's separating the two, not her.  She knows that sex is a wonderful, fun biological process, that it is innocent, and that it is much more special when you choose to share it with someone in love.  And *good lord*, she has chosen, of her own free will, to share sex with you in love.

True,[deleted],,,"Good. Fucking. God. I explained to you earlier today why your numbers are meaningless. *They indicate an increase in the background radiation, but do not indicate that this increase is cause for concern.* Let me say that again: there has been a relative increase, but there is **NO** data showing actual radiation levels.

Look at it this way. Say you have a radiation level that is 1% the safe limit. Then someone tells you it increases tenfold. That's not something to worry about because *it's still only 10% of the safe limit*. There is **NO** actual data available showing radiation levels in this area. The only data available shows a relative increase. So we **CANNOT** say that there has been a dangerous increase, only that there has been an increase. 

Until we have data showing actual radiation levels in Sv/h it is *wildly* irresponsible to say there is danger. You **CANNOT** say what the actual radiation level is in Sv/h by only looking at the CPM numbers and not knowing the scale of the counters. It is literally impossible. Why can you not understand this? Why do you persist in fear-mongering?

Edit: Since this comment seems to be rising up to where a bunch of people will see it, I thought I should mention that this appears to be a false reading caused by an equipment malfunction, in case you missed that in the OP's post:

&gt;Update: 6/7/12, 7:45 A.M: - False Alert:  The alert level reading last evening appears to be a false alert from an equipment malfunction.  Here is the station's report:

&gt;""out of control readings on the GeigerGraph screen from about 11:30pm local time that occurred while sleeping. My apologies to all. I have no idea what caused this. Shut down GeigerGraph and restarted. Readings from the Geiger were in the normal range (the Geiger operates on A/C). All cable connections are tight and not loose. Am speculating between the GFI and USB Adapter and some sort of voltage spikes. The uninterruptable power supply UPS had lost power and had died - a tripped GFI. I am not going to leave the system running while not at home until I can determine and fix the problem.""

&gt;By the way, a handful of stations on the Radiation Network feed simultaneously to the Black Cat Systems network, which explains why a high reading was showing on their network at the same time.  But Black Cat works in uR/hr instead of CPM, so their radiation level was lower because of the conversion factor between units of measurement.

True,otherwiseyep,,,"(relix already hit on some of this)

It's hard to explain this to a five-year-old, because there are some fairly abstract concepts involved, but here goes... 

All actual ""money"" is debt. All of it, including monetary gold, etc. (Don't argue with me yet, I'll get to that.)

Imagine a pretend world with no money, some kind of primitive villiage or something. Now let's invent paper money. You can't just print a bunch of paper that says people have to give you stuff, because nobody would honor it. But you *could* print IOUs. Let's walk through this...

- Let's say you're an apple-farmer and I'm a hunter. You want some meat but haven't harvested your crops yet. You say to me, ""hey, go hunt me some meat and I'll give you 1/10th of my apple harvest in the fall"". Fair enough, I give you meat, you owe me apples. There's probably a lot of this kind of stuff going on, in addition to normal barter. In time, standard ""prices"" start to emerge: a deer haunch is worth a bushel of apples, or whatever. 

- Now, let's say a week later, I realize that my kid needs a new pair of shoes more than I need a bushel of apples. I come back to you and say,  ""Hey remember that bushel of apples you owe me? Could you write a marker, redeemable for one bushel of apples, that I can give to the shoemaker in trade for a pair of shoes?"" You say okay, and we have invented a *transferable note*, something a lot like money. 

- In time, our little villiage starts to figure out that a note redeemable for a bushel of apples can be swapped for all kinds of things. The fisherman who doesn't even like apples will accept apple-certificates in trade for fish, because he knows he can trade them to boat-builder who loves apples. In time, you can even start to hire farm-workers without giving them anything except a note promising a cut of the future harvest. 

Now, you are issuing *debt*: a promise to provide apples. The ""money"" is a transferable IOU-- your workers get a promise to provide value equal to a day of farm-work, or whatever, and it's transferrable, so they can use it to buy whatever they want. The worker gets fish from the fisherman, not in exchange for doing any work or giving him anything he can use, but in exchange for an IOU that the fisherman can redeem anywhere. 

So far so good. But there are a couple of forks in the road here, on the way to a realistic monetary system, that we'll address separately:

- What happens if your apple orchard is destroyed in a wildfire? Suddenly all the notes that everyone has been trading are basically wiped out. It didn't ""go"" anywhere, it's just gone, it doesn't exist. Real value was genuinely destroyed. There is no thermodynamic law of the conservation of monetary value-- just as you and I created it by creating transferable debt, it can also be genuinely destroyed. (We'll get back to this in a minute, it gets interesting). 

- The second issue is that, in all probability, the whole town is not *just* trading apple-certificates. I could also issue promises to catch deer, the fisherman could issue promises of fish, and so on. This could get pretty messy, especially if you got the notion to issue more apple-certificates than you can grow: you could buy all kinds of stuff with self-issued debt that you could never repay, and the town wouldn't find out until harvest-time comes. Once again, value has been ""destroyed"" people worked and made stuff and gave you stuff in exchange for something that doesn't exist, and will never exist. All that stuff they made is gone, you consumed it, and there is nothing to show for it.

The above two concerns are likely to become manifest in our village sooner or later, and probably sooner.  This leads to the question of *credit*, which is, at its most basic, a measure of *credibility*. Every time you issue an apple-certificate, you are *borrowing*, with a promise to repay from future apple-harvests. 

After the first couple of town scandals, people will start taking a closer look at the credibility of the issuer. Let's say the town potato-farmer comes up with a scheme where his potato-certificates are actually issued by some credible third-party, say the town priest or whatever, who starts every growing season with a book of numbered certificates equal to the typical crop-yield and no more, and keeps half of the certificate on file, issuing the other half. Now there is an audit trail and a very credible system that is likely to earn the potato-grower a lot of credit, compared to other farmers in town. That means that the potato-grower can probably issue more notes at a better exchange rate than some murkier system. Similarly, the town drunk probably won't get much value for his certificates promising a ship of gold. 

Now we have something like a credit market emerging, and the potato-farmer is issuing something closer to what we might call a modern ""bond""...

True,EliteKill,,,"It seemed like just another day in this never-ending war. The last few historians left (who needs history now, really) agree that it has been going on for at least 1500 years, but their estimates vary. Why does it matter, anyway. The leaders of the remaining superpowers are locked in this pointless struggle, with no breakthrough. I have no idea how the Vikings keep being so consistent over such a long time, but the Communists have had the same family (and principles) in power ever since the war began and over here in America we've hooked up our president to a computer so he could rule forever. What a brilliant plan that was... Each nation is powerful just enough so neither can fall. Every time a city is captured, it is taken the next day. When roads are build in order to help dry up the swamps, they are immediately destroyed. The only way to rebuild our Earth is for someone to win, but that won't happen. At least, that's what I thought until now.

Our forces took another city by dawn. Nothing was special about it, apart from the fact that it was the first time it has been under American control since the war began. It's not that it was heavily guarded, only it was never deemed important enough for capture. As a part of our new military ""strategy"", we had to capture it for the slight chance that an inhabitant over there could have any sort of solution to the famines. We didn't find a man, but we got the solution alright.

I was being escorted into a large house on the outskirts of the city. It was a big, empty mansion, abandoned for generations according to the locals, who think it is haunted and avoid coming near it. Nevertheless, we had to comb the entire town, so someone had to go there. I, a fragile and valuable scientists sent to the front lines to find some way to grow food in the irradiated swamps that make up most of the world now, am accompanied by a small squad to keep me guard against any sort of dangers. They aren't very smart (to be fair, most of the smart people left in this world aren't anywhere near combat) but they provide good company. As we enter the mansion I order them to split up and search the house. If they are to see anything unusual - they are to report it immidiately. All protocol, we have done it a hundred times in the past year alone, and yet I always excited by the fact that I am giving orders to these armed men.

An hour passes and we find nothing, apart from a sprawling library in the basement. While we should move forward to more important targets, the idea of so many books untouched for such a long time intrigues me, along with my guards. We decide to call in a code 4057, which means we found something of interest and will be taking out time exploring it. We didn't expect finding much from the books, but it is a good distraction from the situation outside.

The library is beautiful, modeled after the old ones that were in medieval castles. My guards all pick up some fiction books and start reading to their enjoyment, which surprises me as I never saw them take leisure in books. I go around the bookshelves, searching for something more interesting than mere stories, when an odd book strikes my eyes.

It is labeled ""The Secrets of Life"", without an author. The cover is colored with a strong crimson color and gold linings, and it is huge, at least 3000 large pages. I don't know what prompted me to pick it up, the fact that it could be what we're actually looking for or the amazing aesthetics of its cover, but the moment I lift it up from the bookshelf a loud, rumbling sound is heard.

All of the guards spring to their feet, clinching their rifles reflexively, and turn to me. The bookshelf in front of me starts to turn, introducing a new, secret tunnel that is unlike anything I've seen before. Even though this was probably built thousands of years ago, the hidden tunnel looks like it's from the future. It is a shiny, chrome color with light-blue wires running along the ceiling. We slowly make our way deeper into the ground, when a huge door comes in front of us. I walk to a control panel nearby and pull a big-looking lever, the only intractable object I can see, and the door begins to open slowly sideways, into the wall. Behind it lies a large chamber, empty apart from a huge machine connected to the wires we saw before. The machine is just a cube, around 5 meters a side, with a large screen on the edge towards the door. As I approach it, a keyboard comes out of the cube and the screen turns on.",0,1339502297,,0,1339503870,1,c4zifc3,t3_uxpil,t1_c4zifc3,t3_uxpil,,1429124433,1178,False,gaming,t5_2qh03,1178

True,[deleted],,,"Please note this is a very lengthy story prior to reading.

My story starts off at the age of 20. I recently broke things off with my girlfriend of 2 years and was working a dead end job at Radio Shack. I worked my way up to Asst. Manager. This meant steady hours during the day shift, which sadly lead to more WoW hours for me.

I eventually had work my way up to the ranks of being a Guild Master of my own guild. Silly as it sounds this meant a lot to me back then (6 years ago) Long story short things fell apart with said guild and a few of my friends decided to make new characters on another server start from scratch (rerolling) and make a new raiding progression guild. I was down for it. We had interview processes set in line for new recruits via Ventrilo/Teamspeak etc. One of the new recruits that we thought would be a good addition to the guild was named ""Splicer"" and went by the name of Kim from the get go. We all agreed she would be a good fit for the guild.

About 2 months into this new guild Splicer had worked her ranks up and became a 2nd in command officer along with some of my closest friends and became part of our close ""crew."" We trusted her with everything talked to her about most RL issues like most close friends do.

One night we had a heart to heart and she told me her life story, which at first I thought to be skeptic but as time went on I believed it more and more. The story went like this.

She was currently living with her Aunt who was recently divorced and was fairly poor. However, her mom and dad which she refused to talk about at first were paying for her rent, food and even her WoW subscription. She was a college dropout and felt WoW was her ""escape"" from reality. She later started going into more detail about her parents being ""mobsters"" and having underground gambling rings/casinos what have you. This is where I felt the story was bullshit but after being her friend for 2+ years I just started to believe it.

We exchanged pictures several times. We flirted with each other but never let it escalate beyond that. We talked as if we were dating but rarely was it dirty and never involved any naked pictures or anything of the sort. The pictures she was sending me look like a 18/19 yr old girl skinny attractive etc.

About 2.5 years into knowing her we decided to move in and see if we could turn our friendship into something serious.  By this time I was no longer working for Radio Shack and was eager to start a new life in her small town in PA. I set up plans with my dad to drive 10 hours in one day. About 8 hours into the drive I called her cell to notify her we would be there shortly and I was excited to finally meet her. Sadly she never answered her cell phone. Well I called a few times and said well maybe she's out or busy so I'll call her when I arrive at the address she had given me of our new apartment.

My dad and I arrived at the apartment to find no one was there. I became a little worried but didn't panic. I called her phone about 2 more times and finally she had picked up saying she just woke up from a nap and was very sorry. She then said her Aunt just brought her Escalade to the auto shop and I should just go pick her up and we'll go get a bite to eat. I agreed and hung up.

We pulled up to her driveway to a really run down small home. I called her again told her I was there and I was coming to the front door she agreed. At last I finally was meeting my long time friend and soon life partner. I rang the doorbell and no one came. I waited and rung again and still no one came. I went back to the car confused and my dad called her phone and said ""We travelled a long way so my son can start his life with you. You should get over being shy and greet him already."" My dad got out of the car went to the front and asked me to wait in the car. She came out to greet him and right away I noticed she wasn't the girl I had being seeing pictures of this whole time. She was a much bigger and scarier looking girl. I was terrified. She got in the car with my dad and we drove to local pizza joint.

While we were there my dad kept giving me looks like what the actual fuck are you thinking?!? And I kept giving him looks of terror and that I was scared. While this was happening she was putting her hand on my lap and brushing her nasty boobs against me it nearly made me want to vomit. I mean this girl was REPULSIVE. Eventually I was so freaked out I got up and went to the bathroom where my dad followed me and asked what was up. I explained everything. She wasn't who she pretended to be etc.

We sat back down and not 2 minutes later my dad was getting a called on his cell phone from the local city police. Asking all sorts of questions about a girl named ""Angelica"" and that we abducted her and to return her to her home. The only girl we had with us went by the name ""Kim"" as mentioned before. My dad then said we'll return to Kim's house and figure this all out. The whole back my dad was livid. He was asking Kim all sorts of questions like if her name was Angelica and how old was she. And why she was sending pictures to me of someone else. She remained silent this whole time. I was sweating bullets for the longest 10 minute drive of my life. The police called one more time but Kim took my dad's phone from his hand and hung it up.

Once we arrived at her house there were at least 10 cop cars there waiting for us. As soon as I stepped out of the car the police told me to stop moving and put my hands up. Kim got out of the car and ran to her parents yelling ""WHY DID YOU HAVE TO RUIN THIS I LOVE THIS MAN I LOVE HIM."" I was freaking the fuck out assuming she was underage or something. She admitted to the police she left on her own will and was in fact not abducted. I couldn't look at her, I didn't know what was going on or what to think. All those stories were made up this whole time. The police then began to feel sorry for me and asked the whole story. After about an hour of explaining the entire situation they let my father and me go. My father then went to talk to her parents to figure out what was up as I waited in what seemed forever in his car.

Once he returned he said we were leaving and going back home. He also said that they offered me a place in their home to live with their daughter and were sorry for everything. I quickly declined, not that my dad would have let me leave and or ruin my life with said beast. Her parents then agreed to pay for the entire trip and a lot of hush hush money.

That night my dad and I took turns driving and I knew he felt incredibly sorry for me. I was taken for a fool for over 2.5 years I was lead to believe a bunch of false stories and got to know someone who didn't even exist.

The next day I logged onto my computer logged into the game and told everyone everything despite being paid off. The guild was shocked considering most of them knew her for the same length I had known her. A few poked fun, however most felt terrible. She never logged on from that point on and avoided all contact with me.

Eventually this lead me to realize I had to escape my ""reality"" which sadly was dead end jobs and a video game and do something better with my life. So I decided to join the Air Force. I've been in for 4 years now and have a great life. I assemble bombs/missile/20mm/chaff/flare etc currently for the F-22.

The thing that most people don't know is, after joining the Air Force I felt bored after work and eventually went back to WoW (like most seem to do) I slowly met another person and slowly fell in love again. This time using Skype with a webcam and PHYSICALLY seeing this person talk and PHYSICALLY getting to know them. Eventually I met up with this woman and we hit it off she was who she said she was. That woman and I have been married now for over 2 years. I no longer play WoW and the best part of it is we have a child together. A lot of my close friends know about all of this but I felt this story truly belonged to people of the internet to read and see.",0,1339718693,,0,False,1,c50qtak,t3_v1h8b,t1_c50qtak,t3_v1h8b,,1429145795,27,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,27

True,CaspianX2,,,"Okay, explained like you're a five year-old (well, okay, maybe a bit older), without too much oversimplification, and (hopefully) without sounding too biased:

What people call ""Obamacare"" is actually the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (abbreviated to PPACA or ACA). However, people were calling it ""Obamacare"" before everyone even hammered out what it would *be*. It's a term that was, at first, mostly used by people who didn't like the PPACA, and it's become popularized in part because PPACA is a really long and awkward name, even when you turn it into an acronym like that. Barack Obama has since said that he actually *likes* the term ""Obamacare"" because, he says, ""I do care"".

Anyway, the PPACA made a bunch of new rules regarding health care, with the purpose of making health care more affordable for everyone. Opponents of the PPACA, on the other hand, feel that the rules it makes take away too many freedoms and force people (both individuals and businesses) to do things they shouldn't have to.

So what does it do? Well, here is everything, in the order of when it goes into effect (because some of it happens later than other parts of it):

(*Note: Page numbers listed in citations are the page numbers within the PDF, not the page numbers of the document itself*)

**Already in effect**:

- It allows the Food and Drug Administration to approve more generic drugs (making for more competition in the market to drive down prices) ( [Citation: An entire section of the bill, called Title VII, is devoted to this, starting on page 766](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=766) )

- It increases the rebates on drugs people get through Medicare (so drugs cost less) ( [Citation: Page 235, sec. 2501](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=235) )

- It establishes a non-profit group, that the government doesn't directly control, [PCORI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient-Centered_Outcomes_Research_Institute), to study different kinds of treatments to see what works better and is the best use of money. ( [Citation: Page 684, sec. 1181](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=684) )

- It makes chain restaurants like McDonalds display how many calories are in all of their foods, so people can have an easier time making choices to eat healthy. ( [Citation: Page 518, sec. 4205](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=518) )

- It makes a ""high-risk pool"" for people with pre-existing conditions. Basically, this is a way to slowly ease into getting rid of ""pre-existing conditions"" altogether. For now, people who already have health issues that would be considered ""pre-existing conditions"" can still get insurance, but at different rates than people without them. ( [Citation: Page 49, sec. 1101](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=49), [Page 64, sec. 2704](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=64), and [Page 65, sec. 2702](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=65) )

- It forbids insurance companies from discriminating based on a disability, or because they were the victim of domestic abuse in the past (yes, insurers really did deny coverage for that) ( [Citation: Page 66, sec. 2705](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=66) )

- It renews some old policies, and calls for the appointment of various positions.

- It creates a new 10% tax on indoor tanning booths. ( [Citation: Page 942, sec. 5000B](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=942) )

- It says that health insurance companies can no longer tell customers that they won't get any more coverage because they have hit a ""lifetime limit"". Basically, if someone has paid for health insurance, that company can't tell that person that he's used that insurance too much throughout his life so they won't cover him any more. They can't do this for lifetime spending, and they're limited in how much they can do this for yearly spending. ( [Citation: Page 33, sec. 2711](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=33) )

- Kids can continue to be covered by their parents' health insurance until they're 26. ( [Citation: Page 34, sec. 2714](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=34) )

- No more ""pre-existing conditions"" for kids under the age of 19. ( [Citation: Page 64, sec. 2704](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=64) and [Page 76, sec. 1255](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=76) )

- Insurers have less ability to change the amount customers have to pay for their plans. ( [Citation: Page 47, sec. 2794](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=47) )

- People in the ""Medicare Part D Coverage Gap"" (also referred to as the ""Donut Hole"") get a rebate to make up for the extra money they would otherwise have to spend. ( [Citation: Page 398, sec. 3301](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=398) )

- Insurers can't just drop customers once they get sick. ( [Citation: Page 33, sec. 2712](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=33) )

- Insurers have to tell customers what they're spending money on. (Instead of just ""administrative fee"", they have to be more specific).

- Insurers need to have an appeals process for when they turn down a claim, so customers have some manner of recourse *other* than a lawsuit when they're turned down. ( [Citation: Page 42, sec. 2719](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=42) )

- Anti-fraud funding is increased and new ways to stop fraud are created. ( [Citation: Page 718, sec. 6402](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=718) )

- Medicare extends to smaller hospitals. ( [Citation: Starting on page 363, the entire section ""Part II"" seems to deal with this](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=363) )

- Medicare patients with chronic illnesses must be monitored more thoroughly.

- Reduces the costs for some companies that handle benefits for the elderly. ( [Citation: Page 511, sec. 4202](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=511) )

- A new website is made to give people insurance and health information. (I think this is it: [http://www.healthcare.gov/](http://www.healthcare.gov/) ). ( [Citation: Page 55, sec. 1103](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=55) )

- A credit program is made that will make it easier for business to invest in new ways to treat illness by paying half the cost of the investment. (Note - this program was temporary. It already ended) ( [Citation: Page 849, sec. 9023](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=849) )

- A limit is placed on just how much of a percentage of the money an insurer makes can be profit, to make sure they're not price-gouging customers. ( [Citation: Page 41, sec. 1101](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=41) )

- A limit is placed on what type of insurance accounts can be used to pay for over-the-counter drugs without a prescription. Basically, your insurer isn't paying for the Aspirin you bought for that hangover. ( [Citation: Page 819, sec. 9003](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=819) )

- Employers need to list the benefits they provided to employees on their tax forms. ( [Citation: Page 819, sec. 9002](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=819) )

- Any new health plans must provide preventive care (mammograms, colonoscopies, etc.) without requiring any sort of co-pay or charge. ( [Citation: Page 33, sec. 2713](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=33) )

**1/1/2013**

- If you make over $200,000 a year, your taxes go up a tiny bit (0.9%). **Edit**: To address those who take issue with the word ""tiny"", a change of 0.9% *is* relatively tiny. Any look at how taxes have fluctuated over the years will reveal that a change of less than one percent is miniscule, *especially* when we're talking about people in the top 5% of earners. ( [Citation: Page 837, sec. 9015](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=837) )

**1/1/2014**

This is when a lot of the really big changes happen.

- No more ""pre-existing conditions"". At all. People will be charged the same regardless of their medical history. ( [Citation: Page 64, sec. 2704](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=64), [Page 65, sec. 2701](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=65), and [Page 76, sec. 1255](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=76) )

- If you can afford insurance but do not get it, you will be charged a fee. This is the ""mandate"" that people are talking about. Basically, it's a trade-off for the ""pre-existing conditions"" bit, saying that since insurers now **have** to cover you regardless of what you have, you can't just wait to buy insurance until you get sick. Otherwise no one would buy insurance until they needed it. You can opt not to get insurance, but you'll have to pay the fee instead, unless of course you're not buying insurance because you just can't afford it. (**Note**: On 6/28/12, the Supreme Court ruled that this *is* Constitutional, as long as it's considered a tax on the uninsured and not a penalty for not buying insurance... nitpicking about wording, mostly, but the long and short of it is, it looks like this is accepted by the courts) ( [Citation: Page 164, sec. 5000A](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=164), and [here](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/11pdf/11-393c3a2.pdf) is the actual court ruling for those who wish to read it. )

**Question**: What determines whether or not I can afford the mandate? Will I be forced to pay for insurance I can't afford?

**Answer**: There are all kinds of checks in place to keep you from getting screwed. Kaiser actually has a webpage with a pretty good rundown on it, if you're worried about it. You can see it [here](http://www.kaiserhealthnews.org/Stories/2010/March/22/consumers-guide-health-reform.aspx).

Okay, have we got that settled? Okay, moving on...

- Medicaid can now be used by everyone up to 133% of the poverty line (basically, a *lot* more poor people can get insurance) ( [Citation: Page 198, sec. 2001](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=198) ) (Note: The [recent court ruling](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/11pdf/11-393c3a2.pdf) says that states can opt out of this and that the Federal government cannot penalize them by withholding Medicaid funding, but as far as I can tell, nothing is stopping the Federal government from simply just offering incentives to those who *do* opt to do it, instead)

- Small businesses get some tax credits for two years. (It looks like this is specifically for businesses with 25 or fewer employees) ( [Citation: Page 157, sec. 1421](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=157) )

- Businesses with over 50 employees must offer health insurance to full-time employees, or pay a penalty. ( [Citation: Page 174, sec. 4980H](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=174) )

**Question**: Can't businesses just fire employees or make them work part-time to get around this requirement? Also, what about businesses with multiple locations?

**Answer**: Yes and no. Switching to part-time only won't help to get out of the requirement, as the Affordable Care Act counts the hours worked, not the number of full-time employees you have. If your employees worked an equivalent of 50 full-time employees' hours, the requirement kicks in. Really, the only plausible way a business could reasonably utilize this strategy is if they currently operate with *just* over the 50-employee number, and could still operate with under 50 employees, and have no intention to expand. Also, regarding the questions about multiple locations, [this](http://www.bakerlaw.com/alerts/special-health-care-reform-series-special-focus-on-the-employer-employee-relationship-part-i-8-15-2012/) legal website analyzed the law and claims that multiple locations in one chain all count as a part of the same business (meaning employers like Wal-Mart can't get around this by being under 50 employees in one store - they'd have to be under that for the entire *chain*, which just ain't happening). Independently-owned franchises are different, however, as they have a separate owner and as such aren't included under the same net as the parent company. However, any individual franchise with over 50 employees *will* have to meet the requirement.

Having said that, the ACA only requires employers to offer insurance to full-time employees, so theoretically they could get out of this by reducing all employees to 29 hours or fewer a week. However, if any employees' hours go above that, their employer will have to provide insurance or pay the penalty. And also, this is putting aside how an employer only offering part-time work with no insurance will affect how competitive they are on the job market, especially when small businesses with 25 or fewer employees actually get that aforementioned tax credit to help pay for insurance if they choose to get it (though they are not required to provide insurance).

- Insurers now can't do annual spending caps. Their customers can get as much health care in a given year as they need. ( [Citation: Page 33, sec. 2711](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=33) )

- Limits how high of an annual deductible insurers can charge customers. ( [Citation: Page 81, sec. 1302](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=81) )

- Health insurance cannot discriminate against women on pricing or plan availability ( [Citation: Page 185, sec. 1557](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=185) )

- Reduce costs for some Medicare spending, which in turn are put right back into Medicare to increase its solvency. Most notably, this bill reduces the amount that Medicare Advantage pays to be more in line with other areas of Medicare ( Citation: [Page 384, Sec. 3201](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=384) and [Page 389, Sec. 3202](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=389) ), and reduces the growth of Medicare payments in the future ( [Citation: Page 426, Sec. 3402](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=426) ). The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that between 2012 and 2022, this will amount to $716 Billion in reduced spending ( [Citation: CBO Estimate](http://cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/43471-hr6079.pdf) ). Also being cut is $22 Billion from the Medicare Improvement Fund, most likely because the PPACA does a lot of the same stuff, so that spending would be redundant ( [Citation: Page 361, Sec. 3112](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=361) ).

- Place a $2500 limit on tax-free spending on FSAs (accounts for medical spending). Basically, people using these accounts now have to pay taxes on any money over $2500 they put into them. ( [Citation: Page 820, sec. 9005](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=820) )

- Establish health insurance exchanges and rebates for the lower and middle-class, basically making it so they have an easier time getting affordable medical coverage. ( [Citation: Page 107, sec. 1311](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=107) )

- Congress and Congressional staff will only be offered the same insurance offered to people in the insurance exchanges, rather than Federal Insurance. Basically, we won't be footing their health care bills any more than any other American citizen. ( [Citation: Page 100, sec. 1312](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=100) )

- A new tax on pharmaceutical companies.

- A new tax on the purchase of medical devices.

- A new tax on insurance companies based on their market share. Basically, the more of the market they control, the more they'll get taxed.

- Raises the bar for how much your medical expenses must cost before you can start deducting them from your taxes (Thanks to Redditor cnash6 for the correction!).

**1/1/2015**

- Doctors' pay will be determined by the quality of their care, not how many people they treat. **Edit**: a_real_MD addresses questions regarding this one in far more detail and with far more expertise than I can offer in [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/vb8vs/eli5_what_exactly_is_obamacare_and_what_did_it/c537rqi). If you're looking for a more in-depth explanation of this one (as many of you are), I highly recommend you give his post a read.

**1/1/2017**

- If any state can come up with their own plan, one which gives citizens the same level of care at the same price as the PPACA, they can ask the Secretary of Health and Human Resources for permission to do their plan instead of the PPACA. So if they can get the same results without, say, the mandate, they can be allowed to do so. Vermont, for example, has expressed a desire to just go straight to single-payer (in simple terms, everyone is covered, and medical expenses are paid by taxpayers). ( [Citation: Page 117, sec. 1332](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=117) )

**2018**

- All health care plans must now cover preventive care (not just the new ones).

- A new tax on ""Cadillac"" health care plans (more expensive plans for rich people who want fancier coverage). ( [Citation: Page 812, Sec. 9001](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=812) )

**2020**

- The elimination of the ""Medicare gap""

.

Aaaaand that's it right there.

The biggest thing opponents of the bill have against it is the mandate. They claim that it forces people to buy insurance, and forcing people to buy something is unconstitutional. Personally, I take the opposite view, as it's not telling people to buy a specific thing, just to have a specific type of thing, just like a part of the money we pay in taxes pays for the police and firemen who protect us, this would have us paying to ensure doctors can treat us for illness and injury.

Plus, as previously mentioned, it's necessary if you're doing away with ""pre-existing conditions"" because otherwise no one would get insurance until they needed to use it, which defeats the purpose of insurance.

Of course, because so many people are arguing about it, and some of the people arguing about it don't really care whether or not what they're saying is true, there are a lot of things people think the bill does that just aren't true. Here's a few of them:

**Obamacare has death panels!**: That sounds so cartoonishly evil it must be true, right? Well, no. No part of the bill says anything about appointing people to decide whether or not someone dies. The decision over whether or not your claim is approved is still in the hands of your insurer. However, now there's an appeals process so if your claim gets turned down, you can challenge that. And the government watches that appeals process to make sure it's not being unfair to customers. So if anything the PPACA is trying to *stop* the death panels. ( [Citation: Page 42, sec. 2719](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=42) )

**What about the Independent Medicare Advisory Board? Death Panels!**: The Independent Medicare Advisory Board (which has had its name changed to Independent Payment Advisory Board, or IPAB) is intended to give recommendations on how to save Medicare costs per person, deliver more efficient and effective care, improve access to services, and eliminate waste. However, they have no real power. They put together a recommendation to put before Congress, and Congress votes on it, and the President has power to veto it. What's more, they are specifically told that their recommendation will not ration health care, raise premiums or co-pays, restrict benefits, or restrict eligibility. In other words, they need to find ways to save money *without* reducing care for patients. So no death panels. In any sense of the (stupid) term.  ( [Citation: Page 426, sec. 3403](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=426) )

**Obamacare has health care rationing!**: ""Rationing"" is just a fancier way of saying ""Death Panels"". And no, it doesn't. (See above).

**Obamacare has an un-elected panel of people who will decide what kind of care I can get!**: Yet another way of saying ""Death Panels"", albeit a softer way of saying it. It's true that the IPAB is appointed, not elected. However, they are expressly forbidden from reducing or rationing care. (Again, see above).

**Obamacare gives free insurance to illegal immigrants!**: Actually, there are multiple parts of the bill that specifically state that the recipient of tax credits and other good stuff *must* be a legal resident of the United States. And while the bill doesn't specifically forbid illegals from buying insurance or getting treated at hospitals, neither did the laws in the US before the PPACA. So even at worst, illegals still have just as much trouble getting medical care as they used to. ( [Citations: Page 141, sec. 1402](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=141), [Page 142, sec. 1411](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=142), [Page 144, sec. 1411](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=144), [Page 151, sec. 1412](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=151) )

**Obamacare uses taxpayer money for abortions!**: One part of the bill says, essentially, that the folks who wrote this bill aren't touching that issue with a ten foot pole. It basically passes the buck on to the states, who can choose to allow insurance plans that cover abortions, or they can choose to not allow them. Obama may be pro-choice, but that is not reflected in the PPACA. ( [Citation: Page 64, sec. 1303](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=64) )

**Obamacare forces churches/taxpayers to pay for women to have free birth control!**: This claim refers to [Page 33, sec. 2713](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=33), which says that health insurance must include preventive care for women supported by the Health Resources and Services Administration. And that Administration, on the recommendation of the independent Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Science, has determined that preventive care for women should include access to well women visits, domestic violence screening, and, yes, contraception. So insurers *do* have to provide these services, and no, they *cannot* require their insured to pay for them. This is because birth control, particularly its effects on hormones and stuff, are very important to the health of some women. ""But what if I, as a taxpayer, don't want to pay for it?"" you ask? You don't. It's provided by the health insurance company, not the government. ""But what about employers who provide employee plans? Does that mean a church would have to pay for the birth control of its clergy?"" you ask? The answer is ""no"". On February 10, 2012 (or February 15th, if you go by the header in the document), the Department of Health and Human Services issued [this document](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2012-02-15/pdf/2012-3547.pdf), detailing its enforcement of that section of the ACA. [Kaiser](http://policyinsights.kff.org/2012/february/insurance-coverage-of-contraceptives.aspx) has given their own interpretation of this. The short version is, churches and houses of worship are exempt from this rule, period. Other religious employers (like Catholic hospitals) are also exempt until August 2013, by which time insurance providers are to have created special plans specifically for them, that put all the costs of contraception on the insurer, with none on the employee *or* the employer. So not one cent of taxpayer money is going towards contraception, nor is a single cent of a church's money paying for contraception either. Birth control is to be provided to women *by the insurer*.

**Obamacare won't let me keep the insurance I have!**: The PPACA actually very specifically says you can keep the insurance you have if you want. ( [Citation: Page 74, sec. 1251](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=74) )

**Obamacare will make the government get between me and my doctor!**: The PPACA very specifically says that the Secretary of Health and Human Services (who is in charge of much of the bill), is absolutely not to promote any regulation that hinders a patient's ability to get health care, to speak with their doctor, or have access to a full range of treatment options. ( [Citation: Page 184, sec. 1554](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=184) )

**Obamacare has a public option! That makes it bad!**: The public option (which would give people the *option* of getting insurance from a government-run insurer, thus the name), whether you like it or not, was taken out of the bill before it was passed. You can still see where it *used* to be, though. ( [Citation: Page 111, sec. 1323 (the first one) ](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=111) )

**Obamacare will cost trillions and put us in massive debt!**: The PPACA will cost a lot of money... at first. $1.7 Trillion. Yikes, right? But that's just to get the ball rolling. You see, amongst the things built into the bill are new taxes - on insurers, pharmaceutical companies, tanning salons, and a slight increase in taxes on people who make over $200K (an increase of less than 1%). Additionally, the bill cuts some stuff from Medicare that's not really working, and generally tries to make everything work more efficiently. Also, the increased focus on preventative care (making sure people don't get sick in the first place), should help to save money the government already spends on emergency care for these same people. Basically, by catching illnesses early, we're not spending as much on emergency room visits. According to the Congressional Budget Office, who studies these things, the ultimate result is that this bill will reduce the yearly deficit by $109 billion ( [Source](http://www.cbo.gov/publication/43471) ). By the year 2021, the bill will actually have paid itself and started *bringing in* more money than it cost.

**Obamacare is twice as long as War and Peace!**: War and Peace is 587,287 words long. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, depending on which version you're referring to, is between 300,000-400,000 words long. Don't get me wrong, it's still very long, but it's not as long as War and Peace. Also, it bears mention that bills are often long. In 2005, Republicans passed the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users, 2005, which was almost as long as the PPACA, and no one raised a stink about it.

**The people who passed Obamacare didn't even read it!**: Are you kidding? They had been reading it over and over for a half a year. This thing was being tossed around in debates for ages. And it went through numerous revisions, but every time it was revised, it was just adding, removing, or changing small parts of it, not rewriting the whole thing. And every time it was revised, the new version of the bill was published online for everyone to see. The final time it was edited, there may not have been time to re-read the entire thing before voting on it, but there wasn't a *need* to, because everyone had already read it all. The only thing people needed to read was the revision, which there was plenty of time to do.

**Pelosi said something like, ""we'll have to pass the bill before reading it""!**: The actual quote is ""we have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it, away from the fog of controversy"", and she's talking about all the lies and false rumors that were spreading about it. Things had gotten so absurd that by this point many had given up on trying to have an honest dialogue about it, since people kept worrying about things that had no basis in reality. Pelosi was simply trying to say that once the bill is finalized and passed, then everyone can look at it and see, without question, what is actually in the thing (as opposed to some new amendment you heard on the radio that they were going to put in).

**Obamacare was signed quietly in the middle of the night!**: This is stretching the truth to the breaking point. The House version of the bill was signed on October 8, 2009 at 12:15 in the afternoon, and the Senate version was signed on December 24, 2009 at 7:05 in the morning. The only vote that you could argue came close to ""the middle of the night"" was the House vote on the changes made in the Senate version of the bill, which took place at 10:49 p.m... on March 21, 2010, a whole three months later. It wasn't a vote on anything anyone hadn't seen before, but on the version of the legislation passed in the Senate. 431 of the 435 men and women in the House of Representatives voted on it. ([citation: govtrack.us](http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/111/hr3590) ).

**Obamacare is a government takeover of the health industry!**: What do you mean by ""takeover""? Like, for example, do you believe that because the FDA regulates food to make sure that it's safe to eat, that we've had a government takeover of food? By the same right, the Affordable Care Act adds a lot of regulations saying how health insurers should do business, in order to make sure that more people have insurance and that their insurance works in a way that's fair and reliable... but the government themselves isn't taking over insurance. They're not selling us that insurance - the Public Option, which would have made a government-run insurance plan to compete with private plans, never got passed. So government isn't taking over your insurance any more than they've taken over your food.

**Obamacare cuts $700 Billion dollars from Medicare!**: Not really. What the Affordable Care Act *actually* does is brings Medicare Advantage costs back in line with regular Medicare ( Citation: [Page 384, Sec. 3201](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=384) and [Page 389, Sec. 3202](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=389) ), limit the growth of certain parts of Medicare where our spending is outpacing what we're actually required to spend  ( [Citation: Page 426, Sec. 3402](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=426) ), and replaces some parts of Medicare with better, more cost-effective substitutes ( [Citation: Page 361, Sec. 3112](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=361) ). These accusations are based on a [report](http://cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/43471-hr6079.pdf) by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office showing the reduction of Medicare costs from 2012-2022. However, the accusations fail to mention that those ""cuts"" will not result in reduced care, reduced enrollment, or reduced anything really, other than reduced costs to the taxpayers... which *both* Democrats and Republicans agree is a good idea (so much so that Republicans like Paul Ryan even included those exact same ""cuts"" in their own budget plans).

**Obamacare takes money from Medicare to pay for Obamacare!**: It absolutely does not. Every penny saved by changes the Affordable Care Act makes to Medicare goes *back* into Medicare. The bill itself specifically says that any of these savings must be used to increase Medicare solvency, improve its services, or reduce premiums ( [Citation: Page 481, Sec. 3601](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=481) ).

**Obamacare is going to make hospitals drop support for Medicare and Medicaid!**: Some doctors and hospitals are worried about some of the big changes being made to how they're paid. Specifically, that Medicare and Medicaid are changing from compensating them for the number of patients they see to compensating them for how *well* they treat those patients. Some doctors have even threatened to stop accepting Medicare and Medicaid. But these threats seem weak when you realize that, according to the [American Hospital Association](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDIQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.aha.org%2Fcontent%2F00-10%2F10medunderpayment.pdf&amp;ei=_32BUJ6aOIiRiQK2h4CIDQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNG-NYo-CeVaDM_6bdHFYZxQhi03HA&amp;sig2=Wuc3TKAM36XZssEh7MlI1A&amp;cad=rja), ""Medicare and Medicaid account for 56 percent of all care provided by hospitals. Consequently, very few hospitals can elect not to participate in Medicare and Medicaid."" Now, granted, reimbursements to hospitals under Medicare are in many cases less than the cost of care, but much of what the ACA does is to seek to reduce the cost of care, particularly *by* reducing recidivism (patients going back to the hospital to be treated for the same thing because they didn't get the right treatment the first time). And alarmists warning about ""cuts made to Medicare"" can look back above - it's not being cut, it's having its growth rate reduced, and any savings go back into Medicare.

**Obamacare allows Barack Obama to create a secret health care army!**: I swear, I did not make this one up. There are actually people out there claiming this. It is pertaining to [Page 562 of the bill](http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf#page=562), specifically sections 5209, 5210, and 203, which reduce limits on the United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, and creates the Regular Corps and the Ready Reserve Corps. What the claim gets right is that these are enlisted uniformed services. However, what these Corps do is respond to disasters like hurricane Katrina and the Haiti earthquake. They are enlisted medical professionals that can be called up in a time of crisis. In fact, the United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps was involved in the assistance with both of those emergencies... but at that time, it was limited in size to only 2800 people. This section of the bill removes those limits so we are better-equipped to respond to emergencies like this in the future.

I think those are some of the bigger ones. I'll try to get to more as I think of them.

Whew! Hope that answers the question!

**Edits**: Fixing typos.

**Edit 2**: Wow... people have a lot of questions. I'm afraid I can't get to them now (got to go to work), but I'll try to later.

**Edit 3**: Okay, I'm at work, so I can't go really in-depth for some of the more complex questions just now, but I'll try and address the simpler ones. Also, a few I'm seeing repeatedly:

- The website that was to be established, I *think*, is [http://www.healthcare.gov/](http://www.healthcare.gov/).

- A lot of people are concerned about the 1/1/2015 bit that says that doctors' pay will be tied to quality, not quantity. Because so many people want to know more about this, I've sought out what I believe to be the pertinent sections (From Page 307, section 3007). It looks like this part alters a part of another bill, the [Social Security Act](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1395w-4), passed a long while ago. That bill already regulates how doctors' pay is determined. The PPACA just changes the criteria. Judging by how professionals are writing about it, **it looks like this is just referring to Medicaid and Medicare**. Basically, this is changing how much the *government* pays to doctors and medical groups, in situations where they are already responsible for pay.

**Edit 4**: Numerous people are pointing out I said ""Medicare"" when I meant ""Medicaid"". Whoops. Fixed (I think).

**Edit 5**: Apparently I messed up the acronym (initialism?). Fixed.

**Edit 6**: Fixed a few more places where I mixed up terms (it was late, I was tired). Also, for everyone asking if they can post this elsewhere, feel free to.

**Edit 7**: I just want to be sure to say, I'm just a guy. I'm no expert, and everything I posted here I attribute mostly to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPACA) or [the actual bill itself](http://docs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf), with an occasional Google search to clarify stuff. I am absolutely not a definitive source or expert. I was just trying to simplify things as best I can without dumbing them down. I'm glad that many of you found this helpful.

**Edit 8**: Wow, this has spread all over the internet... and I'm kinda' embarrassed because what spread included all of my 2AM typos and mistakes. Well, it's too late to undo my mistakes now that the floodgates have opened. I only hope that people aren't too harsh on me for the stuff I've tried to go back and correct.

**Edit 9**: Added citations.

**Edit 10**: Adding a few more citations (it'll probably take me a while to get to all of them) and a few more additional entries as well.

**Edit 11**: Tons more citations!

**Edit 12**: I updated this with a reference to the recent court ruling on the mandate, and address the question everyone seems to be asking about it (""What if I can't afford to buy insurance?"")

**Edit 13**: I've started up a [""Obamacare"" Point-By-Point](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/vrt9x/obamacare_pointbypoint/), where I'm starting to go through the bill point by point and summarize it in the same order that everything is actually *in* the bill, so that hopefully, when I'm done, you can just use my version as a sort of Cliff's Notes version of the bill.

**Edit 14**: More citations and spelling/grammar edits.

**Edit 15**: Debunking myths!

**Edit 16**: I changed the citations to reflect the page number of the PDF instead of the page number of the document. That way, it'll hopefully be easier for people to search by page number on the PDF, rather than having to run a Find search for the page number *within* the PDF. However, I had an ulterior motive for this... it made it easier for me to change the citation links... which now link to the appropriate page of the document! WOOOOOO! Thanks go to Redditor nerddtvg for the tip on how to do this!

**Edit 17**: Adding an extra note about the Medicaid expansion and the recent court order. Also, a few more citations.

**Edit 18**: Making a correction pointed out by Redditor cnash6.

**Edit 19**: Added in a few more clarifications, as well as addressing the recent claims about Medicare.

**Edit 20**: More citations!

**Edit 21**: Here I thought I was done with myths, but I was wrong. More myths debunked!

**Edit 22**: For those asking about contraception and religious exemptions, I made a thorough post about it (with citations) [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/10y6qg/obamacare_pointbypoint_part_4/c6i6esy?context=1).

**Edit 23**: Redditor poneil pointed me to a few corrections I needed to make.

**Edit 24**: Updated a number regarding the savings the CBO estimates this bill will make, and added a citation. Also, more myth debunking!

**Edit 25**: More myths debunked!

**Edit 26**: Added in an answer to an important question regarding the requirements for large employers to provide insurance.

**Edit 27**: More detail (and citation!) on the ""signed quietly in the middle of the night!"" myth.

**Edit 28**: Added an important bullet point I missed earlier - the ban on gender discrimination in pricing and plan availability.

**Edit 29**: Elaborated on the answer to the employer requirement question. And hit the character limit. No more edits!

He looked at me, and stepped on the gun, shattering it.  I was shocked into silence.  When I ask why, he said, ""When you want something, you take it.  Never expect anyone to give anything to you.""

This is also the man who, whenever he gave me money, would consistently give me less than he was supposed to until I learned to count the money I was handed.

**Edit**  Everyone is talking about CEOs, Lawyers, Super Villains, etc.  I want to point out that my dad was a coal miner who worked 60+ hours a week.  I'm not sure what relevance that has, but I feel like it needs to be said.

**Edit 4**.  Stories Remembered.

-The first time I asked my father if Santa was real, he promptly said no.  I think I was in kindergarten.

-When I was around 10, I had a severe fear of zombies.  One weekend, my father and I camped out for a night in a nearby graveyard.  It was creepy as shit, but it worked.  Now I just have a healthy respect for zombies. 

-I live in rural Kentucky, so flea markets and bazaars are fairly common.  Anytime I found something I wanted (The biggest one I remember is a marble chess set that I still have to this day), my father would make me haggle the seller for it.  He wouldn't do it for me, but if I didn't have the money to purchase something I had haggled a good price for, he would often give me the difference.

-I had it bad for a girl in high school.  And she rejected me.  I was crushed, and my dad found me crying.  He listened to my story, nodded, and said, ""Son, I know you're hurting now, and nothing will fix that quick.  But I promise you, that in a few years, you'll look back on this moment and you'll be ashamed that you let someone who cares for you so little hurt you so bad.""  He was right.

&gt; What kind of things would I be able to see with this scope?

Almost anything that your sky could show you. Saturn's rings, including the Cassini division. Jupiter's equatorial belts. Lots of tiny details on Moon's face. Sunspots (with an appropriate [solar filter](http://astrozap.com/scripts/prodList.asp?idCategory=31), which must **always** be used when watching the Sun; the finderscope must be capped or removed from the scope). Double and multiple stars like Albireo and Mizar. Globular clusters like M13. Galaxies, nebulae and so on. Tons of stuff, the words fail.

&gt; Any suggestions for a first timer?

I'm going to give you a lot of info. Don't let it overwhelm you, it's a lot but you don't have to do all that stuff at once. Just bookmark it and tackle each issue separately as you gain more experience. Easy does it.

I wish someone told me all these things at once when I was a beginner.

Keep your scope collimated, if it's a newtonian OTA (like a dobsonian). This is the most common mistake that many people do - they don't collimate their newtonian and then performance takes a dive. There are many techniques and procedures, it can be bewildering. Google how to collimate a telescope and apply that knowledge. Start doing this right from the beginning, and keep learning.

http://www.cloudynights.com/documents/primer.pdf

If you use a laser collimator, make sure the laser itself is collimated:

http://www.stark-labs.com/craig/llcc/llcc.html

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bE09_X43UUQ

You could use the star test to check collimation, some say it's the ultimate performance test for a scope. Plug in a strong eyepiece, point it at Polaris, and investigate the diffraction rings:

http://legault.perso.sfr.fr/collim.html

Once the scope is collimated, you'll get an additional performance boost by using a mirror fan - but don't worry about that at first:

http://www.garyseronik.com/?q=node/55

http://www.garyseronik.com/?q=node/69

http://media.skyandtelescope.com/documents/Adler-NewtThermal.pdf

Reflectors 4"" or smaller usually don't need a fan. 6"", fan is kind of optional. 8"" or bigger, definitely use a fan.

Before making an observation, turn the fan on full blast and take the scope outside, let it reach thermal equilibrium for 15...20 minutes or so; more is okay, less is not. Then reduce the fan speed to a mere trickle, and start observing; keep the fan on for the entire duration, at low speed, as long as it doesn't create vibrations (if you turn the fan off and stars are suddenly not fuzzy anymore, then it was creating vibrations). A PC fan speed controller (cheap gizmo you could find at the computer store) is very useful.

Vibrations are usually reduced if the fan is on an elastic suspension, as opposed to rigidly attached.

If you don't have a fan, at least take the scope outside about an hour before starting the observation, let it ""breathe out"" all the heat.

Eyepieces need maintenance too. The eye-facing lens gets dirty within seconds of using it. It's the oil on your eyelashes that sticks to the glass and blurs the image. It's unavoidable.

The best procedure for cleaning them up is explained by Tele Vue, the makers of top performance eyepieces in the US:

http://www.televue.com/engine/TV3_page.asp?return=Advice&amp;id=103

TLDR: Blow off the dust, then use Q-tips and a little reagent acetone or alcohol. Careful with acetone on cheap eyepieces, better use alcohol there.

Get a book called ""Turn left at Orion"", it's full of suggestions for interesting things to watch. Very useful when you're new to this hobby and have no idea what the scope can do.

You'll need some sky maps. A planisphere is the most basic one, not a lot of detail, but it gives you a snapshot of the whole sky at once.

http://www.amazon.com/Guide-Stars-Ken-Graun/dp/1928771017/

A pocketbook atlas has lots more detail:

http://www.amazon.com/Sky-Telescopes-Pocket-Atlas/dp/1931559317/

The ultimate resource would be something like Wil Tirion's ""Uranometria 2000.0"" and ""Sky Atlas 2000.0"", huge books with lots of details, but don't worry about that now.

On a computer or smartphone you could install Stellarium or SkySafari, which are electronic maps.

A few words about finderscopes, since they are a very important tool in the process of finding objects on the sky:

When you observe ""faint fuzzies"" like galaxies and nebulae, it's important that your vision is dark-adapted. Complete dark adaptation occurs after spending 30 minutes in perfect darkness - you may not want to do this every single time, or even often, but it's required on those rare occasions when you do a particularly difficult observation of some faint nebula. Most cases when looking at faint fuzzies, just stay in a dark place.

For reading the maps, changing eyepieces, etc., use a variable red flashlight. Red light does the least damage to your dark adaptation, and if it's variable you should keep it on the minimum useful level of light.

http://www.telescope.com/Accessories/Flashlights/pc/3/50.uts

When observing the Moon or the big planets, don't worry about dark adaptation, it's not needed if your scope is not too big. In fact, the Moon is painful to look at if you're dark adapted, so don't. Some folks use ""moon filters"", but those are not needed if you don't let your pupils dilate too much and you observe at a small exit pupil in your scope (1 mm or less). Just stay under plenty of ambient light for the Moon-observing sessions. I look at the Moon from a place right under the street light.

Dark adaptation is not dogma. Use it wisely.

Speaking about filters. There's colored filters, ""moon filters"", light pollution filters, OIII filters, Hydrogen beta, UHC, and so on. Which one to get? Short answer - no filter, at first. Use the scope as-is for a while. After you get some experience at the eyepiece, read this and make a decision:

For planets, the Moon, and double stars, you'll need high magnification - from 100x...150x to as much as the scope and seeing would allow. These are high resolution objects, and are affected by air turbulence - ""seeing"" as we call it. They are NOT affected by light pollution; in fact, the Moon and Saturn's rings could be observed even at sunset, before full darkness.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_seeing

You could predict seeing if you go to this site, choose a location nearest you, and watch the third row in the diagram - if it's dark blue then seeing is good:

http://cleardarksky.com/csk/

For nebulae, galaxies and so on, low and medium magnifications may be used, sometimes high. These are faint objects which are affected by light pollution; if light pollution is strong, you'll have a hard time observing them; seeing doesn't matter for these objects. Here's a light pollution map:

&gt; If anyone has pictures of images they've captured with their scope, if they could post them so I could get an idea that'd be great.

Nobody should start directly with astrophotography. It's tricky, it requires experience, dark sky, and good (expen$ive) gear - that is, if you want to do it right. Do some purely visual astronomy for a while, gather some experience, then you'll make far better choices.

Join the local astronomy club and go to star parties. That's a good way to learn a lot quickly.

An 8"" dob is a great way to start with astronomy, since it has a very high performance / price ratio. It is not a great scope for photography (but at less than a few thousand dollars, there is no great astrophotography stack that you could purchase anywhere).

If you do want to get started on an 8"" dob, the Zhumell Z8 is a better deal than the XT8.

http://www.zhumell.com/telescopes/dobsonian/z8-dobsonian-telescope/

http://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/mdig5/i_am_about_to_order_my_first_telescope/c302538

Don't go on an eyepiece shopping spree. Most newbies think that they would automatically get better results if they buy more glass, which is not always the case. The Z8 comes with a 30 mm and a 9 mm, which are a good start. A 2x barlow combined with the 9 mm would give you a ""virtual"" 4.5 mm eyepiece, which is good for high magnification.

Later on, after you gather some experience, if you're looking to buy better eyepieces, look into the Explore Scientific 82^o series, they provide 90...95% of the performance of Tele Vue at 1/4 or 1/3 the price.

One issue with dobsonians is that the eyepiece height is not fixed. Sometimes it's high, other times it's low. An adjustable chair would be great. There are some nice commercial solutions, like the Catsperch chair, but they can be expensive. A cheap alternative is the Denver observer's chair. You can either purchase it, or make one in a week-end from a 2x4 and various bits of hardware. Here are some plans:

True,Kronosynth,alleria,http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kronosynth/,"I play Chen a lot, and I feel that many players don't know about many interesting facets to the control group system in Dota 2.

**Subgroup Tabbing:** If you select a group of units, you'll have a primary unit within that group selected. When you drag select Chen and his creeps, this primary unit will always be Chen; pressing {Q, W, E, R} or item hotkeys will then let you use Chen's abilities even while giving attack-move and move commands to the entire unit cluster.

If you press Tab, you'll move on to the next unit, with casters prioritized over units who have no abilities at all. You can also directly shape the order of the subgroups (will go into this later).

**Control Group Memory:** If you make a control group with some Persuaded creeps and they die, re-Persuading those same creeps will re-insert them into their relevant control groups.

**Shift-Adding to Groups:** This is functionality that very few players know about, which should be intimately familiar to Starcraft players.

_If you hold Shift and press a number, your selected units will be appended onto the corresponding Control Group without wiping the Group's other units._

Say your control scheme is to put Chen on 1, his creeps on 2 and all units (Chen + creeps) on 3. You mind control a new wildkin, what do you do?

Normally you'd have to press 2, shift-select the wildkin, press Ctrl + 2, then press 3, shift-select the wildkin again, press Ctrl + 3.

Instead, you can just select the wildkin, hold shift, and press 2 + 3.

True,feartrich,,[UGRAD] Computer Science,"They exaggerate stuff in orientation. No one really studies 3 hours for every one hour they spend in class. That's a 64 hour work week for school alone. A better rule of thumb for prospective good students is 1 hour of study for every hour spent in class for lower division and maybe 2 hours for upper division.

Also, as for your class schedule, you have time between classes. You can go back to your dorm and chill. Either that, or all your classes are in two days. Even if every day is 9-5...well, you have a 9-5 work day, congratulations :P

And don't work your freshman year. You need to learn how well you can emotionally handle a heavy schedule. Some students can barely handle one job and 12 units.

True,kgdl,,,"I was in a very similar situation. I got married early last year after a 2 1/2 year relationship - prior to meeting me my wife had only ever had lesbian relationships, but self-identified as bisexual. The issue of her sexuality came up during our pre-marriage counselling (she was a somewhat lapsed Catholic) but she seemed confident that she loved me, and that her previous sexual preferences didn't really matter. 

Fast forward nine months - to put things into a bit of context, we were living in a city five hours away from her family (her two sisters both having recently had children) and while she had some friends locally, she felt that her really close friends (read: lesbian friends) were elsewhere. So coupled with a bit of preexisting anxiety, she was fairly depressed. Rather than see a counsellor or psychologist as I insisted she do, she decided that the root of her unhappiness was that she missed being a lesbian (to quote: ""it's just too easy being heterosexual""). 

Anyhow, I figure maybe we can make the best out of a shitty situation, so we agree that she can sign up for an Internet dating site with a view towards meeting women, and maybe a threesome. Like your partner she had significant issues with jealousy but was willing to compromise if it meant she got to sleep with women. The theory was sound in practice... 

We go on a trip to visit friends in another city, and she meets the first girl ""A"" off this website on her own - she tells me she seems nice, but isn't really interested in a threesome so it went no further, but they wanted to stay in touch as friends. A few weeks later, she goes to visit her friends in this city (I'm working late on Friday evening and have to be back Sunday night, and she didn't want me to fly down just for one night). She meets another girl ""B"" off this website, and goes to a party with her friends. 

She gets home, and almost immediately confesses that she had slept with girl ""B"", and had met girl ""A"" for a coffee a couple of times but nothing else had happened. I was fairly upset that she had cheated on me, but figured as long as she was being honest maybe we could rebuild our relationship. She decides she wants some time to think about things, and goes to visit her family. 

She subsequently goes to visit girl A again, and has what she later described as a ""lesbian bender"" - sleeping with her, and at least two of her old lesbian friends. Later she gave me the excuse that ""lesbian haven't had the ability to get married, so they don't really respect traditional marriage boundaries"". 

She gets home, initially denies everything but eventually confesses, packs her bags and walks out. I figure if she isn't willing to even try to save the marriage, then there isn't much point crying over spilt milk - I felt a bit sad for a little while, saw a counsellor, but all in all came through relatively unscathed psychologically. 

So the moral of the story? Either way, be prepared for things to really go to shit. I truly think I would have been happy if she went off to have meaningless lesbian sex once in a while as long as she still loved me and was honest about it - however her ingrained Catholic guilt didn't allow her the same level of acceptance - you may be one of the lucky ones who is able to sustain a semi-open relationship, but I think it's really more difficult than it appears. 

tl;dr: married ex-lesbian, changed her mind nine months later. Tried to compromise, failed miserably - I blame Catholic guilt.
