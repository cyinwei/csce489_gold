"CloudMage1","","","Back in the 90s when I was like 11 there was an old lady that lived next door to us. She was 95 years old. For her age she was in great health. She couldent drive any more so she took the bus everywhere. I used to help her out with yard work and such. 

We'll on day she was at the bus stop waiting for the bus to arrive to run some errands. One day while waiting for the bus a man ran up and grabbed her purse while running past her. the strap was on her shoulder, so as he ran away with her purse the strap tore the skin off her arm kind of like in ops pic, maybe a little worse. The tug of her purse ripped her skin off and knocked her off balance. She fell and broke her hip, and had a few good tears down her arm. 

I felt so bad for her. She went from being very self sufficient, too barley being able to walk or use her right arm. it Was sooooo fucked up, and I felt so bad for her. I was pretty young so I could only help so much. I started doing her yard work, taking her trash out for her on a daily basis, and taking the cans to the curb for her each week. She died about a month and a half after this incident. If it was not for the jack ass robbing the poor old woman I bet she could have gone 100+ years old.

Her name was Doris and as a kid she taught me a lot about compassion.

*edit. I'm not really sure how to respond to everyones reaction for that chapter of my life. Like I said I was young, and helped her alot anyways before that happened to her. So it just seemed right to me at the time to help in the small ways that I could, so I did.

**EDIT** No source for the pic that I can find, but if this is porphyria, it is one of the rarest and severe types:

Congenital erythropoietic porphyria (CEP), or Gunther disease: autosomal recessive and rare, with 200 reported cases.

CEP disrupts the fourth step in the HBP and results in the buildup of the hydroxymethylbilane metabolite. More than 35 mutations of the UROS gene can result in a dysfunctional uroporphyrinogen III CoA synthase enzyme. The most common is the C73R mutation (33%). The age of onset varies and the severity of the disease can range from fatal to severe photosensitivity and transfusion dependency, and finally, mild photosensitivity.  Severe photosensitivity can be seen after birth, and red blood cell (RBC) hemolysis can occur. Sun-exposed areas of skin can have massive blistering and scarring, often resulting in ruptures and infections. Extensive damage to sun-exposed appendages like the nose, lips,  ears, fingers, hands, and feet may occur. Hypertrichosis (excessive hair growth) on the face and hands is common. Patients may also have deposits of porphyrins in the teeth that give them a reddish-brown tint called erythrodontia. Anemia may occur because of a shortened life span of RBCs; this shortened life span increases heme synthesis and can result in a worsening of symptoms.",1423856137,"","1423865980",1,1374,"WTF"

I dunno how many of you canyoneer or hike or climb, but the general opinion among the climbing community, along with the search and rescue community, is that AR is a complete dumbass, undeserving of everything he's received in light of this. 

In doing what he did - go off and run a slot without telling anyone where he was going - he committed one of the cardinal sins of the sport. Akin to doing motorsports without a helmet. Hell, it's probably even dumber than that. People like AR are the ones that give the rest of us fits, and cause most of the 'lost hiker' callouts. They also tend to be the ones that die in the backcountry.

Just because he managed to extract himself from that situation does not mean he isn't a complete dumbass for causing it. It wasn't an accident - it was a direct result of his own lack of foresight. Also, boulders don't generally just 'come loose' and land on your hand. In all likelihood he cut it loose himself.

I should also mention that SAR personnel put their own lives at risk by simply responding to this kind of incident. I have at least an hour drive to many of the trailheads my team responds to. SAR people die on the freeway before and after callouts, while not even in the backcountry. That's before you even touch a rope or a patient. While AR was in there paying penance for his mistakes, volunteers were our putting themselves in danger on his behalf, and were doing so because he was too lazy or inconsiderate to simply tell a buddy where he was going.

This also relates directly to the severity of his injury. Had he filed a flight plan, he certainly would have been found within 24-48 hours, and most likely could have kept his hand (but lost the book deal, alas). Furthermore, the kind of ischemia he had in the hand (combined with the fluid loss through dehydration) made cutting and breaking the hand significantly less painful than if you tried it right now. Balls of steel? Meh.

I end up ranting about this a fair amount (as you can probably tell). What I always say is that there were many thousands of smart hikers, climbers, and canyoneers out on that day enjoying the great American West. AR was the fuckup that didn't make it back because he was lazy and/or dumb. The ones that made it home without incident are the ones you should respect.

"ratajewie","","","The thing is, the third phalanx doesn't serve the same purpose in cats as it does in humans.  They don't walk mainly on the third phalanx.  It's used for grip.  Yes, there can be complications, but the anatomy of cats isn't analogous ~~homologous~~ to humans in this case.  They can still walk perfectly fine, and there are often no issues with declawing.

That being said, I don't recommend declawing.  You bought a cat, keep the cat the way it is (aside from spaying/neutering.  That's actually completely necessary).  It's up to you if you want to declaw it though.  Don't use fear mongering to keep people from doing it.  It's not the equivalent of cutting off the last segment of your finger.

EDIT: Let me clear some things up.  This is the field I'm studying.  I know about it, and I care about it.  That aside, I've owned cats all my life.  They've all been declawed (not my choice) and have all been fine.

First of all, if you want to have an indoor/outdoor cat, obviously keep its claws.  They are completely defenseless without them, not only for attacking but also for hiding and climbing in trees.  Do not, however, have a cat that is mostly outdoor.  The average lifespan of an outdoor cat is three years.  In addition, cats are responsible for a staggering number of deaths of birds and other animals.  Some birds have gone extinct because of cats.

Make sure, if you do get your cat declawed, to talk about it at length with your vet and do research on it.  Issues can arise if the procedure is improperly performed, as with any procedure.

In order to properly own a cat with claws, know a few things: It will scratch you and your things.  It's going to happen.  Buy toys to keep it from focusing its energy on your furniture, and keep the nails trimmed.  Start trimming the nails as soon as possible.  Kittens are very receptive to new things and ideas, but only while they're kittens.  You will never have a cat that is okay with you trimming its nails unless you did it frequently while it was a kitten.  Also, punish the kitten for clawing furniture and people, and reward it when it does something desirable.

Spaying and neutering is extremely important because it manages to population.  There are a staggering number of cats and dogs without homes, and there doesn't need to be more.  By neutering and spaying your pets, you prevent the suffering of homeless animals.  There are also benefits in that it stops undesirable behavior associated with estrus and mating in general.  But that's sort of beside the point.  Declawing, however, is purely for the owner's benefit.

1. Put both lids of the toilet up and add 1/8th cup of pet shampoo to the water bowl.

2. Pick up the cat and soothe him while you carry him towards the bathroom.

3. In one smooth movement, put the cat in the toilet and close the lid. (You may need to stand on the lid.)

4. At this point, the cat will self agitate and make ample suds. Never mind the noises that come from the toilet. The cat is actually enjoying this!

5. Flush the toilet three or four times. This provides a ""Power Wash"" and ""Rinse"".

6. Have someone open the front door of your home. Be sure that there are no people between the bathroom and the front door.

7. Stand well back, behind the toilet as far as you can, and quickly lift the lid.

8. The cat will rocket out of the toilet, streak through the bathroom, and run outside where he will dry himself off.

9. Both the toilet and the cat will be sparkling clean.

&gt;The proboscis of the nemerteans usually consists of an introverted tube in a proboscis sheath, and it is everted like a finger of a glove that has been pulled ""outside in'.

&gt;This new nemertean has also a proboscis which is retractile
within a proboscis sheath, **but the proboscis is branched**. The branching is of the dichotomous type. **During eversion, which takes place almost explosively, the short main trunk. first appears, then this dividess and the finer and filter branches appear, but since each one of these is the result of an evagination the effect is almost indescribable. It is as if a large number of lively, wriggling, minunte worms had been shot out.**

"MisterBearcat","","","They're called [Velella velella](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velella). Recently drove to the Oregon coast to collect some for preservation. They're very strange creatures, the beaches are/were just littered with them. Their movement is controlled entirely by the wind, so when wind currents shift around, they will strand en masse on beaches. Happy to answer any questions people have about them. 

*Edit: someone asked a question about their sails and why I went out to collect them then deleted their question, so here's my answer:*

Yup, that thing on their back is their sail. Soft bodied animals tend to maintain rigidity via water-filled tubes or cells (think of the advantage of having a stiff water balloon vs., well, just goo). The skeletal makeup of Velella velella does seem to be a chitinous composite. See [*Design of a Small Cantilevered Sheet: The Sail of Velella velella*](http://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/handle/10125/508/v39n1-1-15.pdf?sequence=1} for a really good explanation of their sail (a really cool structure). One of my favorite facts about them is that their sails can be oriented in two different ways--they will ""sail"" in opposite directions depending on which way it's oriented! 

I just went out there for fun. I'm a biology student and I became interested in the species after reading about them in the news, so when I had some free time I drove over to the coast with a bucket. Brought about 50+ back, most still ""alive"" (kind of hard to tell, can't exactly take their pulse). I tried to collect valella that were washing in at the time rather than the dried up ones. I then realized that some of the professors in my biology department might be interested in obtaining specimens, so I emailed a bunch. I got in touch with the director of the invertebrate collection/museum at my university, and she coincidentally had been wanting to collect some! I had (luckily) frozen a bunch, so she was able to preserve those properly; I had tried preserving them with things like isopropyl alcohol and/or ethanol. 

In terms of finding out more about them, I think start with wikipedia entry of valella, then work on understanding their relationship to other soft bodied organisms--the [phylogeny of Cnidaria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cnidaria#Family_tree). The research article I linked to provides some really good info on their structure. I think one of the weirdest things about them is thinking about how they ""right"" themselves. When I observed them at the ocean, they would just kind of blow over and then float upside down. The way that their supposed to be positioned is with their sail on top (as you would think), so the question I have is, do they just spend more time right-side up then upside down? Or were the ones washing into the beach somehow damaged, different than the ones way out to sea? Research-wise, I'd love to study their neurotoxin. Poisons and toxins are super interesting, and often illuminate the normal functioning of organisms in a way that we hadn't previously understood.

Am I an idiot for thinking about calling this in? Buchanan, VA only has a population of ~1100 people so even if it's nothing it is probably worth reporting, since I doubt the police are swamped.

Edit: OK, I called the VA state police, told them what i knew, and she gave me a nice grilling. She pulled it up on Google maps and it hasnt been updated since 2011 (or so she said, others are saying it's still there. It's been there since 2011 though). So who knows? Either way, she asked me where I found this info and I told her this thread. Took a while to explain to her how to find it on /r/WTF (maybe if the search function worked!!). So yeah, VA state police are now looking at this thread. She said she would give the info to the state police and that's all I know. I probably just got trolled but so what? I'll sleep better knowing I did the right thing, in my mind.

This is the reason some people claim their eyes change colors with the seasons...They do, but only because the dead cells are replaced with new ones (which may or may not be a different color...Depends on the person's genes). The color of the iris, also dependent on a person's genes, are caused by light diffraction in the wormy iris cells.

I caught a huge carp,  gross fish,  so I smacked it over the head and tossed it as far as I could toward him and he dropped into the water grabbed the fish and ate.  He was really skinny too.  Must have been starving and out of energy, because he devoured the carp.  Just for good measure I gave him one of my good fish and then headed home at the end of the day. Never saw that bear again.

My father suffered from stage 4 melanoma and had been doing quite well on a next generation cancer treatment (see merck pd-1). Despite the occasional scares the drug was working at shrinking existing tumors and it seemed he was going to be around for quite awhile. As most people know, even if you are in complete remission the malignant cancer cells still exist within your body. What most people don't know is that these cells cause your blood to thicken. That being said, even after trying various anticoagulant cocktails the hematology department at UCLA medical center was unable to stop blood clots from occurring. The technique to remove this clot is still relatively new and due to the success there was some publicity (see http://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/ucla-performs-california-s-first-248157). Even though the surgery was a success the clotting would continue and eventually lead to my father passing away. He was a good man; wish he was still around.

I try to keep an open mind of toward ""hisids"" (what the locals call them) because I've met very few and they were extremely pleasant and nice. They are rude, cheap, racist, and the WORST DRIVERS IN THE WORLD! Most of them don't have insurance and a lot of them don't even have licenses! I bring up the cheap part because my county that I live in, Orange County New York is literally the poorest county in the country because of them. The government determines that through how much federal aid that county gets, such as food stamps, tax reductions, etc. The hisids qualify their home as a ""place of worship"" so they don't have to pay taxes!! Not only that, I used to work for a denim company in the mall outside of town, I won't say any names but it wasn't premium gasoline... They would come in and drop hundreds on there children's and babies wardrobes. They are trying to take over my rustic town called Monroe, to build a massive community. Us residents of Monroe are trying to pretty much stop them as politely as we can. It's calls United Monroe and if you are reading this which is really cool you have read this much, please check it out, Monroe is a beautiful town with so much history!! For the hisids to take over breaks me to see the town I was born and raised in and still currently live be taken over by such dirty people. If I myself sound racist I apologize, upstate New York gets a lot of bad reputations as being red neck country and I'm surrounded by them, by I really try to keep an open mind as I said earlier.

"iPostedJustForYou","","","Back when I was in nursing school I helped treat a paraplegic homeless man who was paralyzed from his navel, down, and who would never leave his wheelchair. The combination of friction and pressure had allowed his hips to almost completely erode away exposing parts of his pelvis and femurs. He had a collection bag for fecal matter, but no way to use it effectively, which caused fecal matter to collect in his wound. I was informed that he had fecal matter in his bloodstream, something I had never heard of, before.

My task at the time was to clean and redress his wound. Cleaning the still living yet rotting flesh and bone of a person is definitely an experience, and though the smell was bad, it was nowhere near the stench level of changing an ileostomy bag.

He had severely poor nutrition, impaired cognitive function, of course poor mobility even with his chair, and because of these and other reasons did not frequent the hospital or anywhere else to receive the care he desperately needed. I remember that he was admitted with his belongings, and he was quarantined, not just for the infectious diseases and microbes he carried, but for the roaches that came in with him.

I never saw him, again, after the few times I cleaned and redressed him. That poor, poor man.

If someone did this now it wouldn't mean the same as it did in the context of the art world when it was painted in 1953 it was cool and new because painters were finding ways to slowly reduce painting to it's elements. Art history was basically about first finding out how to realistically represent a subject and then once we had that figured out painting devolved back into it's elements one at a time. First proportion was lost for the overall feel of the painting. Picasso, along with his contemporaries, took away both depth and perspective. At this time in painting the removal of form and experimenting with the materials and colour was all the rage.
