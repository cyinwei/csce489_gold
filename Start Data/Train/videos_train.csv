Not only the constant pain but how it keeps you isolated. David was wrapped from his neck down in white gauze. If he had a bad infection, you could smell it. If he had an open site on his neck, you could see it. EVERY time you leave the house, you get stared at. People pull their kids back when you walk by. They ask your parents if it contagious. It is dehumanizing. He was the loneliest person I've ever known. 
 Not only was his life hard but his death was heartbreaking. The amount of suffering he endured during his life and death (especially his death) broke something in me that I don't know will ever be fixed or soothed.

"Warlizard","","","I did some research, just to clarify.

1. It's legal to enter an intersection when the light is yellow in Georgia (where OP lives). [Here's the proof](http://www.drivinglaws.org/resources/traffic-tickets/moving-violations/running-red-lights-and-stop--8).

2. Federal legislation doesn't mandate a specific time for how long lights should stay yellow, but everywhere I looked, the absolute minimum was 3 seconds. Nothing less was acceptable and Chicago was sued for being under that. See [Question 19](http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/knowledge/faqs/faq_part4.htm) for more details.

3. At a little past 10 seconds into the video, the light changes to yellow. OP enters the intersection and t-bones the woman at exactly :14, roughly 3.5 seconds after the light changed to yellow.

4. There is a 1.3-second (minimum) pause between the time one direction goes red and the other side changes to green at 30mph ([Look at chart 5-11 of the Federal guidelines](http://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/fhwahop08024/chapter5.htm#5.3)).

5. Based on when OP's light turned yellow, the other driver would not have been able to legally be where she was (3-seconds yellow + 1.3 seconds transition = 4.3 seconds) and she was traveling at full speed). Her light *couldn't* have turned green until OP was already through the intersection.

6. OP was 100% legal and the woman he hit was 100% in the wrong unless the times of the lights were outside of federal and state guidelines.

"BlLE","","","I'm sorry guys, I should have clarified what the species was when I posted this. This is a Killdeer. It is a Plover, or short-billed wading bird. Similar to the Sandpiper for which it is often confused it can be found close to shores. This specific family lives next to a manmade lake in an office complex in Southern California.The lake is also home to other species of birds like Mallard Ducks, Muscovy Ducks and American Coots. It is my favorite place to go on my breaks because of how comfortable all of the birds seem to be here. The Muscovy ducks actually have names that I've given them. They usually sit with me on my lunch.  Edit: Here are two of the Muscovy's: http://imgur.com/a/sqlJ3 The white one is named Jules. The other is named Felix. I couldn't find Jackson today so no picture of him.   Edit 2: I did not expect for this to be so popular. Neat! Please be mindful of your feet when you're walking off the beat path! I found another one of these tucked into some grass and if I wasn't looking where I was stepping I would have squished him!Also, some people have asked if the PVC pipe was the nest.

This is becoming an almost daily occurrence of some anti Israel story hitting /r/bestof or another default sub. 


YES. **Israel is held to a higher standard** than are surrounding countries, and we expect everyone there to behave like a good liberal does in the US of A. The countries on or near their borders are beheading people for adultery in the streets, and giving women lashes for being raped, and every example of closed mindedness is posted here like it applies to the entire nation. 


Do most redditors realize that **20% of their citizens are Arabs, and that they serve both in the military, and as the third largest block in parliament?**


Do most redditors realize WHY Netenyahu was able to pull off his right-wing victory, albeit will fewer than 30% of the vote? It's because they're always feeling attacked. 


A nation that's under 100 years old that's been in more major wars than the US has since 1948. The largest UN block of nations, non-democratic and majority Muslim, is constantly bombarding them with reports (Like this one from last week calling them the largest and only violator of Women's Rights http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/01/opinion/united-in-ignominy.html ). 


There are closed minded people in ultra orthodox neighborhoods, and  10 years ago, the US Re-Elected a Pro-Torture President on the promise of adding an Anti Gay Marriage AMENDMENT to the constitution. 


Judge Israel on what it is: The **ONLY** true, open, and functioning democracy in the region, still trying to figure out it's identity. They've got a majority of Jews who found a home after a thousand years with a right wing that doesn't want to give half of it away, even though it looks terrible, and a left wing what came up ONE seat short and does want to negotiate. They've got Jordan and Egypt who refuse Palestinians entrance, while Israel brings in jews persecuted from Iran, Ethiopia etc, and they've got a massive growing Arab population that is going to outnumber them in 50 years. Israeli Arabs aren't going anywhere when Palestine is created. Why be exposed to Nth theocracy in the region when they can lay on the beach, be secular, and eat Micky D's? Israeli Jews have a LOT of be scared of, and their parents were killed in death chambers. **They're ten years removed from weekly explosions killing classrooms full of kids on busses, which was why walls were built int he first place, and the only reason that it's just Muslims in Gaza is because Israel dragged their own people out of their houses and said ""we're getting the hell out of here""**. Regionally it's 8 Mil vs a BILLION. 


There are bad eggs in every nation, but there is a solid democratic political process there, and a VERY watchful world eye on them. This post though is just bigotry against a very small, different looking, and seeming scary private religious sect.

"Nola_Darling","","","Can I say something? People really don't understand micro-aggressions.  

I'm a black woman. I am very educated and have enjoyed great career success. Because of my background, I've spent 90% of my professional and educational career with white people.

Here are some of the things I hear pretty regularly from nice, well-meaning, not-racist, otherwise progressive coworkers, classmates and people I would consider friends:

-""Were you the first person in your family to go to college?"" (actually my mom is a medical doctor and my father is a retired engineer) 

-""Is your father still around?"" 

-When I tell me people I got scholarships to go to school: ""Were you on an athletic scholarship in college?"" (I am very tall, though) 

-""You're only got XYZ program, scholarship, internship, speaking engagement, etc because you're black.""

Now this isn't the same kind of shit my mom and her mom before her had to deal with in terms of racism, and I totally 100% get that. But is it enjoyable? NO! Is it real? Yes! People think that ""racism"" only looks like killing a guy or burning a cross on someone's porch. But it's also in little things we assume about each other. It sounds small, but imagine having to deal with this kind of thing all the time. These things add up.

It really sucks because 9 times out of 10, the people saying these things are your work-friends, people that aren't trying to be rude at all when they say these things. But that actually makes it worse because you realize ""wow there is such a huge gulf between me and my white work friend that they don't realize why XYZ wasn't an okay thing to say."" And when these things are said in a professional setting, you can't really say, ""Oh, that was an awkward thing to say to me because blah blah blah."" You really have no choice other than to just let it go and move on. 

I actually spoke on a panel at a conference for young black women just starting off in their careers about how they can cope with it when these things happen without jeopardizing their own professionalism in the workplace because it is behavior that a lot of folks have to *learn to navigate* to ensure professional success. I don't think people get this. 

People who think microaggressions don't exist should take the time to ask around because we all don't just have these same experiences by coincidence.  ",1428466679,"","1428468422",2,741,"videos"

"dashdriver","","","This will probably get buried, however something needs to be set straight here.

The ""dip"" (or roll) of the wings at the end was not an aerodynamic stall. The crew reported they had an engine failure after takeoff, so what you are seeing here is a Vmc roll. Vmc is defined as the minimum controllable airspeed with one engine inoperative. When you go below this speed, you can have the controls at the stops to make the airplane go in one direction  and the airplane will start going the exact opposite way. I should add that with an engine out, you can not let go of the controls and assume it will fly straight. In this case, with the left engine out the crew likely had right aileron in as well as a lot of right rudder. The slower you go, the more control deflection you need to keep the airplane going straight with one engine inoperative, and vice versa. Vmc is point (speed) at which the controls are fully deflected (in this case to the right) and you're going in the opposite direction (left)

The reason it's not a stall is:
A.) with a relatively straight wing like this, the wing is designed to stall at the root of the wing and not the tip (thus not a ""tip stall""). This is for the crew to maintain control throughout the stall, because the ailerons (providing roll control) are located at the tip of the wing. 
B.) even if the left wing tip had stalled, there is still another aileron on the right wing PLUS a roll spoiler. That should have been enough to counteract any rolling tendency associated with a ""tip stall"". 
C.) Some multi-engine airplanes are designed to stall before they enter Vmc (the stall speed is above the Vmc speed). That is only usually the case with small, twin engine trainers in which pilots first get experience flying multi-engine aircraft. Large turboprops don't have this protection (Vmc is higher than the stall speed) because it wouldn't allow the engineers to fulfill the design goals and typically these airplanes are flown by professional crews who should never allow the airplane to get that slow in a one engine inoperative situation.

At my airline, the Vmc speed for my airplane is mentioned maybe once or twice throughout our groundschool before we actually fly the airplane. There's no mention of the speed in our manuals anywhere and I couldn't tell you what that speed is off the top of my head. The reason for this is that we have a speed on takeoff called V2 which is defined as the ""takeoff safety speed"". This is the speed that we fly with an engine failure on takeoff. We are taught to NEVER go below this speed. This is because once you start going below V2, and getting closer to Vmc, it gets exponentially harder to get back to V2. In the bottom half of the range between V2 and Vmc you most likely have to start descending towards the ground to regain airspeed to get back to V2, which goes against all of our natural piloting instincts, as if you're too low, you'll hit the ground before you achieve V2 again.

There's a video on youtube of an airplane vmc rolling and it is very similar in the way the airplane behaves to this accident.

"MightyMorph","","","Ok lets get some things straight. Im a sikh so i feel i should speak up about some of the misinformation here.

Sikhism doesn't disallow people removing your Pag (turban), or having a turban or requiring a turban. The turban is a head garment that is meant to keep your head covered and take care of your hair. It also helps keep the head cool during hot direct sunlight. Its more cultural than religious. 

Its awesome that he decided to help out, but its not a brown man going against his religion issue. Its a human being helping another human being.


The actual  ""rule"" of the religion is to not cut your hair. Why? because sikhism says that by caring for our appearance we forget to judge people by their actions and values rather than their looks. That is why the religion tells people to keep their hair uncut and to not shave. NOW saying this doesn't mean that people who cut their hairs arent religious, its just how religious you are. The hardcore religious people follow all the rules. The semi-religious choose to let go on some, ie hair, appearance, meat, etc etc.


Sikhism is a religion born in Punjab in the 1500s. Its fundamental beliefs were born from influence from Islam Hinduism and Buddhism. It believes in freedom of religion and protection from tyranny from anyone for anyone. 

And for being a religion of peace, its history is with a life of a warrior.
Stories say that in the 1700s when the moghuls invaded the region and started trying to convert hindus into Islam, the Sikhs stood up against them. Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji went up to the Moghul emperor and gave him a challenge that if the emperor could convert him then all the hindus and other religions would accept conversion to Islam as well. The Emperor accepted and had Guri Tegh Bahadur Ji boiled alive and poured hot oil on, beaten and various other tortures over 5 days. It is said that he did not scream because of his past decades of experience in meditation and being a true devotee to god. () After those 5 days the emperor failed to convert Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji, and had him decapitated in the city in front of everyone.

This was perhaps the first recorded/written history stating a person giving up his own life to protect the religion of someone else. After the death of Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji, the 10th Guru of Sikhism; Guru Gobind Singh Ji, decided that the followers of the religion would not jsut be devotees to God but also warriors. And such was the birth of the Khalsa; the pure ones.

Over the last 500 years the Sikhs have been involved in many battles, from fighting the Moghuls who were in the millions with only a few thousand sikhs, being homeless for nearly 100 years, fighting persians to the British invasion in the 1900s. The fundamental belief has always been equality of all people and devotion to god. There is much more intricate history behind sikhism and it could be interesting to read for those who are curious.

BUT stating that like all humans, we are fallible. There are good humans in sikhism as there are bad humans in sikhism. But the simple belief that you should not judge a person by their appearance and that you should help those that you can is something everyone regardless of religion or ethnicity should follow.",1432477677,"","1432477971",1,44,"videos"

Their solution?  End the episode with some pseudo-moralizing, self-serving drivel glorifying their position and accusing those who disagree with them of siding with the terrorists.  Then all of us idiots with half a brain cell eat it up and praise them for being ""brave"" and ""insightful.""

I assume the majority of American are not anti-black or white supremacists. There is still a system that favors whites over non-whites. Cops thst shoot and kill black men are likely genuinely concerned for their life, but this genuine fear response to a dark skinned suspect is likely ingrained at a young age and through adult life through years of black stereotyping in the media and other avenues.

There's barely enough space for breathing room so I slowly stuck my mouth out of the water so I didn't bonk my head or make noise so she would hear me.

Well, after about 10 seconds I hear her claws and whimpers on the dock above and she dives in. After a few ungraceful doggy paddles she spots me under the dock and comes toward me with wide, panicked eyes. Apparently she didn't have a rescue plan so instead of gently biting my hand to drag me out she just scratches the fucking shit out of me. I bang my head on the dock and swallow water so now we're both panicking.

I shove her away to escape her toe-knives and climb back onto the dock. I lift her out of the water and set her down next to me. Her tail is going crazy and she licks my face thinking she just saved my life. I look down to examine the bloody scratch marks all over my neck and chest, sigh, and call her a good girl.

By the same logic, you can't be an environmentalist if you only actively try to battle deforestation. You also need to battle against desertification and nuclear waste and monoculture and animal abuse etc etc. 

By the same logic, you can't be a health worker if you only actively treat people with cancer. You also need to treat people with heart disease and dental issues and ingrown toenails.

Feminists tend to concentrate on women's issues because there are issues that are exclusively or mostly female-centered. There are only so many hours in the day!

Also, just for kicks, the only organization in the world dedicated to addressing the male suicide rate (CALM) was created and run by a feminist.  It was the feminist movement in Germany who lobbied for it to be recognized that men could also be raped by women, resulting in an archaic law being changed accordingly alongside marital rape also being recognized for both sexes as a criminal act in 1997. 

If your line of thinking is that the feminists aren't doing anything useful except complain about video games and movie trailers, maybe you are looking in the wrong places? Maybe Tumblr, a site where most users are teens or young college kids is not exactly the best representation of a century-old, global academic movement?

"Cloudy_mood","","","I'm a server in a fine dining restaurant in the US. I also like to eat at restaurants as well. At the place I work at, we receive a little info sheet about your past, or favorite drinks or dishes or if it's your birthday. I read every single guest to see if they like a server to be present or if you want to eat and get the hell out of there. 

I'll recommend the best cocktails, wine, or sodas- whatever you like to drink. If you're not sure, I'll give you a few choices. You like red wine, but want fish? I'm not going to judge you, you're paying the money- so I'll start talking about reds. 

I'll tell you where the specials are, I'll point out the popular dishes based on what kind of food you like(maybe determine it by what you chose to drink), I'll explain them in detail and make them sound appetizing. There are one or two dishes that are underwhelming-so I'll steer you away from those without making them sound bad. 

I'll have a nervous breakdown if your apps, salads and entrees don't come out on time. Not in front of you, but if your items aren't getting to you when they should- I'll most likely take that item off your bill. Your water will never be lower than half. My server assistant and I will make sure of that. I'll always politely ask if you want another cocktail, and get it to you in record time. I make sure each course is perfect- if not, we fix it for you immediately. Birthdays and anniversaries are handled above and beyond(no, we don't sing or clap- we do something else but I don't want to say because I signed a contract I won't talk about my particular store on social media), and if you're cool- I'll have my manager take care of your dessert. I invite you to come back to the restaurant, because you're keeping the place open. I work at 100 percent energy to make sure you will never forget your experience at my place and because of the incentive of a 20% tip. 

I've never experienced what I do anywhere else. I've had great servers- but no one who goes out of their way like myself and the other servers that I work with. We are a well oiled machine. 

Because I work in a big city, I've waited on every nationality.  I wait on a lot of people who bring their culture with them and screw my night with some made up tiny tip because they don't tip in their country. (By the way- if I'm ever lucky enough to visit your fine country, you can bet your ascot I'll do my research and learn what the proper etiquette is at a nice restaurant.)

 I wait on a lot of rich people, and I've waited on people that can't afford to eat where I work. I've waited on celebs. Everybody. And regardless of class- and even what they tip- 98% people I wait on know how good they were just taken cared of. My staff and I deserve 20% because the attention you get is ridiculous. We don't always get it, and it's always a shock because our restaurant is designed to go above and beyond. That doesn't change my attitude, because everyone is spending money, and everyone deserves the best experience. Not every tip is 20%, and I don't lose my mind over it, tips just vary- as long as I'm paying bills- I'm happy. 

I work my ass off to make good money so I can support myself and my son. I'm a single dad(no Chris Rock, I don't need a medal).  I'm yelled at by ignorant people, I wait on con artists, people who call and lie so they can get things for free- people who don't tip anything, but the truth is every job is hard and there's always down sides. But I work at my restaurant because it's the best. 

If you take tipping away, we'll all have to find something else to do, but you will most likely not get your drink on time, you'll get your food however it comes out and it certainly won't be comped if it's wrong. You will get special spiels like--(We have salmon and Mahi Mahi tonight served with...rice...and it's 25.95...ready to order?) instead of the protein, starch, veg, and sauce description. Why is this dish good? What makes it unique?  Servers who don't know or care anything about the food or drinks(one server at a really nice place I went to didn't know what a vodka Gimlet was; I certainly didn't judge him but was surprised), and you'll basically be waited on by someone who doesn't give a shit. 

The funny thing is, most people *want* great service, and that attention to detail. I've waited on SO many families that you can tell they're dying for a good drink and a dinner they didn't/or don't know how to cook at home. But if the initiative is taken away, you're going to get half assed service and be more stressed than when your boss is yelling at you while you're at work. So take tipping away, and be prepared for an eye opener. 

**TL;DR** Take tipping away, fine- we'll have to find different jobs. But you'll have the service equivalent of Walmart at your favorite restaurant.

This is still very impressive though to be able to do it this fast.

If anyone is interested in blindsolving, here is an easier method called [classic Pochman](http://www.stefan-pochmann.info/spocc/blindsolving/3x3/old.php). Anyone that knows how to solve a cube in 2 min and less can do it, it just takes a little bit of commitment.
It took me about 2 weeks and 5 attempts at a full blindsolve to get it right, but don't despair, that feeling of taking the blindfold off and seeing a solved cube is amazing.

EDIT: Some more explanations on what's happening:

Each corner sticker has a letter associated between A and X (same for edge stickers)
At the beginning he is identifying and memorising what is called cycles.

This is the order in which he will solve the pieces. And this order tells him exactly where every piece is and where every piece goes.

Since there are only 20 movable pieces on the cube, this comes down to memorising 20 letters in a certain order.
An easy way to do that is to group them by pair and associate a word to each letter pair.

VT would be Vault, QS would be Quest, OK would be Oak, etc.


So now we have ten words to memorise in order. An easy way to do that is to make up a story.

""To find a mythic Vault, you go on a Quest that will lead you to a big golden Oak"" the craziest the story, the easier it is to remember.

Then once the blindfold is on, we tell the story back for each key word extract the letters and each letters correspond to a specific algorithm to execute.

Once at the end of the story, the cube should be solved if everything goes according to plan.

This is greatly simplified but it is basically how this goes.

2. A substance can be non-potable even if it's non-carcinogenic, dish soap isn't dangerous but I'm not about to chug a bottle of it
3. The entire premise from the 'reporter' is based on the WHO stating that glyphosate is a ""probable"" carcinogen, a claim which is not actually based on any empirical data.

"itsjustmeeshie","","","The problem is the state of Georgia has essentially monopolized country music including the artists and the songwriters. Throw in the fact they are all friends and you get the same sound over and over again.

Top Songwriters = The Peach Pickers (Rhett Akins, Dallas Davidson, &amp; Ben Hayslip) - All from GA and write most hit songs on the radio by you guessed it their GA buddies such as:

* Thomas Rhett (Rhett Akin's son)
* Jason Aldean
* Luke Bryan
* Cole Swindell
* Florida Georgia Line
* Brantley Gilbert
* Kip Moore 
* Sam Hunt

Those are off the top of my head and all have played a part in pop country and perpetuating it.... The same bullshit songs continue to go #1 and everyone is happy except true country music fans unfortunately.

The pop-country (I call it bro-country) fraternity of Georgia needs to be broken up....

For real music listen to:

"bjKnizek","","","Zealous MotoGP fan here, I do not often see my beloved sport appear outside of the dedicated subreddits, so I thought I would take this opportunity to provide some context to the video and hopefully convert some new fans! (join us over at /r/motogp)

The video is of the 2015 Argentina Moto3 Warm-up session. Moto3 is the smallest of the 3 classes in the MotoGP championship, they ride 250cc 4 stroke prototype bikes. The two main characters in the video are Romano Fenati (on the Black/Blue Sky46 bike / the angry one) and Niklas Ajo (on the Black/Red RBA Racing Team bike/ the one getting kicked).

As some others have commented in this thread, Fenati has a bit o history with his temper and can be quite moody. Ajo is from Finland so he is usually cold as ice. While we cant see exactly what happened, it isnt that uncommon for the Moto3 riders to sometimes get in each others way when one person is doing a fast lap and another person is not for a few possible reasons that I wont go into. So Niklas messed up Romano's lap during the warm-up, how exactly we do not know but it is pretty safe to say it was not intentional. That being said, it is entirely possible that Niklas was just being thick headed and sitting on the racing line while going slow (a big no no). So what you see is Romano getting overly aggressive in response to his lap getting ruined (this is a warm-up where fast laps do not actually count towards any kind of points or position). At one point Romano hits the kill switch on Niklas's bike and then takes off (this is at the end of the session where most riders do practice starts). We see Ajo try to ""bump start"" the bike but these 250cc engines have huge compression ratios and are very difficult to start without some kind of external tool. 

All in all it turned out fairly harmless but Fenati was very childish here and was handed some penalty points and had to start the race from the back of the grid (last place).

I am so sick of the way Reddit treats minorities. Thankfully it's not too often, but every once in a while, something slips onto the front page that is so utterly vitriolic it makes me sick. Threads that are full of people who probably go out of their way to correct grammar and spout ""science"" on other threads suddenly become senseless members of a hate-filled mob. Women, anyone deemed a ""foreigner"" should know that we are not welcome here - and on a site that is supposedly meant to be for everyone the world over. The woman in the video deserves nothing but your downvote and a look of disgust. What a sanctimonious idiot.

Edit: getting an unsurprising amount of downvotes, which really only proves my point...

Our instructor was pissed. The worst thing that ever happened was during a school program where all the parents of the little kids watched them sing and then we would play a few songs. W didn't care at all how we would sound. That being said, when we went to play he didn't bring any music with him. Just an empty folder. He sat right next to ""L,"" who played baritone. Neither of them had any music. they both were trying to make the other laugh. L finally won their little challenge by screaming into his baritone. With what sounded like a yodeler being beaten with a chicken, W lost his cool. He laughed right into his tuba and it blasted out a noise similar to what was shown in the video, right during a rest. the teacher looked at W with a look that said ""I will punch your Grandmother in her colostomy bag.""

Instead of invading Iraq or Afghanistan, the US army goes into Uganda or Sierra Leone. It's a ten year ""deployment"". The engineering corps build infrastructure; harbours, railways, bus depots - that kind of thing. The medical corps train doctors and nurses and provide intermediary healthcare to the civilian population. Whole army groups specialize in training civilians in specific skills like basic education, farming, heathcare, textiles, business etc etc. All the skills required to build a stable modern economy.

You could have the Teachers Corps or the Farming Division. These guys are highly skilled educators whose sole mission is to update the thinking of a population that, for all intents and purposes, are still stuck in the 19th century.

Instead of manufacturing ammunition and IED proof transports, the military industrial complex is turned towards manufacturing civilian transport, railway track and all the other random shit required to give a country a facelift.

During this whole process, the locals are educated and slowly phased in to the process - phasing out the military personnel bit by bit. After 10 years, the army leaves. The country does what ever it does, either succeeding or failing, and after another 10 years, the army comes BACK to carry out ""Phase 2"" of the development.

America still gets to throw money down the drain but instead of blowing it up on some hillside with a $150,000 artillery shell, it goes into doing something that's going to mean a whole lot to a whole bunch of people.

The whole thing overall is a bad look for the fighting game community (Mortal Kombat, Guilty Gear, Tekken, Street Fighter, Marvel vs. Capcom) as physical confrontations are extremely out of character.  Heated confrontations are rare given the size of the community and physical confrontations are so rare as to be almost unheard of these days.  It was my fault for letting this situation get to this level.  There is a backstory involving him trashing me and other gamers online and claiming that I'm a drug addict whereas I spend my (small amount of) free time volunteering with a homeless outreach program and take special interest in drug cases, doing whatever I can to help out and keep that poison off our streets.  But that's an excuse.  I did lose my temper and I did take it too far and seeing this video come back months later is kind of embarrassing more than anything else.

When I was a young pre-teen, I became fascinated with World War II.  Not only the military aspects, but just life 'back home', or life 'on the line'.  I managed to get a little from my grandparents, but honestly it was like pulling teeth from a starving lion.  You had to be extremely careful and exceptionally gentle.

I can't blame them; it wasn't 'fun', it wasn't 'good'.  These are not memories any sane person wants to recall.  It's pain, sadness, death, despair, and heartache.  Who in their right minds, as they age and already have to deal with a body slowly disintegrating, wants to remember the worst parts of their lives?

My paternal grandfather was an aviation mechanic.  Apparently, the boys would land near-ish the front line.  He'd patch them, refuel, re-arm, and get them back into the skies as fast as he could.  I got a bit about how crazy some of the bullet holes were, big as a man's fist right through the fuel tank and how the hell did they land and... of course some never came back and the story ends.

My maternal grandfather worked for Bell Labs/AT&amp;T.  Extremely precise timing and electrical signalling.  He did his part, in his own way, as an engineer.  Crazy projects he was unsure he could talk about, even 40 years later that he was basically press-ganged into.  He *thinks* some of it went into atomic testing, but he could never be sure.  So, the story ends.

Paternal grandmother was a telephone operator.  On the switchboard from 7 to 7, or longer, every day.  No one else to do the work in her area.  Always worrying about her beau she was engaged to, overseas... and the story ends, because the whole series of 'what ifs' become way too painful.

Maternal grandmother came 'from money'.  Not really, according to grandpa, but they acted it.  Everyone was poor during the depression, I don't want to talk about it.  So the story ends.

I tried.  I really, really did.  Right up till my paternal grandfather's Alzheimer's took his mind, and right up till my maternal grandfather's body gave out.  They were just 'then', those times were 'done'.

This is part of our shared heritige.  Our country went through some crazy, crazy times with most people being dirt poor. Something I personally don't want to have happen to me, nor to anyone else.  I need to know about life during that time; because if I don't, it will happen a second time.

1. The key condition is to get a camera that is able to make its output to the TV in negative colors. That way when the camera sees the negitive on the screen, it negates that back to regular. 

2. The other condition is to have a camera that can mirror it's output. So when the camera sees it's own mirrored output, it magnifies the effect making much more vivid and long lasting fractal patterns. 

[THIS VIDEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulPmf6ZPPwI&amp;list=FL_Dq1v9jmEdHUtTbRXoJ2tg&amp;index=6) shows the best example of all 3 of the conditions.

*Note* At **1:36** you can see him turn on the ""negative output"" mode
         
At : **3:42** you can see him turn on the mirror mode.

Finally--- At **5:15** you can see he somehow injects color into the mix and amazing things happen. I hope someone follows this guide for the best example of this phenomenon I've found.

Edit: Plus, much better music.(and thanks kind stranger!)",1421723040,"","1421767491",1,774,"videos"

I think the point is that this guy is a piece of shit that chooses to make situations with police worse, randomly calling civil disobedience, and somehow getting away with no penalties-but am I wrong?

"sbennett2176","","","Honestly, she is right, I fucking hate when men just think that because of their dicks that they are better than women. It's time for women to stand up, it's time for women to crush the balls of these patriarch obsessed men and take power. Men are nothing but sex driven animals that do nothing but put women down and kill puppies, and burn down senior homes. YES ALL WOMEN!",1426456675,"","False",1,-4,"videos"
