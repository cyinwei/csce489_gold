"stevierar","","","As this is being upvoted quite a bit, I'll post some information about the tank :)

This is a UK Native Marine tank. I live right by the beach in Dorset so the water is collected from the sea and the animals from rock pools. I only borrow creatures to observe for a while in the tank then they go back; I've never mixed with store-bought creatures, this makes it safe to release. I made this on a tiny budget. It's a 65 litre tank with a powerful undergravel filter and a pump to create some current that switches on and off. The only unnatural objects in the tank are the sassy duck (couldn't resist) and the gravel (seemed bad to take that from the beach, so I bought and washed some). There is a 1873 pottery manufacturer (Poole Pottery) nearby and in the past they would dump their broken creations into the sea. Over time these get taken by the tide out of Poole, around Brownsea Island and they wash up on a small beach down the coast a bit (Baiter). This has always fascinated me so I've decorated the tank with little bits of broken pottery and smoothed glassware I've found there.

Currently there is also a hermit crab, pagurus prideaux, he usually has a cloak anemone on his shell (together they form a symbiotic relationship), I collect shells from the seafront for him and another small hermit, a 'hairy hermit'. There is also a goby (fish), a common prawn (many more before but I put them back recently), several snails and a few types of anemone including this lovely snakelock.

My SO's father is a marine biologist and they've both given me a lot of help setting this up. I enjoy it as I get to have a little slice of nature in my flat, observe what they do and not experience any of the guilt I always feel when I keep regular pets. This is just a little crabby holiday. If you're tempted to do this, please read up lots first (although there's very limited information available; if it regards the UK, you can pm any me questions) and please never mix caught and store-bought animals - especially if you intend on releasing - you can spread diseases to ecosystem. This only works for me because I'm so close to the sea; I monitor salinity, temperature and how.. happy everyone looks and return animals if the conditions are not right. I love how fascinated visitors to my flat are about the tank!

For anyone concerned: He's a bit pale due to lack of sunlight for his algae, I guess as it is winter so there is even less getting in. Shall invest in daylight bulb or return to the sea :)

Some people even have a guide in their journey.As you walk up, sweating, you finally catch a view.

The gulf spill was an absolute tragedy. But do you know a crazy fact? The amount that spilled into the gulf is roughly the same amount of oil that the US consumes in 6 hours on a daily basis.

Corporations need to be held responsible for their actions and accidents. And we need to sort out our addiction to oil. Things like this should not happen, but our constant and growing demand for oil is what is causing corporations like BP to have to drill deeper and deeper. Cut off the demand and the production will slow down, and accidents like this will be less likely to happen again. It is absolutely the job of the corporations to prevent things like this happening. But we as citizens have a responsibility to decrease the demand so it's not worth companies like BP drilling in such dangerous places with such fragile eco-systems in the first place.

"danheskett","","","It is easy to blame Rent-A-Center.  It really is.

But consider:

- This is a ~$829 loan that will default approximately 50% of the time.  The people who take out this financing are essentially without any financial stability.

- Despite what people are saying down thread, you can turn this phone in at any time.  It is a rental.  So, you want to use this phone for 2 months while you wait for the next one to come out?  Fine, that's $240.  When you are done, bring it back and you are done, no strings attached.

- Despite the high cost, you are covered for any reasonable loss.  Break the screen?  Bring it back, trade it in, get a new one.

- Despite the high cost, you are insured against theft.  Someone breaks into your (bad neighborhood) house and steals the phone?  You get out for free, and can get a new one, for $29 a week.

Yes, it's expensive.  It's expensive for a reason.  There is healthy profit, and there is both upside and downside risk by Rent-A-Center.  

I'll put it out there right now.  I don't think there is one person here in this thread who would offer a better deal.  You buy a phone for $800 bucks, I'll rent it from you for less than $29 a week, absolutely no strings attached.  If I break it, it's stolen, or I just bang it up, you'll replace it with a new one, no questions asked.  At anytime, I can bring you the phone back and have nothing to say.  At anytime, I can bring you the phone and you'll hold it, and suspend my payments, which I can come back to and resume without penalty at anytime.  Any takers? Anyone?  Instead of 78 payments ($2800), how about you do it for 34 payments, which gives an annual rate of return of almost 20%.  What other investment can you make 20% on?

EDIT:  It's really sick to see how many people in thread who assume that being poor, or having low wages, makes you stupid.  It's not true.  There are people of all education and intelligence levels working in low wage jobs and industries.  It doesn't make you stupid, it doesn't make you a dupe, it doesn't make you a victim.  Poor people should have the dignity to make their own financial and economic decisions, to prioritize what things they should like to have.  Would some of them be better off saving that money instead of buying a big screen TV?  In my opinion, yes.  But they didn't ask my opinion, so I don't feel like I (or society) should poor-shame them into conforming to my view of economic prioritization or cost/benefit analysis.  In a free society, the individual who is properly informed, protected against adverse effects, able to reasonably repay the obligation and able to find a willing lender should be able to enter into a contract of this nature without scorn or judgement from the middle and upper-middle class who look down on them as serfs.  As I initially offered, if you all think the rates are horrendous and abusive, make a better offer and I will take you up on it right now.  ",1423626323,"","1423678098",1,907,"pics"

"MissInkFTW","","","Aside from the kidnapping comment that comes off as a little paranoid, this really isn't that weird. My brother recently married (and had kids with) a woman that writes out similar notifications to this for the kids' birthdays (all still very young). Let me tell you, I fucking love it. Buying from a list is so much easier, god. You go to the store, pick it up, and get the fuck out, rather than humm and haww over getting the right gift, especially for a kid that young that has a bunch of random restrictions on shit they actually can receive that you never would have even thought of if you're childless. And it sounds like they would be perfectly happy just receiving a cash or a gift card anyway, it's just not the ""birthday"" thing to do. Also sounds like they've had kids before, so they don't need a bunch of duplicates of shit they've been saving around since the last kid was that age. I've spent enough time around my brother and his wife to become very aware how that gets real old real fast. You can only have so many play tunnels. 10 goddamn play tunnels is nothing but either a waste of space or a waste of money. And it sounds like they actually do need that money for essentials for the baby anyway, so it's not like they're being unnecessarily pickiy about just throwing money away.

So basically I wouldn't go off making all these unfair assumptions about the parents. Like I said, my sister-in-law writes these notes and she is far from uptight and bitchy.

"lazarus870","","","That's a Winchester 1873.  That`s the so-called ""gun that won the west"" and was a super quick cycling rifle due to the toggle-link design.  It had a neat little cover on the top that you could slide over the action to protect it from rain and snow.

That's the gun that's **supposed** to be used in Westerns, the one that would be period correct.  However, in most westerns, including John Wayne movies, the anachronistic Winchester 1892 was used instead, due to availability and I guess it looked more pleasing.  

I'm betting that one is chambered in .44-40.  The gun design was replaced by the 1892 (in you guessed it, 1892) by gun inventor John Moses Browning.  The 1892 never could cycle as fast as the 1873 but it was much stronger with two giant steel lugs that locked into the receiver.  

I have two modern reproduction 1892 rifles in .44 magnum.  Today there are 1873 replicas (made by Uberti in Italy and Miroku of Japan licensed by Winchester).  Compared to other lever guns, they're not strong due to the toggle-link design not having very positive lock-up.  But they're quick so they're used with great success in cowboy-action shooting.

I was with you at my grave today; you tend it with such care.  
I want to re-assure you, that I'm not lying there.  
I walked with you towards the house, as you fumbled for your key.  
I gently put my paw on you; I smiled and said, ""it's me.""  
You looked so very tired, and sank into a chair.  
I tried so hard to let you know, that I was standing there.  
It's possible for me, to be so near you everyday.  
To say to you with certainty, ""I never went away.""  
You sat there very quietly, then smiled, I think you knew...  
in the stillness of that evening, I was very close to you.  
The day is over... I smile and watch you yawning  
and say ""good-night, God bless, I'll see you in the morning.""  
And when the time is right for you to cross the brief divide,  
I'll rush across to greet you and we'll stand, side by side.  
I have so many things to show you, there is so much for you to see.

We are trained for years during residency to preserve life. We do it as much as we can, and resuscitation becomes so ingrained in us that work becomes machine-like. We empathize with our patients, yes, but we put our own emotions to the side. Because if we felt any swing in emotion - whether it be anger, extreme sadness, or pride - that might impair the way we care for the next patient we see.

Patients will come and go - we will save a lot of them, but some we cannot save. And it's at this moment, this one moment, that we actually *feel.*

I know I'm speaking in general here, and I know that we aren't all the same. However, when it comes to our work, nothing is harder - and I mean nothing - than telling a loved one that their family member is dead.  Give me a bloody airway to intubate. Give me the heroin addict who needed IV access yesterday, but no one can get an IV. Give me the child with anaphylaxis. But don't give me the unexpected death. 

The patient might die. We can only do so much, and we can only hope to do our best. But it's that moment, when you stop resuscitation, and you look around, you look down at your shoes to make sure there's no blood on them before talking with family, you put your coat back on and you take a deep breath, because you know that you have to tell a family that *literally* the worst thing imaginable has happened.

I'm Indonesian and back then English language wasn't that well spoken and books written in English were crazy expensive. We weren't rich, but my father would encourage me to pick all the English books. I would grab piles of books,  thinking I would select one final book from those piles. But he would just say 'Is that all? Anything else?' So we ended up going home with piles of expensive English books. He would set limits on what to spend on food, toys, etc, but never books. 

Having learned English on my own from those books, I managed pretty well. I got a scholarship to study Master abroad in Netherlands and now starting PhD in Denmark. I never thought I'd make it anywhere out of my country and always felt insecure about my formal educational background as I know it's nothing compared to first world education. But remembering those weekend afternoons in the book stores with my dad, it convinces me that informal education can really bring you to great heights. 

I hope your daughter enjoys those books. Her face reminded me of how I felt in those book stores. The memories, the resulting love of reading, and where it can take her are priceless.

"Myklanjlo","","","Damn!  In August of 2000, I had an *interesting* encounter with John Travolta at a 24-Hour Fitness in Santa Monica.  I‘ve been waiting for the best opportunity to tell my story. Did I miss it?  I'm afraid the story might just get lost here.  What do you guys think?

EDIT:  Okay, I'm going to write it up!  Give me a few minutes.
EDIT2:  So sorry!  Here you go...

It was a warm summer night in the year 2000 (August, I think--maybe September).  I was working nights as a police dispatcher, and my schedule was all out of whack.  6pm to 6am was my regular shift, so my nights off were often quiet, sometimes lonely, and occasionally weird.  This is one of those stories. Now, 24-Hour Fitness was the perfect gym for my schedule, and 3am was my go-to workout time.  And although the 24-Fitness Sport in Santa Monica, CA is certainly the busiest gym I've ever seen, it was normally as empty as the streets at 3am.  On this particular night, however, I wasn't alone.

I turned up, signed in, threw my bag in a locker, stretched the quads a bit, and hopped on the treadmill.  And that's when I saw him... In all his pale glory, the man himself, Vinnie Barbarino (a.k.a. John Travolta).  My first two thoughts:  *Oh my God, that's John Travolta!*  Followed by, *Why the fuck is he so pale?*  I swear the dude was practically transparent.  He looked sickly.  But he was being led around by a personal trainer, so I figured he was on the mend.

Well, the novelty of seeing John Travolta in public wore off quickly (I do live in L.A., after all), so I just went to finish my workout, ignoring him.  I had about 8-10 lifts on this particular day, so I finished my usual circuit around the gym.  (Now I want to preface this next part by saying that at this time I was in the best shape of my life. I may be a fat bastard now, but not back then; I was training for the police academy, and I was ripped.)  Well, as I complete my workout, I notice that John Travolta is following me around the gym. I mean, every time I use a machine, John Travolta uses it next.  There must be 200 pieces of equipment in the room, but every time I finish with a machine, John Travolta and his trainer use it next. Not once. Not twice. But over and over and over again. It was really weird. I mean, I had to imagine that the personal trainer was directing the workout, and not John himself, so why the correlation?  I just imagined that since I was doing common lifts, my workout was probably similar to the one prescribed by the trainer.  But somewhere in the back of my mind, I started to feel like I was being cruised. So this goes on for about 45 minutes, and then I hit the treadmill to run a few more miles. John Travolta and his trainer disappear. I figured that was that.

EDIT3:  Story continued...
The gym was quiet again. I finished my run and then headed toward the showers.  Now, the gym floor was empty, and the locker room was empty, so I figured that, except for employees, there was no one around.  John Travolta must have finished his work out and went home, right? No....

At this gym, directly across from the showers is the sauna room.  And at the front of the sauna is a huge glass window, and it looks directly out into the shower room.  Well, when I round the corner from the hallway into the showers, I look back over my shoulder, and I can see John Travolta in the sauna room leaning up against the glass window.  It's a large room, and he's in the only spot that has a direct view of the locker room hallway and the showers.  He is sprawled out, laying across the bench and his towel is loosely draped over his body.

*Okaaaaay*, I think.  I head to my usual spot (last shower on the right), and immediately John Travolta leaves the sauna, sans towel, and starts showering as well.  The thing is, he's showering, but he's also staring right at me. And he has half an erection. (I'll save you the suspense, it was fucking enormous!  Like a horse.)  I'm thinking, *is this really happening*?  *Is John Travolta half-wanking at me??*  Well, to make a long story short I started to get pretty uncomfortable, so I grabbed my towel and walked out.  As I passed him, he turned to face me, holding his cock.  I just ignored him and walked away, laughing to myself.

I told my roommate at the time; he laughed at the story, but he was a little skeptical on the details.  Then I swear to God, not one week later, my roommate elbows me in the checkout-line at the market:  ""Look!""  It's a National Enquirer.  The cover story?  ""John Travolta hit on me in the shower!""

tl;dr. John Travolta followed me around the gym, all the way to the shower, and he had a semi-erection.

"reddittrees2","","","Dueling actually has a pretty interesting history and even more so when you get to this period. 

The objective isn't really to kill your opponent. Duels to the death were very uncommon however due to the medical knowledge of the time, or lack of it, many died later of infection. The objective was generally to land a shot, any shot. 

Then the 'second' would come in. Each man had a 'second' and he was sort of like the duelists keeper almost. The seconds did a bunch of things but importantly here they would check to see if the hit man wanted to or could continue or if he was going to concede. It was very often for the first wounded to concede and this would constitute victory for the other duelist, or satisfaction as it were. 

Now, a lot of times, unsurprisingly, neither party hit each other. Smooth bore and all that. If this happened (and this was far more common than even someone being hit) both parties could do a few things. They could either declare that the honor of both parties was satisfied simply by virtue of having the courage to stand and fire at each other. Or, one party could declare they wanted to continue and if the other party agreed they would resume the duel from the beginning. If one party wanted to continue and the other did not, that was most often seen as conceding. 

Once this was all over, the duel was over. Far more often than not the actual duel did not kill the shooters directly though as I said many died indirectly from infection. This was even true to a degree in times of edged weapons and the first with a serious wound would be allowed to concede or continue. 

It wasn't (usually) about killing the other guy. It was about their feeling of 'honor' and 'satisfaction'. If you felt dishonored by someone you might challenge them to a duel, showing that you are willing to face the pistol (or sword) on an equal battlefield with your enemy. Sometimes simply accepting the demand for a duel was enough to satisfy honor and it was left at that. Uncommon, but it did happen. 

Those are beautiful firearms too. This set is from what I see complete and quite ornate It includes everything from tools to clean to tools to make balls, measure powder and tamping. Most dueling sets were like this and owned by the higher society however these are in exceptionally good condition and if real and fromt he period are great examples. 

Dueling was outlawed however it continued for a number of decades after that in a more underground fashion though all manner of high society still participated. We don't have something too similar today except challenging someone to physical combat. That is often an uneven battlefield and would not be considered very honorable by their standards. Physical fighting was something done by drunks and brutes.

My mom told me this information so that same day after school I went over and asked if I could look for it. 25 minutes of trying to crawl under the porch and having a spider crawl down the back of my shirt, I retrieved the little one looking exactly like the kitten in your 1st picture.  

My mom's friend told me she could try nurse it back to health, but she didn't want the mom trying to kill it when it wasn't under her super vision. I asked if I could try and keep it if it lived. She said sure. She even offered to give me another kitten if the runt happened to die.  

The 1st few nights were rough because she wasn't eating. She was all bone and she had the most pitiful meow. I was convinced she was gonna die but I didn't stop trying. Finally after a bit of coaxing I got her to suck some milk off my finger. I remember crying from relief.  

I spent 6 wonderful and poopy weeks nursing her to health; making sure she was eating and breathing when she was sleeping. She was such a princess because she would start out on my chest, but curl up into the curve of my neck on my pillow every night. Every morning I'd wake up to some bright green eyes. It always made/makes my day.  

That was 2006. She was 2 pounds up until this past December. Now that she had surgery she's just a little over 4 pounds.  

I cried seeing the 1st picture, but squealed with delight when I saw those big eyes, alive and alert in the 3rd picture. Your friend is an angel.  

I'm also contributing my crying to being a little over 23 weeks pregnant. Haha

"Aqquila89","","","Dan Gardner writes the end of his book, *The Science of Fear*:

""In central Ontario, near where my parents live, there is a tiny cemetery filled with rusted ironwork and headstones heaved to odd angles by decades of winter frost and spring thaws. This was farm country once. Pioneers arrived at the end of the nineteenth century, cut the trees, pulled up the stumps, and discovered, after so much crushing labor, that their new fields amounted to little more than a thin layer of soil stretched across the bare granite of the Canadian Shield. Most farms lasted a generation or two before the fields were surrendered to the forests. Today, only the cemeteries remain.
 
 
The pioneers were not wealthy people, but they always bought the biggest headstones they could afford. They wanted something that declared who they were, something that would last. They knew how easily their own existence could end. Headstones had to endure. “Children of James and Janey Morden,” announces one obelisk in the cemetery. It’s almost six feet tall. The stone says the first to die was Charles W. Morden. He was four years and nine months old.
 
 
It was the winter of 1902. The little boy would have complained that he had a sore throat. He was tired and his forehead felt a little warm to his mother’s hand. A day or two passed and as Charles lay in bed he grew pale. His heart raced. His skin burned and he started to vomit. His throat swelled so that each breath was a struggle and his head was immobilized on the sweat-soaked pillow. His mother, Janey, would have known what was torturing her little boy, but with no treatment she likely wouldn’t have dared speak its name.
 
 
Then Charles’s little brother, Earl, started to cry. His throat was sore, he moaned. And he was so hot. Albert, the oldest of the boys, said he, too, was tired. And yes, his throat hurt.
 
 
Charles W. Morden died on Tuesday, January 14, 1902. His father would have had to wrap the little boy’s body in a blanket and carry him out through the deepening snow to the barn. The cold would seep into the corpse and freeze it solid until spring, when rising temperatures would thaw the ground and the father could dig his son’s grave.
 
 
The next day, both Earl and Albert died. Earl was two years and ten months old. Albert was six years and four months. Their father would have gotten out two more blankets, wrapped his sons, and taken them out to the barn to freeze.
 
 
Then the girls started to get sick. On January 18, 1902, the eldest died. Minnie Morden was ten years old. Her seven-year-old sister, Ellamanda, died the same day.
 
 
On Sunday, January 19, 1902, the fever took little Dorcas, barely eighteen months old. For the final time, James Morden bundled a child in a blanket, walked through the snow, and laid her down in the cold and dark of the barn, where she and her brothers and sisters would wait through the long winter to be buried.""

"3dbdotcom","","","I had a positive body image when I was 337 pounds. However, I knew I wasn't healthy. I wasn't trying to impress anyone (I am married and my wife met me at 330 pounds) so I didn't have a negative body image. Like many have said here, no one should ever promote that being obese is ok. It's not. I am now at 258 pounds. I've lost 79 pounds since the beginning of last December by dieting and exercising because I finally decided to start living healthier. I did if for many reasons, but mainly so that I wouldn't die at a young age. I wouldn't live a short life just so I could eat whatever I want. I still have a long way to go but I'm not stopping. 

Love yourself in your own body.
But also love yourself enough to change.
Obesity is dangerous. 
Leading people to believe it's not is irresponsible.

You'll have people on one side screaming about your town calling it a ghetto shithole that will never recover.  Then you'll have the social justice warrior brigade on the other side making it look like you've got KKK levels of minority oppression and beatdowns by shady cops in the streets 24/7.  Neither depiction is my daily life experience.

I have friends who are deeply involved in protests and I have friends who are police officers and elected officials.  The media circus will be brutal in both directions.  They don't give a fuck about the people who live there -- they want their sensationalist bullshit for the 24 hour news cycle.  There will be nights where there will be more media present than protesters.  There will be racist trolls and there will be race-baiting opportunists working to raise a quick buck and furthering their own profiles and media presence.

Then there's the people like my family and my neighbors.  We're stuck in the middle.  We want safe streets and no race/class oppression.  We want to go to the goddamned farmer's market without fist fights and screaming.  We want the outside world to realize that there's a lot more than the sum of a few images seen on televisions and the internet around the world.  I'd also like it if my house value hadn't just plummeted 47%, but hey...  that last one's just me.  Again, I'm sorry, Baltimore.

EDIT: Thank you everybody for your support! You too can make a difference by registering (see below). I was sent some paperwork to complete by the CU health transplant office and that is completed (medical history, current medical stuff, support systems, etc...) and faxed back to the office. It is under review and if approved (no idea why it wouldn't), they will help me schedule the first round of tests (blood/urine/tissue) to start the entire process!!! Thanks everybody!

Just a tip though, it's always better to establish a tank about a week or even 2 weeks before adding the fish. It allows good bacteria to grow in the filter and remove the ammonia in fish waste. Since the tank will be brand new, make sure you replace some of the water in the tank on a daily basis for the first 2 weeks and, if you can, get a water testing kit and check on the pH of the water too.

"anothercarguy","","","Not sure if real but here is what goes on with these hunts:

GDP per capita in countries where it is legal to hunt: ~$2000

Cost for the Elephant tag: $60,000

Cost for the hunt itself: ~$15000

Elephants that are legal to kill: Sterile males ~50 years old that chase off bulls from the females.

Where does the money go: To hire more park rangers, local communities etc.

Where does the meat go: To the local villages and feeds them for quite some time.

What is the effect on the elephant population: Areas where trophy hunts are legal and regulated have increasing elephant populations because they have the money to hire rangers etc. The locals know how much they are worth and protect them to bring in the wealthy hunters who buy tons of stuff at Mzungu prices. As this is an annoyance elephant, younger ones can mate and propagate the species. 

How hard is it to kill the elephant: Fucking hard! The brain box is small and behind a very thick piece of bone. It takes something like a .458 Lott or larger to take down an elephant, the target is very small and moving to stomp you. Very expensive double rifles are usually employed *up to* some of the finest in the world http://hollandandholland.com/gun-room/royal-double-rifle/
Yes that says *starting* at $175,000

"GetOutOfBox","","","I too have felt the pain of being ""betrayed"" by someone I loved (it's complicated, we weren't in a relationship but I was played with, perhaps intentionally, perhaps unintentionally, it doesn't matter; the point is I truly loved that person, and will always in a fashion).

First there's the depression; crying, wondering what cruel world could dangle love before your eyes only to snatch it away when you least expect it.

Then there's the anger and bitterness. You learn to despise the person; realizing they were not who you thought they were. In a way, this is yet another way they hurt you.

Then comes the burnt out period. The words that sprung to my mind when I was experiencing it was ""I feel as if I am a thousand years old, and have withered away into nothing"". You feel as if you've endured endless torture, and have reached a point where you just don't care. This is the point where you must be careful. Some people look too deep into the pain that still lies within, and refuse to let it go, as it's all that remains of something that was once beautiful to them. At this stage, you must learn to release it. That means ridding them from your life in every way. Eliminate contact. Put away any kind of objects that provoke strong memories somewhere where you won't be tempted to reminisce (one day, you may still want them, and perhaps not; but it's best during this time to not make any decisions that might make you feel worse afterwards). Focus on things that make you happy, even if they don't do much for you. I watched tons of The Office, as well as a really beautiful TV show called ""Northern Exposure"" (I very highly recommend it; it's a show about a New York doctor's misadventures in a little Alaskan town, filled with profound but down to earth little stories that will help you through pretty much anything. There have been two parts of my life where that show helped me find myself again).

Above all, as cheesy and cliche as it is, it will get better. What most people who say that to console you don't realize is that it can take a long time, but as someone who's been there, it does eventually get better. You find new appreciation for life's beauty, and eventually you find it in yourself to forgive the person, even if they don't deserve it. Forgiveness is ultimately the only way to heal such a wound, as it allows you to leave that last little bit of them behind.

When I first got my puppy, Phineas, my friend had rescued him and his whole litter from a kill-shelter in Kentucky. (I live in New Jersey). Unfortunately, they had [Parvo](http://pets.webmd.com/dogs/parvo-parvovirus-dogs) virus.

The rest of his siblings did not make it, but Phinny fought his hardest. He was in quarantine at the vet for almost 2 weeks when we came to the end. The vet gave us one additional option - a blood transfusion. It was certainly not a guarantee, but it was one last option before there was nothing left. His vitals were dropping, he couldn't stand on his own, he was just a lump of bone and fur.

As my fiance and I were discussing it, Phin climbed into my lap. A dog that couldn't hold his own 4 lb weight, used whatever energy he had in him to climb into my lap and lick my hand. There was no other option at that point. He received the blood from his donor dog and within hours his coat went from dull to shiny, he was standing little by little, and he was finally keeping food down.

Without this donor blood, I would not have my best friend here with me today. So thank you and thank Mac for this amazing sacrifice.

It's extremely atmospheric! Everyone lines the edges of the streets and waits for the procession to start. You will know when it starts though because a large feature of the procession is the drums. Each parish gets youngsters and trains them for the year with the drums, the main drums are about 1m in diameter. These drums are extremely loud and you can hear them from great distances. The people who play these drums have to beat them extremely hard and often their hands will bleed. On the drums there are stains of blood. Each and every one of them.
