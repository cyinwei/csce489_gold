True,WarPhalange,,,"Alright, I've had my fun. Here's the deal: I lied. This was all fabricated. I did not have cancer and don't even care about Diablo 3. This was just an exercise to see just how gullible you idiots are. I took the image from this post:

http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/qd8nv/i_stopped_gaming_to_get_my_grades_up_a_few_weeks/

Rehosted it on imgur and created some stupid story behind it I knew you would gobble up. Not a single fucking person thought to call bullshit.

Funny enough only the automated bot ""caught on"".

**EDIT:** Okay, I get a lot of people shocked at this and asking ""WHY DID YOU DO THIS????"" so I'm putting this here before it gets locked at the 6 month mark.

**Why I did this**: Several reasons. You've already read the part about you all being gullible. And no, don't give me ""But we trusted you and wanted to be nice!!"" Bullshit. You all upvote stupid ""HAY GAISE I FOUND THIS IN MY GRAMPA'S ATTIC AT A GARAGE SALE IN GOODWILL FOR A DOLLAR!!!"" which is just as obviously fake. What's your excuse there?

But there's more. Why did you bother upvoting this? Is it because you wanted others to see what a D3 beta invite looks like? No. You did it because you are patronizing fucks. ""Awww... he has cancer. I'll give him upvotes."" What the fuck is that?

Reddit started as a place to share content. You upvote what you think deserves other users' attention. Upvotes are NOT a reward. Would this submission have been as upvoted as it was (it was on the front page of /r/gaming) if I hadn't put that cancer bit in there? No. So why is the cancer relevant to this at all? People upvoted this out of pity. People do this all the time here. Not just with sick people, or people who have been dumped, or people whose dog died, but even stupid ""lol it's my CAEKDAY REDDIT!!1"" bullshit. They knowingly post stupid shit and think they are warranted attention for it just because they've been here for a year? Fuck those people.

**Do I feel remorse?** No, because I don't think I did anything that would make me feel remorse. I didn't take your money. I didn't hurt you physically, emotionally, or mentally. Now, some people have claimed that I *did* hurt them. Ok. Well, if you're the type of person that is hurt by a stranger on the internet lying, not even directly to you but in general, then you probably have some mental problems you need worked out. Don't be ashamed of it, lots of people have trouble coping with the world today. There's a lot of stress out there. Humans weren't meant to deal with it all. It's amazing we've come as far as we have, in fact. But be reasonable. I didn't come find you and con you. I don't know or care who the fuck you are. A normal person should be able to just brush this off.

Anyway, if I could go back, I would have changed this to something more mundane than cancer. A broken arm maybe. People are so fucking stupid they can't or don't want to read the whole message and just yell ""FAEK CANCER!111"" over and over. The funniest part is that I didn't fake cancer. I didn't do shit. I just said I had it, and then later said I don't. I didn't take pictures of myself with a shaved head and hooked up to IVs. I didn't do anything to try and convince you. Lying vs. faking. Lying about someone's death vs. faking it is different, right? Lying about having an orgasm vs. faking it is different, right? Same thing here. So I don't even understand why people think I ""faked"" cancer.

**One last point**. Lots of people say I did it for karma. I'm sorry, what? If I wanted karma, do you think I would have made this post? The karma train crashed and burned when I made it and I knew it would. If I wanted karma, I would have kept the lie up. This is why I don't feel any remorse.

True,leconfield,,,"I believe I have cracked the code in the Omar Khayyam:  It reads:

1st Line:       Number 124    (MRGOABABD)

2nd Line:      Is a mistake and crossed out (MLIAOI)

3rd Line:       IORSN   Keijo  K16    (NTBIMPANETP)

4th Line:       Naser beset c          (MLIABOAIAQc)

5th line:       Soon open 5? Omer (ITTMTSAM5TGAB)


Explanation:
Line 1         Number 124  this represents a numbered cable sent by Moscow to its Russian Embassy in Canberra Australia, between the months of August and October 1948.  The number fits in exactly with the Venona Cables released on the net by America.  The last one released by America in the Australian  Stream is from Moscow to Canberra Cable No 104 dated 5th June 1948.  The Russians numbered each of their cables sent starting with the number 1 at the beginning of each year. So if it took till the 5th June 1948 to get to No 104 that averages about 17 cables per month (give or take) so August to September 1948 would be very close to being right for Number 124.  The Russian codes in these Cables were broken by the Americans and it remained a TOP SECRET that they had been broken, for at least 20 years It became known as the Venona Project.(Its on the net)

Line No 2.  This is a mistake the writer started to write the 4th line made a mistake and crossed it out

Line No 3. IORSN  Keijo  16.   
a,  The  IORSN stands for Independent on Line Radio Station Network it is an Acronym (Google it!).  
b.  Keijo, is the name given to Seoul in Korea in  the early 1900's when Japan took over Korea and renamed Seoul Keijo.  That was the name the world used till about 1946 when  Japan was dispossessed of Korea and VERY SLOWLY the name reverted back to Seoul. 
c,  'K16' Is a Korean/American Airforce Base situated near Seoul (Keijo) In this substitution code 'P' = K AND  P is the 16th letter of the alphabet.  So only the letter P had to be written at the end of this 3rd line to make it read  K 16 This line is probably ordering an illegal secret Communist Radio Network for site 'K16', or it is advising the Australian Spy Network what type of communication system exists at K 16, the Airforce Base.  This would then allow the Australian spy network to build some sort of secret communist interception device so base communications could be secretly listened into by Russia/North Korea. 

4th Line:   Naser Beset c.  Naser I believe is a Russian Code word dedicated to possibly Australian Army Intelligence.  In 1948 in Australia a Russian Communist Spy Ring leader by the name of Walter Snedden Clayton,(Russian Code Names 'c' and 'klod') had managed to infiltrate and recruit from many Australian Government Departments  dozens of Communist spies  - the Departments were leaking like sieves. Clayton also was involved with Communist controlled Unions and  with some people working for the then CSIRO in Sydney, one a Communist by the name of  Wilbur Christiansen (Russian Code Name ""Master"")  was the world's leading Radio Physicist.  Clayton was reported as saying Christiansen was working on a 'special project' for the Communist Party and doing a 'good job of it'  There were other very prominant Communists also working with Christiansen.  Christiansen I believe may have been building illegal radios/communications/radar etc to help Russia/North Korea who had very poor radio equipment or building some sort of secret Communist interception device to listen into K16 Airforce base.  I believe with the help of Clayton, the Aust. Communist Maritime Unions and others they were shipping illegal radios etc to Korea to help North Korea prepare for the 1950 invasion of the South.  In 1948, Another Australian Russian Spy who came from the Australian Department of External Affairs, and who in 1948 was posted to the UN in New York, was one Ian Milner (Russian Code Name 'Bur"").  In 1948 Milner spent considerable time in Keijo (Seoul) working for the UN, but I believe may have been secretly setting up North Korean Communist Spy Networks, or reporting to Russia/North Korea South Korea's defence capabilities etc  in preparation for the 1950 invasion. What ever he was doing he was up to no good and also Christiansen.  I believe the cable is part of Milners communication to Christiansen ordering a Radio Network for ""Keijo K16"", the airforce base, or he is advising Christiansen what type of communications exist at the base so Christiansen and others can build interception devices.  The FBI in New York hold a file on Milner and refuse to release it.  Also in 1948 The future Australian Attorney General Dr Evatt, who is now also 'suspected' of being a Russian spy, was Secretary of the UN. He and Milner worked together in the UN and in the Department of External Affairs in Canberra.  Australia was 'leaking' so much that America stopped sharing classified information with it for some time.  In about June 1948 two Aust. Army Officers were visiting with Christiansen looking at radios etc when Christiansen and a Dr Green took them for coffee and tried to extract secret army radio codes from them.  The two Officers reported back to their Commander on what had happened and Aust Army Intelligence then demanded an investigation in Christiansen &amp; Green.  Up to that point, another secret Australia Communist spy (O yes there were 1000's!) by the name of Alfred Hughes (Russian Code Name 'Ben') was in charge of the Commonwealth Investigation Service's branch in Sydney looking at and checking out Communists! The CIS was the forerunner leading to the establishment of ASIO in January 1949.  Up till the 2 Army Officers complaint, Hughes had managed to sweep a lot 'under the carpet' but this time he was unable to do much because Army Intelligence (?Naser) had taken control, that lead to the fourth line in the code:  ""Naser beset c""  The small 'c' is clearly defined and written in the Omar code and is the way the Russians codes referred to Clayton.  Beset of course means to harass. If Army Intelligence got onto Christiansen &amp; Green, Clayton 'c' would be next in line. Milner defected behind the iron curtain just before the start of the Korean war and lived there for the rest of his life.

5 Line:  Soon Open 5? Omar.  This is self explanatory, when the Australian Spy Network got an order to ""Soon open ?5 Omar"" they obviously had to open their probably special, secret Communist printed, Omar Books and follow their Instructions regarding verse 5.  I am not absolutely sure it is a 5, but believe when one looks at verse 5 in Omar it talks about hiding things and burying them in the sand.  Clayton spent most of his time organising clandestine meetings and hiding places for illegal Communist equipmen with secret Communist members. He had a network of drops and hiding places and delivery services &amp; CODES. He mixed with known Russian KGB agents in Sydney.    It is reported that at one stage he had an illegal Communist Printing Press buried in a 'chook' (Chicken) Yard. In 1947/8 the Communist Party of Australia tried to buy a small Export Business in Sydney.  This would have been ideal for the exporting of their illegal radios etc.  The other reason  it might be a 5 is Europeans usually write their 7's with one or two small strokes thru it, I think the same has been done by the Russian that wrote the 5 so it didn't get mixed up with an S.  This code is a very crude substitution code made up by Clayton.  The Russians had top secret codes, they were only sent to one or two trusted people in  each Embassy around the world.  When the Secret cables arrived the person receiving them in the Russian Embassy in Canberra  then worked out who they were to go to in the Spy Network and the top secret code was then transferred into Claytons made up code.  There is NO WAY the Russians would ever allow their secret codes to be given to all the spy networks, too dangerous, America would have had it in no time. So the code got tranformed into Claytons Code the value is this:

Code Letter A = E (also 1)   B = R (also 2)   R=U  M=N  G=M  O=B  T=O  S=P  L=A  Q=T  c=Clayton  E=J  P=K (also 16)  D= 4   I=S  N=I
               
I believe the line that divides the code represents that the top half above the line is an actual (or part of) Venona Cable No 124, while the lines below are an internal warning to the Australia Spy Group.   The original Omar associated with this case went missing and it is my bet it is locked up in a big safe in some organisations basement.

As I have deciphered this code word by word into English.  Logically and statistically there can be no other word interpretation.  Save your time searching the codes, its homemade and very crude to say the least.

Another very strange incident in all of this is:  When the Somerton Man's suitcase was found at the luggage section at the Adelaide Railway Station (unclaimed) there was a luggage tag attached to the case, it read the date of lodgement of the case, 30th November 1948, and the lodgement number BUT written in pencil across the top of the label in large letters was the number   K 16.

You will need to read this a few times to understand its complexities.  There was not one Aust Communist Spy convicted in Claytons Spy Ring, and this was because to convict them the Venona Cables would have had to be publicly released and the 'powers that be' were not prepared to do that. A lot of the spies lived a full and happy life and some still waited for the next Communist Revolution. Christiansen visited China repeatedly and they Loved him. Clayton 'went fishing' when his spy ring was exposed and in hiding when the Omar Khayyam was found, he died in 1997 aged 90.  The Somerton Man's identify had to be hidden or else again the Venona Codes would have been exposed.  I personally believe at this stage he was a possible KGB agent working as a Russian Ballet dancer things seem to point to this but as yet I have no proof.  I have someone in mind but need help to identify and expose him as the information must come from Russia

Finally the Russian has made a spelling mistake in the last line of the code, he has spelt Omar as OmEr.",0,1331737436,,0,1354718365,1,c40xu6w,t3_nohoo,t1_c40xu6w,t3_nohoo,,1428524165,1,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,1

Don't feel too bad. Religion has been going on for thousands and thousands of years. Modern scientific inquiry and extensive understanding of the universe and its laws have only come about in the last few hundred. Look at all the progress we've made in evaporating belief in bullshit in just a few hundred years! I'm proud of humanity. Someday religion will disappear altogether, but probably not in our lifetimes. We have a lot of work to do. That's the fun of it, so get to work and be happy about the miracle of existence. 

Don't be angry with religious people. Pity their ignorance of the vast marvelous beauty of the universe. Pity the fact that they're forced to live in a tiny world with a beginning and an end and filled with obedience, submission and judgment. Go about every day with the attitude that the universe is a beautiful and infinite place and we are beautiful creatures who have a brief opportunity to show other beautiful creatures the wonder of existence.  

Therefore, be motivated not by anger, but rather by wonder. Break people away from blind faith not out of disgust, but out of love and hope and dedication to truth, freedom and clarity. Treat every person as a miracle and possible witness to the glory of the universe.

True,MyWifesBusty,,,"The guide is intended to get you really close to wearing the perfect size *but* there is no alternative to actually trying on bras and assessing the fit. Ideally, every woman would have access to a well stocked lingerie store that carried everything from 24A to 50K, but alas.

You'll need a tailor's/cloth tape, a scratch pad and pen, and (if at all possible) a friend/significant other to help. You don't *need* a friend, but it's really helpful to have one as they can make sure you've got the tape lined up neatly and do the measurement for you. 

First, here's the ""Don't do this!"" part of the program. 

Don't measure yourself wearing a bra, even a bra you think is a good fitting bra. You'll effectively be measuring the bra and not your breast tissue. 

Don't wear *anything*. You're not trying to measure yourself to wear a bra over a t-shirt or a bra over another bra or anything. You want a skin-to-tape measurement. 

Don't do any weird math, fancy over/under the boobs nonsense, or anything else you've ever heard about measuring for a bra. 

Alright, you're naked and you've got your tape and pen/paper. Now, let's get measuring! =) 

* Lean forward so that your back is parallel with the floor. *This is important*. You want gravity the help pull all your breast tissue forward, even the breast tissue that your previously ill-fitting bra squished back under your arms (and even around onto your back). You may even want to take a moment to reach back and massage your sides, kind of pushing the breast tissue forward with a sweeping motion.  Measure around your torso with the tape passing over the fullest part of your hanging breasts. Keep the tape as straight as possible (essentially perpendicular to the floor if you've done your best to make your body parallel to it.)

This measurement *should be loose*. Tighten the tape just tight enough that it doesn't easily slide off the skin if nudged, but not tight enough to begin to deform the breast tissue. 

So! Upper body parallel, measure with a snug and straight tape, and write that number down. For the sake of this example, let's say 42 inches. Write it down. 

*Note:* If you have pendulous breasts you may wish to take two measurements and average them.  You can measure yourself once in the hanging position, then once in the standing position and average the two numbers. 

I strongly suggest leaning towards the larger measurement. The *vast* majority of the “90% of women wear the wrong bra” crowd are wearing bras with radically undersized cups. Make sure there is room for your breasts and then work down to a snug cup fit!

* Next we measure for the band. Wrap the tape around your torso, directly under the root of your breast.  *Wherever* your breast tissue terminates into the torso, that's where the band should be sitting. Even if it seems high (because you're used to wearing poor fitting bras or you have breasts with a high root but signification slope) you want the band to sit at the root of the breast so that the breast tissue is laying nicely in the cups. 

You want this measurement *to be very snug*. Pull the tape tight enough that it feels really snug but not so tight as to be a corset or a that it leaves a red mark in your skin. It's important you get a snug measurement; If you start with a band that is an inch or more too big it will not only fail to support you right from the start but it will rapidly get worse. 

So! Measure tight but not so tight that you leave a red mark on the skin. Write this measurement down. For the sake of this example, let's say the measurement was 34 inches. 

* Armed with those numbers: 42 inches over the fullest point of the bust and 34 inches snug around the rib cage, it's time to do some very minor calculating. You can do it manually or you can use a bra fit calculator. The big caveat is that 99% of bra fit calculators are absolute garbage; they're so bad as to be completely useless. 

That said, as of this writing (3/29/12) the [bra fit calculator at Sophisticated Pair](http://www.sophisticatedpair.com/bracalculator.htm) is *excellent*. Probably the best one online at the moment. If we plug in the numbers we got with our measuring, it suggests that our model would likely be comfortable wearing a US 34H or a UK 34FF. 

If you'd like to calculate your bra size manually you need the band size and the difference between the bust size and the band size. In the case of our example the band size is 34 inches and the different is 8 inches. The cup size is determined by the difference (8 inches, in this case).

You may notice that US bra manufacturers do not have their shit together. That would be an accurate observation. UK companies are almost completely standardized with a little variation in cut/cup size between companies and within their various lines. US companies are all over the map; part of it is a stupid fixation with not making bras bigger than ""D"", so G cups are sometimes labeled as DDDD. So stupid. To further compound the confusion, some US companies have thrown in the towel on the US system and are now using the UK system (because it's clearly easier to understand). *Manually calculating your bra size using the US system is a complete crap shoot once you get above around a DD cup; US brands are ridiculously inconsistent*. 

With that in mind, I'd strongly suggest you start with UK brands first, to avoid frustration. Brands like Panache, Freya, Fantasie, and Curvy Kate are all great brands to start with. You can find lots of UK brands for dirt cheap at BraStop.com--we're talking bras that cost $75-120 in the US for a mere $20-30 USD. 

The real test is actually trying the bra on. I'd suggest ordering a few bras from a few companies, around the size you think you are. Once you get the bras, try them on (making sure to use your hand to gently scoop *all* your breast tissue from the sides and armpit area into the cup) and assess the fit.

You *must* get in the habit of doing the scoop-and-swoop move.  It enhances your bust, it smooths out armpit and back bulges, and (for larger chested women especially) it helps the breast fat that crappy bras have savagely smashed into your armpits and around your torso, migrate back into place. For women with C cup breasts and larger, it's not uncommon to go up a cup size after a few months of wearing the right size bra because all the previously smashed-around-""chub"" has settled back into it's proper place: in the breasts. 

As far as the cups go... You want *all* the breast tissue in the cups. None bulging out in the arm pits, none being pushed back against your ribs, and none spilling out over the top of the cups (the dreaded quad-boob). 

The band should be snug (you should be able to slide a finger or two under it comfortably, but no more), it should be parallel to the floor, it should touch your chest all the way around (if the band doesn't sit flush to your breast bone in the front, that means the cups are too small and your breasts are lifting the band/gore away from your torso). 

Here's a quick trouble shooting list: 

* Breasts spill over cup either on the tops or out the sides (like into the armpit area)? The cup is too small, go up a cup size. 
* Bra cup is wrinkly? Either the cup is too big or the style of the cup isn't suited to your breast shape (i.e. the cup is shaped to compliment a woman with upper pole fullness and you're more of a lower pole kinda gal). 
* Underwires are digging into your sides/armpits or aren't flush against your ribs? Cup size too small, go up a cup. 
* Band too tight? Increase band size. 
* Band rides up in the back? (i.e. curves towards your neck, not parallel with the floor?) The band is too big, go down a band size. 
* Gore doesn't tack? (the center of the cups, where the underwires form a little bridge of sorts isn't touching your torso?) Cup size is too small, go up a size. 
* Straps painfully digging in? Loosen the straps to a two-finger tightness. Do your breasts sag? Then you were using the straps to over support them. You most likely need a tighter band. 

Remember, the cup and band are not independent. If you make an adjustment to the cup or band size you need to make an adjustment to the other element. For example, if you're wearing a 34H and you feel the band doesn't fit well, your next stop should be a 32HH not a 32H (unless of course you're attempting to diagnose a poor band *and* cup fit at the same time). 

Most of all, it should be comfortable and flattering. Even if it meets all the requirements: breasts in cups, band flush, should straps not digging it... if it makes your boobs pointier than you'd like, gives them a weird shape, or otherwise doesn't make you feel awesome... send it back. You've spent too much time wearing the wrong size bra to settle at this point in the project.
