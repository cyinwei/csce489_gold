True,DeadSeaGulls,,,"http://imgur.com/gaymlJW    
my girlfriend and I took a set of jenga blocks and etched in the word ""truth"" or ""dare"" into the blocks, and a number that corresponded with either the truth sheet or dare sheet.    
each sheet was a list of truths or dares... all of them mildly humorous on paper, but devastating in reality.   
Questions like: ""when was the last time you faked an orgasm, if you haven't or can't recall, fake one now.""  
or  
""what's the strangest thing you've ever masturbated with, if nothing unusual, smell the finger of every person in group and describe the smell.""  
Dares like ""Demonstrate your favorite sexual position with the person on your left.""  
or  
""Let DeadSeaGulls tattoo your right thigh."" (I have almost no tattoo experience.)   
Among the truths and dares there were 5 group choice in each category.  

Any truth or dare could be declined by a shot, and if anyone intentionally knocks over the tower they have to lick the left nipple of all same sex players until the nipple is erect.  
Loser has to take a shot and do a group choice dare.  

This game nearly broke up 3 couples.  in the picture above, the girl eating the sunchip out of my ass is the guy on the rights girlfriend.   The questions were too real. too raw. resulted in people walking out of the room. but at the same time it was like a train wreck, they kept coming back.  At first you decline so many of them by taking a shot... but after 7 shots.... you're answering what the sluttiest thing you've ever done was, right next to your girlfriend, who decided that she's going to TRUTHFULLY answer the last time she faked an orgasm... shit was brutal.  everyone ended up naked and in the snow.   

all relationships still in tact, but in the way that people who survive a disaster sometimes stay in touch.

True,FRIENDLY_CANADIAN,,,"I'm not going to try to eviscerate your comment completely because I feel there is some truth to what you are saying, yet I have to say something because I feel you are more misinformed and your view of certain concepts is skewed.

&gt;Before you say ""it's cause of poverty!"", blacks are only 2.7 times as likely to be in poverty[2] . If you were to create some sort of crime/poverty index, in which crime rates are adjusted for poverty, blacks would still be way more likely to commit crime.

You can't simply take two number and attempt to completely explain correlation vs causation with such a complex issue. When it comes to stats you can create any story you want and this is exactly what you did in this instance. What about over representation? Accumulation of wealth through the years? Social policy and funding? Historical context? Etc.

In this instance, you are trying to fill in the blanks with the story and are missing the big picture. 

The over representation of blacks within the criminal justice system is far more complex than simply saying they commit more crimes. The fact that they are 2.7 more likely to be in poverty plays into the context, but you leave out much of the complicated social dynamics attached to it. The reality is that in North America, when a black person commits a crime, people are much more likely to notice and report it. Once a police comes along, they are more likely to get charged and when they go to court, they are likelier to receive a stronger sentence. (I can source this if asked, no time now. It's in a number of journals I have read through)

The system is stacked against them at every turn. In this instance, their ""culture"" is actually a counter culture that emerged against the rest of society that had ostracized and alienated them for years. 

The thing I completely disagree with, is that you say it is part of THEIR culture. It's is not about the fact that they are black, but more so about the fact that they are a MINORITY within society. 

As a contrast - the same crime/poverty/overrepresentation scenario plays out the same way for aboriginals in Canada, and they are not black. Yet, they face the same historical socio-economic realities as black people in America, and are much more likely to commit a crime, go to court, and go to prison that white people. 

So basically, when you have a group of people who are visibly different than another group, the one who holds less social power on the micro level of day to day living as well as the macro dynamics of social super structures, the minority are far more likely to be accused, tried, and sentenced than those in power. It's part of the social dynamic and happens in increments throughout the socials structure. 

I'm not saying black people don't commit more crimes in the united states, but it is far too easy for you to jump to the conclusions why. It's not that simple, and the fact that you find your conclusion and fill in the facts to fit your view is deceptive. 

Don't get me started on your completely subjective generalization of only being a victim of crime from black people. I'm sick to my stomach reading you using stats to validate your argument, and then throw a subjective narrative to the mix. Not only that, human memory is fallible at best. Also, one point of data is worthless. 

Again, my intention is not to insult or insinuate, only to point out that it's just not that simple. And considering the historical and social context, it is a cop out to simply point the finger at their ""culture"". This negative ""black culture"" does not propagate itself through all black cultures around the world - in many ways it is a response that has risen through years of oppression. It is a social construct. So should we further alienate a group which has a number of issues to overcome, or do we work together to remove racially charged social policies, with the aim of making everyone more equal?

Also, your final line of text is quite ironic considering the context; 

""If you can't see the situation for what it is, we're never going to create the right solutions to fix it."" 

That is exactly my point, and the reason I replied.

True,WHM-6R,,,"Someone should make ""deployment simulator 2013"" where you spend most of the game sweeping sand out of a goddamn tent and getting chewed out by the Sgt.  Occasionally you go out on a patrol, which involves hours of walking around and nothing happening.  Roughly once every few hundred hours of play time you get ambushed.  There's a loud explosion, which has a random chance to just outright just kill you.  If you do die, then you must purchase a new CD key before the game allows you to start the campaign again.  If you survive the initial IED blast, then you get to spend several hours crawling around, tending to wounded comrades, and shooting at where everyone thinks the enemies generally are.  If you're really lucky you might actually see a handful of actual insurgents over the course of the entire game.  After a couple hours of rises and falls in the action, you eventually advance to where you think the enemy was and see a few puddles of blood.  You and your squad members argue about how many insurgent probably got killed, but since they carry the bodies away with them, you don't really know for sure.  After a couple thousand hours of play time, you get to come back home.  After arriving back home, you get to discover that your wife cheated on you and you get to spend the next several hundred hours working your way through a divorce proceeding, trying to get your health benefits to actually come through, and wondering whether those nightmares are a sign of PTSD or just a normal part of the readjustment process.  That should cause everyone to shut the fuck up about how terrible it is that Unreal Tournament doesn't feature realistic magazine mechanics.

Edit: Since this comment is actually getting some attention, I'd like to quickly clarify a couple things.  First off, I have never actually been in the military.  None of the above described events have ever actually happened to me, however they have all happened to people I personally know (a decent number of my friends and former coworkers are veterans).  Secondly, I am a pretty big fan of the tactical shooter genre.  Rainbow Six is one of my favorite games of all time and I do enjoy games with more ""realistic"" magazine mechanics.  This comment was meant to criticize the train of thought that believes making a shooter more ""realistic"" by default makes it better (which is why almost every shooter these days feels compelled to throw in an iron sights mechanic and make characters move slowly), not to shit on the tactical shooter genre.

I'm not sure if you are saying that you just want to be able to be around him but really good friends, and you have the added problem of dealing with the emotional impact of falling out, or that you want to try to repair it and be good friends? Either way, I think a good first step would be to try to distance yourself. Don't be off-putting or rude, but give yourself some distance, so you can get some more healing and get a better perspective on thing. This might mean avoiding things where he is at, but since you have the same friend circle that's harder. If you see him, I'd say be nice and polite and cordial, but don't push anything, and don't get into anything too emotionally charged (lest it fall out right there). If he ignores your comments and actions, that's on him. He has his reason for acting that way, but it's not on you or your fault. That might not mean much, but just keep in mind you can't control how he feels, you can only control how you act and feel. Maybe he'll get some clearer vision after stepping back and getting distance himself and work through his own grudge.

I get what you're saying about it representing your failure, and something you can't fix. I *completely* get that, that's exactly what I felt with my ex-best friend. And it sucks, big time. Wondering if there is something you could have done better, maybe thinking where it all went wrong, why it has to be this way. But to the failure and not being able to resolve it, it's really important to remember that he is the one that acted how he did and flipped out when you turned him down (and questioned your own sexuality, which he has no business doing). His reaction was over the top. And his feelings are his alone. You can't control them, so please don't feel like it's your *fault* that he feels how he does. Just act the best you can, and true to yourself. From what you've said it sounds like you really are a caring and empathetic guy, and what the best for your friends and want things to work out. I highly doubt you are a failure as a friend. It's a shitty situation, but that doesn't mean it's your fault. And sometimes, there isn't anything you can really do to ""fix"" it or resolve it. It doesn't sound like you made a big mistake or error, and you did the best you could with what you had, and even then, most of it is on him imo. But, I do understand being in that position, and how f***ed up it feels, and all you want is for it to be like before, and you just want them back. 

I would also say, it sounds like he's not the kind of friend you deserve. He freaked out and became petty over something totally not deserving of that. And you deserve friends that will respect, love, and want the best for you. Sure there will be fights and conflicts, but there has to be an overall balance and level of caring, and it sounds like he's disregarded all that. Think about some of his behaviors, how he's acted, and how he's treated you. Is that someone you want to be friends with, that would treat you like that over something like saying no to his advances? You had good times, there is no doubt, but you've seen another side of him. If you could be friends again somehow, do you think you'd be able to get past what he's done, knowing it's possible he may do the same thing? I'm sorry for being so blunt about it, but it really sounds like you deserve more than what he was giving you.

Our grandmother who lived on the other side of the country whom we had both only met a handful of times died, so neither one of us really gave 2 shits. I know it sounds kind of douchey but whatever, we didn't even know the lady.  SO everybody else is grieving and as 2 11 year old boys would do while bored out of their minds, we went exploring during the wake.  This funeral home was a converted Victorian era mansion and the ground floor was the only part open to guests. We snuck past the velvet rope on the stairs and off we went.  When we got upstairs we hid in the first room for a minute just to make sure nobody saw us sneak off. This happened to be a giant bathroom where the bathtub was stacked all the way to the ceiling with magazines, and I'd guess another 5'x5' pile nearly 4' high next to the bathtub. We had hit the puberty jackpot. After looking through them and picking out the best ones, we stuffed our pants and shirts full of magazines.  We couldn't be happy with 1 or 2, we tucked our pants into our socks and shoved as many magazines as could fit down our pants, then tucked our shirts into our pants and did the same above the belt. We decided to casually walk down the stairs and pretend we got lost if anybody saw us.  Our plan was to go out back and hide the magazines in the bushes and come back later on our bikes to retrieve them.  So as we are walking down the steps, we get spotted immediately .  We tried to pay if cool, but as 2 11 year olds with 30+ magazines shoved down our pants we didn't have the best poker faces.

True,BakingBrad,gold gilded l-19fhhx c-c8nm3e2,Made a 13-year-old Cry,"Well little Billy, do you know what it's like to eat peanut butter crackers a lot? The first few crackers are good, but after that, it starts lose its appeal. It becomes boring, and you'll stop eating them and go eat something else. You like peanut butter crackers, but you don't want to eat them every day. But what if you had nothing else to eat? You would have to eat them, or else you would go hungry and start to feel really tired and sick.

In war, we have these meals MREs, which stands for Meals, Ready to Eat. They contain an assortment of food that isn't too bad at first. But when you're out at war, that's all you have to eat, and you get sick of it really quickly. It soon doesn't even taste like anything, you are eating it just to stay alive.

While the lack of awesome food sucks, it's nothing compared to the pain you may or may not experience. You remember how much it hurt when you broke your ankle playing soccer? Well, try to imagine being on the battle field, and you're trying to hide from a bunch of other guys who are trying to break your ankle. Many days will go by where nothing happens, you're just waiting and watching. Then, all of a sudden, they're everywhere, firing bullets and you're either running or hiding, or worse, hiding and forced to shoot back. If you're lucky, you and your friends won't get hurt and you'll get away with only fear to follow you back. If you're unlucky, you and/or your friend is hurt or dead.

Pain varies in war. Some may never experience anything worse than an uncomfortable place to sleep at night. Some will get scratches and bruises. Others will have broken bones and some will even lose their limbs. At worse, some will die. Do you remember how sad you were when your dog, Scruffy, died? Well, war is watching hundreds of Scruffy's die, and most of the time, it's not pretty. While Scruffy was put to sleep and died peacefully within a few seconds, in war they may die slowly, crying and begging for you to kill them just to make the pain go away. 

Every death or pain caused to your brothers is one you'll always think about, wondering if you did something wrong and what you could have done to prevent it. Every time you see your friend's spouse, family, or friends, you'll always feel that twisty feeling in your gut, reminding you that it isn't fair that you got to live while your brothers died. You don't do anything special but play video games all day, and you don't have a family to support. Why did you get to live but Robert, the man with two kids and a college degree in the medical field, had to step on the land mine and die? Why weren't you the one walking in front of him instead of the other way around?

Remember how bad you felt when you beat up your neighbor, even though he tried to hit you first? War is kinda the same. Even though your enemies can't speak your language and they're trying to kill you, killing someone sucks. You'll never forget your first kill, and even if you aren't a religious person, you'll still feel like you're going to Hell in every religion for taking someone's life. 

Coming back from war is hard, even if you're in great shape. Do you remember how when you came back from summer camp, coming back home seemed horrible? You had so much fun at summer camp, and you got used to the routine there, and you made some amazing friendships. When you came home, you were happy to see your friends and family, but it was really hard to adjust to your old routine after spending the whole summer at camp. 

War is like that, only you never truly adjust back to your old way of life when you come home. You won't feel safe without your weapon, but you don't entirely trust yourself with it either, especially when you wake up thinking you're back in the trenches, only to realize it was a nightmare. Your friendships are hard to maintain because you want to talk about what you've seen and been through, but it's too painful, and besides, your friends wouldn't understand. While you feel bad about your friend Steve getting his legs blown off and you got to keep yours, your old friend is complaining about his coworker's noisey eating habit.

 Eventually, you start to resent your friends and their silly problems. You try to care, but it's too hard to give a damn about who Ashley slept with or who Tina broke up with when you're still trying to figure out if it was your fault that your Sargent died or if it really was something that you couldn't have avoided even if you hadn't fallen asleep for a few seconds. While they're complaining about how hard it is to get up and go to work every day, you're holding back your tongue from telling them that while they're 'struggling', there are men, women, and children being slaughtered and tortured right this second. But you don't say anything, because you don't want to alienate yourself any further.

You try to get back into the dating girls/guys but it's hard, they want to know more about you but you aren't sure what to tell them. Whenever you bring up going to war they either probe you for details you aren't comfortable sharing or they blame you for all the world's problems. If you do get in a steady relationship, they usually end because they can't deal with your constant nightmares or the way you freak out every time you hear a firework or a gun shot in the distance. If it doesn't end there, it usually does when you almost attack them because you can't tell them from the enemy until they're screaming at you to wake up. 

You know how you like drinking coke? Well, people out of war love drinking alcohol. It becomes your best friend; it numbs you to your feelings and once you drink enough you finally fall asleep and stay asleep. The hang overs suck, and you feel like shit in the morning, but all you have to do is drink more alcohol and it goes away again. Before you know it, two months have gone by and you haven't shaved, bathed, or eaten anything other than pizza and mc donalds. Your friends are either gone or very worried about you. 

If you're strong, you'll cut back or stop drinking and go to counselling. It will help, but it's never enough, not really. Sure, you can have friendships now, and you may even have some successful relationships. But it will never stop the way you break out in to a nervous sweat and frantically look around and feel for your weapon every time you hear a loud noise that sounds like a gun. It will never stop the guilt, the way you wish it had been you who had died and not your brothers. It won't ever quash the anger you feel at the hand full of rich ass holes who paid you to fight *their* war. 

It's okay though, you'll learn to fake it to where no one will know how much you're suffering on the inside. And even though it sucks a lot, there is also some days where you feel awesome, and you may even momentarily forget why you're so fucked up in the first place. 

So, in short, your video game may have realistic graphics and might show some troubles of war, but it will never come close to what it's like to experience real pain, pain you can't just turn off when you're bored with it.

What's with the look, Billy? You asked the question. Now, go get me a beer and turn off that shitty excuse for a game, I wanna watch Adventure Time.

I wrote this before I went to bed and it was based off of what information I've gleaned from my old friends who did serve in the military. I was just trying to explain in such a way that a 12 year old would understand war in a game isn't like war in real life. I know not everyone who joins the military will see any war or see anything traumatizing. I hope finding out that this story isn't real doesn't take away from the fact that there are lot of vets out there suffering silently. Again I'm sorry to burst the bubble, I hope I didn't offend anyone who has/is currently serving :(

True,glycerinSOAPbox,,,"Subscribed, then recommended to my family and friends who are redditors.  My brother is in his fourth year of remission from a rare leukemia.  He was an adult with two small children when he started his fight, and we had people from all over sending cards, food, books, and puzzles to entertain him... I think those things had a large impact on his recovery, and I know he feels the same.  

EDIT:  As a thank you to the kind person who gifted me gold, I'd like to share two cute stories from my brother's treatment.

1.  My brother's father in law, who was very active in my brother's treatment and recovery, gave my brother three inspirational vomit buckets.  By inspirational, I mean they had awesome messages Sharpied on the inside bottoms:  SOMEDAY SOON YOU CAN BARF AFTER TOO MANY BEERS, WON'T THAT BE A RELIEF?; SMILE, IT ISN'T DIARRHEA; THIS IS WHAT YOU GET FOR GETTING MY DAUGHTER PREGNANT. **TWICE**.  My brother would even take these during the lengthy periods of hospitalization.  

2.  I took my nephew up to shave my brother's head (age four at the time) shortly after my brother started chemo.  My brother is a hirsute dude, and his hospital sheets were covered with not only hair from his head, but also from his brows (he has prodigious brows), back, arms, and legs.  My brother and my older nephew (the other one was three months old at the time) needed a pick me up, and having the four year old shave daddy's head was cathartic and amusing for everyone involved.   I videoed it.  We watch it now and again since it is so entertaining and heartwarming.  Now that my younger nephew is four and change, he has said several times, ""If anyone else gets sick, I'm doing the clippers, okay?""  

EDIT AGAIN:  I guess it's three years remission, my youngest nephew is four now and he was three months when my brother started chemo.

It was really horrible but I'll tell you one thing, that vet went out of his way to make sure each animal had the most peaceful, comfortable ending possible. He actually wouldn't euthanize them till they were comfortable with us handling them (took several wks sometimes), so that when the day came, they were comfortable with us putting them up on the exam table, tying off the vein and putting the needle in. Then he'd give them a bit of sedative to relax them and we'd pet them and tell them they were good and give them a bunch of treats. Then he'd administer the euthanasia and we'd keep petting them while they died, and telling them ""good dog"" and so on.

The hardest thing was to keep our cool, and act happy and not act upset, because that would make them upset too. 

So they mostly got a peaceful ending. Fucking brutal though.

True,The_Enoz,,,"I prefer this version:
&gt; There were a lot of things we couldn't do in an SR-71, but we were the fastest guys on the block and loved reminding our fellow aviators of this fact. People often asked us if, because of this fact, it was fun to fly the jet. Fun would not be the first word I would use to describe flying this plane—intense, maybe, even cerebral. But there was one day in our Sled experience when we would have to say that it was pure fun to be the fastest guys out there, at least for a moment.

&gt; It occurred when Walt and I were flying our final training sortie. We needed 100 hours in the jet to complete our training and attain Mission Ready status. Somewhere over Colorado we had passed the century mark. We had made the turn in Arizona and the jet was performing flawlessly. My gauges were wired in the front seat and we were starting to feel pretty good about ourselves, not only because we would soon be flying real missions but because we had gained a great deal of confidence in the plane in the past ten months. Ripping across the barren deserts 80,000 feet below us, I could already see the coast of California from the Arizona border. I was, finally, after many humbling months of simulators and study, ahead of the jet.

&gt; I was beginning to feel a bit sorry for Walter in the back seat. There he was, with no really good view of the incredible sights before us, tasked with monitoring four different radios. This was good practice for him for when we began flying real missions, when a priority transmission from headquarters could be vital. It had been difficult, too, for me to relinquish control of the radios, as during my entire flying career I had controlled my own transmissions. But it was part of the division of duties in this plane and I had adjusted to it. I still insisted on talking on the radio while we were on the ground, however. Walt was so good at many things, but he couldn't match my expertise at sounding smooth on the radios, a skill that had been honed sharply with years in fighter squadrons where the slightest radio miscue was grounds for beheading. He understood that and allowed me that luxury. Just to get a sense of what Walt had to contend with, I pulled the radio toggle switches and monitored the frequencies along with him. The predominant radio chatter was from Los Angeles Center, far below us, controlling daily traffic in their sector. While they had us on their scope (albeit briefly), we were in uncontrolled airspace and normally would not talk to them unless we needed to descend into their airspace.

&gt; We listened as the shaky voice of a lone Cessna pilot who asked Center for a read-out of his ground speed. Center replied: ""November Charlie 175, I'm showing you at ninety knots on the ground."" Now the thing to understand about Center controllers, was that whether they were talking to a rookie pilot in a Cessna, or to Air Force One, they always spoke in the exact same, calm, deep, professional tone that made one feel important. I referred to it as the ""Houston Center voice."" I have always felt that after years of seeing documentaries on this country's space program and listening to the calm and distinct voice of the Houston controllers, that all other controllers since then wanted to sound like that and that they basically did. And it didn't matter what sector of the country we would be flying in, it always seemed like the same guy was talking. Over the years that tone of voice had become somewhat of a comforting sound to pilots everywhere. Conversely, over the years, pilots always wanted to ensure that, when transmitting, they sounded like Chuck Yeager, or at least like John Wayne. Better to die than sound bad on the radios.

&gt; Just moments after the Cessna's inquiry, a Twin Beech piped up on frequency, in a rather superior tone, asking for his ground speed in Beech. ""I have you at one hundred and twenty-five knots of ground speed."" Boy, I thought, the Beechcraft really must think he is dazzling his Cessna brethren.

&gt; Then out of the blue, a navy F-18 pilot out of NAS Lemoore came up on frequency. You knew right away it was a Navy jock because he sounded very cool on the radios. ""Center, Dusty 52 ground speed check."" Before Center could reply, I'm thinking to myself, hey, Dusty 52 has a ground speed indicator in that million-dollar cockpit, so why is he asking Center for a read-out? Then I got it, ol' Dusty here is making sure that every bug smasher from Mount Whitney to the Mojave knows what true speed is. He's the fastest dude in the valley today, and he just wants everyone to know how much fun he is having in his new Hornet. And the reply, always with that same, calm, voice, with more distinct alliteration than emotion: ""Dusty 52, Center, we have you at 620 on the ground."" And I thought to myself, is this a ripe situation, or what? As my hand instinctively reached for the mic button, I had to remind myself that Walt was in control of the radios. Still, I thought, it must be done—in mere seconds we'll be out of the sector and the opportunity will be lost. That Hornet must die, and die now. I thought about all of our Sim training and how important it was that we developed well as a crew and knew that to jump in on the radios now would destroy the integrity of all that we had worked toward becoming. I was torn.

&gt; Somewhere, 13 miles above Arizona, there was a pilot screaming inside his space helmet. Then, I heard it—the click of the mic button from the back seat. That was the very moment that I knew Walter and I had become a crew. Very professionally, and with no emotion, Walter spoke: ""Los Angeles Center, Aspen 20, can you give us a ground speed check?"" There was no hesitation, and the replay came as if was an everyday request.

&gt; ""Aspen 20, I show you at one thousand eight hundred and forty-two knots, across the ground."" I think it was the forty-two knots that I liked the best, so accurate and proud was Center to deliver that information without hesitation, and you just knew he was smiling. But the precise point at which I knew that Walt and I were going to be really good friends for a long time was when he keyed the mic once again to say, in his most fighter-pilot-like voice: ""Ah, Center, much thanks, we're showing closer to nineteen hundred on the money.""

&gt; For a moment Walter was a god. And we finally heard a little crack in the armor of the Houston Center voice, when L.A. came back with, ""Roger that Aspen. Your equipment is probably more accurate than ours. You boys have a good one."" It all had lasted for just moments, but in that short, memorable sprint across the southwest, the Navy had been flamed, all mortal airplanes on freq were forced to bow before the King of Speed, and more importantly, Walter and I had crossed the threshold of being a crew. A fine day's work. We never heard another transmission on that frequency all the way to the coast.

So, my girlfriend and I took a set of jenga blocks and etched in the word ""truth"" or ""dare"" into the blocks, and a number that corresponded with either the truth sheet or dare sheet.
each sheet was a list of truths or dares... all of them mildly humorous on paper, but devastating in reality.
Questions like: ""when was the last time you faked an orgasm, if you haven't or can't recall, fake one now.""
or
""what's the strangest thing you've ever masturbated with, if nothing unusual, smell the finger of every person in group and describe the smell.""
Dares like ""Demonstrate your favorite sexual position with the person on your left.""
or
""Let DeadSeaGulls tattoo your right thigh."" (I have almost no tattoo experience.)
Among the truths and dares there were 5 group choice in each category.
Any truth or dare could be declined by a shot, and if anyone intentionally knocks over the tower they have to lick the left nipple of all same sex players until the nipple is erect.
Loser has to take a shot and do a group choice dare.
This game nearly broke up 3 couples. in the picture above, the girl eating the sunchip out of my ass is the guy on the rights girlfriend. The questions were too real. too raw. resulted in people walking out of the room. but at the same time it was like a train wreck, they kept coming back. At first you decline so many of them by taking a shot... but after 7 shots.... you're answering what the sluttiest thing you've ever done was, right next to your girlfriend, who decided that she's going to TRUTHFULLY answer the last time she faked an orgasm... shit was brutal. everyone ended up naked and in the snow.
all relationships still in tact, but in the way that people who survive a disaster sometimes stay in touch.
TL;DR: Truth or Dare Jenga, Adult Edition.

Just remember this game started out really mild and, on paper, it appears to be so. The truths and dares could definitely be modified to be funnier or crazier but the truth is that after 3 times playing this with our significant others present, we were all pretty sure to seal it up forever or destroy it. The group choices would always get out of hand and people were near alcohol poisoning level. it was brutal.

While going Gluten Free [GF] is difficult, it's a lot easier than it used to be! Companies and Manufacturer's are getting better at coming up with GF good tasting foods. The main things to avoid are; wheat, barely, rye, and oats.

Prego spaghetti sauce is GF (read the labels on the different flavors)    
I find Heartland Pasta to be pretty decent    

A lot of candy/chocolate is gluten free, such as smarties, skittles, and snickers.     
Chex cereals are gluten free    
A good idea is to cut out lactose for a lot of people that are GF, I like RiceDream rice milk, however milk, eggs, and butter are naturally GF.       

    
**If you're in doubt, don't eat it** until you contact the manufacturer of the product. A lot of foods have contamination possibilities during manufacturing, which is why they won't list the GF label on their foods. If it doesn't have the label, but there's no Gluten ingredients, it's recommended to call the company. Google has been a great help to me when I'm on the run too.

True,Universus,,,"I am not trying to convince you of anything here, but this is something I think you should add to your body of knowledge collected so far on this Earth.

Far, far, far more people in the world go from being theists (almost entirely a religion taught from childhood by their parents, church, and/or society) to not being religious/agnosticism/atheism, than vice-versa. 

I think it would be an important thought experiment for you to imagine how many of us came from a similar background from you, and used to believe in the exact same things you do (or similar). I was raised in the church for 18 years. On countless nights, I cried myself to sleep over some very serious issues (to me) praying to god, praying for any sort of sign, anything, and never heard a single thing -- no revelation, no comfort. Even without any evidence whatever, because of the strong childhood teachings about religion, I believed until I was about 23, when the cards started to topple. I had simply had enough, and found a much better, more reliable, way of living that offered actual answers -- or as close to actual answers as we humans can get thus far: **evidence-based-thinking.** 

I started reading other works of other religions, and the first question (and the most important) that I asked myself was ""What makes *my* religion the correct one?"" I was a Deist for a while, until I discovered evolutionary biology and cosmology. I still thought I was special until I discovered astronomy and physics. Philosophy is what really taught me to think, though. All of these things began to fill the ever-present hole that I had my entire life. I realized how little I actually knew, and how little I will know even if I do nothing but intake knowledge for the next 60 years. The most important thing I took from it, was asking myself ""Who am I to say the universe is ""this way"" or ""that way"", with how amazingly ignorant I am of everything?"" All I can do is go on probability, based on what is evident to us. *All* of us. I don't claim to know anything absolutely. But we have amazingly short lifespans in geologic, let alone cosmic time, and we have to go with the best knowledge that is available to us at the time of our existence, and work off of that. But really, it's all probability, based on evidence. I mean, we understand the principles of gravity (most of them, anyways), we can observe it every day, we have even given it it's name. But we have *no idea what it is*; why mass attracts things. Little factoids like this continue to blow my mind and leave me in humbled ignorance and reality-shock much more than any creation story ever could.

All I want you to take away from this post is that it's not that we don't ""get it"" or that we ""hate god"" or that we were raised atheists. Some people, sure -- but I would wager to believe the vast majority of atheists were, in fact, raised in a religious household. We get it, entirely, and many of us have been in the exact same position as you. And now, I would wager many atheists (although not myself -- Hitchens' North Korea argument, etc.), would turn to god in a heartbeat were he to prove his existence. Any deity would have to do *so microscopically little* to prove his existence, and we hear nothing but silence. *Gott ist tot*.

Perhaps you have experienced something I did not. Perhaps you had a very intense spiritual moment that was so convincing that you simply cannot discount it and turn to atheism. This is understandable, very human, and I liken it to any emotional or mental trauma that someone goes through in life (and technically, even if it *was* real, that's exactly what it would be). It's not my place to discount your experience and tell you to ""snap out of it"".

But what I will say is this: To base the entire truth and reality of the universe (in this case, belief in the Islamic version of god) on your own personal experience, and solely that, is probably one of the most selfish, egotistical, and solipsistic acts one can perform as a human being.

True,wouldbebuddhist,,,"Hmmm.... here's what I know about most endeavours in life: Generally, you get out of it what you put in. How much effort are you really putting into it?

This is what I believe about the meditative process, so take it with a grain of salt: 

Meditation is basically a training method for your mind. When certain things happen to you, your mind generates a certain response whether it be happiness, frustration, anger ect. The way your mind has been inculcated is the path of least resistance and the path it wants to take, and will take unless you know how to mitigate it. Meditation teaches you how and makes it easier to override the process. Who is doing the overriding of this process? Well, that's the million dollar question. But I digress.

So here's what I'm getting at: if meditation is too easy, you're doing something wrong. 
You might be getting yourself really relaxed, but is it possible that's all you're doing? Not saying it is. I don't know, just throwing some ideas out there and it's up to you to see if any seem to fit your situation. 

But as you meditate, your mind wants to grab onto the thoughts and not your breath. The course of least resistance is away from your breath and back into whatever thoughts are vying for your attention. Every time you go back to the breath, you train or teach yourself even, to take the opposite of the path of least resistance. This is coupled with the fact that half the time when you meditate, your mind says, ""I'm tired. Stop concentrating on the breath and just kick back and let a guided meditation do most of the work."" But every time this comes up you learn to drop it by returning to the breath and not listening to the thought no matter how loud and powerful it can get.

When you first start meditating you have this thought and then come back to the breath. But there's still a trace of this thought floating around in your mind and eventually it pulls you in again. As soon as you realize your back in that thought again, you turn your awareness back to the breath and away from the thought. But then it pulls you in again. And then you drop it again. You do this over and over and over. But as you practice you get better and better and faster and faster at recognizing it. You start to figure out how to do it most efficiently and quickly, seeing and dropping thoughts before they even become thoughts at all.

After doing this hour after hour, you gain a skill. One day you realize that you don't have to be sitting on a cushion to use this skill. I can't really explain how it's done, but it's just something you learn from continually focusing, coming back to, and holding your attention on the breath. It's like if you ever do a lot of push-ups, eventually you will realize, ""I can flex my pecs."" You couldn't flex them before, and you don't really know how you learned to do it, but now you can just do it. 

So when I'm driving down the street and I get cut off, this magnetic, powerful idea pulls at my attention. But I've done this so many times before in my meditation sessions. It's not my first time at the rodeo. I know how to just drop it. I don't need to take that path of least resistance into anger because I have had so much practice choosing not to just take the path of least resistance and get pulled into the thoughts. That said, just because I'm better at dropping a thought process doesn't mean I always choose to. In fact, I still get irritated a lot, but not usually right after meditation. 

I think it's more than just being better able to drop unhelpful thoughts though. I think it stems form the fact that after you do this process with literally every thought you have, and put hours and hours of practice in, your mind almost has this other mode where its immediate reaction is not to get pulled into the thought processes or emotions, but just to let it float by. This is how I feel after a meditation session. It's like my mind is so used to not letting ANY thought or emotion draw me in and start the thought process, that it takes a whole hell of a lot to produce an idea or thought magnetic enough to pull my mind into the old environmental trigger and thought process response mode. 

This is why it's odd to me that after a meditation session, you feel like you let thoughts and emotions affect you more. You're mind should still at least semi-be in the letting thoughts and emotions go mindset.

Also, it sounds like you have a lot of stress in your life. Is there anything you can do about that? If I had that kind of stress, it would certainly be hard for me to get out of the thought process and have productive sessions. Not to say you can't. You definitely can, but it just makes it that much harder -- but also that much more rewarding when you can silence the stress.

Anyway, those are just my thoughts. Take them for what they are worth. Hope this helps!",0,1362119798,,0,1362280261,2,c8nqhw1,t3_199qsd,t1_c8nqhw1,t1_c8nnvwo,,1431447193,1698,False,Meditation,t5_2qnc9,1698

Why discourage yourself from giving to those people when they've expressed an interest in you and your work? Why throw away your life when you know that both physically, and mentally, there's just so much more to be done? It's hard seeing it, but it's always there.

True,Legionary,,,"I had a massive pulmonary embolism (PE) and nearly died. My experience was very similar to what is described in the OP's link.

My heart was beating extremely fast due to the PE, and the lack of oxygen was making me feel very panicked. As it got worse though, a curious thing happened over a minute or so as I circled the drain in ever-smaller spirals.

First I got tunnel vision and could really only see what was right in front of me. Then all the colour leeched out and I was reduced to seeing in black and white. If you ask me, this is the origin for many of those near-death tunnels-with-a-light-at-the-end. 

My hearing faded out too. It was like my ears were stuffed with cotton wool, and there was this weird high pitched buzz.

I was feeling very frightened. If you've never been acutely short of breath before you won't know quite how it feels, but ask a friend with asthma or some other breathing problem. It's terrifying, literally physically thrashing around for air. But as my vision faded, something changed.

Things started not to matter. I have bipolar disorder, and all the bad things in my life began to seem completely unimportant. That was when I knew I was dying.

Concepts like fear and courage didn't mean anything. It was like falling into a vast black ocean of calm. I felt a massive disconnection from my physical body; at the time I felt utterly separated from physicality. 

It wasn't just a physical detachment. It wasn't just an end to socially constructed ideas like courage and sadness. In those last ten to twenty seconds, I stopped caring. Stopped caring about everything and everyone. 

Didn't care I wouldn't see anyone again. Didn't care that this was the end of my life. It was the most profound sense of peace, but 'peace' in a very alien sense.

In the last few seconds, I felt small. I felt smaller and smaller inside my own head. And I felt I was surrounded by unimaginable vastness. If you picture me floating in that deep dark ocean I mentioned above, it was like the camera you're viewing me from zoomed out and kept on zooming until I was the tiniest pinprick. 

I was absolutely insignificant to myself.

True,Tynach,,,"I had never thought of it this way, but this is me too.

I have major issues with motivation as well - I have several personal projects that I am extremely passionate about (posted one [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/19b5an/php_website_project_dimentions_roleplaying/)), but I can't get myself to work on them. I find myself going in and out of depression, and unable to function properly.

What's worse, is I find I'm often only able to get things done if someone DISSES me. Three years ago I was taking a math class (I tested into the highest math category possible, so my first semester of college I took calculus) I was doing miserably; I was learning the subject, but I was depressed and could not get myself to do any homework (not just math; I had a programming class I loved that I failed for this reason as well). The teacher one day pulled me aside and told me I was probably not smart enough for the class.

The very next class period (almost said 'day'; was not an every day class), we had a test. Almost everyone did poorly on the test, and she was sorta sternly lecturing the class about our grades. I got a high B, something like an 87%. That was the only test I passed in that class (I am good, but horribly slow, at math; the math placement test I did well on took me 3 - 5 days to finish).

I guess if I analyze my behavior with this sort of thing in mind, I think with my personal projects I'm just trying to get SOMEONE to say I did a good job, and really mean it. I don't want a 'You did a good job!' from someone who clearly sees I've made horrible mistakes; I want to get it right, and I want to DO a good job. And be acknowledged.

Things have been made worse by the way my dad treats things. For things like remembering to take out the trash, I once asked why he dosen't praise me when I do these things... He always says because I'm supposed to do it anyway, and I shouldn't be praised for the 'minimal effort required' (my words, I can't remember exactly what he said).

All throughout growing up, I was constantly told not to let things 'get to my head', and to always be humble, and all of that. Nowadays I think I'm craving for any recognition at all, while pushing recognition away (I suck at taking compliments; I shy away from them and want to just be left alone... Emotions are conflicting like that), and yet my dad keeps telling me I have a 'humility problem' and how I need to be 'humble'.

I get where he's coming from. I guess my push of wanting recognition is coming off as being hot-headed, and I find that if I have ANY knowledge of a subject I tend to, without meaning to, push my way through the conversation and act like I'm a professional in it. As a result I'm constantly paranoidly putting in things like, ""At least, if I remember right,"" and, ""I'm not an expert, so I might be wrong,"" but I also raise my voice and stand up straight (while usually I'm slouching), and overall seem like a dick head.

I think I need help.

Edit: And then there's THAT whole issue. All my life I've felt like I needed to see a psychologist. I did a very long time ago, saw one that my dad knew from church (my parents are super paranoid that anyone I see who's a psychologist or counselor needs to be Christian; I am Christian myself, but please don't assume I'm the same way my parents are), who basically said I was fine. But as I got older and especially since my first wave of depression hit (very end of the first semester of highschool; I suddenly could not bring myself to do homework or work on projects), I really felt like I needed to see someone about this.

At first, the excuse was I wasn't under insurance. Now I'm under parents' insurance, but my dad firmly believes it's a spiritual matter, and he says he'll take me to a psychologist or someone but it never happens. Maybe he wants me to deal with that, but part of my whole issue is that I can't get myself to do the things I want to do, so it's absolutely fucking pointless.

True,J_Kenji_Lopez-Alt,specialty,Professional Food Nerd,"This is outdated knowledge that has been disproven by several sources. First I saw was an article by Harold McGee in the New York Times in February of 2009, then repeated experimentally many other places. You can put pasta in a pot, add cold water, and put it directly on a burner. As long as you give the pasta a good stir once the starch starts absorbing water and expanding (a few minutes after you start heating), it will not stick to itself and cooks up indistinguishable from pasta cooked in a lot of water. It won't stick to itself or the pot, unless you really stuff it in there. All you need is enough water to cover it by an inch or two tohttp://newyork.seriouseats.com/2010/10/how-to-poach-an-egg-perfectly-nick-anderer-maialino-new-york-technique.html account for expansion as it absorbs the water.

A fixed amount of pasta dropped into a small amount of boiling water will also come back to a boil at the exact same rate as pasta dropped into a larger amount. That's because your burner is a static output heating system. Assuming you leave it at one setting (high, in the case pasta), its energy output is constant. Wen you drop pasta into water, the water stops boiling because the pasta cools it, I.E. it's average energy per mass goes down by a fixed amount. But the amount of energy required to bring it back up to a boil after you add that pasta is the same no matter how big the pot of water was.

Basically, it's equal to the amount of energy you'd need to bring a fixed amount of room temperature pasta up to 212 degrees. That amount of energy is identical whether you have a small pot or an entire ocean of water.

In fact, with a limited burner size, you're better off using *less* water than too much, as a large pot of water loses more energy to the atmosphere due to its greater surface area (that is, your energy input to the system is constant, but as you use a bigger and bigger pot, the energy wasted to the environment goes up). Use a large enough pot and you won't even be able to bring it to a boil no matter how long you heat it. The less water you have, the harder you'll be able to boil it for a given burner output,

There are other advantages to cooking in less water aside from the energy savings: it creates starchier pasta water, which makes it much better for binding sauces and getting them to coat your pasta better. Anyone who's worked a pasta station at a restaurant knows that there's an ideal stage to that water when it is rich with starch and makes all the pasta sauce silkier, smoother, and nicer. Eventually in a restaurant, the water will get *too* starchy after too many batches of pasta are cooked in it and it'll have to be changed.

What's even more interesting is that the hydrating process and cooking process which normally take place simultaneously when you boil pasta don't actually need to be done at the same time. You can pre-soak pasta in room temperature water and store it in the fridge (as the starch has not been activated by heat, it will not stick to itself, even with no oil!) Then all you have to do to serve it is heat it in the sauce. It takes only a minute or so. This is a great technique for baked pasta dishes - no need to precook the pasta, just soak it in a big bowl of water while you prepare your sauces and whatnot, then add it raw. It'll cook through as it bakes!

The exceptions to the less water rule are long skinny shapes like spaghetti or fettuccini (unless you happen to have a long, skinny pan to submerge it in), and fresh pastas made with eggs, which need hot water from the start to set that egg before the pasta starts to absorb too much liquid.

This, by the way, is why those ""skillet pasta"" recipes (where you just add dry pasta directly to a simmering sauce) work perfectly fine, even with minimal stirring.

True,fetishiste,female-mod,♀-mod,"&gt;Well, I can see how society objectifies, and asks for a certain image from women. I don't get as much how you feel like others are owed and entitled to you bodies, so if you could explain that more.

I don't know if you've heard much about catcalling, but that's one big example of it - men on the street will randomly make comments that are both demeaning and sexually suggestive about women and their bodies, basically making us feel like crap because it is entertaining to them to loudly express their opinions about our physicality.

Women who don't conform to the beauty standard correctly are basically told that they are offensive to the eye and need to change in order to become better visual scenery, whereas men who aren't that attractive are just sort of left alone usually (and yes, that sucks too, but it's better than being told you aren't doing your duty to others because you are failing to perform attractiveness for them.)

Women are expected to be beautiful and sexy whatever role they are performing within society. There are news articles all the time about how women's sport would be more popular if only women were sexier; female politicians are constantly criticised in a way male ones aren't on the basis of how ugly they are or how good their dress sense is; much higher standards of grooming and makeup are expected of women if we want to be seen as professional and put together in the business world.

We are constantly bombarded with messages about how we ought to be trying to be more attractive in advertising - while men are bombarded with messages about how if they buy X product, it will win them an attractive woman just like the women we are told to emulate. It makes one feel like one's ultimate goal is to be a prize to men.

And then there's the issue of men being made angry by the ""friendzone"" - feeling angry and deprived because they put in friendship and didn't get sex back, as if sex is something one can get out of a woman by putting in friendship, like you can earn our bodies with enough work - and like that's the only point of being friends with a woman. So many men say they don't want female friends, or can't really have platonic female friends, because sexual desire gets in the way, or because they really have no interest in women as friends, only as sexual/romantic partners. It can be pretty shattering to discover that all of your friends were basically pretending they liked your personality to get to your body.

As for the comment from AskMen - god, I get so sick of this shit. Sorry, but that attitude irritates me quite a lot. Yes, I do think you're making a huge mistake basically saying, ""I wish women would give me sex out of pity"", and I also do think you'd be better off looking for mutual desire and aiming for that, but I don't think that's about being more manly and less feelsy, or about abandoning emotions. You do need to take women's bodies off a pedestal and start relating to us as your fellow humans with our own desires and preferences if you want to have sex with us - we aren't works of art but we also, well, aren't your damn steak dinner. ""Sex partner"" is a good phrase to remember. Sex is a collaborative thing and a thing for mutual pleasure. You don't hunt it from people and you don't beg for it. You flirt and you get to know folks and you make yourself a version of yourself that you like and are proud of, and you seek people who you think are awesome and sexy. I don't even think you're being threatening right now, though if you start expecting or begging for sexual things from people randomly that could be threatening. You just aren't seeing sex as a matter of mutuality.

&gt;“It turns out procrastination is not typically a function of laziness, apathy or work ethic as it is often regarded to be. It’s a neurotic self-defense behavior that develops to protect a person’s sense of self-worth.
You see, procrastinators tend to be people who have, for whatever reason, developed to perceive an unusually strong association between their performance and their value as a person. This makes failure or criticism disproportionately painful, which leads naturally to hesitancy when it comes to the prospect of doing anything that reflects their ability — which is pretty much everything.

&gt;But in real life, you can’t avoid doing things. We have to earn a living, do our taxes, have difficult conversations sometimes. Human life requires confronting uncertainty and risk, so pressure mounts. Procrastination gives a person a temporary hit of relief from this pressure of “having to do” things, which is a self-rewarding behavior. So it continues and becomes the normal way to respond to these pressures.

This lasted and peaked at about 8 months of this.  She had gone over to her mother's house, which I was still required by the state to allow visitation, which I don't have to do anymore. She was there for about two weeks and I called and asked when she was coming home. She snapped at me and for the first time in her 8 year old life, gave me serious attitude.

She came home, was dropped off by her mother.  She walked into the house, didn't say a word to anyone and then walked upstairs and slammed her door.  Which kind of pissed me off to begin with.  We moved back into my parent's four bedroom house after my divorce and my parents have always been more than awesome to her.

My mother went up to talk to her, knocked on the door and then started to open it. I was right behind her. My daughter ran up and slammed her body against the door and almost knocked my mother over.  The only reason she didn't go over was because I was behind her.

I did a quick ten count, walked out to the garage, got a screwdriver and a hammer and walked back to her room. I was whistling as I was removing her door. ""What are you doing with my door?"" was replied to with ""Oh this isn't your door, it's grandma and grandpa's door and since you can't use it right, I have decided to take it away from you"".  I just popped it off the hinges and took it into another room.

This caused the situation to come to an eruption. About two days after the door came down she started spouting at me about stealing her and keeping her from her mother.  That and all the other lies her mother had told her just came flowing out.

So I sat down with her, broke out the divorce/custody decree, showed her the court docket and explained to her that the reason I have custody of her is because I *fought* for custody of her, there was no stealing.

I didn't remove the door because I was worried about what she was doing, I removed it because it was a barrier from communication. As long as she kept that door shut, she didn't have to deal with me. Without the door, I could walk up at anytime and open a discussion.

At this point I had no option to go all in on the truth about my ex. The ex had gone months without seeing my daughter, the longest was 11 months without picking her up for visitation, she had my daughter convinced that I just wasn't allowing her to talk to her.  So I broke out phone records to show that her mother never even called.

Tears were shed, the truth was discussed, hugs were had, everything got better.

To make her feel better, I got her a cell phone at 9 years old and told her to give the number to her mother.  Within about six months of that, her mother took another hiatus from being a mom and stopped calling.  She learned that I was telling the truth. I felt bad because I had been keeping the truth from her, but it was a delicate balance. I didn't know how to breach the subject of what her mother had done to me, how horrible of a person she was without sounding like I was trying to ""win"" my daughter over to ""my side"". So I ended up not covering for her mother, but staying as neutral as possible.

Eventually over the years, I kept telling her the truth and her mother just kept being her mother.  Through examples my daughter lived through, she couldn't argue that her mother is just, not good. There were some very emotional times, my daughter sitting with her bags packed on the front porch, waiting for mommy, who never showed and never called.  Sitting with a crying 10 year old on the front porch because her mother failed her, yet again, really made me feel like I had failed my daughter.  I felt helpless.

That was the only year I really had trouble with her, and it was really only about two months of serious trouble.  She's been an awesome kid, otherwise.

We've had long conversations about her mother since then and she's fully realized that I am not making anything up. She's learned how to deal and cope with her mother, with my help and we keep a line of communication and discussion open about it. 

Our relationship is damn near perfect. We respect each other as human beings and I really never have to punish her.  We have open communication, we discuss *everything* and she's just a really good kid. 


Edit: Wow that got fucking long.

TL;DR: I took my daughter's door down because it was a barrier to communication, not because i was worried/nosey about what she was doing.

True,Lansydyr,gilded l-19gh4m c-c8nt15q,Sith Lord,"I had warned you about questioning me, my young apprentice.  However, this once, I am in a tolerable mood, so I shall educate you on those pathetic dark ""jedi"" and why we Sith shall rule absolute at the proper time.  As Sith, we are the inheritors to a galaxy spanning empire, one which emphasized rule and order, not like the current Galactic Senate with their petty squabbles and egotistic little games.  We commanded thousands of planets, millions of troops and trillions lived and died under our command.

The Jedi, those meddling children believed that only they have the right way to look at the Force, believing in such primitive concepts as ""good"" and ""evil"" instead of ""power"" and ""lack of power.""  In attempting to force the Sith empire to believe as they did, they refused to acknowledge that all the war was, was a power struggle.  It wasn't good versus evil, as their histories show.  It was power, power that attempted to force itself on us.

And our ancestors were foolish also.  They foolishly believed they could share power during the crisis, working together for the ""greater good"" until the war was over.  See how easy it is to get bogged down into the false idea of ""good and evil?""  Their cooperation undermined the very nature of the Dark Side of the Force, weakening each Sith Lord even as cooperation strengthened the Jedi.  It always comes down to power, you see.  Power will multiply with cooperation in the light side. But in the Dark Side, power is meant to be hoarded, to be flaunted, **never** to be shared!

Our ancestors sowed the seeds for their own destruction, weakening their armies and the ancient sith lords even as the battle multiplied.  If not for Darth Bane, the Sith would have been extinguished for all time.  He understood the true power of the Dark Side, perhaps better than any before or after.  He instituted the Rule of Two, which I have already told you.  You remember, ""One to hold power, and one to crave it.""  Power, Dark Power strengthens with competition.  Your job is to learn all you can from me, then attempt to kill me.  If I die, you have succeeded, and are worthy to be the one to hold power.  But you know, of course, that you are nowhere near where you need to be in order to do that.  I have taught you all you know, but barely a fraction of what **I** know.

And I have rambled on like a Bothan being paid by the word.  The Rule of Two is my main point.  It defines us as Sith.  From the Rule, all our ambitions, our hopes and our plans flow.  We **will** rule the galaxy, but not yet.  It is not that time, yet.  Maybe not in my lifetime, or in your lifetime, but every single plot, plan and strategy we have instituted works towards the ultimate goal of the extinction of the Jedi and absolute rule over the Galaxy!

The pathetic ""dark Jedi"" have no history.  They have no culture, no knowledge of the true power of the Dark Side.  They were taught from birth to use the light side, and were shown the beautiful blackness of the Dark Side. They are open to the Dark Side, but they have little use to us except as pawns, proxies and scapegoats. Let the ""dark Jedi"" have their fun, running around causing havoc, not understanding that true power from the Dark Side leads to order.  They are but scratching the surface, never understanding the depths they could dive.

We use them, but we do not let them know we exist.  We use all force sensitive beings that are attuned to the Dark Side, but only we are equipped to rule.  Only we understand the **true power of the Dark Side**.  No, go, my apprentice.

True,POGtastic,gilded l-19fhhx c-c8ntg8w,Taught that 12 year old a lesson,"AD Marine here. I actually thought you were in the military, because that's exactly what happens.

I think the only thing that you missed is the boredom. You sit there, cleaning your weapon, standing guard duty, going on stupid pointless patrols, cleaning your area, burning shitter barrels, cleaning your gear, standing more duty, doing working parties, cleaning up after the working party, and then BOOM. Oops, some people died today. No warning, nothing. You went from ""Gee, hope I can get a satellite phone call home to my folks"" to ""Shit, Brader's dead"" in five seconds. And then you go right back to ""Fuck, this is so boring.""

The boredom combined with tiny MOMENTS of sheer terror is what gets people. You're always on alert when you go on patrol. Every inch of the road has to be watched by multiple people. Every piece of trash has to be scrutinized. Every ditch has to be watched for wires coming from it. Every culvert, every civilian you pass by, every building, every stop you make is dangerous. Because that BOOM can come from anywhere, and you have to be ready for it.

The brain adjusts to this very well, interestingly enough. The problem is that it can never figure out how to adjust back. Once you've been in combat, there's that Survival Voice in your head that says, ""Hey! THAT might kill you! Hey! THAT might kill you too!"" If you've played OoT, think of a Navi inside your head going ""Listen!"" every three seconds, reminding you of something. And that's great when you're in combat. That voice will save your life a million times over. Except it's not so great when you go back home. You'll be driving your kid home from school, and suddenly someone throws a garbage bag into a trash can right next to the road, and you'll slam on the brakes and skid across the median, reaching for a gun that isn't there, waiting for the explosion to go off. Oops, sorry, false alarm there. Navi's still saying ""Listen"" even though you're back in Springfield. What do you tell your kid? What do you tell your wife when you wake up from a bad dream and you're jumping off the bed, frantically searching for your rifle that you checked back into the armory three years ago?

And that's why people with PTSD drink so much. To get rid of Navi.

True,Questeaser,male,♂,"The first thing I hate is that people treat confidence as a singular quality of a person, instead of it being a person's confidence in being able to do something. For example I don't feel confident when approaching women, but I am too confident, even bordering on arrogant when it comes to say intellectual discussions.

Which brings it to my next point - it is also very difficult to find the proper level of confidence, as having too much of it will make you seem arrogant and self-absorbed, and many people would rather choose to be seen as too timid instead.

But the most important thing is that confidence is a feeling. And it is very hard to control your feelings, and it is even more unusual to be judged based on the your feelings instead of your actions. In the end I am dismissed based not on what I do, but how I feel, which sucks.

Of course I could try to fake it, but then it requires not only conscious effort, which is tiring, especially for an introvert like me, who gets tired from most social contacts, but more importantly, the ability to access knowledge about how confident people act on the fly,which is a very hard skill to acquire.

As for why for example I don't have confidence in my social abilities, is because I don't have any experience in it. Only in my twenties did I discover that being social takes skill and experience, which I don't have because I spent most of my previous life as a studious loner.

In the end it all comes down to positive feedback loop, that is - the less confident you are the less likely you are to succeed the more confidence you lose and the opposite.. Those who have confidence for long time, it is hard to see why the rest of us don't because it makes you successful. For those of us who don't have it, we need extraordinary circumstances or a shitload of effort to get to the point of balance, where putting effort in doing something pays off and we gain the confidence instead of lose it.",0,1362144245,,0,False,1,c8nto7r,t3_19ghdc,t1_c8nto7r,t3_19ghdc,,1431448704,11,False,AskMen,t5_2s30g,11

(Also, please do not post screenshots of code. See the sidebar for more information.)

You really don't actually want to check for types like this in Python, though, in almost every case. What are you **really** trying to do? Why do you *care* if `idd` (what does that name mean?) is an `int`, a `float` or neither?

In your case, it's because you expect the `abs` function not to work otherwise. It gives you a `TypeError` when the input is of the wrong type. (Well, it's really because Eric Weinstein wants you to practice using `type`, but we'll ignore that for now.) So the **correct** way to deal with this is to handle the exception:

    def distance_from_zero(idd):
        try:
            return abs(idd)
        except TypeError:
            # it's not an int or a float, so do whatever

But let's consider what ""do whatever"" consists of... if you just return a string error message then you have not really helped matters any - because now the calling code still has to check whether it got back a numeric value or a string. This doesn't really handle the error at all; and in fact this is not where or how you want to do it. The calling code has context that lets it decide what should happen if `idd` is invalid. The function itself doesn't really. Should the message appear on the screen? Maybe, but if you make that decision here, then you've imposed that decision on every piece of code that wants to use `distance_from_zero`.

So, never mind what Eric Weinstein wants your function to do, because we're here to learn how to write good code. The natural way to handle the issue is to leave it up to the calling code:

    def distance_from_zero(idd):
        return abs(idd)

And now the calling code can decide what to do:

    # other code...
    try:
        something = distance_from_zero(my_value)
    except TypeError:
        print(""Oops, that wasn't valid input"")
        return # Or something else. Who knows? It depends on why we care about the `distance_from_zero` result.
    # more code, using `something`

Of course, now we see that our function no longer does anything interesting, and we just use `abs` directly instead. Or if the renaming actually does make our code more clear in context, we can just alias the function: `distance_from_zero = abs`. Yes, in Python, this works and does what it looks like: it makes `distance_from_zero` another name for the `abs` function.",0,1362145964,,0,False,1,c8ntyuo,t3_19g7qg,t1_c8ntyuo,t1_c8nrdwc,,1431448878,10,False,learnprogramming,t5_2r7yd,10

Listen to this podcast (its long) with Col. Richard Graham, a former SR-71 pilot. 
http://omegataupodcast.net/2012/03/91-flying-the-sr-71/

It is a fantastic interview, so I recommend giving it a listen, but basically the SR-71 only started with a partial tank of gas on take off because refueling in mid-air allowed them to get the atmosphere/pressure (I believe) in the tank to allow them to reach mach 3.3. I'll edit this post when I figure out at what point he talks about fuel leakage and why they handled it the way they did.

EDIT: Go to 20:10. I'll quote him:

When you took off the tanks were not full, why was that?
The tanks were not full for several reasons, first of all, as I mentioned you could cut the tire... if you took off with a full load of gas, that would be 80,000 pounds of gas, because if you cut a tire you would need to go back and get it replaced (my note: he talked earlier about how the tires were at something like 400 PSI and running over a bolt/washer on the runway could shred the tire, and how each mission was planned down to the minute for refueling purposes... so this could scrub the mission) if they were not full, you might be able to get away with (running over the bolt). The 2nd reason was because the brakes could overheat really easily, but the real reason, and I can't emphasize this enough because people think we take off with a partial fuel load because of the fuel leaks, imagine 6 main fuel tanks holding 80,000 pounds of JP-7. As you burn down that JP-7 that fuel internally gets up to 350-375 degrees fahrenheit. All the fumes/volatility above those 6 main tanks gets very dicey because the skin of the plane above those tanks gets up to 5-600 degrees fahrenheit. 
So we had gaseous nitrogren plummed back to all 6 main tanks to maintain an innerting atmosphere in all 6 main tanks because of the volatility. Now, how would you get a 100% atmosphere in all 6 main tanks? There is only one way... you start off with a partial fuel load, you go to a tanker, he fills you up with JP-7, relief valves open up so the ambient air in those tanks is pushed out... once you are fully filled those valves close and from then on every drop of JP-7 you are burning is being replaced with 100% nitrogren atmosphere.
.... 
Basically we had an aircraft limitation, if you didn't have a 100% nitrogren atmosphere you were limited to mach 2.6. Therefore we refueled right after takeoff to get that 100% nitrogen atmosphere in the back.

He discusses it more in the podcast, about how much it actually leaked(only about enough to fill up a 55 gallon drum half way) and how that rumor started from a Discovery channel show where the reporter basically made up that fact. :)",0,1362147145,,0,1362155160,1,c8nu77z,t3_19fcyo,t1_c8nu77z,t1_c8npe5s,,1431449015,22,False,todayilearned,t5_2qqjc,22

True,waystinthyme,,,"What do you think is the root of the problem causing the need for such a service? Have you ever let your mind wander through thoughts of ""possible solutions""? What were those?

That’s a great question. There are many causes. I like to tell people that hunger isn’t a cause of people’s problems, but rather the effect of their problems. Every case is different, but generally speaking, the cause usually stems from a lack of employment, physical or mental handicap, or not enough retirement funds. I could go on and on, but that’s the nickel answer. As far as possible solutions, our collective minds are always wandering through these thoughts. Our goal as a food bank is to work ourselves out of a job, and we’re not going to do that by simply giving people food. When a client is in need of assistance, they are referred to one of our over 380 member nonprofits. These nonprofits perform a variety of services in the community from housing assistance to general case management. These case managers can put folks on the path to self-sustainability by deciphering the causes of their problems and offering creative solutions to combat those problems. 

Are there problems you can identify in the actual way this service is provided? (The ones I hear the most often are ""creates dependency"" and ""no incentives to get out of one's situation"", for example.) How could they fixed, in your opinion?
This goes back to what I was saying about case management. It is important to align the client with the right service. This is something we are keenly aware of. Before dissecting your question further though, I think this is a good juncture to talk about “common misperceptions.” Our clients are a diverse group of people. In most cases, our clients are working families who use our services as a simple stop-gap. I talk with people all the time who have used our service in the past and are now completely self-sufficient. Now, back to your question…there are problems with the system. If there weren’t problems then it would be profitable and some company would be making money to provide the service. Generally speaking, a nonprofit is in existence because 1) companies can’t make money providing the service and 2) the government can’t/won’t provide the service. Of course, this isn’t to say that we can’t make things more efficient. One way is to make sure that you are utilizing community partners. By aligning with other nonprofits, we are able to provide a slew of services in conjunction with one another that help us address the problems of the client both creatively and effectively.

What should one do to prevent the continuation of the need for such services, aside from donations (food/monetary)?
Honestly, I’m not sure. Hunger has existed since man took his first steps in this world. Hunger will never be completely eradicated. One thing each person can do however is provide a voice for the client. By advocating for the food insecure, large corporations and the government are more likely to get involved.
I assume that since you work in this environment, you've probably developed your own criticism and understanding related to this field. Anything that goes beyond those questions will be appreciated, read, and thought upon. Cheers, keep up the good work. :)
If I can say anything based upon working on the field, it’s this. You get into this business to make an impact in your community. However, before you know it, you realize the community is making an impact on you. Through the relationships I have developed with clients, donors, and volunteers, I have been made into a better person. My “pay” is much more than a check I get every two weeks. My pay is seeing that kid get a hot meal.

""Lawyer1234, we do our job, and fight as hard as we can, making sure that all the T's are crossed and i's are dotted, so that when the truth outs, and this piece of shit is convicted, he will never, ever get out on appeal.

Looks like this isn't  a LOM

### Solar array deployment successful - [elonmusk](https://twitter.com/elonmusk)

This suggests that the thruster pods are working (the solar arrays aren't deployed until the thrusters are working due to risk damaging the panels while fixing the issue). Mission is back on track!

 - Attempting bring up of thruster pods 2 and 4 - [elonmusk](https://twitter.com/elonmusk)

Now he is just being a showoff :p

 - With Solar Arrays deployed and 2 Thruster Pods up and running, Mission Controllers have plenty of time to troubleshoot the remaining 2 - [ISS](https://twitter.com/ISS101)

12:50 - The thrusters should have begun their first burn towards the ISS by now. No word as to whether or not that has happened. But no news isn't really positive in this case. If they delay too much, the mission could still be lost. For now, with arrays deployed, the Dragon can sit in orbit for a while before an ISS rendezvous becomes impossible.

1:00 - **NASA says it requires THREE thruster nodes to be working to allow the Dragon to berth.** This puts the mission back into limbo. Hopefully they get it working.

1:35 - NASA - Burn has been delayed at least one orbit to 2pm. This may or may not result in a delay in the planned arrival to the ISS.

2:00 - No news of said burn. Not looking good. :/

2:30 - Looks like it can't make it on time now, burn was missed. It is still posssible but looking grim.

As others have mentioned, conference coming up at 3pm. ~~Probably~~ will be on NASA TV [**here**](http://www.nasa.gov/news/media/newsaudio/index.html). Thanks to [Munkeez](http://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/19gm5f/live_coverage_spacex_crs2_launch_to_the_iss/c8o0e3l) for the link.

3:00 Teleconference started. Shotwell sounds like she is covering. Talking about the launch being great. Elon to talk about the Dragon.

Musk: **Trying to figure out what went wrong, bring the thrusters back. Pods 1 and 4 online. 2 and 3 still not up but ""looking quite good"" double checking parameters ""optimistic that we'll be able to get all 4 working well"".**

Vehicle is stable. Berthing timing is very flexible, we have lots of options. If we are comfortable when the time comes berthing will happen...(redundant...)

### Pods 1 and 4 now online and thrusters engaged. Dragon transitioned from free drift to active control. Yes!!  - [elonmusk](https://twitter.com/elonmusk)

Hardware or software?

Elon - Blockage in the oxidizer pressure chamber. Were able to free it up by cycling the valves. Seems to have been effective. But that is just a preliminary guess, we'll know more as time goes. **Pressure is holding on all four pods.** Working close with NASA to handle this.

NASA - After we make a good guess at root cause and fly the dragon closer, we'll have a lot more information as time goes on. Can't determine go/no go yet. Need to determine all the risks.

Elon - Nominal pressure on all 4 pod tanks. Pods 2/3 simply not enabled. Will be enabling them shortly. We expect this to work well as the issue was the pressure to begin with.

How long can Dragon orbit before you have to do something. What about late load cargo? 

Elon - Dragon can orbit several months... We could leave it up there for a month at least to fix all the issues/learn what we can. If we are late we only get partial payment if the late load (time sensitive) cargo is lost.

Elon - No debris or gas leakage we are aware of. Everything but the tank pressure seems to be working perfectly.

Why didn't you wait for the 2nd thruster to be online before deploying the solar array?

Elon - we noticed the craft was cooling rapidly. Opening the arrays helped warm it up.

What if this were crewed?

Elon - The crewed version will not even have solar arrays, it'll have a big battery pack. This would not be an issue there. We could get people back with two.... technically we could de-orbit safely with 1 pod, it would just be a wobbly trip.

Elon - I think we'll be back on track here.

Sunday docking looks probable.... fast 18hr dock not possible.

You have 4 oxidizer tanks, how did you plug 3 of them? (was noisy here, if anyone heard that answer post it) Seems to have been a clog in the helium line which is shared.

Hour or two before we'll know more.

3:45 - Conference over.

### Thruster pods one through four are now operating nominally. Preparing to raise orbit. All systems green - [elonmusk](https://twitter.com/elonmusk)

True,lettucetogod,,,"That's not a fair statement. Articles like this are written with an agenda then authors use these declassified documents to fit that agenda. In this process, a lot of the historical context gets left out or the author refuses to acknowledge it. I've worked with Reagan documents before and I will be a lot more--I'm working my way through a History PhD and I research in Reagan foreign policy.

As for the situation in Guatemala. The Cold War was on and, looking back now, we know that the Guatemalan marxists were not directly connected to the USSR. But that doesn't matter; at the time, many Americans thought the marxists and USSR were connected throughout the hemisphere. In 1979, Cold War fears returned for many reasons and Americans believed Carter mishandled foreign policy and that's one of the reasons they elected Reagan.

So the Reagan administration had to respond to instability throughout the hemisphere, Americans demanded action. So how do you respond? There was already a civil war in Guatemala and you have to pick a side...if you didn't, and the marxists won, they surely would have taken aid and assistance from the USSR and Americans would have been furious with Reagan in a similar vein to how people criticized Truman for ""losing"" China. So the administration acted by giving aid and sending some advisors. Once a regime received the aid, though, it's very hard to control how they spend it--just look at aid corruption today, it's a mess! Now, Reagan could have pressured and criticized the regime for the killings or how they spent the aid, but then you risk alienating them and pushing them away as an ally.

My overall point is that these are extremely fluid and complex situations that it's hard to make sense of at the time (especially when your top priority is elsewhere) and looking back. Too often when journalists uncover these incidents, they forget the context of the times and produce 'bad' history. It's also a lot easy to just throw platitudes around like ""Reagan was a murderer"" or ""Reagan was a saint"" than it is the understand the complexity of the times which produces a much more nuanced understanding. If you want good history, start with books produced by university presses where they are peer-reviewed and the sources are examined by many people from multiple perspectives to ensure quality. A good start on issues with the Reagan administration, Congress, and Latin America is William LeoGrande's *Our Own Backyward*.

True,Spizzik,,,"This is super difficult to answer because our experiences are subjective.  One of the problems is that if you're on the wrong med it's just getting you high but between the stimulant and the euphoria you're probably much more able to focus.  

1)  It's not that you're compelled to focus.  I think you'll find that ADHD people spend most of their lives feeling compelled to focus and failing.  What the medicine does is ALLOW focus. Imagine you're watching a TV show you really like, got it?  Great, I'm going to use Big Bang Theory as my example.  Now, you've been watching for about 30 seconds when all the sudden another channel comes on at the same time.  So now there are two channels, and two separate pictures, and the audio from both shows playing at one time through your TV.  No matter what you do to the TV, it keeps playing multiple channels at the same time.  You REALLY just want to watch your show, but there's a fucking soap opera playing on top of Big Bang Theory and you're getting pissed and angry and frustrated about it.  That is every waking second of being unmedicated, and it's something you get used to and you think is normal—until you take the meds.  Suddenly, it's just one channel at a time again, and you know there are tons of channels you can switch between but that choice is up to you.  

2) No.  Good habits make it easier to maintain focus, not the other way around.  Meds alone do not an ADHD treatment make.  Good habits are precisely what allow ADHD sufferers to survive this world without medication.  I see a lot of similarities between ADHD and alcoholism, actually.  Our brains are WIRED for novelty, and we absolutely cannot help it.  Much like AA for Alcoholics helps them avoid tempting situations, focus on success, and so on, a good treatment for ADHD will include a focus on habits to help you get through your day.   For instance, much of my day is spent on auto-pilot.  Distracted or not, I've engrained my upkeep lists (stuff that needs done daily to keep my life organized) into my brain so much that I don't even think about it, I just do it.  Meds treat the neurological basis for your symptoms, they do not treat the plethora of bad habits, negative self talk, and internalized feelings you've developed over your life.  Therapy is really a must, there should be support groups offered to ADHD sufferers for free. 

3) They are life changing, not always for the better.  On the positive side, you can focus for once.  You're on something APPROACHING a level playing field with neurotypical people.  ADHDers are usually so elated by this that they become almost hyper productive.  That's a positive change.  

They also have a dark side though.  In many cases, mine included, it feels too easy on meds.  We're used to struggling every single day to maintain focus and for us, putting in a lot of time on an assignment was a necessity before, but now we're burning through the work load we have like it's nothing.  You start to feel like you're cheating, that you've got this advantage over normal people somehow.  Sometimes you get depressed about it because that really impacts your self worth. Are you succeeding now, or the meds? 

You can start to feel helpless without the meds, like once they wear off you're just incapable of doing anything because it goes back to being difficult again.  You get cranky at people when you come down. 3 hours ago you were flying through work, now you're staring at the computer screen trying desperately to put words on the page and avoid looking at the dozens of colorful icons on your taskbar or dock, or listening the dog down the street barking, your heater just turned on, you got a notification, your friend instant messaged you, the light is flickering a little bit.

True,PAroots,,,"OK, lots going on here.  Hope this helps.

the website, message and photography all need a good bit of work.  This website screams ""i'll do anything for anybody - just call me""  It's so non specific that a potential customer could be turned off.  You lead with video production, yet there is not one sample of your video work.  As a buyer, I'm on to the next.  You also mention that you're very inexpensive.  Not everyone is looking for the cheapest solution, especially with so many craigslisters with cameras out there.

Get speccific.  How will your company help mine?  Who do you work with?  ""custom media"" for ""diverse clients"" says nothing other than you're a generalist w/o a speciality.

With regards to the photography, presumably you're using this as a sample of what your company could deliver to a customer, not as a personal online album... so show it as such.  Navigationally, pictures are of different sizes, which makes if frustrating to have to scroll down to click on to the next one.  Pick a resolution and stick with it for all your images.  With regard to the catagories - think like a buyer.  Businesses don't think in ""black and white"" - Sports, portriture.. etc.. they think in terms of how the photo will be used or the impact it delivers.  How many calls do you expect to get asking for a high contrast B&amp;W landscape of a hillside.  It's not going to happen, so don't show it.  Also, be sure to not duplicate photos across portfolios, it's redundant.  Also, clicking on the photo on your main page doesn't take you to the gallary.. at first I only thought that you had one picutre in each catagory, before it occured to me to click the works and not the picture.  

On to the photography, there's some OK stuff here, but a lot of clunkers.  In portraiture, loose the party girl (it's not a portrait nor can you even see her face) ditch the mom and baby - the lighting is horrendous and any buyer will see that and think ""he can't shoot with lights"".  the kids are ok, but not very compelling.. red guy fine but seriously.. a overexposed out of focus picture of a very overweight guy unaware his pictures is being taken?!  loose it.  and loose it in both portfolios.  That leaves a street photo of an old man, two couples and a bouncer..  what's your target market and would someone hire you on this?  

Landscapes etc.. there is some nice stuff here - and it seems to be where you excel, but again, what purpose would it have for a client?  background to an advertisement perhaps?  if so, show some sample mock up ads!

Sports: kill the indoor climbing pictures - they are snapshots at best. the last photo of the swimmers shows nothing as well.  Teh first swimmer is ok, the group of them could be good but you oversaturated the hats and that's all I can see.  The snowbarder is a great capture but he's at least 3 stops underexpposed.  If you can't fix it in post, then drop this one.  The surfer is a great picture as is the B&amp;W of the climber.  Lead with those.

Now.. Random Fun?  lets get serious.  Why would someone hire based on any of these photos.. especially b/c I've seem most of them earlier in your portfolios.  snap shot of an apartment complex?  fat guy again?  drop them.  Some band photo are interesting, and if that's a great potential client.  Bands need photos.. so instead of having a ""fun stuff that I don't care about but like to do in my personal life"" folder - get 5-6 pictures and have a folder of ""musicians""  

In general, if you don't have it, don't show it.  Having 4 great photos is FAR better than having 4 great photos hidden among 6 other klunckers.   Think like a customer - show your best work only - explain what you do and why someone would hire you.. specifically.  IE: WHERE ARE YOU LOCATED?!  no where does it say this other than your area code..  

Good first effort, but refine it down and get some real video examples up there.

True,RamsesThePigeon,gold gilded,Norse Overlord of Reddit Gold,"*A grizzled warrior sits upon a chair assembled from hewn bone and hide. Scars from countless battles cross his skin, and his gaze pierces through the air like a shaft of arctic ice... but as he smiles, a comforting warmth comes to his eye. In silence, he pours another tankard of mead - from his personal store, no less - and offers it forward.*

Ah, at last... you have found cause to ask the question. I am very proud of you, son, for today - whether sunset finds you in this world or Valhalla - you finally become a man. No, no, I do not question your prowess... I have seen you wield a blade against many a foe, and I would gladly have you by my side as we plunged into the very depths of Niflheim.

These conquests do not make you a man. A man is measured not by the strength of his steel, but by the depth of his knowledge, and knowledge of Reddit Gold is perhaps the most powerful you shall ever possess.

*He pauses and drinks deeply from his mead, then places his tankard aside. With a faraway look, he begins to speak again, his voice a steady thrum which, if heard from a distance, would be as the beginnings of a war song.*

Son... you have had glory on the battlefield, and have felt the fury of the All-Father coursing through your veins. On Reddit, however, the battle is not only with they who appear to be your enemies, but with yourself, as well. In those moments when you triumph over all, when you offer laughter, comfort, or rare knowledge, your fellow warriors may see fit to immortalize your wisdom, your wit, by granting you Reddit Gold. Think of it as a fleeting trophy, for most often, it will only last one month's time. Yes, it may confer upon you greater skills, like the ability to view more comments at once or to know which of them you have already seen. Some legends even state that its power allows you to subscribe to more subReddits... but never forget, it is the *gesture* which truly matters.

*He turns, his entire face now touched by the firelight. An unearthly glow flickers across his skin, leaving only the empty socket of his left eye unilluminated. He smiles and holds up a medallion, which seems to shimmer with a light of its own.*

True,Thinks_Like_A_Man,,,"I have been thinking about this a great deal lately.  My take on it is a bit different.  Apologies in advance for the wall of text.

I used to play this timed video game that took about a minute a round.  I would climb to the highest ranks because I was good at it, then get knocked way down. I noticed that about every 20th game, I would be put in a no-win situation to lose a shitload of points, where the winning piece would not be given to me until literally seconds before the game ended. It became some sort of sick fascination for me. I kept playing the game just to see if this was truly the pattern, if it was designed to be unwinnable.

I'll get back to this later. I promise this will all make sense.

There have been only rare times in my life when I can say I was truly happy.  The last time was 20 years ago and the situation was that I had a low paying job that I absolutely loved.  I was writing full-time for a small newspaper, cranking out articles and editorials every week.  I was in a pretty good relationship, not great, and I was struggling financially. I woke up every morning excited to face the day because I got to do what I loved.  I was respected, sometimes even feared, but certainly what I did *mattered*.

Yeah, I know, someone is going to say you can still write every day.  But there's a difference when people read what you write, and what you do has meaning. I'm not here to debate that point.

I have struggled to find my way back to that life and now, I am afraid I may actually find it.  In reality, I think it would have been easier if I had never experienced happiness at all. At least then I could accept my fate that I was destined to experience losing and stop holding out hope that all the pieces will come together to create a life I know exists.

Every time I have hit a period of happiness, I have experienced such relief, and I have thought, ""Well, I am so glad that's over, now my life can really begin.""  Before, I use to frame these difficult times as a period of bad luck, but recently, I now see it as the other way around. My expectations have changed.

My life is one continuous span of difficult times occasionally punctuated by brief periods of relief where the cosmos align, and enough things seem to go my way where I feel empowered.  Most of the time, I would have all the ingredients for happiness, except one minor detail which would destroy everything else.  

Now that I am older, and have spent so much of my life battling depression and trying to be happy, I am worried that life may be like that video game.  

I am worried that life will give me exactly what I want and it will be as wonderful as I imagine.  I do not fantasize about unobtainable goals like being a celebrity or wealthy.  I don't even need for the life to include a career in writing. My desired life is one that I feel is modest in goals, where I have someone who really loves me and is committed to the relationship, where I have some type of work where I am appreciated and feel like I make a difference. It is a metaphorical warm embrace, where I feel like the universe wants me, and I am destined to be happy, like God is saying, ""You win."" It is a life where I feel like I can set out to get what I want, and as long as the goal is reasonable, and I work hard, I can achieve it. 

My fear?  I will achieve that life and just as I realize how wonderful it can be, that familiar sense of relief will wash over me.  As I get that much needed piece to the puzzle, I will know that the bad times are over and I can finally start living. Then, I will discover the clock has run out, and it is time for me to die.

My fear is that life is like that video game, designed so that I can never win, but giving me just enough hope to remain engaged, obsessing over finding the answer, with some sick fucking design to make it unwinnable.",0,1362162074,,0,False,2,c8nyl71,t3_19gu09,t1_c8nyl71,t3_19gu09,,1431451383,2076,False,depression,t5_2qqqf,2076

True,protomic,,"Elec 0T9+PEY, MASc 1T3","I cannot speak on behalf of the Engineering Society, but I have read the document. EngSoc has 88 affiliated clubs, including 42 that are not eligible for UTSU affiliation and funding, and allocates nearly three times as much money to clubs funding per capita. This is due to the lower requirements for affiliation (10 engineering members) and includes many groups that are not engineering-related, engineering-run, or engineering by majority composition. Just because a club is affiliated does not mean they get funding by default, as requests are passed through the finance committee to filter out clubs applying for the sake of getting free money, but they have access to club benefits as listed in the document. I don't see how you could reach a conclusion where clubs receive less funding since the available funding pool as a percentage of fees will actually increase.

In the analysis of the insurance situation, the original concern was that engineering students would be the ones that had to pay higher premiums due to their smaller constituency. The conclusion reached based on talks with insurance providers was that the cost of insurance premiums and running the plan will remain the same as what it is now for all parties, engineering and non-engineering.

I think that the proposed use of the transferred funds in the document are fairly straightforward in answering the questions/concerns you have proposed. The general sentiment is that the UTSU will receive proportionally lower funds based on the fees that would be transferred to the engineering society, but those reallocated funds would be put into replicating the services that the UTSU provides, and with roughly 8-10% of their constituency removed, the UTSU should be able to maintain their own services for the rest of the colleges that  choose not to defederate. Most importantly, note that the UTSU does not always align with the Engineering Society and other professional faculties on topics of student advocacy, and the Engineering Society is most importantly looking at the impact of the separation on its own members and how it can best serve its student body.",0,1362163193,,0,1362163377,1,c8nyywr,t3_19g036,t1_c8nyywr,t1_c8nvvkt,,1431451523,3,False,UofT,t5_2rbaq,3

That's all there is to it, and I genuinely don't see why this is such a confusing issue for you. 

If a woman tells you she's not interested, but you keep whining until she feels nothing will get you to leave her alone except for giving in, and you end up having sex... you have coerced her. You have, in fact, committed a rape, by browbeating someone who made it very clear she did not want to have sex with you until she felt she had no meaningful choice in the matter. Is this really such a controversial concept? D:

Whether or not she had other options, like leaving or calling the police, does not really impact the wrongness of your own actions. You have made it quite clear that you will not desist until she does *something* to stop you. And in the presence of an aggressive, insistent, potentially dangerous male... yes, women may feel like caving in is the only *physically safe* option.

The most successful tech companies that operate on a large scale today build their highly efficient, top-performance and astonishingly resilient systems out of commodity hardware. They write (or in some cases adapt, or in others probably even just use) clever software that enables running their applications on comparatively ridiculously cheap (yet still absolutely massive) infrastructure. They don't buy ""enterprise-grade"" hardware that adds a prohibitive premium for that extra nine after the decimal point, because they design their systems in a very clever and fault-tolerant way that most people and corporations do not - either because they are unwilling, or they are unable to.

I think (user-modifiable - your ""hardware RAID"" is, at the end of the day, still driven by software that you can't even analyze; you'll have to implicitely trust it to get its job done right at all times. Seems kinda naive, doesn't it? :)) software's control over how your bits get dumped to a physical medium is only going to expand, because it's in the best interest of those that, today, influence what's being developed on both the hardware (Google et al. build the largest data centers, and they don't feel like getting ripped off by hardware vendors) and the software side side. Once SATA and SAS are killed off for good and you'll hopefully be able to talk to the NAND in your SSDs over a fast interconnect and without that stupid ATA/SCSI/LBA/whatever-holds-us-back-compatible translation layer served up by proprietary secret-sauce firmware, this development will only speed up. And with it that, I think, many other things in the storage business will vanish - things like ""hardware RAID"".

It takes time to for old habits to die, doubly so if they used to be (or even are widely regarded as) the state of the art and still are a reasonable choice to make - like ""hardware RAID"".

Most people I've shared this with find it appalling cynical but I guess I find it really just liberating.

Others are convinced that some deity sits in judgement of their morality and worry about being a good person so much that they never really step outside their comfort zones or experience different perspectives.

True,[deleted],,,"Sphinx and Solr are simply programs. I didn't really answer your stack question. If you use either of those they would be included in your list of ingredients for the app but it probably won't be considered part of the stack. Normally STACK consists of:

1. Server OS
2. Web Server program
3. Database
4. Server side language

But obviously it takes more than that to make a web app. I'm only famaliar with PHP and MySQL for server side scripting and database so I would do:

1. Linux (I like Ubuntu Server Edition, very easy to install things via apt-get command and you won't get the constantly missing packages which at least for me is a big headache on CentOS)
2. NGINX (more light weight and performant than Apache, to get it to work with PHP you would have to install the FastCGI module)
3. MySQL
4. PHP (pick a good MVC framework rather than writing one from scratch. I like Codeigniter but Zend, CakePHP and Symphony are very popular too)

Other:

- Search: Sphinx
- GEO location detection (e.g. to server custom content based on geographic region if needed): MAXmind GEO IP C library
- jQuery as the JavaScript library (if the app is going to be very client side focused with lots of JS interactivity then I would use backbone/underscore too)

Anyway the above is what I would personally use for most projects. What you use is dependent on a million questions that you need to answer first about your project.


As for deployment I would go with Amazon Web Services. EC2 for the hosting, S3 for the storage, Simple email service for signup confirmations, newsletter and other emails. When you deploy on the cloud you only pay for what you use and can scale instantly. I believe amazon even offers a monitoring service that will auto scale your app based on how much traffic your app is getting. That way your app will never go down due to server overload and you will also only pay for the resources you use.

I was so goddamn perplexed I just stood and watched the whole time. He didn't even realize I was there until he was done flipping out. I felt soooo bad for him, I had no idea why he was acting like that, but I know it was with reason. 

If this didn't take place in the newer bathroom in school things may have turned out differently. This kid lived a hop and a skip away from school, and this bathroom was on the first floor, newly constructed, relatively soundproof.

Following queer theorist Eve Sedgwick's focus on textiles (which are constructed), I wonder if it would make more sense to speak of a reddit Argile or a reddit Paisley.

I've sent an email to the administrators asking to block my reddit gold functionality, so we'll se how it goes.

True,theprofessor75,,,"You can't tell from the picture given his scarring but I can tell you guys, as an individual who had severe acne in high school, it is a horrible horrible thing. 

I would ask myself, why me? What makes me different from other people? What am I doing wrong? Why do I have more acne on my one face than everyone combined in this class has? Why can't I just be normal? 

My acne was so bad I went on accutane twice. For those of you who don't know what accutane is, it's basically the last resort medication for acne. You have to sign a waiver when taking it because people have killed themselves while on it due to depression. 

Severe acne is so bad. It's something you CAN NOT control. Think about it, when people look at you, talk to you, what are they looking at? Your face. That's how people identify you, by your face. And what is on my face you ask? Acne, lots and lots of acne.

Most people when they wake up they see a new zit and they are shocked. My normal routine was the opposite, if there was not a new zit I was shocked. My face was so inflammed from me popping zits that I could not feel my face, all I could feel was inflammation. 

I hated taking pictures. If I looked in a mirror I was disgusted with myself. If the sun was on my face I could feel it on my acne, it was that bad. 

The biggest thing that got me is that it's ugly and it's something that I could not control. I thought about suicide a couple times. Really, when you feel like there is no out, there is nothing you can do, it seems like a smart way to end the turmoil. 

4-5 years later my acne has cleared up. I don't break out like I used to. The thing is, I didn't do anything different. It must have been hormones.   But, it is evident on my face from the scarring of picking at my zits, that I had bad acne. I have indentions on my face because of this. I assume this is what has caused the OP to do what he did.

I have vowed to never make fun of person with acne, especially extreme acne, ever in my life because I know of their pain. It's a horrible thing that I'm glad I got over.

True,goodcase,,,"There appears to be some misunderstanding here. This was a supply/substitute/ temp teacher. The regular teacher was sick, this guy filled in for her. This was not a regular staffed teacher. The Vp did talk to him in private and escorted him into class to collect his belongings at which point I gave him the bratty smile. I apologize, the details are a little foggy as this happened almost 9 years ago. 

I had a supply teacher for science in grade 8 that was a real prick. He wouldn't let anybody go to the washroom under any circumstances. There was this one girl that REALLY needed to use the washroom. She asked and he refused, he really would not let her go. She ended up crying because it was an *emergency* (if you catch my drift). I looked at her and then said out loud ""let her go to the washroom, she's crying, she must really have to go"". Instead of letting her go to the washroom he sent me into the hall where a few minutes he came out to talk to me. He asked me why I spoke out loud and I said that he wasn't being fair and that she should be allowed to use the washroom. He said that he wasn't going to let her and that was the final straw with me. I stood up and said ""okay, I'm going to get you fired"". He didn't believe me, he said ""okay, go, get me fired"" I walked up to the office, asked to speak to the vice principal and told him what had happened. He got so red in the face and followed me back to class, removed the teacher from class and relieved him of his duties. I gave that teacher the brattiest smile I could.

tl;dr teacher wouldn't let girl go to washroom, she starts crying, I get teacher fired.

my favorite 32x games: Knuckles chaotix, virtua racing, kolibri, metal head, mortal kombat 2, space harrier, after burner, shadow squadron.

Few games take advantage of the x,y,z buttons. I think all of the ones that do are fighting games.

Get sonic megamix for the sega cd.

I have never had my genesis games damaged by my 32x

The 32x has a better video encoder than the model 1, so the picture is a bit sharper. Some model 2s have even better video than the 32x. (composite video)

The 32x has the same sound quality as the genesis you are using, im not sure about the sega cd.

True,esantipapa,,,"&gt;Of course I’m exaggerating. I don’t think I personally know 200 men that I find sexually attractive.

Dripping with contempt for unattractive men (reversal... a man with this level of contempt for women would be seen as incredibly sexist).

&gt;Now one could argue that men being more thoughtful about sex, **rather than being the selfish entitled asses that they have traditionally been** is a feather in feminism’s cap.

So that means you get to be just as much of an entitled ass? Way to be progressive! /s

&gt;But what I can tell you is this: Getting my courage up to ask a partner that I trust for the sex that I wanted only to be turned down left me feeling hella disempowered.

Imagine how it feels to have that shit happen all the time (that's a taste of what it feels like to be a man sweetheart). 

&gt;Denying sex becomes an easy way for men to let you know who’s boss.

Wait... so when men deny sex it's a power grab... when women do it, it's asserting your independence and freedom?

&gt;And in the classic fashion of those with privilege, they played the victim, changed the rules, and refused to give the thing they had the power to give. In this case, sex.

What in the fucking fuck??!?

True,boundmaus,,,"..TW (obviously) 

I was smoking pot with my 'friends' when I was 15. I didn't realize that it was laced with K, and so smoked quite a lot. I K-Holed. I ended up being dragged to my friends bed, just off the living room (there was no door between the room and the living room, just a curtain). I was essentially paralyzed, but fully conscious. The 'friend', Anthony, came into the room. He started kissing me, and talking about how I wouldn't get away this time. 

He spent hours raping me, and slicing my legs open slowly with a razor blade. I was in agony, but couldn't move. I could only beg him too stop. Eventually I figured out that seemed to make him happier (which made him more violent), so I turned off. I just looked at the ceiling, and listened too the sounds around me. My 'friends' watching films, drinking, and smoking in the living room. Music. Cars going past. Anything. I think I was crying. He called me horrible things. He kept forcing smoke into my lungs so I wouldn't sober up, and I think he gave me something else. 

After about four hours he dragged me into the shower (literally, still unable to move). He threw me on the floor and turned the cold water on, and walked out. He left me there for hours, until I could move again. In the morning, when I could finally walk, I went into the living room. He and the others were watching a film, and just ignored me. I was covered in blood. I wanted to leave, but had no clothes. I went back into the room, too look for my clothes, but saw blood everywhere. Anthony followed me into the room, and asked if I was on the pill. I told him I wasn't, as he knew I had been a virgin. He said 'perhaps you should take the morning after pill', and gave me one. I just looked at him, grabbed the bloody sheet, wrapped it around me and walked out of that house. 

What was it like? It left me permanently scarred, in more ways than one. It was torture. Why was I tortured? Because he thought I would be easy too rape, but it turned out that I was a better drinker than he realized, so he drugged and tortured me for revenge, I guess? I don't know. Funnily, I never asked him. 
There is more, but I need a fucking cigarette. I will attempt to answer any questions. 

EDIT:: I have to go to work now (tis Sunday morning here in Aotearoa), but will answer more questions when I get home. But I just want to thank all of you for reading this, and for your beautiful words. The internet can be a horrible place, but it can be a amazing place, and you all have shown me the amazing side today. I have had a horrible week, but I go to my nightmare job not caring how much my boss will scream at me today, uplifted by your support. Thank you all. 

EDIT PART II:: Thank you for reddit gold, whoever that was! 

**To those stupid Cunts sending me LOVELY messages telling me how it was my fault; FUCK YOU. Ya know what? NOTHING CAN MAKE SOMEONE RAPE SOMEONE. My smoking pot has nothing to do with it. I chose to smoke pot, not K. I didn't know that someone I thought was a close friend, who took me in when I was kicked out of home, was the monster he turned out to be. Rape is NEVER a victims fault, and those who say it is have no understanding of why I am breaking my heart sharing my story. You know why rapists get away with it? Because of people like you. So go to hell.**

True,kaebeez,,,"""Trench Warfare is boring"" is possibly the single most cliche'd thing that gets posted in every single one of these threads, and it's completely wrong.

I worked on a mod that was semi-popular (but mostly... lacking) in the mid-2000s called The Trenches, and I have some insights into why the setting is not very conducive to a popular game. The first problem comes from the fact that the war is not very popular to begin with. This is affected by all kinds of factors: The first and foremost being that outside of a few counties, mainly the Commonwealth countries, World War One is not a massive topic in school... certainly not on par with World War Two. Hell, many people don't even know what the Triple Entente is or who the Central Powers were comprised of.

The second major factor into the war's unpopularity (especially with games) is that there is no agreed on general narrative other than the rather hackneyed line of ""lmao trench trench filth and mass attacks."" This is all many people know, and they parrot it over and over. It does not matter that the Western Front was a war of mobility starting in 1917, it does not matter that the Eastern Front was very fluid, and it does not matter that the Italian Front was largely fought in mountains and their valleys. No, all that can be skipped because the only common narrative most people have is from watching All Quiet in history class and reading some war poetry.

The war, also, is not very accessible. You have battles that span over many years and stages. It is not like World War Two, where the whole war was one of mobility and you have concrete, large operations of ""Here is the drop in Normandy, now we move to Carentan, etc."" You have multiple battles in Verdun, you have multiple battles in Passchendaele, and in the Somme say for 1916-ish. These are not concrete towns (despite there being towns with the same name, these were not generally the 'main area' of the battles) with concrete villages and areas that are easily modeled. These are referred to in terms of general areas in regions of France.

Another reason for the war's inaccessibility is, for the most part, the general lack of education of weapons and their implements in battle. The most oft-repeated phrase is just ""napoleonic tactics against machine guns."" This is in no way true, as small-unit skirmishes became far more popular in the Western Front in 1917 with French assault detachments, German Stostruppe teams or Sturmpionier groups, etc. However, these facts go against the general narrative people hold, and the Eastern, Asiatic, and Italian fronts are all but ignored outright.

Also, in terms of a balanced gameplay standpoint, and something that can be balanced properly while still maintaining interesting tech-- the game would really require the two factions to be the Germans and the French. Now, in certain parts of the world, both of these countries are unpopular for different reasons. In an ideal world the match-up would best be the British or Commonwealth forces against the Germans, but the British unit structure and tech really doesn't lend itself towards an engaging FPS or RTS. The French in particular experimented a LOT in the war, and fielded multiple kinds of semi-automatic rifles, light machine guns, an assault rifle, the most mobile and advanced tanks, etc. The French essentially had the answer to Germany's incredibly defensive strategy in WWI, and it'd make for a decent game. But peoples' perceptions define what will be popular and what won't.

A problem that has plagued WWI mod and game development teams, and serious affected The Trenches was the difficulty of creating interesting maps, giving an 'iconic' experience of the war, and keeping its size in line. Engines have certainly come a long ways, and can provide a much larger battlefield with more details than say The Trenches or WWI:Source provide, but player count and populating those maps can be a problem.

In regards to an FPS, referring to the original post, you can't be looking at more than 32 player servers, 64 at the absolute maximum, and unless respawn time is extremely high for multiplayer games, you're not going to be able to get massive waves coming at a position that isn't evenly matched by 16 or 32 other players on the opposite team just waiting for you as you're exposed. 

I believe it'd work a lot better as a concept with an RTS, in the same vein as Company of Heroes as someone else mentioned. You could have the numbers in a more apparent manner, and wouldn't be risking some of the technical difficulties of an FPS in the war. You can have more recognizable, larger battlefields with the numbers to fill the trenches, where little groups of shock troops can actually operate in a stalemate like environment. This is one of the failings of most WWI projects: the nature of FPS games in particular leads *everyone* into being shock troops. If you implement some sort of system where an officer player has to ALLOW you to exit trenches, the only real solution, it just causes all kinds of issues from a server experience / fun factor standpoint.

I don't think this will happen unless a big studio makes it, and I can't see the multiplayer being anything to write home about unless it's done as an RTS game. Many WWI mods and projects have come and gone-- and most are unknown simply because the war is not accessible enough, people don't know enough about it, and the setting is not very conducive to a multiplayer FPS. Battlefield 1918, The Trenches, WWI: Source, etc. have all made attempts at what some of you seek, and all have failed in many regards. It's been a noble endeavour for us, or at least we all thought so, but there are significant problems that stand in the way of making a good WWI shooter.

tl;dr: The inability to reflect the numbers and settings of the war, and especially peoples' perceptions, misguided or not, make the war inaccessible to the average gamer.


EDIT:

Just to nerd out a little bit and counter the whole 'bolt action rifles yawn' thing: France adopted the Meunier STA-8 A6 semi-automatic rifle well before the war, and it was used in WWI as a semi-automatic sniping platform, not unlike scoped Gewehr 43s in World War Two. By 1917, front line units had 8 semi-automatic Ribeyrolles-Chauchat-Sutter M1917 rifles per platoon, the first mass-produced semi-automatic rifle to be fielded in large numbers by any army. By December of 1917, France was issuing its troops on the Salonika front with Winchester 1907 self-loading rifles converted to select fire, firing a 9x35mm intermediate cartridge from a high-capacity magazine-- the second real foray into an assault rifle.

Both France and Germany fielded different types of light machine guns and flamethrowers. The most infamous of these being the French Chauchat, a 20-round light machine gun fitted with a pistol grip and a bipod that was issued in absolutely massive numbers to many Entente forces. The French also fielded the Hotchkiss M1908 Portative light machine gun, a general-purpose machine gun firing from either 30 round strips, or linked 'rigid' belts. The Germans had their own counters: The rather heavy MG-08/15, its lightened brother the MG-08/18, the Danish Madsen Muskete 1915, and the forward-thinking Bergmann MG-15 neuer Art.",0,1362218102,,0,1362358514,1,c8ocyif,t3_19h3ng,t1_c8ocyif,t3_19h3ng,,1431458255,558,False,truegaming,t5_2sgq6,558
True,introllect,,,"I'm not sure if this is what you'd consider torture, but here goes:

I once wrote something disparaging about my mother and father in a private journal when I was about 9 or maybe 11? My mother read it and then showed it to my father, who I guess believed/believes people aren't allowed to have opinions about anything so he made me eat the pages of my dairy where I wrote stuff about them. He told me if I didn't eat the pages, he'd hit me x amount (forgot the exact amount) of times with his favorite disciplinary tool of that time--the heavy, wooden handle of feather duster. Stupid me, I had a journal with thick, glossy pages, and I had written that entry with permanent marker. 

Later in adulthood, after having a family of my own, he gave me back the journal he made me eat pages from as well as a notebook in which I had used to express very angry feelings towards my mom. There was an insulting note pasted on the notebook meant to ridicule and shame me for expressing my feelings, but it had the opposite effect.

I had to endure lots of really terrible parenting (understatement, maybe), but the one that takes the cake is the time I stayed after school for extra credit in English when I was a freshman in high school. My dad picked me up everyday after school, and I didn't think it would be a big deal if he waited 15 minutes while I was trying to get extra credit. I was wrong. He was pissed, and he didn't believe that I was where I said I was. 

So we get home, and I'm sitting on my bed. He asks me where I was. I tell him the truth. He slaps me across the face. I'm baffled and shocked. He asks me again, calmly. I tell them again. The truth, of course. He slaps me across the face again. He, again, asks me where I have been. I repeat my answer to him because it's the truth. He slaps me across the face again. I flip out and start yelling and cursing at him and hitting myself because I don't understand why I'm getting hit for telling the truth, and it's maddening. He pushes me down on the bed, flips me over, and basically punches me with a closed fist on the back of my head. As he's getting off my bed, he falls, and I tell him I'm glad he fell because he's a fucking asshole. My mother comes home just in time to hear me call my dad a fucking asshole.

She sees me, her eldest daughter (pretty sure Reddit assumed I was a dude up to this point), crying, RAGING, just calling my father a fucking asshole. Do you know what she does? She sits down next to me calmly, and asks me if I realize what I've done. ""Uhh, what?"" I ask. ""You called your father a fucking asshole,"" was her reply. I never wanted to bash my mom's face in so badly up until that moment. No 'what happened?', no 'are you okay?'. Just, 'ERMAGHERD, u call yooze daddy an assholio. Derpaherpa.' 

Basically, it was that point where I realized I might as well do whatever the fuck I wanted because I would get punished for lying regardless of whether or not I've actually lied. For the longest time as a child, I would imagine beating him up and 'torturing' him when he was old and bedridden the same way he did to me when I was basically a helpless child.

He has sprayed Lysol in my face. I wish I remembered more, but the funny thing about being abused growing up is that it appears normal to you, so nothing really seems memorable except for the instances that really emotionally impacted you. He's also destroyed homework that I've completed more than once. He has destroyed my clothing, torn up all my books, destroyed electronics. He'd get so pissed when I basically acted like I didn't care. I mean, really, why would I care? He'd punish me by telling me I couldn't watch TV, only to find me entertaining myself by reading a book, which he would promptly confiscate, and he'd tell me I had to just lie on my bed and do nothing. Double-yoo-tee-eff, right? 

Years after, after having my own children and refusing to visit my father, my mom would fucking wonder why I wouldn't visit. She'd be emotionally manipulative and say stuff like, ""Oh, I'm so sad you haven't forgiven your father."" I didn't hold any bitterness toward him. He basically taught me how NOT to parent and what kind of spouse NOT to marry. I basically told her to knock it off; she was lucky I was even talking to her even though she totally failed to protect me from my dad's abuse. 

Well, she eventually left him, and no one really likes him anymore. He's old and mellowed out. I do visit him, and I see him biting his tongue in a way I just never witnessed growing up. You treat your children so differently when they are adults who don't rely on you and can just walk out if you even start to get a little bit out of hand. 

Edited to add: In a twisted way, having a shitty, yet not-too-destructive childhood has really helped me really appreciate my adulthood. I really enjoy being an adult. I love paying my bills. It reminds me I'm not beholden to anyone. I love driving around and performing really monotonous tasks because my mom insisted on doing everything for me. I love shopping for my own food, since I was never allowed to pick out what I wanted to eat. I'm in my late 20s now, with my own kids. They always tell me they will always live with me, even when they are old. I tell them that that is sweet, and they are always welcome to live with me, but I'm certain they will want to start their own lives when they are older.

True,Aurori,volibear,[Aurori] (EU-W),"Ok, before this thread blows up (as it kinda have already, seeing that this isnt our official way to answer questions about our work), let me just clarify why and what has happened.


The post you are talking about was deleted because of 

**A)** Its in violation of our rule about being respectful, mainly by the ammount of racial slurs used. I do know that Sky is a comedian and that he is simply doing his job, but you can still be funny without namecalling.


**B)** All this is doing is to inspire the toxic behavior of parts of this community, as I said I do understand that he is joking, but the side-effects is that our AutoMod runs warm deleting all kinds of racial slurs, insults and other things quoting Sky from either his videos or his stream. Just because you are black doesn't make it ok to throw around ""ni**a"" to everyone.

I can see the funny part about his videos and I know that the community liked his first video which was indeed worse then this (seen from a mod-perspective with even more namecalling). The first thread got approved by mistake (a mod that didn't look at the video and just approved due to him not breaking blogspam-rules), so that video got to be up in 24 hours by mistake.

IF we were to allow these videos we are basically saying that this is an ok behavior for a league of legends player. I personally doesn't think that it is.

We as a community is always talking about how bad the community is (all them posts about the toxicity of the people you guys play with) and how we all should unite to increase the quality of this community as a whole. Then do your part (as I know many have since both posts got quite a decent amount of reports) and we/I will do ours.


Just to clarify again, I do know that Sky is a comedian but it does not justify racial slurs, especially not when it inspires even more toxic comments then ever before.

I was the one that deleted both of these videos and I even told my fellow mods that if people start asking I will take the responsibility, because I stand for my actions and I would have deleted them again. Sky is more then welcome to post here and I got nothing personal against him, I just wish that he would refrain from using racial slurs and stop catering towards a toxic behavior.

These were the first guys to argue that the ""secularization paradigm"" might be fundamentally flawed (the secularization paradigm argued that demand dropped because ""with modernity"", we had no *demand* for religion).  Of course, most scholars pointed out that secularization includes at least three parts (decline of individual belief, separation of spheres, privatization; privatization is definitely more common in Western Europe than America), but economies of religion paradigm only examines secularization as the decline of individual belief.  Anyway, their main argument is that secularization has *supply-side* explanations, not *demand-side* ones.  In America, where there are no supply-side restrictions (anyone can start a church!), demand is high because robust competition means there's something for everyone.  Conversely, they argue, in Europe where there are state churches (""monopolies) and it's harder to start new sects (in the technical sense), religious organizations ""provide an inferior product"" and this is what is driving decreased demand. *There are problems with this model, I fundamentally disagree with it, but looking at Europe and America, it does highlight many important things, and it changed the terms of the debate about secularization (which was assumed to be more or less inevitable).*

**THEY'RE NOT SO DIFFERENT**  This school, sometimes but not often called ""neo-secularization"", emphasizes, in the grand scheme of things, that even the U.S. is pretty secularized.  How do you measure individual belief?  Surveys, right.  There are a couple of different kinds of surveys, the most basic kind asks you, ""Did you go to church last week?"" (or whatever).  Jose Casanova found that if you look at time use surveys (""What did you do this week?""), Spain and the US actual report much more similar values of church attendance.  **This gets into measurement issues: how secular a country is depends on how you define secular (formal affiliation, weekly church attendance, reported importance, position in the public sphere); different measures get you different answers of who is secular and who is religious.**  Whether these measurements are valid is another issue (people in the U.S., it seems, tend to over-report their religious participation in surveys).  There's big literature on the fact that in America, religion is in the public sphere, where in Europe it is not (and remember, the Moral Majority and Evangelical Protestantism only came into American politics in the 1980's--they haven't been a constant force in national American politics); in terms of practice, they argue, they're not so different.  There's also argument that positions *neither* are that religious compared to 300 years and that *that's* the big story (this is the ""separation of spheres"" thing--religion is now in it's own ""sphere""; Phil Gorski's article ""Historicizing the Secularization Debate"" is a good place to start here).  But as some have pointed out in this thread, Europe and America not necessarily so different as the question assumes and it matters a lot how you count ""religious"".  Steve Bruce's *God is dead: Secularization in the West* might be a place to start for this one. *This argument has some points for it, again highlighting some important things, but also ignores certain realities that there are both qualitative and quantitative differences between Europe and America (and within Europe, as well) that could use explaining.*

**HUMAN SECURITY** Norris and Inglehart, the people behind the World Values Survey, argue that it is intimately tied up in ""human security"". In fact, they argue, rather than religious regulation, variations in human security explain most of the variations in religiosity (they modified their claims slightly by the time the *Sacred and Secular* was published in 2011, but I forget what they exactly modified it to).  That is to say, in places where things are more unsure (poor Eastern Europe, healthcareless America, to mention nothing of the the Global South), people are more religious.  Similarly, in places with large income inequality, religion is also more important (again, they group this within ""human insecurity"").  As financial security improves in Romania, Poland, Turkey, people will became less religious no matter how you measure it (this theory predicts).  Ditto as America gets healthcare and tackles inequality.  In wealthy, welfare state-y, egalitarian Western Europe, religion isn't as needed.  **They say that economic inequality and ""existential"" insecurity drive religion--it's *demand* that matters, not supply.**  This explicitly challenges the ""Economies of Religion"" literature with quantitative data and regressions (most of the other challenges have come with qualitative data, at most with descriptive statistics) and has done a lot in terms of quieting that school down (you see a lot less economies of religion stuff after about 2004 when Ingelhart and Norris start publishing on this; though it's still popular as *one* explanation for behavior instead of *the* explanation--see for example Melissa Wilde's [article on voting at Vatican II](http://asr.sagepub.com/content/75/4/586.short)).  However, these explanations originally relied on correlations in small N-samples of developed countries; I can't find the graph right now, but I remember their earliest findings really seemed to be most driven by the US and Ireland; remove those two, and the trend line was relatively flat.  Data on more countries from the last wave of the World Value Survey in the late 2000's made them deemphasize parts their thesis, however, it also made other parts robust. *Indisputably, they're on to something here but this is relatively new, and no one is quite sure what to make of it yet*.  This also reminds me I need to reread their book...

**CLOSENESS TO REGIME** and **NATIONAL IDENTITY**.  This emphasizes that **religion is embedded in specific social and political contexts**.  This explanation is the probably the second oldest explanation for variations in secularization (after the arguments that ""rationalization"" and ""modernization"" will doom religion, which aren't even considered here) and dates back at least to Tocqueville.  We just went over this in my undergraduate class; even in the 1830's, he could already write:

&gt;In France I had almost always seen the spirit of religion and the spirit of freedom marching in opposite directions. But in America I found they were intimately united and that they reigned in common over the same country.    

So, to explain this a little bit as its developed in the current poli sci literature especially, to go against the political regime in France (or wherever) meant to go against the religious regime.  **Religion would remain popular as long as the regime remained popular, but when religion came down firmly on one side of a political debate, the other side tended to secularize**.  Arguably, the same thing did not happen in America until the 1980's (Tocqueville elsewhere mentions that even Catholic priests in America love liberty).  However, in countries where there has been daylight between unpopular regimes and religion (think about Poland and Solidarity), this can help the religion, so it works both ways (in post-Communist Russia, you see regime supporters supporting religion, etc). I haven't looked at the numbers myself, but Claude Fischer recently argued in a [Boston Review piece](http://www.bostonreview.net/BR38.1/claude_fischer_liberals_religion.php) that much of the recent declines in religious participation in America over the last thirty years has occurred among political liberals--primarily after the Moral Majority, et al. entered politics in '80s.  Before that, religious arguments were frequent from both sides (think: civil rights movement, the social gospel, abolitionism, etc) and religious participation was roughly equal between conservatives and liberals.  So religion became associated with one political faction, and this led to its decline in the other political faction (you also see this happening with European socialists a century before).  

Nationalism is also important.  **In some parts of the world, to be an X nationality means to be X religion**.  To be a Pole *means* being Catholic, to be a Turk *means* being Muslim, to be a Greek *means* being Orthodox, to be Irish *meant* being Catholic (meaning, this was once the case, but it's changing, some argue), but since the French Revolution, to be a Frenchman did not require being Catholic.  This tends to affect more measures of importance and affiliation as opposed to attendance, but it definitely affects all three, if I remember the literature.  But this helps understand most of the countries that are most religious in Europe.  I discussed the differences between the Czech Republic (one of the most secular countries in Europe) and Slovakia (frequently counted as the second most religious country in Europe, after Poland) in [this previous question](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/14xxsq/why_does_the_czech_republic_have_so_many_atheists/c7hgyls). This argument is frequent and becoming more important: I recently read a not-entirely-convincing-but-suggestive chapter by Genevieve Zubrzycki about how the ~~Silent Revolution~~ Quiet Revolution (*oops*) in Quebec changed Quebecois identity, de-emphasizing the Catholic aspect of the identity, and in the decades since then, we've seen a decline religious participation when it was no longer necessary to be Catholic to be Quebecois (aka national identity&gt;religious identity). In America, the argument (long established in books like Will Herberg's *Protestant, Catholic, Jew* and things like Robert Bellah's Civil Religion [warning the wiki for civil religion is awful; see [this](http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/civilrel.htm) instead]) is that especially during periods of anti-Communism but even before those, it didn't matter *which* religion you were in America, it only mattered that you were one of them (see, the rise of ""Judeo-Christian"" as a term, and kids TV shows in the Cold War saying ""Remember to worship this weekend at a church or synagogue of your choosing"", but even Tocqueville notices this long before the Cold War).  **Basically, American national identity meant being religious, at least in terms of civil religion (even Jefferson had civil religion), without specifying which *kind* of religious and, until the 1980's, ""being religious"" wasn't associated with just one political faction in the U.S.**.  *This is what I think is currently under-emphasized in the literature, and what I try to emphasize when I write on this topic.  It definitely doesn't explain everything, but it's not supposed to because the answers aren't that simple.*

Edit: added bolds and italics for ease of reading.  Rewrote each section to clarify some of the distinctions and make this hopefully more readable, but really, ""secularization"" is one of three or four main areas of the sociology of religion, so this is me trying to synthesize the last 30 or so years of a literature that stretches back beyond the founding of sociology as a discipline.  These are what I'd characterize as the four main perspectives that are still popular (I omitted older ones). Basically, **all the above are part of the answer and there's no ""silver bullet"" the explains the whole difference.**

True,TheJucheisLoose,,,"[The Glossary of Political Economic Terms](http://www.auburn.edu/~johnspm/gloss/sequestration) explains what the sequester actually is, and you can deduce most of what the effect would be from the definition itself. The current sequester is the result of the [Budget Control Act of 2011](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budget_Control_Act_of_2011).

Essentially, the effects of the so-called sequester would almost certainly mandate reduction in spending increases for most (but not all) government programs. Very large/politically popular programs like defense spending and social security likely would not have to see their spending increases cut back, but most other federal government programs and departments would, at the treasury's discretion.

Keep in mind that, for the most part, the sequester is **not** a budget cut. It merely reduces the amount of money the treasury will allow other departments to increase their spending, in line with federal regulations about spending increases. 

The sequester, though both sides have claimed various things about it, is, in the scheme of things, a minor reduction in spending increases to the federal budget. [This graph](http://blog.heritage.org/wp-content/uploads/BL-sequestration-size-comparison.jpg) from the Congressional Budget Office shows the very minor impact of the sequester as a proportion of Federal outlays for the next ten years. As you can see, for the next 2-3 years, the impact is almost imperceptible. Even at its highest, the impact on increases in federal spending continues to be less than 1%. 

[President Obama](http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/02/27/remarks-president-business-council-dinner), and many on the left have predicted dire economic consequences, including as much as a 6-tenths-of-a-percentage-point drop in economic growth this year as a result of the sequester, but this seems unlikely given the minor impact it has and given the federal government's ability to easily raise revenues by inflating the currency. 

In all, the impact of the sequester should be very minor, and most Americans will not feel its effects at all, even most government employees. Some people associated with the defense department or certain other major (or very minor) federal programs may feel a squeeze as they lose the ability to increase their budget somewhat, but keep in mind that no one will take a cut at all. Pretty much everyone will be at least as well off as he was last year. So things should not change much, if at all.

The night he died, mum came and woke me up, sat on the bed and said ""private_pants, daddy's dead"".  I obviously was in shock.

We always had dinner together at 6, homework after school before tv.  She worked so hard to keep life as normal as possible for us.  And this was what helped the most.

A quick rundown on how schools look at your application.  This is a general idea, and obviously there's going to be some variation.  Some schools might have a completely different method, but this is probably relatively standard across the country.

* GPA/MCAT - This is how they decide which applications to take a closer look at.  Schools will have a general standard for how to sort through the thousands of application that they receive.  Some might use a sliding scale (if you have this GPA, you have to have above that on the MCAT), some might have hard standards (above this GPA, above that MCAT).  However, this is the initial screening, and it is really just to try to ensure that you have the intelligence and work ethic to succeed in medical school.

* Extracurriculars - All of that extra crap that you've done in your life.  All of the hoops that you've jumped through.  All of the volunteering, working, etc. that you've done in your life.  Personal statement partially comes in here, as it is where you get to tell your narrative.  Letters of recommendation also matter.  This is where they ask the question ""does this person warrant an interview?""

* You - Who are you as a person?  What can you provide to the medical school besides simply academics?  Are you someone that would benefit the medical school?  Are you a **nice** person?  This comes down to interview, letters of recommendation, and personal statement.

Alright, so from what you've told me, you had a little bit of a detour (proper word choice?  meh, whatever, I'm still in my PJs and under the covers as I type this) while you were in college.  But, unless I'm missing something, you did what a decent human being would do (help out your family), and you still managed to succeed despite some tough circumstances.  That's a positive.

Starting in the upper right is the crystal used by the SoC to generate all it's internal clocking.  The SoC itself has a PoP (Package On Package) memory chip on it so pretty impossible to tell what it is without cutting into it.  There are a bunch of small chips next to the SoC obscured by epoxy but sticking out at one point is what looks to be a level shifter.  Modern SoCs can't tolerate the higher voltages used to signal over a cable so there should be one for every cable interface on the board.  Next to the HDMI connector are an inductor and cap for power conditioning from the cable.  This is to prevent any nasty spikes in voltage when plugging or unplugging a power supplying cable (not ESD related).  The components at the bottom are inductors, FETs, resistors, etc. used in the main switching regulators which power the SoCs core logic and memory.

[Side 2](http://imgur.com/fpdd4zo)
In the upper right, we see the ESD protection chips for the second lightning connector.  Next to that is the main PMIC (Power Management IC) which runs the switching regulators and other voltage supplies for the SoC.  The ??? chip is probably another FET for a switching regulator but without markings it's hard to be sure.  It could also be a companion chip of some kind or another regulator.  The bottom right side looks to be standard linear VRs which would power IO voltages for the SoC and potentially other chips on the board.  The center level shifter appears to be [this part](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/sn74avc2t245.pdf) which Apple has used in the lightning/30 pin adapter board to provide ESD protection and level shifting of the incoming lightning digital signals.  Next to the HDMI receiver we see [this part](http://www.bourns.com/data/global/pdfs/CDDFN10-0524P.pdf) which is a standard high speed ESD protection part.  The lower left of the board is almost entirely backside power decoupling for the SoC and memory.  With digital chips you get very nasty power spikes at each clock edge.  At high frequencies these spikes are too fast for the voltage regulator to respond to so instead the power comes from capacitors placed near the chip.  In this case, a large number of small caps are used in parallel to reduce resistance and maximize the amount of current the SoC can draw during each clock cycle.

There, more than anyone actually wanted to know about this board.  As for why Apple did this it's because HDMI specs require a secure path to prevent copying.  The data coming over the lightning cable is probably encrypted for security and encoded to compress it.  The SoC then decrypts the data, decodes it into raw video data and sends it out over HDMI.  All these additional steps are most likely why it doesn't support full 1080p as that would require even more processing and probably exceed the capabilities of the SoC they used.

Edit: As blitzkrieg3 pointed out this might actually be to make up for bandwidth limitation on the lightning connector.  I had assumed that Apple accounted for 1080p requirements on that link but a bit of googling throws that into doubt.  If this is true then the whole point would be a bandaid which upscales to 1080p.  I wasn't able to find enough details on the lightning link to know 100% either way though.",0,1362253545,,0,1362258888,1,c8oj5iq,t3_19iryu,t1_c8oj5iq,t1_c8ofncb,,1431461387,68,False,technology,t5_2qh16,68

True,J_Kenji_Lopez-Alt,specialty,Professional Food Nerd,"I [just wrote a guide](http://www.seriouseats.com/2013/02/the-serious-eats-guide-to-how-to-buy-caviar.html) on buying and tasting caviar. It's a very basic primer that might answer some questions.

The tl;dr version: go to a trusted seller. If you are beginning, buy cheaper stuff first until you learn what you like in terms of flavor before shelling out for expensive stuff you might hate. More expensive does not always mean better. Try before you buy. Keep it simple when serving. Buy enough that you can really taste it. A bite should be at least a half teaspoon. Any less and you're just wasting it.

There are many different types of caviar from all over the world these days. Iran, Israel, the US and China are some major producers, each with their own flavors, skills, and weaknesses. You have to try a few varieties out before you can figure out what you want. Asking what caviar is good is kind of like asking what wine is good. S long as you have a base level of quality, it's largely a matter of personal taste.

When tasting, roll beads on your tongue and break the on the roof of your mouth. Breathe in and get the aroma. Try and notice different flavors as they spread from your mouth through your nose, through the back of your mouth. Each bite you take, try and identify a different flavor. Great caviars should have around fifteen different identifiable flavors.

Caviar is like cheese. Once you open and taste it, you should consume it pretty quickly. A reputable caviar seller will sell you caviar that has been aged properly. Holding it longer will not improve it. Keep it sealed and eat within a week. Once open, finish it all within a few hours. The difference in texture is noticeable, even after half a day. Opened caviar gets slimy.

Classic way to eat is is blini or potato pancakes or just boiled little potatoes with creme fraiche, and perhaps some chives or chopped red onion. I like to just eat some off a spoon (any material except reducing metal. Plastic, mother of pearl, or wood is fine. Metal can affect flavor). Another great way to eat is on top of very soft scrambled eggs. Extra points if you mix creme fraiche into the scrambled ages during the last few seconds of cooking.",0,1362261626,,0,1362261870,1,c8ola3o,t3_19jgxi,t1_c8ola3o,t3_19jgxi,,1431462479,92,False,AskCulinary,t5_2t82m,92

Burden of proof is all well and good for claims of a repeatable nature. I claim that helium is lighter than argon. Excellent! Let us weigh them. 

When dealing with personalities and events, things don't work that way. 

Prove your grandmother made you cookies for you when you were seven. What? You don't have any pictures or affidavits? UNPOSSIBLE! It never happened! In fact, I am beginning to question whether or not you actually HAVE a grandmother!

Plenty of logically consistent arguments have been put forward for the existence of God, and a good number still stand unrefuted. 

But that doesn't matter, because radical empiricists such as yourself have conveniently selected requirements that are never applied to other historical events, or personalities, and instead to demand the same conventions applied to physics and chemistry be applied to theology. 

This would be like demanding the same requirements for cooking be applied to painting. 

Yet still I continue to hear the endless litany: 'prove it'. 

Prove your mother loves you

Prove the beauty of Antonio Vivaldi's ""The Four Seasons"". 

Prove what Augustus Caesar said to the guards stationed outside his bedchambers on the fifteenth day of his reign. 

So what is left? Logical arguments. 

The Cosmological

The Ontological

The Evidence of Fine Tuning

The Historical Evidence of Jesus's Resurrection

The Moral Argument

And most of these have withstood decades of scrutiny and assault by the anti-theist community.

People like you claim that the non-existence of God is so blatantly obvious that it staggers your mind that people might actually believe He does exist. 

For thousands of years the default position has been that God exists. Now you wish to challenge that.

The burden of proof lies upon you to explain why we should change the default assumption of the majority of mankind with your unsupportable, untestable assumption that flies in the face of eons of human experience, philosophy, and culture. 

Sorry, the burden of proof argument is invalid, has always been, and is only whined about by people like you who fear facing judgment for the lifestyle you have chosen to live.

That's more than twice the population of North America as a whole, now let me ask you, how much total damage in how many arenas does North America do to the earth?

Well, the United States consumes more oil than China, Russia, and India combined. That must be 'fucking shit up for everyone' pretty good. 

Saying China has no moral limit is the same thing as saying the Western or Eastern Hemisphere has no limit to their moral corruption. Do you know how much child prostitution and how many serial killers and horrific raping of the earth happens in a given hemisphere? A lot. Take any third of the world's population and you'll have at least as much bad stuff going on. How much collective bad stuff has happened as a result of people and habits in Europe and North America?

How much slavery and prejudice and oil spills and evil corporations (monsanto, exxon mobil, whatever too many to count) and bullshit politics has come out of those areas collectively since the beginning of time?

The year is 80:209, I have been travelling through space for over 800 years, me and my lonely ship. My mission is to reach the universe next to this one, search for stars, and collect their energy. There were many of us, all tasked with the same mission. I lost contact with the last of them about 200 years ago. Since the beginning we knew some of us would succumb to the despair of being alone in the vast voids of our universe, I didn't expect to outlast them all.

My universe is reaching maximum entropy, and if I don't find the next one to collect the energy of its stars, everything that humanity has accomplished will die, remain innert, forever lost, never to be seen by anyone, or anything, ever again.

I cannot let that happen.

I have thought about suicide myself, of ending this, it seems impossible, it probably is impossible, what if there are no more universes? How long will I keep up with the torture of reason?

Then I think of her, my mother, she is probably waiting for me at home, waiting for her son to come home with good news.

True,TheHeartOfTuxes,,,"I agree with *twisted_spoon*'s comment:
&gt;*You can invest in quality pieces that are meant to be worn in...*

I don't think that getting clothes dirty or rumpled has to mean that you give up on them. There are more alternatives than simply either ""good"" or ""grubby"".

If we look beyond the strategy called *The French Wardrobe* to the French/European mindset itself, the approach is a much more organic and engaged relationship between people and their clothes, possessions, living spaces, and surroundings. Sophistication and enjoyment of culture aren't the privilege of a higher class, they are a relationship with life that can be accessed by everyone.

The American approach is turned around: in America, there's a mindset wherein ""good"" things, including ""good"" clothes, are for special occasions; and when they are used, they make *you* somehow special. Fine wines are partaken of by imperious people in high-flown situations. Fine clothes (whether formal or streetwear) are worn to rise up in status. I'm not saying it's this way across the board, but that there tends to be this disconnect in the American approach. The European approach tends to be more organic. All wines, fine or otherwise, are sampled with interest; and in the wardrobe, texture and color and pattern are explored for their own sake. Flavors and fragrances are available to enjoy at any station of life, not only among the rich or well-bred.

In the European approach, things are meant to be used. There's a sense of comfort in stylistic expression because people are used to it — it's what you do every day and is part of who you are, not something you add from the outside that somehow makes you better.

So it may serve you well to overturn the distinction between dressing up and dressing down, and consider that style unfolds from within you — it comes from the center of who you are, and works with your life as it is. Your work clothes may have to be less expensive because they will get dirty or worn out more quickly; but they don't have to be a lost cause. And on the flip side, your good clothes don't have to be hermetically preserved under glass; they can live a little and begin to take the form of your actual life. A little faded here and there, a bit of fraying at the edges — when you can see someone's life in their clothing, *that* is very interesting. It speaks of character and soul.

The basic elements of style apply to any fashion or level of formality. Awareness of fit, cut, color, contrast, pattern, texture, movement, and design features will always be applicable. For example, you can wear jeans in a bad fit that go poorly with a badly fitting t-shirt, and the colors can make you look sallow, and they can be uncomfortable and impractical to boot... OR you can wear jeans that fit well and that harmonize with a well-fitting t-shirt (or henley?) in a color that makes you look healthy, and they can have a cut and design features that make you comfortable and assist you in your work. Same theme, different application.

The thoughtful approach of the *French Wardrobe* can be extended to include assessment of your lifestyle and work needs, and subsequent planning of purchases. It sounds like you would be using some of the problem-solving skills you use in your job, but applying them to your wardrobe.

The general assessment may involve these kinds of questions:

* What are your needs? What kinds of activities are you engaged in, in and out of work? What existing areas need to be addressed, and what are the areas that you would like to offer more energy to, to help them grow?

* What is your personal style? How do you like to feel and look? How do you like to be? And what parts of yourself do you want to encourage to emerge?

And what you come up with can be addressed in a specific manner with these kinds of questions:

* What kinds of fabrics will be most useful (durable, dirt-shedding, easy to clean, etc.)? What colors work for me and work together? What properties do I require from my clothing (stretch enough to take different postures comfortably, adjust easily to different temperatures, help me feel a certain way, etc.)?

I find that I want to ask you: *Have* you ended up ruining clothes that you work in? How much foundation does that concern have? There's nothing wrong with wearing clothes that show you've actually been living. But if you do in fact destroy your clothes often, it may take some clever adaptation to mitigate that trend. If wearing a tough twill or denim jacket as a buffer over a nicer shirt won't be good enough, then maybe you need to look for the best-fitting overalls you can find. ;)",0,1362267696,,0,1362707621,1,c8omv12,t3_19i2el,t1_c8omv12,t3_19i2el,,1431463214,88,False,malefashionadvice,t5_2r65t,88

##LCS Week 1

9:30 - Airplane noise over text.

9:35 - Chaox - Alright, so we just got in to the studio 20 minutes--30 minutes ago? But we're finally here IN the studio, we're in the chairs we're going to play from, we set up using our keyboards, mouse. Like pretty much we're going to be PLAYING in 40 minutes. And I don't know, everyone's really pumped, we're drinking our red bulls and CLG's right behind, right there. This blue screen, this blue room, I don't even know, but we're blue side and I don't know--just gotta beat them.

10:04 - Phreak (official recap video) - Welcome to week 1 of the League Championship Series. What a better way to kick things off, but a classic rivalry? Team SoloMid vs Counter Logic Gaming. CLG was just too much for TSM to handle winning a 4-0 exchange and taking Baron. CLG would then ACE TSM, forcing a surrender.

10:14 - Rivington (casting) - No, it's going to be CLG, they're just turning this around in an OBLITERATION fight in front of the Baron as all five make it out clean! And that's going to be the surrender vote, CLG 1-0 in the LCS, the very first victory of the day.

10:33
    (in the background you can hear the casters analyzing the match, talking about mechanics)
    - Xpecial - Didn't play that well. I don't like losing.
    - Reginald - IT SUCKS! And we prepared really hard for this match and CLG just played better than us. And we made a lot of mistakes as well.
    - Dyrus - Ok, let's go, let's get ready.

10:51 - Phreak (official recap video) - After starting in the LCS with a loss, would TSM be able to turn around against Vulcun? TSM got off to the right start, TheOddOne picked up first blood with Jarvan.

10:58 - Rivington (casting) - They exhaust Xmithie now, will he be able to get out of this one, they've used quite a bit. Double
turrets behind and they GO for the first blood, it's going to be OddOne picking it up on Xmithie.

11:07 - Phreak - The TSM of old was back and Reginald's Kha'zix lead them to their first win of Season 3.

11:12 - Reginald - So that's day one of the LCS, we lost to CLG and we beat Vulcun. We came--I wouldn't say we came close to beating CLG, but it was a good experience. We knew exactly why we lost, how we lost, and we're not going to let that happen again. Against Vulcun we came in a lot more aggressive and I would say we did a pretty decent job. I underperformed and my teammates were able to pick up the way and I'm really excited to go to other matches because it's only going to improve from this point on. We're going to practice even harder.

11:43 - Phreak (recap) - In their first meeting since PAX, Dignitas was looking to avenge their loss against Team SoloMid in the North American Regional Finals, but things did not start off well for Dignitas and Dyrus secured first blood with help from 
TheOddOne.

11:52 - Dyrus - (teamchat, monotone) We got it, I got it, I got it.

11:55 - Chaox, then everyone (teamchat) - (shouting) TSM!!!

11:57 - Rivington (casting) - And Dyrus picking up first blood!

12:00 - Phreak - TSM would go on to win in dominating fashion, looking like a completely different team from the one that lost their first game in the LCS.

12:08 - Rivington (casting) - The bullet time clearly hitting every member of Dignitas and it completely softens them up for a quick 1-2-3! Dignitas watches as their nexus goes down as Team SoloMid finds another win in the LCS.

12:18 - Xpecial (interview) - So I'm practicing really hard, my team is starting to practice really hard, but we--played pretty well the first week. Like I'm pretty proud of my team even though we went 2-1. We could do better, but still. We did pretty well and I'm looking forward to us improving. I'm looking forward to stomping CLG. I'm looking forward to winning the NA regionals and, even though it's way down the road, I'm really confident in my team and that's a good thing to have. I'm ready to play.

##Dyrus breaks things, news at 11 (SnapDragon plug)

12:42 - Reginald - Dude, take that out. Oh. Uhhh, we're just taking apart this phone right now because we broke it the other 
day. I dropped my phone out of my pocket and then Dyrus stepped on my phone and it broke. So I have to get a new phone and that really sucks, but we're just taking it apart now. We actually want to see where the SnapDragon processor is in the phone. So we're taking it out and it's pretty stuck on, it's been pretty hard for us to take out, but it's right here (shows it to the camera).##Intro to LoL

13:24 - Dyrus - League of Legends is a 5v5 game and it's called a MOBA. Just like in fighting games where you choose different characters, in League of Legends you choose different champions. Playing the game itself, there's 3 lanes and in each lane there's creeps that respawn and I play top lane for TSM.Snapdragon. Top lane is basically the solo toplaner who just farms most of the time and can end up being put in a bad situation, being put 2 on 1, but when you're put 1 on 1, you can really show what you can do.

14:00 - Reginald - My position is middle lane in League of Legends and there's 5 positions and 3 lanes. I play the middle lane and my job is to kill minions, kill my opponents and get stronger. The sole objective in the game is to kill the enemy's base and once you kill the enemy's base you win the game.

14:20 - Dyrus - So here we've got the top lane, the middle lane, these are the two solo lanes. And then we have the bottom lane. Since there's five people you can only have so many people in each lane and the bottom lane is most commonly known as you have one support and one AD.

14:34 - Chaox - I play AD carry for Team SoloMid. I start the game kinda weak, so my team has to help me get stronger, but then I eventually get really, really strong once I get my core items and then I just finish everyone off and do tons and tons of damage.

14:50 - Xpecial - I play support for TSM.Snapdragon. A support would be like a medic in a battlefield. You really wouldn't be the one killing people, but you're the one healing them, giving them moral support, and that's kinda what medics do. And that's what a support is.

15:07 - TheOddOne - So I jungle for my team which is mostly killing critters around the map away from everyone else cause they don't like my company. My other job is to disrupt the enemy lanes 'cause I've got nothing else to do but kill critters, so I might as well just disrupt them as well as make my life miserable.

15:28 - Xpecial - The LCS is the League Championship Series. What it basically is, is that it's similar to baseball or basketball where you have a league. There's eight teams in the league and these 8 teams play against each other a total of 4 times. In each of these 4 times their records are tallied up and the top few teams will meet each other during the playoffs. Very similar to basketball, very similar to baseball. Those teams will compete in championships and their standings in the league will determine their seed going into the championship.

##LCS: Week 2

16:00 - Phreak (recap) - In a rematch of week 1 we had TSM taking on Vulcun.

16:03 - Rivington (casting) - They're going to end it here, he's been playing a whole different game himself in each lane he's in, his friends in a different one as well, but they've now joined in the same one at the Nexus. They've found each other, looks like they're going to take it down, TSM's going to grab the second win of the day.

16:18 - Phreak - Alright, y'know, so we're going to see if Dignitas can come back to make both teams 3-2, but we're into the game, let's get it going with Dignitas on blue and TSM on red.

16:25 - TheOddOne - Dignitas beat us because basically a gank was called middle and it didn't work out because they were expecting it, they had vision of where I was, like, the original plan was to gank top again and kill Singed over and over, until he was basically out of the game, but it didn't happen that way and from that point on in the game, the game was basically one-sided. It ended at 5 minutes and there was not much we could do as we didn't get an advantage anywhere else against a team that could engage on us.

17:00 - Kobe24 - TSM gets murdered and that's going to be the game.

17:02 - Phreak - That is the game, amazing play by Dignitas.

17:07 - Phreak (casting) - TSM are looking for the Nexus!

17:10 - Jatt (casting) - Wow, they just rolled through them in that teamfight. It was the game of attrition and TSM finally cracked the egg at the end of it, here comes the nexus turrets.

17:20 - Phreak (casting) - There we go, TSM putting themselves at 4 - 2 so far. 

17:21 - TheOddOne - We lost to Counter Logic Gaming and we've lost to Dignitas, so we beat them the first week, but then we lost fairly badly the second week too. There'll be many more games, but we want to win them all cause it's sorta bad if you lose. It's never good to lose.

17:37 - Chaox - It's not too exciting, but it's not too bad. Definitely looking, it's an ok start, but we're definitely looking to improve it.

17:46 - Xpecial - A B. If I went to school right now, that'd be a B and my parents would beat me. Because that's what a B is, it means you get beat. So, we're going to do better. We want A's.

17:57

    - Dyrus - My team did it. 
    - Reginald (in the background): Oh my god.
    - Dyrus - See, look at that. I put trust in my team. My judgment is--my judgment is beautiful. My perfect, beautiful judgment.

First there is an [SRSMeta thread](http://np.reddit.com/r/SRSMeta/comments/19g5cv/i_think_some_ridiculous_person_is_going_around_in/) saying that random people are giving SRSers gold. I know I've seen multiple instances of SRSers being given gold out of spite, which I don't think really makes sense. I wonder how much gold I can rack up and I leave an obviously baiting comment in this thread:

Notice that the comment isn't really edited. It gets gold within a half-hour and then the parent comment later gets gold too. I leave a baiting child comment that is unsuccessful. Then there is [an SRSsucks post](http://np.reddit.com/r/SRSsucks/comments/19gk7n/tell_me_more_about_your_brilliant_plan/) about my comment, flaunting that I was, in fact, able to receive gold. In this thread, I leave [a strawSRSer comment](http://np.reddit.com/r/SRSsucks/comments/19gk7n/tell_me_more_about_your_brilliant_plan/c8o7u2m) rebuking people for giving me gold, and I'm given gold again. I leave [a child comment](http://np.reddit.com/r/SRSsucks/comments/19gk7n/tell_me_more_about_your_brilliant_plan/c8odbhi?context=1) bragging that I've maxed out the gold I can receive, and it goes on to get ~~3~~ 8 golds. There is then a seperate [SRSsucks post](http://np.reddit.com/r/SRSsucks/comments/19jd7z/srster_threatens_mod_complaint_if_anyone_dares/) made about these comments. This is the first thread where people suggest I'm trolling. I leave [an angry comment](http://np.reddit.com/r/SRSsucks/comments/19jd7z/srster_threatens_mod_complaint_if_anyone_dares/c8onnl1) that receives gold.  StymieGray informs me that they have ""bought a years worth of credits just for this"". My reply receives gold. Then an SRSsucker [sends me a year](http://imgur.com/ifRg5Eq) of gold, bringing my total to 1 year and 7 months.

True,Ozed,,,"I've had a go at your second problem because I didn't quite like the bellow responses. If there is one thing I know about microcontrollers is that you should avoid division (and hence modulus) like the plague as they are very slow. Now since I don't know your external memory address, I've used a dummy value:


	const char * const P1 = (char *)0x80;
	int * const ExtMem = (int *)0x8BADF00D;
	const int Numbers[10] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 };

	int main()
	{
		for (int ExtIndex = 0, IntIndex = *P1 ^ (char)1; IntIndex &lt; 10; IntIndex += 2)
		{
			ExtMem[ExtIndex++] = Numbers[IntIndex];
		}
	}

I've used some fancy operations to set ""IntIndex"", I've used eXclusive OR (xor) between the value at P1 and 1. An xor compares the bits two values (of the same size) and if only one of the values has a 1 in certain bit position, the output has a 1 in that position otherwise it has a 0. So if the value at P1 has a 1, IntIndex will have 0 and visa versa, NOTE: if P1 is something else then the result is messy, you should make note that the program operation is undefined for any P1 outside of 0 and 1 (if you are going to copy this code).

It might seem a little strange to have the ++ inside the array operator, but as it is after the value it is a post-increment, meaning once the line of code is complete, it can then increment the value. This is a common way of compacting code.

Now if you were allowed to dynamically create your even or odd numbers, only a few changes would be needed, here is how I would do it:

	const char * const P1 = (char *)0x80;
	int * const ExtMem = (int *)0x8BADF00D;

	int main()
	{
		for (int index = 0, value = 1 + *P1 ^ 1; value &lt;= 10; value += 2)
		{
			ExtMem[index++] = value;
		}
	}

I suggest you do a lot of reading about coding, look at plenty of examples. If your lecturer hasn't given you a textbook to read, I learnt from (yes I'm self taught) C++ How to program by Paul Deitel &amp; Harvey Deitel, which was quite good, but it is a C++ book not a C book!

True,over30virgin,,,"Ok, I'll chime in here.  On this account I post exclusively on http://www.reddit.com/r/foreveralone , but I came across this on my main username and I feel more then qualified to answer.  Here we go.... 

Sex is everywhere.  Everyone is talking about it, ALL THE TIME.  At first being a virgin doesn't bother you.  You think to yourself, ""I'm young it'll happen eventually"", but then for some people (me) it doesn't.  You hear all your friends talking about their sexual exploits.  You hear about girls you are friends with talking about that guy they had a one night stand with.  Your confidence is shrinking by the day and it's humiliating that you've never done this like a ""normal"" person.  You then hear about your friends little sister or brother who is 10 years younger then you who is having sex on a regular basis.  It's at this point where it's beyond humiliating and it's become a sick joke.  I feel like these people who are half my age have passed into adulthood and I'm still a 30 year old child.  By not not having sex that's exactly what it feels like.  You feel like a child, you never truly feel like an adult.  Sex is like a rite of passage into adulthood and it's a journey I've never taken.  

This is sort of what of it feels like.  Imagine there is an amazing party going on.  Your parents are invited to the party, all of your friends are invited to the party, people half your age are invited to the party, everyone is invited to the party, but you.  The next day everyone is talking about how great the party was.  Everyone has their own tale to tell, but you.  People then start asking why you didn't go to the party.  You get comments like ""you didn't go to the party? Holy shit you don't know what you are missing out on""  People ridicule you for not going to the party, people look down on you for it.  Eventually to fit in you start lying about going to the party.  You don't feel good about lying, but at least nobody ridicules you anymore.  

OP you said in your post ""Not having had sex does not make you less of a person"", but that's exactly what it feels like.  You feel like less of a person, you feel inadequate because you've failed at this for so long.  You've never truly known what it's like to be close to someone and you feel less human because of it.

True,herebewagons,,,"So first, right now you have three separate elements (title, author, image) which are all sitting off in their own spaces being safe and boring. This cover is trying to hook the reader in, and it needs to be more interesting, I would start by doing the following:

* Make the image bigger, and don't necessarily have it perfectly centered.
* Have it bleed off the edges of the page. You don't need the very edge of the wing or (especially) the bottom of the tractor trailer it's carrying to understand what the image is.
* Overlap the elements. The author text can go over any parts of the truck that aren't the cab and it will work fine.

So that's where I'd start playing. Other stuff:

* The text needs to be perfectly aligned on both sides. That means that you can draw a line up each side, and the very edge of every letter will hit it. That's not the case right now.
* Similarly, the margins on the left/right edges absolutely have to be identical.
* I suspect your margins on the edges are far too small. You have plenty of space. Make 'em a bit bigger.
* You're designing a book cover, which is going to go on a book (unless this is an ebook-only cover). Print it out, and put it on a book, and it will be much easier to see what proportions are wrong/strange.
* Speaking of that, book covers have a spine and a back and on hardcovers inside flaps too! Don't forget those, and consider how an element that bleeds off the cover might, say, show up on the spine or on the inside flap.
* The type is boring, and I think too spaced out for how big it is. Play with the kerning.
* The background is really boring. This may not be an issue depending on what you do with the other elements, but right now it is.

True,kerovon,med,Grad Student|Biomedical Engineering|Regenerative Medicine,"I decided I should go through and read/summarize the paper, seeing as I have access to it and it is interesting. Disclaimer: please note that while I do mostly understand a lot of what they did here, I am an undergrad, and this is not my exact field of study. As such, I will probably oversimplify some things in here, and get some other things completely wrong. If you spot a mistake, please let me know so I can correct it.

Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) is a protein that acts on neurons in the brain.  One of its major known roles is regulation of energy balance in the hypothalamus of the brain. One of the cells that can produce it are haematopoietic cells located in bone marrow. It is also known that some type of hematopoietic cells can head to brain tissues.  This brings up the question of whether or not the haematopoietic that go to the brain are also ones that produce BDNF, and if so, does this BDNF aid in regulating appetite. 

The first step is to confirm that haematopoietic cells go to the hypothalamus.  They took a group of normal mice, and at 8 weeks old, irradiated them to kill off their bone marrow, and transplanted bone marrow from another group of transgenic green fluorescent protein(GFP)  mine (the mice produce a protein that fluoresces green).  8 weeks later, they looked at various parts of the brain to see if any GFP positive cells were located in it.  If they were present, that would confirm that cells migrated from the bone marrow to the brain.  They did find GFP+ cells in the hypothalamus, with most of them in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), which regulates satetity.  They also noticed that if the mice had fasted for ~16-24 hours before being checked, they had an increased number of GFP+ cells in the nucleus.  

Now that they know that cells migrate to the brain, the next step was to figure out what the GFP+ cells were doing. They looked at the hypothalamus under a microscope, and found the GFP+ cells had dendrites that contacted paraventricular nucleus cells ( [Shown here, with GFP cells in green, PVN cells in blue.]( http://i.imgur.com/fyT0wiQ.png) ).  

They now know that hematopoietic cells migrate to the brain, and contact  neurons in the region that regulates appetite.  The next step is to find out if the cells from the bone marrow can perform the role of normal BDNF producing cells in the brain.  To test this, they got a bunch of mice that were genetically engineered to not produce much BDNF.  These mice have higher intake of food and water, and become obese.  They took a group of them, irradiated them, and performed a bone marrow transplant from mice that produce BDNF normally.  The mice that received transplants from BDNF normal mice had their food and water intake significantly decrease to more normal levels, and their weight went down.  

So, to summarize the results of this experiment:

* BDNF producing Haematopoietic cells from bone marrow migrate to the brain

* These cells localize in the areas most associated with appetite regulation

* In BDNF deficient mice, healthy haematopoietic cells can provide better appetite regulation.

So,  some answers to things that I expect will come up.  No, this will not produce a cure in the next week/month/year for obesity.  It may never produce a direct cure for obesity.  No, not all obesity is due to deficient  haematopoietic cells, don't try to get a bone marrow transplant to fix that unless a (qualified) doctor tells you (which will almost certainly not happen in the next decade.  If they confirm this is happening in humans, which will take another 5 years at least, it would then have to go through clinical trials for safety, which probably adds another 5-10 years at the soonest onto this timescale).

TL;DR: Cells originating in bone marrow can migrate to the brain and secrete proteins that can help regulate appetite (maybe, in mice).  More research necessary.",0,1362284965,,0,1362285455,1,c8ordu1,t3_19jnvc,t1_c8ordu1,t3_19jnvc,,1431465365,159,False,science,t5_mouw,159
True,Jason_Metzger,,,"Do you really want to know why? 

I'm drunk right now, so I'll lay some heavy duty personal truth on you, as painful as it is for me. And this is just my own sad little view of the way things are here, so take it with a fistful of salt, anecdotal evidence amounting to nothing and all that.

I've been working a shit job for the last 4 months. I was lucky to get it because I have friends that are selling their bodies to afford food for their kids, whereas I get $12/hour for 20 hours a week (my boss says they're always room for advancement, but they just let a ton of people go because our stock didn't meet forecasts). I fill out about 20 applications a week (LastPass FTW!) but for now I basically help rich people hide their money by processing certain claims for a financial services giant. Previously, my job was in Mumbai, but they moved it back recently do to ""labor problems"". During that time I've paid about $500 for health insurance that doesn't cover hardly anything, but because I have a pre-existing condition no other health insurance company will touch me. I even had to go off the medication that was keeping me sane because it was too expensive, so now I just try really hard not to scream most nights and my days are riddled with near crippling anxiety (which is why I drink). I can't get access to any type of welfare because I make $13,000/year, which, in my state, is apparently too much. Doesn't matter that I had to move back in with my parents (I'm 27). Doesn't matter that I drive a shitty 30 year old car because there aren't any mass transit within 10 miles of where I work. Doesn't matter that my student loans are killing me (and before the engineers and CS majors jump down my throat telling me I shouldn't have majored in underwater basket weaving, I have a goddamn MBA, but nobody gives  a shit because I don't have the 5 years experience required for an entry level position). 

Each and every day, I feel more and more fucked. My best friend buried his kid in November because he couldn't afford the treatments to get his white blood cell count down low enough to allow for a transplant, even though he had several good matches in his short life (but Dick Cheney gets a new fucking heart). Other of my friends are fucking their way out of massive student loans on SugarDaddies.com. So, you know why I don't care? 

I plan on leaving. I don't want any of this. I don't want to live in a place where ""anyone can make it rich!"" means ""X"" many people have to fucking die, go into massive debt, or sell their souls just to get by. The american dream has become a nightmare. I don't want to live in a place where the elderly, those who we are supposed to venerate, out-source their critical thinking skills to Rush Limbaugh and Bill O'Reilly and Glenn Beck, and every time I ask them why socialized medicine is okay for them but not for me I'm called a fascists communist, whatever the fuck that means. 

I plan on leaving soon. I saved up enough for a passport and I'm plotting my defection, because I broke the two cardinal rules of new america: Don't be poor and don't get sick. 

And worst of all there is no fixing any of this. We have a two party system because our electoral system is winner takes all/first past the post/Single Member District, and the two far right parties are cutting up whats left. The average Senate seat now costs $9,000,000 and the average voter has an 8th grade reading level. That's not a co-incidence. 

God, I went and made myself depressed again. Nothings going to change here, and I can honestly say that I've tried: I've voted, written my representatives, tried to educate people, all in order to get mocked as a dirty socialist. The best I can hope for is a better life somewhere else. Let those who want to ""Go Galt,"" come here in fucking droves. Mark my words, this will all end in tears.

You could go up to the lookout on the mountain, but don't go if it has been raining, and DO NOT GO BEYOND the lookout. The rental 4*4's in all but the most experienced hands in the best conditions, are not up for many of the dirt roads.

Robb Stark seeks to repeal Stanniscare. Stanniscare has cut down crime by 34%.

Robb Stark is a notorious flip flopper, changing policy as per his convenience, breaking alliances with the Freys, letting his criminal mother walk free. His running mate Theon Greyjoy is also a known liar. There is no more honorable man than Stannis Baratheon.

Stark's campaign claims that Stannis unjustly removed the first joints off his loyal servant's fingers for piracy, but Robb Stark himself publicly set his wild direwolf upon one of his own principal bannermen because of a disagreement. The animal bit two fingers off.

Stark's campaign claims Stannis allows women to give birth to demon shadow babies. This is true. Because Stannis Baratheon believes in a woman's right to choose what to do with her body.

Stark himself owns almost half of Westeros, but money can not be allowed to win the Seven Kingdoms. Westeros needs a true King, who cares about the people, who would become King not because he wants to, but because he knows he must.

True,PenPenGuin,,,"I see lots of people pointing you to Shuns and that's fine, 'cause Shuns are damn fine pieces of hardware - and they also have the added benefit of impressing almost anyone when you flash them around. The same can be said for Global - when you see someone using a Global knife, you know instantly ""That's a Global"".  They have a very specific aesthetic look, and they're pretty darn awesome functionally-wise.

The commonality with both of the above brands is that they're Japanese. Japanese kitchen knives have a reputation of being incredibly sharp, mostly because their edges are ground to a much more acute angle than Western style knives. Japanese knives are generally also much harder, so they have a better edge retention (time between sharpening) than Westerns. That does come at a price though - Japanese knives are more brittle and prone to chipping if you're not careful. This also means that you won't be using these knives to do any heavy chopping - whether through bone, ice, or hard veggies (yes, there will be people who say they've done this successfully, but even the manufacturers do not recommend it). That being said, Japanese knives are probably the closest thing to a mandolin slicer in knife form. Thin, delicate, intricate cuts?  These blades will have you covered.

I'm going to say this and probably get a lot of flack from the knife snobs, but there is nothing wrong with a good Henckel (not the Target-versions, but the 4 star and above - the ones stamped with the linked (Zwilling) figures). Henckel is a Western (German) brand who have been making knives for centuries. There's also nothing wrong with other brands like Wusthof and even Calphalon. The Western knives come with a much ""fatter"" edge than their Japanese counterparts, made with a softer metal - but they take a beating. Grab a 10"" Chef's knife and you can hack through frozen king crab, chicken bones, and all sorts of hard squash. 

I'm also going to say that there's absolutely nothing wrong with a $40 Victorinox Fibrox either. They come with a wicked sharp blade out of the box, one of the grippiest handles in the knife world, and it's so cheap, you can abuse the hell out of it and not feel self-conscious. Not only that, but if you've got large hands, you'll really love it - many of the Japanese knives have really thin handles that large-handed people say they have a tough time getting a grip on. Not a problem with the Victorinox Fibrox line.

All of the above knives are stainless, not carbon (or high-carbon, whatever you want to call it). Carbon blades are easier to sharpen and stay sharper longer, but honestly, don't do it. They're a pain in the butt to take care of, and even most Asian chefs don't bother with them anymore. They require oiling and proper storage to keep rust away and they may also impart a metallic taste if you're doing a lot of work on acidic ingredients (like tomatoes). 

Don't fall for one of those bogus 10 piece sets - a three-piece set consisting of a 8"" to 10"" Chef's knife, a 3""-4"" paring knife, and a serrated (bread) knife will take care of 95% of your needs. A Santoku would help round out that set, and if you like showmanship, a nice slicer is never a bad addition. 

If you're looking at spending $200 *per knife*, more than likely whatever you find will be a great blade. The best knife you can buy is the knife that feels the best to your hand. Go brave the outside world and find a snooty mall. It should have either a Sur La Table or a Williams Sonoma. Both of these locations carry high end cutlery that you can physically handle - and I'm pretty sure their staff works on commission so they'll be more than happy to help you play with all the sharp pointy things.",0,1362302433,,0,False,1,c8ouvjd,t3_19k613,t1_c8ouvjd,t3_19k613,,1431467108,5,False,knives,t5_2qzyn,5

True,XxionxX,,,"Having a house in the suburbs which generates no income or food is a manufactured idea. It is manufactured to make wage slaves. You are ***not*** middle class if you own one of these money pits and you don't have **at least** several million in money generating assets. You are getting paid by your masters to pay for your: car(s), house, medical bills, food, incidentals, taxes, children's education, and inflation. Oh,  and you get to keep the rest. Btw I hope you have enough stashed away to pay off [your debt](http://www.usdebtclock.org/). Yes, you owe figure in the bottom, the one which says 'Liability per Taxpayer'. Will our money inflate out of control into another depression? I don't know, but I am not going to stand around and find out.

The people who were sold these purported investments were swindled. They were swindled right out of their happiness, health, and money generating skills. Now all they have is a building which is under a mountain of debt. It might as well be a pile of dirt, wood, and stone. Oh wait, it is. These poor souls are dependent on the infrastructure around them to continue functioning. They are not free, they ***think*** they are free. They think they are free because there are no chains on their feet or bars on their windows.

Astonishingly enough they are held with nothing more than a promise. This promise is shown to them on every TV, in every magazine ad, and in every supermarket. It is the American dream of a house in the suburbs and a college degree which has been sold to untold millions. Everyone knows how the housing bubble turned out for so many of these families.

Who is to blame? Don't ask me, I don't deal in conspiracies. I just deal in things which force people to think and evaluate what they know. These are simple things which could be taught to children in a single lesson. A single class could change the lives of 30 people. But not just 30 people, because every person they came into contact with could potentially share their knowledge. We cut funding to our schools every year and increase class sizes saying that it is cost effective.

The status quo will not change because we live in a sea of passivity, nothing matters because there are no problems knocking at *our* doors. Everything is an ocean away and there is no need to get upset because everything will be alright in the end. Be happy that you get to watch your movies and play your video games. Beer and cigarettes are just a stop on the way home. If you don't like your life just escape into something when you come home. Facing reality is tough.

I suggest to anyone who is reading this that they seriously consider if their current lives are making them happy. We are an isolated, depressed, and enslaved people. Don't believe me? You don't have to. Just think about what I am saying as you live your daily life. Try it, I implore you. Think about the the ranch I am going to buy and the life I wish to lead. Think about how you might like to fish, program, read, do your favorite hobby, or stand in the sun. Is a ranch really all that bad? Compare it with your current life. If you think it is something you might want to do, check out [Open Source Ecology](http://opensourceecology.org/). They will free your soul, real freedom is so close. Don't let them take it from you.

I am sure a lot of you have heard this before but it bears repeating,

&gt;A child was given a sheet of paper and he was told to write what he wanted to be on it. He wrote that he wanted to be 'happy'. The teacher told him he did not understand the assignment. The child told the teacher he did not understand life.

Are you happy? Truly? What would you be happiest doing? Hint: It's not a yacht, helicopter, hookers, and blow. Money does not bring happiness.

Every day we have a choice, what are you going to do with your day? If it is not the thing you wish to do, then why in the fuck are you doing it? *You are going to die*. If you have some shit you want to do you better hurry the fuck up.

The world is happening to you. Do you want your control back? You are going to have to fight for it, and it will be uncomfortable and difficult at the very least. Do you think all of your forefathers who fought for their freedom got to sit on their couches? You come from a long line of awesomely savage creatures and your lineage stretches back to the dawn of life on earth. Fucking act like it.

I understand they mean well, but to create a economic revolution is far harder than releasing documents. What we need is an [economic bill of rights](http://www.fdrheritage.org/bill_of_rights.htm). It would be need to be updated to really get around all the issue we have today. In my opinion we need something more like this, of course more eloquently put and with someone who knows this a lot better than me. 

An equitable and effective voice is the heart of our democracy, and the key the pursuit of life, liberty and foremost utility.  No voice should be silenced through the taking of life or property. No voice should be restrained, so as to be hidden. No voice should be twisted and forgotten in light of hopeless toil of survival.  We breach the contract that gives our nation legitimacy when we have not given our citizens their natural rights; to not go hungry, to go without shelter, to go without the tools to care for themselves, and to lack the time and means to foster utility. 
Our Nation’s strength is in hearts, minds, and democratic virtues. In no time sense the Great Depression has the American people had such an egregious loss of utility. This utility is what feeds our hearts, minds and virtues, and strengthens our sovereign body.  In so much the prosperity of our Nation is concerned, so stands the need to protect these rights. In protecting these rights we not only hope to foster justice, but the greatness of each citizen and thus the United States of America.
Democracy is the highest calling for a nation. The democratic virtues of effective participation, equality, full disclosure of relevant information, enlightened understanding, control over the agenda, and inclusiveness; should never be corrupted and distorted by the economic system.  Monetary pursuits should progress the welfare of the sovereign will of the people with respect to governing and participation in society.  
To starve one American of resources he or she needs to become a full function member of our democratic process is to starve the nation of its full potential. The strength of our nation is not in material wealth, but in we the People.  Property does not vest rights, but rights vest property. 

Inalienable Monetary Rights:

The security of life: in sustenance, shelter, and health. 
-	We the people, every one of us, should not fear the uncertainty of fulfilling nourishment. A nation that allows starvation, only starves itself. 
-	None should be without the right to affordable shelter. 
-	We the people have an obligation to our self to maintain the mental and physical health of our people. To let one of us suffer when we have the power to alleviate this pain is a harsh cruelty we wage upon ourselves.  We strive for greatness not cruelty. 
-	No citizen should be taxed on income generated to perpetuate to the basic needs of his or her life, or the life of his or her children. 
The security to liberty: from chains of monetary repression. 
-	None should spend their life in a preponderance of debt to another, with unreasonable terms. 
-	Effective participation in the political state of government should not be discouraged through monetary leverage. 
-	Free speech is not to be bought. 
-	Law is not to be bought through the tyranny of the majority of funds. 
-	Money should not write law. 
-	The freedom of information and education that fosters an enlightened populous.
-	No tax should burden those least able to pay more so then those that can do so with ease. Regressive taxation is an affront to the equity of a society. 
The freedom in the  pursuit of  utility, and the happiness of personal autonomy. 
-	None should have to spend an extensive portion of their life and time to sustain a basic level of utility.
-	None should have to deal with unfair market pressures from monopolies, or governmental pressures that are not meant to limit harm or sustain the government.  
-	Every business man and consumer deserves a market that is free of manipulative, deceptive, and malicious practices. 
-	Every citizen has the right to an efficient government that does that studies, audits, and changes its practices to best align itself with the goals of the people to have a strong and ethical economy. 
-	The market should not fear hostile forces the government has the duty to protect it from interests that do not have the interests of the people in mind. 
-	A market that cultivates a richness of opportunity and choice should be accessible to all the citizens of this nation. 
-	Every citizen has the right to sustainable markets, that have the legal, physical, and energy infrastructural support them. 
-	None should have exorbitant fees and criminal penalties that are un-proportional to the crime, levied against them. 
-	Information should not be monetarily unobtainable due to institutional circumstance of birth or social class.

True,DashingLeech,,,"That is not a rational argument though. Under that argument, what fact about the food is acceptable to not include? Do we need to label any food that was ever handled by a homosexual? Somebody somewhere might want to know that. Was a Muslim involved in growing, preparing, or packaging any of it? Well then, ""patriots"" against supporting terrorism will be up in arms. Better label it.

What matters is that ingredients describe the contents, that they comply with health regulations, and the nutritional information is available. What bizarre, unsupportable beliefs people have about foods and their handling is not something to be entertained. 

If you do want to entertain such beliefs it onus is for niche producers to advertise it themselves. If you want kosher food, the solution is for kosher producers to advertise their products as kosher, and for followers to set up their own certification process. It's not up to everybody else to label their food as ""not kosher"" or to pay to have kosher labeling certified as accurate.

Same with GMO. Unless somebody can actually demonstrate that GMO is harmful, it's a belief of faith/paranoia. If somebody wants to indulge it, the correct way to do it is via having ""no-GMO"" producers voluntarily advertise and label their food as such for that niche and for followers of that belief to pay for their own certification process. Collectively we support health regulations based on scientifically demonstrable evidence, not whims of belief systems.

The failure to list horsemeat is one of inaccuracy in the ingredients list. That is an entirely different issue.

So that ""simple"" argument is seriously flawed. Not all information about food is equal. You can't just insert any form of information into the disclosure statement and call them analogous.

True,mejogid,cnty-uk,London,"No, it's not misleading that it's named that way. It's called the European Convention of Human Rights because it sets down a series of minimal requirements that European states have agreed to be necessary for a fair and democratic society.

You can of course go above and beyond those duties, but there are exceedingly few legitimate reasons to violate any article of the ECHR. Even the whole prisoner voting rights fiasco is nothing like as bad as the press made out: the state *can* deny prisoners the right to vote, but it must justify doing this based on the specifics of that prisoner - rather than purely because they're in prison.

&gt; I would appreciate some sort of list of what ECHR has actually done to benefit the average UK citizen.

Here are some of the rights infringements that the ECHR has prevented in the UK, copy and pasted from a previous comment I wrote:-

* Requiring that when somebody is killed by the state there must be a proper independent investigation, and that armed personnel should be trained properly (McCann et al v UK)
* Preventing the government informing paramilitaries they know will kill someone of that individual's location, to execute by proxy (Shaghan v UK)
* You can't put an ethnic individual in a cell with a racist offender and take bets on how long he'll last (he died) (R on the application of Amin v SSHD)
* It led to safeguards and legal standards for wiretapping (Malone v UK)
* You can't ""interrogate"" prisoners by forcing them into certain positions or depriving them of light and sound (Ireland v UK)
* The legalisation of homosexuality in Northern Ireland (Dudgeon v UK)
* Stopping contempt of court from infringing on freedom of the press (Sunday Times v UK)
* The mentally ill who voluntarily commit themselves to an institution are owed the same duty - suicide watch etc - as those who are sectioned (Rabone v Pennine Care)
* Ensuring that existing prisoners still get access to solicitors (Golder v UK)
* Ensuring that workers maintain rights to join trade unions (Wilson v UK)
* Giving the police an obligation to act if somebody is being dangerously stalked (Osman v UK)

True,louhern56,,,"There are several ways to play a rasgueado triplet.  Definitely practice whatever finger combination your teacher has you working on.  But keep in mind that for any finger stroke combination to be efficient, when the last stroke is completed, your hand should be in position to execute the first.

Counting, ""One-trip-let"" would throw me off (sounds like a gallop rhythm).  The last 2 syllables end abruptly on a hard consonant, while the 1st (""one"") has a bit of sustain.  I prefer a word like ""hominy"", ""Emily"" or ""seventy"", or think of another.  You can feel the difference as they flow from your mouth as you pronounce a string of them out-loud: ""Ho-mi-ny-Ho-mi-ny-Ho-mi-ny-Ho-mi-ny-"" vs ""One-trip-let-One-trip-let-One-trip-let-One-trip-let-""


""Computing"" triplets began making sense to me when I started thinking of it like this:

     Beat               1          2          3          4          
     1/4 note           one        two        three      four   
     1/8 note triplet   ""70""       ""70""       ""70""       ""70""  
                        (one finger per syllable in each pronounced number or word)
     
     Beat               1     &amp;     2     &amp;     3     &amp;     4     &amp;     
     1/8  note          one   and   two   and   three and   four  and 
     1/16 note triplet  ""70""  ""70""  ""70""  ""70""  ""70""  ""70""  ""70""  ""70""

On a completely separate note, a lot of women get this impression that it is ok for them to mentally and physically abuse a guy and get away with it. But as *soon* as a guy has enough, stands up for himself and goes to hit her in the face she's all 'you can't hit me, I'm a girl'. Where is the logic in that?!

If I hit a guy in the face for no reason then I hope to fuck he hits me back. The whole 'I don't hit women thing' is sexist as hell, it frustrates me when I see some random bitch smack a guy for a pathetic reason and he just stands there and takes it. **If a women demands equality then it goes BOTH ways, not when she feels like being a spoilt bitch.**

Same rule applies to kids, if some little unrespectful chav if hits me more than 3 times I'm not sitting down and taking it I'm at least gonna attempt to fight for myself. Although in England we get arrested for hitting kids even in good reason, it would totally be worth doing a 6 month sentence just to teach a chav brat violence isn't how life works.

True,Zeroeh,,,"Everyone who has posted so far is correct but incorrect on what really needs to be learned.

Programming isn't just syntax and compilers, it's a whole logical thought process that shares the same process of building a home. You must have a great foundation of what computing is, how pieces work and how to really think abstractly.

Programming is great because there is never the ""best"" solution to a problem, Yeah you can get that algorithm down to O(1) but you always strive to do it better, faster, larger scale then before even if before was the best.

Programming teaches you how to think differently. It teaches you to think abstractly and more of the how does this work, and the big why does it work this way. Your total thought process becomes a puzzle that you are constantly trying to solve.

Programming also teaches you patience, Programming is one of the most stressful and aggravating things you can ever do. Some people try it once and think what the fuck! I can't do this! then give up. Others will excel at the theories behind computer science but during implementation time, they become overwhelmed and let their code ""run-away"" from them. (Run-away means you lose the complete picture of what you are trying to create and solve)

Example:  yeah you need to create that round-robin scheduling algorithm? Okay what is that? You look it up and say okay cool easy to do, a less experienced programmer will Google what it is, then try to implement it, normally they will not end up getting the problem the 1st compile, that's okay! we are suppose to do incremental testing anyway! They try to see what the error or unexpected output is.  Yeah, you can figure out where you're missing that } or ;, but what happens when your program gives you 5 instead of the 3 you were looking for? 

Most unskilled programmers become frustrated, start doubting yourself then you just become flushed and become scouring google for more examples until you just try to copy and paste code into your program. This is your code getting away from you, you now have no clue what is what, where is this method? This is where most programmers give up, they can't figure it out. 

A skilled and experienced programmer knows how to let there mind run free, they don't let problems and code run-away from them. They understand the complete picture and knows the what and how of a FIFO Queue, Stack, Binary Tree, Linked List. How arrays work, what datatypes are best, what looping structures are better.

This is something that comes with experience, not one day of googling and understanding that. 


Everyone can become a ""programmer"". Syntax and algorithms will come with time, but patience and your thirst for success must be something you stride for.

True,[deleted],,,"As for this criticism and dialogue, I must address it as a Buddhist; there seems to be lots of confusion about what Buddhism is really about, and articles like these reflect that.

Buddhism is not an organised religion. I am a Buddhist, and I operate completely alone, as an individual. Nobody tells me what to believe, I disagree with the Dalai Lama frequently. (In fact, my friend that works for a publishing company is going to help me meet him so I can discuss my disagreements with him.)

Buddhism can be simplified to twelve statements:

Life is suffering.
The origin of suffering is craving.
Suffering can end.
Suffering can be ended through the eightfold path:

You must have a right mindset.
You must intend to be mindful.
You must do no harm in speech, to yourself or others.
You must do no harm in action, to yourself or others.
You must do no harm in profession, to yourself or others.
You must persist in developing a kind and useful mind.
You must think and act mindfully and deliberately.
You must concentrate, so as to hone your mindfulness.

Things like yoga are ancillary to this belief, and war is antithetical.

In the same way jihad causes masses to misunderstand Muslims as being part of a violent religion, Buddhist's wrongdoings cause misunderstandings of the Dharma. As for justice, Buddhism promotes justice through Right Action, Right Speech, and Right Livelihood. You have all the freedom in the world to determine if you are doing the least possible harm by carrying out justice. Buddhism has no dogma in this respect.

My most potent argument against this article is that it is clear that the author has not meditated before. He did not approach this topic with an open mind, but rather one that had formulated an opinion before he allowed himself to explore, freely and as many have as children. He denied his own curiosities with his beliefs and predispositions.

I encourage anyone who does not recognize the potency of my argument to try meditating for two weeks, with no expectations about its effect on the mind. (Including, you cannot expect to have no effects. You must keep a completely open mind.)

EDIT: I encourage anyone with criticisms or the desire to discuss what I've said here to voice their opinion. I don't gain from speaking about my beliefs, but listening to those of others.",0,1362332205,,0,1362334338,1,c8ozewh,t3_19kw3t,t1_c8ozewh,t3_19kw3t,,1431469208,45,False,TrueAtheism,t5_2soy6,45

True,alucard_3501,,,"Prepare for wall of text.  About 9 years ago,about a week after i graduated high school, my mother had been teaching one of my friends how to drive our ATV.  They had driven the 2 mile dirt road that our house was on already and had decided to drive down to the river about 2 more miles away.  On their return drive, the girl my mother was teaching lost control of the ATV.  My mother didn't bail out in time and ended up riding it headfirst into a tree.

My brother and I found out about this about an hour later.  I started calling my mom's family informing them of what happened, as well as my father.  He had graduated Nursing school about a week before this happened.  He started calling the hospital she had been flown to and got details.  We drove up to see her that night.

Her injuries were quite catastrophic.  She had a depressed skull fracture on the front of her skull and several more bones had broken throughout her head.  My brother, my dad's girlfriend (Mom and Dad had been divorced for about a year), and I sat in the waiting room while Dad when in to talk to the nurses.  Things didn't look good.  We were told to go in and say goodbye.  Odds were good she would be gone by the time we came back the next morning.

That was a long sleepless night.  Before all this had happened, she was the elementary PE teacher at my school so she was in great physical condition.  I think that, combined with the amazing care given by the doctors and nurses is what held her together.  she stayed in that first hospital about two weeks, then was flown up to a larger hospital in St. Louis, MO. Most of that summer is one long blur now, but I distinctly remember walking into her room in St. Louis one day and hearing her boyfriend say ""Look who's here to see you.""

Seeing her turn her head to see me and say my name was finally the moment I knew she would be okay.  It's been a long road of recovery, and she will never be 100% who she was before, but she is doing fantastic now.

True,Joywalking,,,"I have this theory that relationships are like computer operating systems, metaphorically speaking.  (Bear with me a bit, here.)  

On the one hand, you've got Mac relationships (think very traditional relationships).  They just look so simple, so well-designed.  Doing things in them seems almost intuitive.  But not everything you want to do can be done in a Mac environment, and trying to do something that Apple doesn't want you to do or to do something in a way that isn't the Apple way can be very frustrating or outright impossible.

On the other hand, you've got Linux-like relationships (think good poly).  Many people are simply astounded by what you can manage to do in this environment, but nothing is easy here.  Even seemingly simple take-for-granted things can require some hacking and work.  

Most people muddle along in the middle, in a Windows-like way in the middle of these two extremes.  And I find that after a breakup, those that felt their old relationship was too restrictive gravitate toward something more Linux-like and those who felt that the old relationship had too many broken boundaries gravitate toward something more Mac-like.  

Thing is, BOTH of these extreme environments, whether we're talking computers or relationships, don't really work in a vacuum.  They seem to require a user-support community, a network of people who have struggled with the same problems and might help you find a solution or at least commisserate over the issues.  Being the only Mac person in an all Linux group is no easier than being the only Linux person in an all Mac environment -- in both cases, when you complain about a perfectly reasonable problem, you'll be told that it's only a problem because you've been doing it wrong from the ground up and you just have to change your whole way of being.  

Which is my very long-winded way of agreeing with OP.

Put your ideas down on paper. Do not tell people your ideas, just write. Whether you begin with an outline, begin with backstory and exposition, or just launch right into your story, it really doesn't matter.

Reading books isn't writing. Reading websites about writing isn't writing. You can play it off like you're doing ""research"" or something, but what you're doing, in reality, is avoiding the work of writing. If you want to write, open a word processor (whatever word processor you want, there is no single **best** word processor) and start writing.

If you have already started writing and you're looking to fill the space between writing sessions, read whatever books you want by authors whose styles you find appealing. Read the info posts you find here, in /r/writing, or in any of the other writing subs. /r/WritingHub is a good place to find these. Look for websites by authors you like. The thing to remember is that doing all of this is decidedly **not** writing, so you can't do all of this, not write, and say you're writing.

Good luck.

If they weren't cute, we'd probably all wring their little necks. Raising a puppy is **hard**. It's a full year of accidents, chewed stuff, intense, time consuming training, bites and scratches, coming home to let it out several times a day, waking up in the middle of the night. It is chaos and your whole life revolves around it as if it were a human baby. Go check out [r/dogtraining](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogtraining) and [r/puppy101](http://www.reddit.com/r/puppy101) and see how many people are frustrated to the point of tearing their hair out at **normal** puppy problems. 

As a former dog trainer, I've seen **so many** people bring home a little fluff ball having no idea what they are getting into. I'm not saying never get a puppy, but if its your first dog or you have a busy life you can't rearrange around a puppy, it isn't the best idea. Adult dogs are just as cuddly, just as cute, and you love them just as much. I have one of each, a dog I got as a puppy and one I got at 5 yrs. old. I don't miss the puppy one's puppy years **at all** and I don't regret having never seen the older one's. It's kinda like Louis C.K. says about his kids, you would die for them, you love them, but for parts of that first year, your life sucks.

True,virtigo21125,,,"Potatoes have always been a sign of general sustainability and welfare. Never anything fancy, but enough to keep you satisfied with a meal. Consider the phrase ""bread and potatoes."" You could say that potatoes are the ""moderates"", or even the middle class. They're just average foods with an average taste quality with very little specialty to them.

Now Jack and Jill is an old nursery rhyme that depicts two people of either nobility or wealth- presumed by the crown placed about Jack's head- making a climb up a hill to attain a sample of water; the great equalizer. No matter what your status is, water is a necessary commodity for everybody; rich or poor. 

The potatoes, or the average folk, find themselves in a position where they meet the wealthy at some great equalizer of life. What do they do when given this opportunity? 

*Rumble rumble*

The author purposely chose a violent word to depict the action of the common against the wealthy. *The potatoes squash them, squish, and stole the crown.* 
Once put on an even playing ground, the common folk with resort to any means to take the power away from the mighty. This also fits in with the themeing of equalization. The potatoes are taking the wealth and power from the rich, and are now keeping it for themselves. 

However, these potatoes are not fit to wear a crown. Not because of their status, but because they are potatoes. The crown was fitted for a human head (Perhaps alluding to the head-knowledge necessary for influential social prowess) which keeps the potatoes from having any tangible gain from the crown itself.

So what do they do instead?

*""[they] sold it at a pawn shop but only got 50 bucks.""*

The pawn shop is a symbol of the outcome. The endgame of this shift in power shows no real gain for the potatoes. In the end they profited a little, but compared to the true worth of the crown, they were given nothing. Despite the worth of the possession they offered to the shop of reality, the outcome of their treacherous acts ended in a severe lack of the worth of power. When attaining power becomes a matter of brute strength, it loses all of its value. This point was represented by the colossal  monetary devaluation of the crown.

What her (Or his) student was trying to imply was actually an anti-revolutionary sentiment. He (or she) was alluding to the points that all of humanity is equal to some degree, but power is placed where it ought to be. When the common rise up to take power from it's rightful place, they can only wear it in cosmetic fashion. The actual value of power becomes belittled, and even those who gained anything only gained a little.

True,yourfriendlane,poppy,,"I've played from Bronze V all the way up to Silver IV, and the players in the lower ranks of Bronze can be so bad that I think it literally breaks the Elo system(or ranking system now I guess, though I assume matchmaking still works more or less on Elo). Elo was designed to match chess players of equal skill, but that far down it seems like trying to play chess with people who don't know what half the pieces do and a toddler knocking things off the board every few minutes. 

I'm not a Gold or Plat-level player, so I can't singlehandedly carry a team that doesn't work together, and I don't really fancy myself ""stuck in Elo Hell,"" but I do know that I'm better than most of the people I play with in the lower half of Bronze.  I say this confidently and without any ego-inflation, because players down there literally don't even understand the fundamentals of the game. Things I see on a regular basis:

* ""X OR AFK"" in at least every other game. I know this happens at every level, buy there's a direct correlation between rank and frequency.

* Pretty much any time anyone actually offers to support, be afraid. Usually this means they plan to play Master Yi and try to outfarm you. The only saving grace is that they're usually so bad at last-hitting that you can snipe most of their CS from them, but it still basically turns bot lane into a 3v1.

* Alternatively, they will spend all their time trying to 1v2 the other guys. Either you have to give up any hope of farming and try to help them, or focus on farming and just let them feed and then listening to them yell at you for not ""helping.""

* Level 1 brush fights. Yes, the exact same ones you did the first week you started playing the game.

* Oh my god, the verbal abuse. Apparently nobody in Bronze III or lower ever has any fun playing this game. Probably a third of games down there are decided by which team starts yelling at each other first.

* People cannot farm. At all. The most fundamental of fundamentals, and nobody can do it. 90% of games I play, I have twice the farm of anyone else.

* People who have no clue how to itemize. Half the ADCs rush a Phantom Dancer, sometimes two before even thinking about buying damage items. And if I saw an ADC in Bronze IV or V with a Last Whisper I think I'd have a heart attack. Of course, since they're such bad farmers, they usually can't afford one anyway.

* championselect.net. The worst thing to ever happen to Bronze. There is always at least one person with it open in the background, convincing people to pick champs they have no idea how to play. Despite obsessing over counters, they can't begin to explain why X might counter Y.

* Going back every two minutes. Ace the other team? Better go back. Just get Dragon? Better go spend that 190g instead of knocking bot turret down. 

* Likewise, the opposite is also true. Dragon wide open? Sorry, all five of them are top, better run up and fight them for no reason.

* Map? What map? Why didn't you call MIA even though you were shopping at base? Reported.

This is turning into a giant rant, haha. But the lower you go, the more you might as well just flip a coin to decide a winner. One great player can't carry a team that has no concept of how the game works.

e: Oh, and one other thing, lest this start sounding like a one-man circlejerk: I regularly encounter individual players who I consider as skilled as, if not more skilled than myself. If two players like that end up on one team, it's usually a 20-minute surrender. The fact that these people are so much better than their teammates is incredibly self-evident; they'll have the most farm, most kills, and least deaths. They'll be the ones pinging objectives, protecting their teammates from their stupid decisions, and buying 90% of the wards that end up on the map. The difference is night and day, but if they're a five and their teammates are all ones, they'll still lose to a team of threes 99% of the time.

Furthermore, you want to make sure that if you change some code—either by refactoring it or adding new features—doesn't break. At the very least, you probably want to make sure it doesn't outright crash.

How many times have you made a change to your PHP and refreshed the page to make sure it still loaded correctly? What if you made a change to a function or class used by several parts of your site. Likely you had to refresh every page that could be affected.

Writing tests means you can automate this process, so that instead of reloading 10 different pages to make sure everything still works, you run one script which verifies these things for you.

**As a verification of completed features, for clients—or, as specifications.** Clients want a set of features developed. There is a (not so recent but re-popularized trend) in software development called behaviour-driven development (or story-driven development), in which you begin by defining the features (also called stories) your software should provide when it is complete. You define tests that specify the correct behaviour *first*, and then you start writing the software to pass those tests.

Your tests become not only a method to ensure that your application works correctly, but also as a *specification* showing *what* your application can do. This has become (arguably) the most common view of tests—not as ""tests"" per se, but as [*specs*](http://rspec.info/).

**As a method of programming.** Related to the above, there is an incredibly powerful programming methodology called [test-driven development (TDD)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development). Here, the tests don't simply verify that what you've written works. Instead, they are an integral part of the programming process.

In the TDD process, you begin writing a program/class/module by writing a test for it first, before you have a single line of application code. You run the failing (Red) tests, then write the simplest code you can to make the tests pass (become Green). You repeat this process, adding tests for more functionality, until your application is complete.

This may sound silly or time-consuming, but many people (myself included) consider it to be an essential programming technique. A (the?) rule of TDD is that when your tests are green, you can only do one of two things: (1) refactor your existing code without changing behaviour, or (2) add a failing test. In particular, you are *not* allowed to add new a new feature or functionality without writing a failing test for it first.

By writing tests first, you get to think first about how your classes should *behave*, rather than how they should be implemented. People who learn TDD often are surprised by how the resulting code often ""writes itself"" after its tests are written.",0,1362358148,,0,False,1,c8p7c80,t3_19ljf5,t1_c8p7c80,t1_c8p6su0,,1431473058,18,False,rails,t5_2qhjn,18

True,SynapticSight,,,"So people responded a little incorrectly, and I'm probably beyond the upvote wave so this'll likely get lost, but eh, for your info Blue, and because I was bored, here's a long ass description of HIV and how it can be treated:

The idea behind HIV is that it possesses a specific and rather nasty mechanism to infect your helper T cells, which are among the cells your body uses to fight infection (they're also the reason you get poison ivy rashes).

The mechanism is this: a protein on the virus called GP120 recognizes CD4, a marker on helper T cells (the different cells in your body present specific markers on their surface so your body's cells can talk to each other). Once the two proteins recognize each other, GP120 structurally changes and instead attaches to a receptor on the T cell called CCR5 (a receptor that recognizes chemokines, or chemicals in your body used for communication). Once GP120 links up with CCR5, GP120 moves aside and makes way for GP41, which is a very hydrophobic string of amino acids and thus wants to dig its way into a membrane (which is also hydrophobic). So, it digs into the T cell's membrane and boom, the virus is connected with the T cell, and the virus can then replicate in that T cell.

The virus replicates by using reverse transcriptase, a molecule that converts RNA into DNA, and integrase, a molecule that integrates DNA into a genome. The idea is that the HIV virus has some RNA in its capsid that then gets converted into DNA in the host, and then integrated into the host's genome (using those two molecules). Once it's in the genome, it's *impossible* to tell what DNA is viral and what's host. That's why HIV can't easily be ""cured"" in any real sense; it's always there, latent or not, sitting in your helper T cells. This is why HIV is a ""retrovirus.""

But it's even worse than that! Your helper T cells respond to a specific cytokine called interleukin 2 (IL-2), which your body releases during infection. This cytokine, when a helper T cell recognizes it, causes an activation cascade of gene expression in its nucleus (activating the helper T cell). The nasty thing is that the HIV DNA in that helper cell's genome *also activates from IL-2 stimulation.* So, whenever you get an infection, you make more HIV. And since helper T cells are active during infection (that's why they react to IL-2), that means that more HIV produced during a time when your body is upregulating its helper T cells causes more T cells to get infected by HIV! Very nasty.


So, how can you cure it?

1. Prevent that initial infection of the CD4+ cell. This has been actively published this once, but given that HIV medication (anti-retrovirals) are given prophylactically and reduce your chance of getting HIV by 73%, this has likely happened before, it just wasn't documented.

2. Kill all T cells of the host. This is rather awful, because it means you have to essentially purge all lymph nodes, thymus, and circulating system of its T cells, and then replace them, without killing the host. And you're not entirely sure whether you've gotten rid of all virus. So the best thing to do is not only destroy the host's T cells, but also introduce new T cells that are immune to HIV. Remember CCR5? A small population of people has a mutation in this receptor so that it either doesn't bind anything or isn't there. That means that HIV cannot infect the T cell, so the immune compromise  that otherwise happens when your body's T cells are destroyed by HIV doesn't happen.

3. Treatment can suppress the virus for a long time, but treatment itself cannot cure virus because, as you saw above, the mechanism means the virus can go latent (like herpes, which sits in your trigeminal ganglion and every now and then gets activated and travels down the nerve to get to your lips and give you a nice big cold sore).

Hope that wasn't too much info, although it probably was.

True,karlmoebius,,,"Caution: Wall o' text

For me it was because I kept asking myself what was wrong with me? Not only was I a virgin, but I hadn't had any dates, or really anyone I'd want to date. I had sexual fantasies, but no woman really grabbed my attention. So, I'm in my late twenties, alone, never had a date, virgin, I hear people talk about their sexual relations, I read that people on death row get *marriage* proposals, and here I am, working at walmart, starting to go to community college, and... what kept running through my head was, 'what was wrong with me?'. Add to this, I'm a tall, and large person, and I live in Oklahoma.

Now, in case you've never been here, let me explain what the 'norm' is for relationships, and women (in general) in Oklahoma. Honestly, if you don't have kids and been divorced by your mid twenties, you're outside the norm. It is normal for two people to be dating for almost two years when people start to pointedly question why you aren't married and settled down now. So, if you aren't that, you are outside of the norms, and people honestly react *differently* to people outside the norm.

Large and tall has it's own disadvantages. Since there's a very... um... thing that gets beaten into the minds of women here in addition to all the other memes that are pushed onto women (I shit you not, when a little girl said she wanted gi joe dolls for her birthday, her mom flipped her shit and almost screamed at her that little girls get barbies dolls only), so when I'm just walking around, not even paying attention around me, people shy away. Men and women. Women tend to cringe when they're alone. Okay, fine. It used to rip me apart, now I just giggle at it. So, that wasn't helping my self esteem either.

I'm a big guy. I'm overweight, but I carry it well, and mostly I don't care. I'm trying to lose weight now because I want to lose weight, and I physically feel better the more I lose (I feel like I have less inertia, honestly), so the implicit fat shaming that goes on doesn't help either.

Now, that being said, I wanted sex. I wanted a relationship. I wanted all the things I hear about over and over and over from too many people. I was the cow that looked past the fence and saw the lushest, greenest grass. I was a tired, starving traveler knowing that salvation is just over the hill, and if I just keep walking I'll get there... but I never do.

You are always the odd man out. It's like being in a party filled with sports fanatics all talking about teams and rosters and the last game, and you intellectually know what the sport is, and how you play it, and you've watched a game or two, but you're not a fanatic, and you don't know how to talk to them. Do you talk and reveal your innocence? Lie and just go along with it? Or just smile and nod a lot and let the others do the talking? 

The first one, you get sympathy. Lots and lots of sympathy. You're patted on the head, you're given 'that look', you are 'that person', you start to hear the same words from so many different mouths over and over again. You feel like a cripple and you're pitied. Over. And. Over. And. Over. Worse of all are the women (or men) who will happily say, 'if I wasn't &lt;in a committed relationship and/or something else&gt; I'd date you in a heartbeat.' You can only hear that so many times before it too starts to affect you.

The second, lying can backfire. I don't recommend it.

The third, nodding and smiling allows you to avoid both paths.  You're not pitied, and you don't have to lie. You become the person people come to to talk about their problems. If you're a slime, you take advantage of it, if you're actually a friend you sympathize and help in the little that you can. Now you're trying to help someone that has a problem that you've never experienced before. It would be like someone telling you what's wrong with their car, and being less of a car person than my mom. So you make the appropriate noises at the appropriate times, and you begin to be known for your maturity and wisdom.

This... all of this for long enough can warp a person. Really deep down things metastasized, and *things* start to go wrong in your brain, if they aren't already. I blamed myself. I constantly wondered what was wrong with me that was right with everyone else. Was there something that I was doing? Saying? Wearing? Being? Something that I didn't know about that I did or did not do that everyone else did or did not do? 

Was I going to be alone forever?

That's the scary question. Forever. Like this. Some Quasimodo hobbling through life, horribly aware of the wound. That something that everyone else in the whole fucking world had. So many goddamn songs, movies, books, a whole day about it! Friends getting married and having kids, friends going out on dates, breaking up, cuddling on the couch and watching movies, and there you are... the guy at the bar with a drink in your hand looking around and hurting inside like a bag of broken glass wondering what's wrong with you. What are you doing wrong that everyone else is doing right. Hell, even that guy (or girl), and you know who I'm talking about, the one you wish you didn't want to know, is in the same circle of friends but you don't want to be around him, even he's getting laid. Over. And over. And over again.

After a while I threw up my hands and said to hell with it, I'm giving up. I was 26, and 30 is running like a freight train at me, there was nothing. Absolutely nothing. Then the first woman showed up. Now, the other thing that most people don't think about is that if you haven't had dates, like I did, all that shit you went through in high school and grade school dating, all the scars... I didn't have. So, I was desperate, and lonely, and a woman, a WOMAN!! showed me some attention in that way. *For the first time in my entire fucking life*. Salvation was at hand, I wasn't going to be alone forever!

She was damaged. I was being her sounding board, she came onto me. I... I was desperate, and alone and I did a stupid thing and after a bit of cajoling on her part over several weeks, snapped. And that's when the relationship started. She was needy, I was needy... We were needy together. I look back on it now and it's obvious what was going to happen, how it had to end. And it did. And I was totally surprised at the time.

I read a quote once, ""Maybe the purpose of your life is only to serve as a warning to others"" and there are times... especially when I think of my love life.

So, I hope that helped.

True,hrhtyh,,,"Your science here is flawed because of the definition of pedophila when referencing humans as opposed to animals.  In animals pedophilia refers to an individual trying to mate with a member of the same species which is not sexually mature and capable of breeding.  In humans however, pedophiles are any individual who is attracted to someone who is under the age of 18 when in fact sexual maturity often occurs at the age of 13 or even younger.  Historically marriage and reproduction in the human species was normal at this age, and it is only modern society which has labeled it as being wrong.  If you were to redefine human pedophilia as being attracted to individuals who have not yet reached sexual maturity you would find that the number would be much lower, although certainly not absent.

What nicotron was saying about the treatment of pedophilia was not so much about the act but the mental state of mind.  They agreed that sex with a minor cannot be consensual and because of that acting on urges cannot be allowed.  However there is a vast difference in treatment for these individuals compared to other sexual preferences.  The modern view of homosexuality is that it is not a choice and that it is not a disease to be ""fixed"" or something to be punished for.  Also if an individual belives they are more closely associated with the opposite sex it should be acceptable for them to adopt that gender and alter themselves to fit in it.  Pedophiles however are treated as being ""sick"" and are punished both socially and judicially even if they never directly hurt a minor.  To say a homosexual needs help to change is politically inaccurate, but to say a pedophile needs it is widely supported.  I kind of do not like to mention stuff like this at this time where homosexual rights are still being fought for as it provides ""ammunition"" for anti-gay groups to use to gain support, but the reality is that there is an unethical discrimintation against pedophiles.  This debate is much more complicated because of the issues of consent and our need to protect our children, which are completely legitimate concerns, but in the future once our current issues of sexuality are settled hopefully this will be worked out to make a system where individuals are not punished for desires they did not choose to have so long as they do not hurt anyone.",0,1362367684,,0,False,1,c8pabfx,t3_19l893,t1_c8pabfx,t1_c8p5l9d,,1431474553,19,False,atheism,t5_2qh2p,19

True,Winston_Legthigh,,,"Ok... I'm about to pour my heart and soul out to you guys. Getting better from my depression and social anxiety took a combination of things, and it definitely was not an easy process.

I've lost count of the amount of therapists I've been to in the past 8 years, but I finally found one that was just perfect for me. She literally saved my life, as I was extremely suicidal during a few of the years I was depressed. I was forced to spend a night in the hospital because I was threatening to kill myself. I used to smile at the thought of suicide because it was my way out. It was my way to finally be able to get rid of the horrible emotions I had. I actually still meet with my therapist occasionally, and in our last meeting I worked up the courage to tell her that she saved my life. She means so much to me, I owe her everything I have now. If you're thinking about getting a therapist, it may take a while to find the right one, but they're out there, I promise.

Medication, and taking it regularly I think has really helped. I can't stress this enough because I used to not believe that medication actually worked. I used to skip days, sometimes I even went a week or more without taking them. I also just hated taking them. I felt like if it did work, it was just artificial happiness. Would I truly be happy? Once I started taking them every day I feel like they really helped. I'm currently on 4 different anti-depressants. That by itself is pretty depressing, but I think they're working.

The last thing, and this might be the most important, is this realization that I had. Life is way too short to care what other people are thinking about you. I am not going to be held back by other people's opinions of me anymore. I do not want to look back on my one chance on life and regret everything in it. And trust me, there's already plenty of stuff I will regret for the rest of my life. We're all going to be dead in 100+ years anyway, so why should I give a shit if I make a fool of myself in a minor social interaction. I used to be terrified of social interaction because I hated things being awkward and embarrassing. Those used to be my two least favorite emotions. But, I realized, who gives a shit if you said something awkward at a party? So what if you made of fool of yourself in front of some people? So what if somebody doesn't like you? No matter what, not everybody you meet is going to like you, it's just a matter of different personalities. I used to want to be perfect. I wanted everyone to like me, so I was terrified to make a mistake. So, I would either stay quiet in groups, or avoid the situation all together. For a while I just faked being confident. When people reacted positively to that, I slowly became truly confident in myself. Just be the best you that you can be, and treat others how you would want to be treated and I guarantee you there will be people who want to be around you.

I know this philosophy on life probably won't work for everybody. It took me a while for me to truly believe it. But, if you think that's a really stupid way to think about things, then find a philosophy on life that works for you. 

Well... this is the longest thing I've ever written on reddit, but it's about an important subject. I never thought I was going to get better. That's why I wanted to kill myself. I just couldn't take the loneliness, anxiety, and sadness anymore. But, if you take certain steps to make yourself feel better such as finding something you truly enjoy doing, finding a therapist, and taking medication then I promise you that you can get over it. It's hard, and I put myself in a lot of uncomfortable situations, but it all paid off. I have some really great friends, I have a girlfriend for the first time in 23 years, and I'm really excited to start training for this new job. It's incredible... Sometimes I still get depressed, I have bad days, but never like I did before.

I don't know how serious of a situation you're in, but this is for anybody who is struggling with severe depression/social anxiety. Life is incredible now, and I'm so glad I didn't kill myself. Sorry... this was some heavy shit, but I needed to write it out for myself more than anybody else. I've only started feeling truly happy very recently, so it's all still really fresh. Well that's it... feel free to ask me anymore questions. I just want to be proof that things can get better, but only if you work for it.

TL;DR: Just fucking read it if you're seriously depressed and/or suffer from social anxiety.

Edit: I thought this day would never come. Thanks for the reddit gold, you really didn't need to do that.  Now I just need to figure out what I'm supposed to do with it.

Edit #2: Holy shit I didn't expect this to get so much of a response.

I'd argue that the job of a skeptic is to be skeptical, not to say something is impossible because you don't think it is possible. Sure, we have no knowledge of people being reincarnated, and no understanding of any possible mechanism behind it, we also have a very limited range of ""evidence"" to suggest that it's possible, so I'd say it'd be improbable that reincarnation or something of the like exists, but you can't really say it doesn't.

The reality is that this is a curiosity, one that I feel is worth people looking at (if they so choose), beyond that no facts are established.

True,[deleted],,,"First, try to cut back, but don't beat yourself up when you drink or pop a pill or smoke. Identify the trigger--a certain feeling, a state of mind, boredom, stress, having to perform a task--that precedes your drug or alcohol use. Just observe. Identify the pattern. Say you last only last a day. Just notice what you're feeling or doing when you break your ""fast."" That's your *cue*.

Then, next time you feel that cue, pick something to do instead of taking the drink/popping the pill/hitting the bowl. It can be something as simple as going for a walk or a drive. Call a friend. Or even go to an NA or AA meeting. What you're doing is replacing the *routine* you've developed in response to your cue.

The tough part is the *reward*. Right now you've got a cycle going: *cue*--&gt;*routine*--&gt;*reward.* Whatever your cue is, you've developed a routine that, at some level, works for you, and your brain considers it a reward. Now, the reward might seem to be ""being drunk/high/etc."" But chances are being drunk or high is just one way of achieving the true reward, which might actually be ""getting to sleep"" or ""getting through this dull task"" or ""putting off this task without feeling bad about it"" or simply ""I want to feel different."" It could be any one of a number of things, and it may take some time to identify what the actual reward is.

But while you're working on that, the important thing is to disrupt the cue--&gt;routine--&gt;reward cycle by replacing the routine you've developed in response to your cue. Get inventive with it. From a neurological perspective, at this point in the process it doesn't matter what new routine you adopt, you just want to replace the old harmful routine with something different. Brains love novelty, and it's the best way to initiate change. Chances are you'll get a better handle on your actual reward once you've started disrupting your routine.

In my experience, physical activity is the best thing to break the cycle. When I had to break my alcohol cycle, I identified my cue (boredom coupled with anxiety about not performing tasks I knew I should be doing) and replaced my routine (going to get a bottle of vodka) with walking to the gym and lifting for 20 minutes, then walking back. The reward was that 1) my boredom was alleviated because I was out of my familiar environment and doing something different, and 2) my anxiety diminished because even though I wasn't doing what I ""should"" have been doing, I was taking care of myself.

The changes can be small, and it might take awhile. When I started out, I would turn right instead of left when I left my apartment to go to the liquor store, forcing myself to walk farther to get my bottle. But some nights I just went for the long walk, never got to the store, and went to bed sober.

To sum up: identify your cue. Disrupt your routine. Get your reward.

Finally--and most importantly--have compassion for yourself. Changing your habit mind isn't easy, and you'll fail a lot, at first. Be kind to yourself when you do.

Good luck!",0,1362382485,,0,1362460229,1,c8pe8s9,t3_19mfkn,t1_c8pe8s9,t3_19mfkn,,1431476411,64,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,64

True,newerthannewtoreddit,,,"I too have suffered from the anxiety, panic attacks, depression on Sunday nights. I could sit here and say I've solved it, but I'd look like a giant jackass for posting late Sunday night. I've just recently gone back to school so I don't have the same pressure but suffer from the Sunday night blues. I did have a time when I was cured.

Lets rewind to Friday. You're so happy the week is over. You go out Friday night for dinner and drinks. Get home late and pass out. Wake up at noon and eat breakfast. Clean your home, watch tv, hit the gym. Then it's time to put your dancing shoes on. You play your weekend party mix while you get ready. Your night out/date go into the wee hours of the morning. If you're old, you PTFO before midnight. Whatever. You wake up at noon on Sunday and feel like shit, so you sit on your ass. By 6 pm you're ready to take care of business but the sun is going down. Suddenly you're Will Smith in I am Legend freaking out about the zombie apocalypse. You can't sleep so you're tired as fuck on Monday and for some reason you can't make up the lost hours of sleep. Your week is fucked. Repeat next Friday until long weekend. 

Not sure if that is you, but that was me. It sounds simple and easy, but going to sleep at roughly the same time every day or waking up at roughly the same time helps so so much. When sleeping in is 7 am on the weekends, and you get so much done or everything necessary in the day, it feels good to relax at night and prepare for he week. 


Seriously though... Sunday nights used to make me so depressed until I woke up early and did lots of stuff. Sleeping early is great. OTC sleep aids are sometimes helpful too.

Regardless of whether your Alice (ah, it's been a while since I've met a tulpa named Alice!) is a tulpa or not, she seems to be a thought-form in the same general category as what we call tulpas - a mental companion. I think some here might class her as a ""servitor"", given she's never surprised you or grabbed your attention unexpectedly. Any mental companion can developed further using tulpa techniques, increasing ease of communication, visualization, and personality development. It's worth noting that not all of us get head pressures, and ""parrotnoia"" (paranoia of parroting) is often rife, even in long-term tulpa hosts. Try asking her some open-ended questions, spend some time with her (communicating by writing or otherwise) and see how it goes. Best of luck.

The way I usually do this sort of thing is create a new layer and use the clone tool to start cloning the available headboard area (ensure the source options include all layers below) onto the ""new"" headboard area. Then add a mask and start softening/masking out edges as required.

The pillow looks ok from a zoomed out view on a mobile. You may need to play with lighting &amp;amp; size a bit to make it look like it fits. Maybe slightly larger &amp;amp; a tiny bit of perspective distort on the right hand side. Maybe try burning behind the new pillow to add some shadow.

You want a nice sharp edge on the pillow - use the pen tool.

高𣘺 渉 and 高𣘺 保基 seem to be his kids or close relatives of young age, so one of these two may still be alive now.

True,cunnilingusthrow,,,"oh dear god. there's that first initial gasp when suddenly someone's tongue makes contact with you. it's a little cold at first, in a wet and exciting way. kind of like putting something minty on your skin. tongues, used well, are much more refined instruments than fingers. they can either cover more surface area or become pointed and extremely localized. this is how i prefer to start -- go extremely slow, hover between my legs so i can feel you breathing and maybe you kiss my thighs. very occasionally you flick your tongue over my vulva and i will yelp. i myself would like it if at first you left my clit alone -- she's too sensitive for immediate onslaught. play around for a while. this part feels crazy amazing; if i'm aroused i'm already feeling a throbbing inside me but every time you suddenly lick me it's like all that interior feeling leaps to the surface and is crystalized in a bolt of warm juicy lightning. 

the best part of this early stage is that i don't know what's going to happen next. you should try and surprise me. take a long pause, give me one lick, pause again, then three short licks in succession. i am all tensed up at this point, completely focused on the next moment your tongue will make contact, and feeling the desire to spread my thighs far apart to make room for all the need you are building up in me.

then you should really get down to business, as while i love the teasing stage i can't take it for too long. (you'll know because i'll make some frustrated vocal noises and i'll be arching my pelvis towards you.) here is where you should start exploring ""in the groove,"" as i call it. try long slow licking motions that start at my vaginal opening and go all the way up to, but don't QUITE make contact with, my clit. then vary the length of the lick, the speed, and the shape of your tongue -- try pointy, then big and wide. in this stage my body relaxes; it's sort of like getting the most hyperbolically good massage of your life, and you can't believe how awesome it feels so you just sort of melt into it. 

then you start working my clit and this is where i go bonkers. try licking up to it -- stroke your tongue repeatedly from about half an inch below it right up onto it. my vaginal walls are tensing like crazy at this point, and i am rotating my pelvis towards you because i can barely stand it but i need more. i don't even have the words for this part -- it feels absurdly wet and sparkly, though the sensation is still happening on the surface at this point.

if you're doing your job well, at some point during this stage i will start to feel a strong, bodily premonition: i am going to come. i visualize this shift as a change in WHERE the sensation is coming from: while before it was all in the little external sphere of the clit itself, at this point the clitoris's roots well inside me have suddenly gone warm and tense. (look this up ---- the clit is misunderstood, it isn't just a little button but a really large interior structure.) they are grabbing all the muscles in my pelvis and squeezing. i begin to feel intentionality at this point: before i was just enjoying how absurdly good this feels, but now i am on a mission. i am going to orgasm my brains out. for me, coming strongly involves my pelvic muscles, so you'll notice where i'm at because you'll feel me contracting under you. i am probably also shifting my legs around at this point.

now, you can keep me on the verge for a long long time -- but whatever you do, don't return to the teasing stage at this point. focus on the groove as a path to my clit. when you do something in particular that increases that ""i am going to come"" sensation in me, that's when i'm most likely to exclaim ""YES"" or ""FUCK"" or ""JESUS"" or just ""WHARBARBALFGBLE."" keep doing that thing. 

there will come a point where everything in my body knows that we are going to come IMMEDIATELY if the right sensations keep happening. for me, this is the only time when you should focus entirely on my clit. you will know because i am clenching everything in my body. everything you do on the surface is sending warm, contracting depth charges of pleasure into my pelvis. i lose my ability to feel really subtle sensations at this point: i want you to pick a repetitive motion and DIG IN. you might have to try a few different ones but it will work.

the part just before i actually come is the best fucking part. oh jesus. i am on a giant cliff-edge of more pleasure than i thought was possible and suddenly, all those clenched muscles relax for just a few seconds. everything is silence and slow motion and i feel a big, round, room-filling sensation of OH.

True,JerikTelorian,,,"Form complete.

Since it's a pilot study, I have a suggestion for you: your questions look like they are trying to take the form of a Likert scale, but have missed the mark a bit. For example, one question asked about how social/outgoing one it, and the responses were:

* very outgoing
* outgoing
* somewhat outgoing
* neutral
* not outgoing
* not outgoing at all
* I don't know.

Your responses are worded a bit more heavily to the ""Outgoing"" side, as there are three options there, and you'll probably see some bias in the response. You could rearrange them a bit to give you a more balanced presentation by making the not outgoing side read:

* somewhat shy/introverted
* shy
* very shy

True,MonkeyWrench3232,michigan,Michigan Wolverines,"I've tweaked my template yet again and decided to take on a huge project. I made one wallpaper for every university instead of my customary two due to the sheer amount of teams.

Primary logos were used for the most part and the background tint was chosen based on what I felt looked the best. It was hard to choose with a few universities but I put a lot of thought into it. I used the universities' graphics identity guides to help make these decisions. While my focus was on Football Bowl Subdivision universities, I used logos and colors that are suitable for all sports fans of each university.

I also increased the guide used to size the logos from 1200 x 1200 to 1500 x 1200 so those logos that aren't very vertical in stature are bigger.

The universities are listed in alphabetical order based on full names. Therefore, you will find universities such as UAB under Alabama-Birmingham and UTEP under Texas El-Paso.

To download the full resolution, hover over the selected wallpaper, click the gear in the upper-right corner and select ""Download full resolution.""

Thanks to [ColorWerx](http://colorwerx.us/research/CollegeColorsNicknames/CollegeColorsNicknames.htm) for providing university colors.

Disclaimer: I made these wallpapers first and foremost as a creative and therapeutic outlet. Here are few items that I would like to ask all of you. Please do not:

* Request different logos, teams or color schemes. If I fulfill one request this would make me feel obligated to make them all and that can get overwhelming very easily.
* Request logos by themselves. If you are looking for logos, [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org) and [Chris Creamer's Sports Logo Page](http://www.sportslogos.net) are excellent resources.
* Request my templates. It took me a lot of time, trial and error to get them into states where I find them satisfactory. I hope you understand.

What might be hard to understand is the regular expression. See [this page](http://www.regular-expressions.info/reference.html) for more info.

    curl -s WEBPAGE

Get the source code for WEBPAGE

    awk '/([0-9]+)v([0-9]+)|(Games)(.*\|.*)(Wins)/'

Use awk to cath what you want from the output. The regexp says: 

find (any digit one or more times)v(any digit one or more times)OR(Games)(Anything zero or more times|Anything zero or more times)(Wins)

    sed 's/\(&lt;div class=""mode.*""&gt;\)\(.*\)\(&lt;\/div&gt;\)/\2/'

Use sed to subsitute (replace) your data. The regexp says: 

find (&lt;div class=""mode(Anything zero or more times)""&gt;)^1 (Anything zero or more times)^2 (&lt;/div&gt;)^3 and replace all that you matched with the second match, in this case anything between the &lt;div&gt;-tags.

    sed 's/^[ \t]*- //'

Use sed again to modifiy your data. The regexp says: 

find (any **starting** space or tab until ""- "" and replace it with nothing (remove it)).

I struggled a long time with understanding regular expressions but once you got it, it's easy to read and write and it's always handy while programming.

It's a compromise I'm willing to accept, because the fact that it's DLC means the ones who need it can have their feels and the ones who don't can pass it up. Either that or it's a thank you to fans who invested in and cared so much about the characters. I'm fine with either interpretation.

2. Feminists don't want equal treatment of the genders, otherwise they would be called ""egalitarians"" because that's what it says in a dictionary.

True,SyrioForel,,,"If you're put off by the size of the cities, then you probably need to be aware of a few points which EA's marketing and various gaming outlet previews have either completely glossed over or never even mentioned, but they play a fundamental role in how the game is designed to be played. 

First of all, understand this: You are *supposed* to run out of space. That's one of the challenges of the game, and the reason why the whole ""Region"" concept plays such a huge role in the game. The cities you build are not meant to be end-all-be-all self contained little population centers perfectly catering to your sims. The cities must be built in concert with their neighbors.

You see these little sims? You heard how they are individually simulated? Well, you probably didn't hear (or it wasn't sufficiently explained) that the sims are completely free to move around from city to city. I don't mean they move to a different house in another city, I mean they travel from city to city as part of their day-to-day activities. 

Now, without this level of real simulation, the older SimCity games already kind of had this -- but it was all a single-player experience self-contained in a single city. The sims (you can imagine this, without the real simulation) simply traveled 10 miles down the highway to a different neighborhood, or whatever. But the key point here is that they were all *your* sims. In the new SimCity, the sims are more-or-less *shared*.

Criminals from your city will travel to another city to commit crimes. Ambulances from one city can respond to emergencies in another. One of your cities on the region might be a center for knowledge with a big university campus, and sims will travel there to get higher education in order to operate the more advanced industrial structures (i.e. sims need to go to college before they can work at a nuclear power plant). So the mayor of that city (whether it be yourself playing with your self, or your friend who you invited to take control of that city) better make sure they maintain that kind of ""specialization"" (i.e. a hospital center, a research/education center, a gambling town, which is what EA's early videos focused on, and many other variations).

The other very important point to bring up is that, unlike in other SimCity games (at least based on what I remember), this is the first SimCity game to feature finite resources that you have to mine, extract, process, and *use*. A coal power plant no longer just ""works"", it needs *coal*. Water pumps need *water*. And here's the kicker -- these resources are not distributed equally among the cities, they are placed in specific places underground in the region that some cities may sit on top of and others do not, or some cities may have more of than others (they DO run out!). So you need to have a full trading system in place, which is its own interesting challenge.

Now, you may say, ""Why can't they give you all these gameplay features, but just increase the city size?"" Because then you would need to rely on other cities less and less if you can just fit everything in your own city. They are giving you these limits in order to encourage multiplayer gameplay. If they didn't do that, no one would bother playing with friends, and that would defeat the entire purpose of what they're trying to accomplish here -- cooperative multiplayer gameplay on a large scale. Right now, you have to think: ""Well, I have room for a large garbage dump, but now I can't put an airport here. I'll ask my buddy to build a garbage dump in HIS town, and then I'll just pay him to export my garbage there, and then his sims can use my airport to increase their commercial/industrial output!""

If you had the space to build everything in your own city, you wouldn't even think about this level of multiplayer depth. It just wouldn't be there!

By the way, if you're anti-social and have no friends, you can go ahead and play the entire region in a single-player fashion. You just need to simultaneously build and juggle multiple cities at once to take advantage of region play, but you can certainly do it. It might even be more fun, depending on what you're into, but I think most people will probably enjoy playing with their friends more and focusing on just one or two cites at a time (some regions contain a dozen cities, so playing them alone would be very difficult).

[](/bjsurprise)Project horizons follows Blackjack, a wildly awesome and badass security mare whose stable was attacked by bandits in pursuit of EC-1101.  She escapes the ""massive rape factory"" of stable 99 with P-21.  She prefers a more close quarters approach in combat than her parallel, Littlepip, as she uses her meager magical talent to do little more than hold weapons but can take down ponies twice her size in melees.
[](/sp)
[](/p21)This guy's actually got a complicated backstory, and after the circumstances of stable 99, it's hard to blame him.  (I'm not going to go too into detail about that, just remember the story clarifies pretty well that stable 99 was *not* morally correct in its ways.)  Long story short, P-21 has difficulty trusting others and enjoys explosives.
[](/sp)
The rest of the characters join in this order:
[](/sp)
[](/glory)Morning Glory is met by Blackjack and P-21 with her cowering under a terminal hiding from security droids (and shoots Blackjack in the face by accident) after the rest of her Enclave VC squad was slaughtered by them.  She uses energy weapons in combat and the rest of her backstory would involve too many spoilers to tell.
[](/sp)
[](/rampage)Rampage is an ever regenerating, literally invulnerable member of *the reapers*, a gang in the Hoofington Valley.  Even she knows nothing of where she comes from beyond waking up in a crater one day.  She rarely uses any weapons beyond the many spikes adorning her armor.  Noticeably, she also has stripes similar to a zebra's, but of a different color.
[](/sp)
[](/lacunae)Lacunae is an alicorn, and initially defies all logic of FoE before she gives her story:  She is an alicorn under The Goddess, technically, but she has no being, only a body.  Her entire consciousness is based off the ""negative"" emotions of the goddess and her victims.  Whenever The Goddess has feelings of sympathy, regret, or even contradicts her motives she takes those feelings out and places them within Lucanae.  She does the same for those in unity as well.  Because Lucanae shows a resistance to enervation (another taint like entity in the Hoofington, [similar to the effects of speakers in Canterlot, but more passive:  You'll slowly melt instead of get ripped apart.](/spoiler)) she is the only alicorn present in The Hoof and acts as the eyes and ears of The Goddess for the region.  She quickly grows a liking to Blackjack and her goals and joins in her quests (first as The Goddess's commands, but later just because screw The Goddess).  In combat she acts similar to other alicorns, except she later uses a minigun, half to defy The Goddess, half because it is a good weapon for some situations.
[](/sp)
Error 404: No Emoticon found.Have more Blackjack[](/tapdancingbj)
[](/sp)
The last character is Scotch Tape and no details beyond ""olive green filly who builds stuff"" can be used without abusing the spoiler tag.
[](/sp)

[](/sp)
Anyway, they go around The Hoofington Valley at the same time as Littlepip and friends rain hell on Red Eye in the rest of Equestria.  Blackjack is awesome because she regularly gets drunk and goes on bandit murdering sprees *while singing about whiskey*.  She's more awesome than Littlepip in every way-

Among the many things that marginalized groups suffer is that they are so easily silenced.  When the majority is seen as normal, or powerful, or right, then the minority often has difficulty being heard.  This isn't even necessarily because of malice; if the ratio of gay people to straight people is (to make up numbers) 1/19, then in a room of 100 people you'll have 95 straight people and 5 gay people.  If they all start saying, ""Well, as XYZ, I think blah blah,"" what the straight people will overwhelm anything the gay people say.

So beginning in the 60s with the civil rights movement, and on through the feminist and LGBT movements, academic language has been developed specifically to allow the minority voice to be heard, and it does this by finding various ways to tell the majority voices to just shut the hell up for like two minutes, goddamn.  This is a good thing, because it encourages a number of dialogues that pretty much couldn't happen otherwise, and advances the causes of rights, freedoms, etc.

But the language isn't tied to any one movement, nor does it only apply to ""legitimate"" oppression.  So then you get people like the otherkin (or the transabled, or the transethnic) who adopt the *language* and use it to silence people who say ""dude you're not really Charrizard.""

This is bad for at least two reasons: (1) it teaches people, who would naturally not be receptive of this language in the first place, that the people who employ this language are full of shit, even when it turns out they aren't, and so people who actually need to use it get thrown under a bus, and (2) it gives other, more academic people incentives to formally challenge the whole structure assumed and built by this language going all the way back to the 60s and earlier, which can then be used formally to attack actually marginalized people.

For (1) you don't have to look far; reddit is full of people who stopper their ears the instant they hear someone talk about privilege.  For (2) you can look at the most extreme radical feminists, who are apparently **insanely** distrustful of trans* people.

It is only after the fact, sober and in tremendous pain, that she probably took stock of what happened and went ""Holy Shit!"". The next morning this seems like the worst thing she could have done but I don't find it difficult to imagine that, in the moment, it was just a crazy party and she wasn't thinking 'consequences'.

No, you're not. It sounds hot. It sounds like a wild, fun party that she got swept up into. I get wanting to be there. It might even feel like the reasons she did it was you weren't there to watch and she didn't have to ask your permission and face being told that it was not cool. 

If in NINE YEARS a little hot-tub kissing is her worst transgression, you have an incredible relationship. I think you should be (and probably can't help but be) pretty upset about this but I would err on the side of forgive and forget.

Maybe your wife has a kind of passion for girl-on-girl that would be fun to explore together. Maybe she's got an exhibitionist streak. The thing that comes to mind is something like a swingers club. NOT to even go and be with other people but maybe to have some semi-private, semi-public sex. Maybe this is a cry from her to make being 30 and married not be the end of her wild and crazy days. 

I am sure all of that is the last thing on your mind right now but it is worth thinking about. Given an APPROPRIATE outlet for those feelings she might never be topless-hottube-makeout girl in the future. 

Long story short, I think this sucks and it is emotionally difficult but I think you'll both come out the other side and be just fine. This is about as big of a deal as you want to make it and I'd probably try to give in to those ""wish I was there"" thoughts and move away from the scary/ugly betrayal and damnation side of this.

True,weagle11,,,"I formerly worked in a college town grocery store and supervised a department of the store. Being a college town most of the employees were younger and many of the girls were pretty good looking. It also seemed the prettier they were the lazier. Anyways, there was this smoking hot blonde who worked in the bakery that I had always had my eye on since I had hired her. She had a boyfriend so I never made a move, it would have been risky enough being her superior. She was pretty good at her job(mostly baking cookies and simple birthday cake decorations) but she never went above and beyond on anything. One day I was sitting in my office going over the week's payroll and she knocked on my door, peeked her head in and asked to talk. She came in and sat down and started making small talk, I instantly noticed something was a little strange only because we usually didn't carry on long conversations and it definitely had a flirtatious feel to it. Eventually the conversation turned back to work and she came out with it. She wanted a raise. I kindly explained to her that I was pleased with how she did her job but that it wasn't a highly skilled position and she never really went out of her way to impress anyone. While I was talking she got up out of her chair and moved around my desk towards me. I was trying to stay calm but in my head I was thinking ""holy shit, is this really happening?"" Once I finished talking she immediately leaned forward over my chair and put her hands on my shoulders, intentionally letting me look down her shirt(she had some amazing, firm breasts) and asked ""surely, there is something I can do to impress you."" Before I could even reply she stood up and began to take her shirt off. As she was undressing, trying to be as smooth as possible, I asked, ""So what kind of raise are we talking about?"" As she pulled off her shirt she replied, ""I'm gonna need about 3.50."" That's when I noticed that her work uniform was hiding the body of a green sea creature from the paleolithic era.

As an atheist myself and redditor who has been on this website for far too long: This subreddit is terrible. It's partly due to the goddamn edgy teenagers mad at mom and dad for taking them to church, but it's posts like yours that are really the problem.
Douchey, arrogant posts whining about (formal) fallacies in absolutely everything on the news and on facebook and intellectual weakness of their authors. You don't tackle any issues, you are bashing the lowest common denominator of believers over and over again. You're not helping progress, you're not raising awareness or helping other coming out, you just like beating people with a stick over the head.

And the torrent of stale quotes from throughout history mixed with quotes of comedians, the facebook drama, the posts about gays (enemy of my enemy amirite?), the pictures of space and some vague-ass comments pasted on top and the fucking veneration of three american science popularizers.
The veneration of science, while not admitting that the progress brought by it is the main reason everybody ""loves"" science instead of the pursuit of science itselft; and perhaps the very obvious fact that saying you love science makes you look cool pisses me off.

edit: I was aware of the annual fundraiser while making this post. Please do not mail me 100 times over this.

True,INeedMoreShoes,,,"Was in the military. I worked a late night shift with students in military training. We had students who were injured or had failed out the course work in the office until they moved to their next step (discharge, reclass, etc.). I had a younger girl working in my office with me to help with paperwork and files, something she had a background in. I was still pretty new to the job and needed the help. I knew that this young lady had some bad stuff in her past and once in a while she would talk about it. I just thought she was getting things off her chest and just needed someone to listen. She always maintained her military bearing and never acted unprofessional so I didn't mind. 
One night she was about five minutes late and told me she had a horrible day. I told her it was a mistake, not a big deal but don't let it happen again or I'll have to find someone else mk more reliable (any NCO knows the tone). Her eyes water up and she says she's sorry and want to know if we could talk closed door about what was wrong. I tell her no problem and have her sit at my desk and tell her I will be right back 
Now, I'm new, but I remember that you NEVER close the door as a male leader to talk with a female alone. I go to the CQ desk and request another female to join our conversation. We walk back to my office and I open the door. I would have never expected what I saw. 
There she was on my desk, topless, and pulling her pants off. I let out a shrill and slam the door. At this point I tell the two to stay by the door and I run to call my boss. I tell him what happened and he responds ""Heh, what ya do.."" Laughing. I tell him nothing and beg him to come and take care of the situation. He tells me no and to deal with her.
I went back to the office and she's crying sitting on the floor. After talking to her a while she tells me she had a fight with her dad and then thought I was going to fire her as an office assistant so she thought I would keep her around if we had sexy time. Well, I talk to her. Have her go to bed with a CQ guard to watch her and take her ass straight to the Chaplin in the am.

True,Freekmagnet,,,"   I agree with the other responses here; what you are describing is almost certainly an ignition related misfire, not a transmission problem.    Ignition parts that are wearing out usually show symptoms first under load.    The reason is that when the fuel mixture in the cylinders is lean (more air/ less fuel in proportion) a much higher voltage is required to fire the spark plugs, and to keep the arc burning across the plug gap.    When the throttle is closed or partially closed like at cruising speed the fuel mixture is richer.   When you push down on the throttle the butterfly  in the throttle body is opened, allowing a sudden rush of air into the engine.    It takes the computer a second or two to respond by holding the injectors open longer to richen the fuel mix back to normal; during this time if the ignition system cannot supply a high enough voltage to fire the plugs the engine will misfire, causing a momentary rough running/ power loss condition.   When the transmission downshifts as you open the throttle more it reduces the load on the engine, and you respond by letting up on the throttle slightly, closing the air intake to the engine; this is why it runs better after it downshifts from 4th to 3rd gear, even though the engine is running faster.
    Spark plugs do wear out over time, especially if they are not platinum electrode plugs (the type required on tis engine).    The electrodes erode away and the gap gets larger, requiring more voltage to fire.    Spark plug wires get hardened and brittle as they age; electrical resistance increases as the wires degrade.  Higher resistance means, again, more voltage is required to overcome this resistance to get to the plugs.
   If the car has not been maintained well, the plugs and wires are probably getting old and worn out.   Replacing them is routine maintenance, so you should start there.
   If the car has been driven for a long period of time with worn plugs and wires it can cause other damage.    Your engine has 3 ignition coils which supply the high voltage (around 12 to 15 thousand volts) needed to fire the plugs.    As the electrical resistance through the plugs and wires increases, the coils must produce even higher voltages; they are capable of generating well over 40,000 volts on this system.    When they have to make higher voltages, they generate a lot more heat than normal.   The heat can start to melt the shellac used to insulate the internal windings of the coils, causing them to arc internally between windings.      Also, the coils are mounted on top of and plugged into the solid state ignition module that turns them on and off.   If the coils arc internally between the secondary (high voltage) and primary (low voltage) windings, it can cause the expensive ignition module that should be operating on 12 volts to be intermittently zapped with 40,000 volts.    This, of course, will eventually damage the module.
   So, replace your plugs and wires with good quality new ones.    If the problem persists, you may need to replace the ignition coils.    If the module becomes damaged what you will experience is a rough running engine, even at idle, because 2 of the plugs will stop firing at all (each coil fires 2 plugs on this design).   Spark plugs cost about $7 each.  A good quality wire set is around $50.   Coils cost around $50 each.   A module is usually over $200.
    Someone mentioned having the codes read that were stored in your car's computer when the check engine light came on.    This may yield some useful information to give a starting piint for diagnosing any other problems you may have.    You will find that the auto stores probably cannot read the codes in your computer because you have what is known as an OBD-1 generation engine control system.     The OBD2 generation of engine controls that we have now were only used on a very few California emission cars in the 1995 model year, it became the industry standard in 1996 in the US.   Being the older generation of controls the code reader tool that the auto store counter guys have will not connect to your car's diagnostic plug.     However, you can read your codes yourself using only a paperclip.    By jumpering the top right 2 pins in the car's data connector you can make the check engine light flash the stored fault codes; the light will blink out the digits of any stored 2 digit fault codes.   This is done with the engine off, key on.   The first code flashed will be a 12, this means there is no engine rpm signal at the computer (normal, because it is not running).    Following the 12 will be any other stored 2 digit codes, and at the end you will get a 55 (end of fault code sequence).
   Here is a U-tube video showing you the steps to get your codes using a paperclip:

There are times when I look like a skeleton.  I have no breasts.  Clothes hang off my body and make me look shapeless.  Everyone says that clothes are designed for skinny people, but I guess I'm even skinnier than that - I can never find clothes that fit.  The legs of my jeans are always baggy, no matter how small I go down in size or how skinny the cut is.  My shirts always gape at the chest and just look... empty.  I'm always amazed at how much better my clothes look on my curvier friends.  I've never had a bra that fits - even training bras are too big for me.  I can still fit into my clothes from middle school.  

In every relationship I've ever been in, my partner has either fetishized my skinniness and grown to be manipulative and controlling over the fear that I might someday gain weight (which contributed to me developing an eating disorder) or been openly dissatisfied with my body, preferring curvier girls (which didn't help with the eating disorder).  

In high school, before I'd ever developed disordered eating, people used to call me anorexic.  My 'friends' used to joke around like ""don't worry, dicksalsa, someday you'll find a guy who doesn't mind that you don't have tits.""  Also, the ""only a dog wants a bone"" comments.

There's no way to know for sure; I'm guessing. But this sounds to me like she's planning that. My guess would be that she's sending a signal that she's not interested in having other than a friendly relationship with you.

&gt; But the past few times shes come down to visit friends and family I've made excuses, or ignored her when she would ask to hangout, or go somewhere.

As my guess, I'd say that's the right thing to do.

There are a few secrets to life: one is that you'll often never know if you've made the right decision. Make a decision based on what you know and how you feel and go from there. You can always change your mind if she pursues you. If she doesn't, make up your mind that you did the right thing.

Another secret is that you should make yourself happy. If you don't enjoy the way she's treating you, stop giving her the chance. Don't go through life putting yourself in situations you don't enjoy. If you don't like being made a third wheel and being ignored, don't hang out with her.

Let me offer this suggestion: If she makes it clear that she's interested in going out as a date, then you can accept. But going out and being ignored is not something that would make any normal person happy.

Finally, you'll get used to not knowing what to do. :-&gt; Welcome to life, wildcat.

I am a lifeguard every summer, and on many occasions attractive women are wearing next to nothing and bouncing around near me. Now, I am a very good lifeguard and have saved 11 people's lives at this point. But, I am a man, and sometimes my resolve and my concentration waiver when I am on the stand. On this particular day, a notorious group of babes were splashing around right in front of me. I tried to fight it, but I got a chubby. And that chubby evolved into a full fledged boner. And then I noticed the little girl who was WAY too small to get in alone do something insane. She got in alone. And as an on duty lifeguard, it is my job to stop her from becoming the reason I quit and can't trust myself for the rest of my life. So I hit the air horn and jumped in after her, scooped her up and placed her on the side. The group of babes was right next to me, and I felt like such a hero. Until I noticed that my boner was sticking around to see how things turned out. I knew if I got out of the pool, people would stop seeing me as a hero, and start seeing me as the lifeguard who gets off on grabbing little girls in swimsuits. So when my boss came over and told me I needed to get out and do all the paperwork, I pulled a really old play out of the playbook. I feigned injury. I told her I had twisted my ankle jumping in, and that bought me enough time to shut down my monumental erection. The only repercussion was that I had to fake-limp for about 2 days.

Seriously though, I've visited Hong Kong a few times and have a small collection of Hong Kong coins, as well as Chinese coins in general, and I don't recognize the ones in your photos. I've also spent some time just now going through my coin catalogs, looking up officially-issued Hong Kong and Chinese coins from 1997, and while there are a few issues commemorating the handover event they don't look like yours.

I'm not sure if what you have are actual government-issued legal tender, or just commemorative medals or medallions issued by a private company and sold as souvenirs. We actually see a lot of manufactured collectibles from private companies in the US as well, often being peddled on late-night TV to celebrate events in American history. They are rarely worth what they cost.

If any of yours are actual government-issued coins the ones from Hong Kong will list a denomination on them in dollars, and the Chinese ones from the People's Republic will list the denomination in yuan (元).

The character yuan (元) does appear on some of the pieces, but not in the context of [a denomination of money](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_yuan). The characters **公元** preceding the date mean ""AD"" or ""Christian Era.""

The places where it says ""24K"" are followed by the characters for ""gold plated"" (镀金), *jin* (金) by itself meaning gold. The large versions of your photos show a more coarse surface texture than you'd typically find with government-issued coins as well.

My Chinese is pretty rusty and you could try asking on /r/HongKong, /r/Chinese or /r/ChineseLanguage for help with reading what is on the medals and their packaging, but I highly suspect that these are just souvenirs issued by local companies to make a fast buck and don't have any real numismatic value.

True,[deleted],,,"In this story, the boner isn't really the awkward part, but the boners wake.

Went to a small local festival last summer. After having finished my set with my band, I decided that fuck it, now is the time to get shitfaced drunk and wear nothing but boots, a cowboy hat and some boxers made partly of see through mesh. In order to not flap my dick in everyones face I did the only reasonable thing, and duct taped that bastard to my thigh.

A few hours (and bottles) pass and then a band I absolutely love comes on. I run to the front, in all my cowboy hat and pink mesh glory. Halfway through the set the front man notices me, and goes ""You! Redmesh cowboy! Get the fuck up here!""

And so I'm thrown on stage with one of my favorite local bands in front of a couple hundred people, drunk as shit, wearing a cowboy hat with appropriate boots and a red mesh boxer, dick still firmly duct taped to my thigh. They want me to sing a fucking song with them, and hell, I don't mind. I'm drunk as shit at this point, singing my heart out to a song called Bæsj (thats Norwegian for poop by the way), enjoying my time. Apparently, others enjoyed it as well, and a couple of girls decided to flash me. This would have been a lot of fun, if it hadn't cause me to instantly pop wood and rip my cock from my thigh. I tried to minimize the damage my slightly adjusting my dick, but being drunk, on stage geared up as hell, and holding a microphone, that didn't work out.

I ripped up the boxers, and out pops my throbbing, duct tape covered cock. Fuck it, its too late to change anything, I'm rolling with it. And thats what I did. I lived out the part of the ductdick cowboy for the rest of the night, and it got a lot of attention, strangely. As the night is coming to a close I realize I need to get this shit off my dick at some point, so I do the only reasonable thing. I hold an auction, where the winner gets to remove the tape. For 20 bucks two girls step up, grab a hold, and rip. Hard.

Hairless and bleeding, newly slaughtered cock in hand I fall to the ground, and though the women had promised to kiss it better, the sight of a blood covered cock sort of scared them off. This is around where it gets awkward.

The 20 bucks were spent on a taxi, where I sat in the back, naked and bleeding, on a plastic bag to not get blood on the cab. When I reached the hospital I put on the plastic bag like a pair of trousers, looking like the most ridiculous human being on earth, with my cowboy hat and blood dripping down my thighs. I spent a whole of 7 seconds in the waiting room before they got me in to a doctors office. Being drunk, all I could muster to say when she asked me what happened was ""I am the cowboy of cock"".

Then I woke up the next morning with bandages on my dick. Great night right there. Couldn't fap for weeks. My dick has healed since, mostly.

True,SeductiveMango,,,"DRM stands for Digital Rights Management, which is basically a way for a game company to make sure that the people who are playing the game actually paid for it. DRM isn't bad in of itself, in fact it's understandable as to why it exists. The problem is when that DRM prevents us from enjoying the game we purchased. DRM that requires a constant internet connection is one such DRM.

Imagine you go out to buy some soup (a game). Now depending on where you go, you will often get the choice of ordering the soup for take-away (singleplayer) or decide to eat there at the restaurant (multiplayer). Let's say that you enjoy sitting at home to eat your soup, so usually you just go to the register where you order a bowl of chicken noodle and they hand you a receipt (DRM). You then proceed to show that receipt to the server who then gives you your soup since you have proof that you bought it and you go on your merry way.

Now the DRM that is in this version of SimCity would be akin to being forced to eat your chicken noodle at that restaurant. Sure you can go sit in the corner, eat there, and not talk to anyone. But you came in a pair of pjs with a rip in the crotch, so you much rather be home. The restaurant tells you at the counter that they will be serving your soup to you at your table one spoonful at a time, and if you do not recite your receipt number when they come to you with each and every spoonful, they will assume you did not pay and kick you out of the restaurant (You must stay online to prove that you paid. If you get disconnected, they will assume you didn't pay and kick you out of the game).

Now they say that they do this service for everyone just in case someone doesn't have the ability to feed themselves (calculations are done server-side so people with out of date computers can play the game). So you appreciate the gesture, but you feel that you are more than capable of feeding yourself. A couple bites in, you find that the carrots that are usually found in chicken noodle are nowhere to be found. You ask the server and he says that the carrots were prepared that the same as the soup and if you'd like, he can go ahead and add them for an extra charge (day one dlc/micro transactions). You begin to suspect that this may have been an attempt by the restaurant to make you pay more for the soup, as you probably could have just added carrots at home (game modding). A bit of time later, your friend Jonathan come over and gets some soup. The soup is now cold, so they have sold it to him at a lower price (discounts due to the age of a game). He goes to sit down and receives two spoonfuls of soup when the manager decides to kick everyone out and that they will not be selling that style of chicken noodle again (servers for the game are closing). Everyone who is there is complaining that they still wanted soup, and the manager says to come tomorrow when they will have a new recipe of chicken noodle that features white meat instead of dark meat (SimCity 2 with any improvements it comes with). While people start saying how much better white meat is for you, you will always miss having your dark meat chicken noodle. And you end the day thinking ""If I was able to bring a bowl home with me, I'd be able to eat leftovers tomorrow...""

**TLDR: EA may be the soup nazi from Seinfeld** 

EDIT: Wow, this has been quite interesting. While this just started out as an attempt to help someone understand why there was so much hate towards the SimCity DRM, it's turned into a library of information that can allow him to form his own opinion on the matter.

I can try to answer if I'm asked a specific question, but I'm not well-versed enough to describe those concepts in general - I haven't had a formal education in this stuff, I just pick it up along the way.

Wikipedia is often a good place to start to learn the basics of what everything is. For example, [AES](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard) is a specific cryptographic algorithm, and is currently considered secure given enough rounds (repeatedly running the encryption on the output of the same algorithm). You can more or less follow the links from there - cryptography is a *very* broad field. Actually, [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topics_in_cryptography) article might be a good starting point.

[IT Security at StackExchange](http://security.stackexchange.com/) is a great place to ask questions (though be sure to read the [FAQ](http://security.stackexchange.com/faq) for the rules first!), and there's already a large number of 'beginner' or 'basic concepts' type questions you an search for. Keep in mind that they greatly prefer specific questions - ""If you can imagine an entire book that answers your question, you’re asking too much."".

For three years, I was a complete basket case. I couldn't hold a job. I was not fit company to be with other people. I grieved tremendously. I still do.

What transformed me was to honor a request by a prison Priest to visit the man in prison who killed my wife and child. It took me a year to work up the courage to face that man. But I did it.

He begged me for my forgiveness. After hearing his story, I did. What drove him to alcohol was the death of his own 7 year old child to cancer. He vowed that if I could find it in my heart to forgive him for what he did, to never drink another drop of alcohol.

To this day, he has not. He put his life back together and so did I.

I can tell you...the minute that I offered my forgiveness, a weight was lifted off my shoulders that felt like ten tons.

I will until the day I die, miss my son and my wife, and I visit their graves often, but I went on to marry again a woman who stands beside me whenever I visit those graves, and who has delivered two daughters that did not replace my first child, but have brought me joy that has eased my pain.

So Sir...my advice to you is to forgive yourself for what happened. Your circumstances are not the same as mine, but you know in your heart that what led up to the death of your son might have been your fault, but it was NOT INTENTIONAL.

You have suffered tremendously for 20 years. I feel every ounce of your pain. I've been there. You deserve to cut yourself a little slack for making a MISTAKE.

Your wife's decisions were her own. For sure, they were triggered by what happened and clearly she held you responsible, but I urge you...for maybe the first time in your life, to understand that you are not an evil person. You are obviously a person with a conscience. You have atoned for 20 years, the mistake you made. You made an error in judgment...and nothing more.

Bad things happen to good people. I could write a book about the tragedies that have occurred in my own life, but I have learned to keep picking myself up and moving forward.

You are in my prayers even though I don't know you. Please forgive yourself, for you deserve to do so after suffering with this for all these years. It's so obvious, from what you write, that if you had to do it all over, that you would have done all you could to have prevented what happened. You know that, your wife knew that, and I'm sure that your son knows that too.

My religion leads me to believe that one day, when you pass on from this life, you will all be reunited and all of you will be made whole.

Please take care of yourself and don't do anything more to hasten your journey towards death. I pray fervently that you find some inner peace for what happened. It was a mistake. You have paid the price for years for it. Please try to file it into the proper drawer and cut yourself some well-deserved slack.",0,1362481502,,0,False,5,c8q2mi7,t3_19opc3,t1_c8q2mi7,t3_19opc3,,1431488185,3620,False,offmychest,t5_2ranw,3620

True,caustic_banana,europe,Roman Empire | Classical Europe,"Part of the problem with this logic is you are assuming that the past was equally valued among all cultures at all times.  The evolution of writing and the transition from oral to written was a really lengthy period of time, as I'm sure you can imagine.

When writing was ""coming of age"", there is not much evidence to support that people decided, ""Whelp, better record my family history while I can"".  Reading and writing was reserved for the privileged few and the education required to make use of it was not commonplace.  So early writing tended to be used solely by nobility and royalty amongst early societies.

What does this mean?  It means what records we do have usually revolved around only the most important societal info (which is really useful for historical purposes) and social info (i.e. Rao begot Tut begot Karfu, ad infinitum).  But we don't have a lot of basic, common things to fill in any real gaps.

What works especially hard against all this, is the tendency for leaders to flex their glory by erasing everything done by people who overshadowed them / they didn't like.

It is a huge mess when counting backwards as we don't always know what year a succession occurred so we could have a Year 10 of King A and Year 3 of King B but we don't know how many years were in between. Then you get large swaths of Egyptian history where multiple kings rules the country, of course each with their own dates and we're not counting instances where kings are pretty much removed from the record, damnatio memoriae. 

Dates regularly move up and down, there's a discussion going on in the email lists now about moving the 2nd Intermediate Period around by a good few years. There is potential for almost absolute dates from astrological records but there are issues in identifying which stellar body the Egyptians are talking about. One of the generally accepted ones is the rising of Sirius but even with such dates you need to work out where the sighting was made which will not always be the location of the inscription, you also need to take into account artistic license.

Don't get ahead of your conditioning.  Follow your own curve and avoid an injury.

Don't talk to anyone while they're attempting a lift.  Don't stand directly in front of or behind anyone who is lifting.  Know where and when heavy things are in motion around you.

Don't drop the bar from the top of a deadlift.  You miss the entire eccentric second half of the lift, and you're probably not lifting more than 225 or so anyway.  If you drop at the top of a dead, you probably won't ever lift more than 225 in any case.

Don't drop a bar from any height that only has 10 or 15lb bumpers on it.  Bumpers are expensive and it breaks them.  Its called ego dumping for a reason.

When learning a new lift, make sure your coach shows you how to safely bail out from under a failed attempt.

True,g1i1ch,,,"A programmer is a wizard. The keyboard is his wand and his libraries are his spell tomes. That's how programming is like. What programming is? It's about abstractions. 

It's a confusing term to someone starting out but it's actually pretty simple. When you're playing a video game, that game is an abstraction of all the complex code running behind it. It's something that's nice on the eyes that hides all the complexity behind it.

In programming you'll be creating abstractions constantly; you'll use several things to create these abstractions, functions, variables, classes, macros, etc. But their only purpose is to allow you to take complex code and hide it away within yet more complex code which is in turn hidden away. Never forget the most basic part of your job, removing complexity for yourself.

About parts of it? Can't really say, just about every programming language does things differently. Some need a compiler, some need the files just in a folder when you export the program, some need a script line in a webpage. The only important part about all languages though is creating abstractions. 

You can start in any language you want but I recommend going around and trying as many as you can. Learning any language is only going to be faster if you enjoy it. 

Processing was mentioned earlier and it's a good easy language. 

I'd also suggest JavaScript(which isn't similar to Java) because it's very simple to use and get anything done. Also it's one of the most used languages in existence so you'll have a marketable skill right from the start.

True,rougepanther,,,"This is awesome! Recently, I've had a few surgeries and lost my job because of them. So my wife had to get a second job. Her idea was to adopt a cat for me, just so I would have a recovery buddy. I wanted an older cat, one that would be mellow and stay in my lap for hours on end. After looking online, most people said cats only live for about 10 to 14 years. So we go to the local humane society, and I fell in love with the sweetest little fluff ball. She was already 8 years old, and because of that, she had been in that place for over a year without being adopted. I was able to sit in a chair for 30 minutes holding her, and the whole time she was just tucked in my neck and wouldn't budge... safe to say she adopted me. So I told my wife that we'll give her a nice and safe place to live out the rest of her life, and she can give us a lot of good memories in the few years that we would have her. But seeing your post, it really gives me hope. In the few weeks that I've had my little recovery buddy, I have fallen so much for her, she's just so loving and caring, just what I need since I'm alone for so often. I just hope my Raco (name the shelter gave her, we kept it so since she responded to it) can do what your cat is doing! I don't know what I would do without her, she's really helping me stay sane during all that I'm going through.

True,A_RUSE,,,"Video would just feed the 24/7 new cycle even more sound bites with which to over-simplify the legal determinations the Court is supposed to be making. Oral argument serves a ton of purposes, and the Justices aren't always espousing their personal views when questioning counsel - sometimes, they're teasing out an idea, or flagging an issue for another Justice, or even playing devil's advocate. It would be all too easy for Fox News to turn every off-handed remark from the Bench into stupid 5:00 p.m. spin fodder. 

The Judiciary branch is supposed to be one step removed from the democratic process - They act slowly, and under the constraints of stare decisis.  Everyone SHOULD be engaged in this process. But that engagement needs to be approached in a measured, intellectual fashion. Read the transcripts. Study the law. Hell, submit an amicus brief. But watching 20 second highlights of oral arguments presented by media outlets designed to help support a person's prefabricated political views does not contribute to transparency in the judicial process - it helps water it down and further politicize it.

This is disturbingly vague for a city council resolution that passed unanimously.

Answered on your other thread, but...So no one's confused....

Emergency is procedural language. It allows the resolution to be voted on and implemented immediately rather than being tangled in bureaucratic and procedural delays.

Basically, the city's trying to allow DM to increase the number of overflights they're permitted to make, to remove ""noise reduction"" limitations that prohibit night flight operations/overflights and restrictions on the type of aircraft allowed to overfly the city.

Residents are upset because it's primarily targeted at allowing DM to operate the F-35 which, apart from still being experimental, has caused noise problems as well as other issues from supersonic flight associated with them.

The ""emergency"" clause basically lets the city shut out opponents who would delay or derail the resolution.",0,1362505833,,0,False,1,c8q822k,t3_19p4q7,t1_c8q822k,t3_19p4q7,,1431490763,5,False,Tucson,t5_2qmno,5

&gt;*""TheTDB, you're really drunk right now, and you have to walk a couple of miles home.*

&gt;""Yup"".

&gt;*""Do you know what we're going to do?""*

&gt;""Nope.""

&gt;*""We're going to get some hot food in you, so you can sober up.""*

&gt;""Food.""

I stumble into a local chinese takeaway, and being drunk, order the most difficult thing to hold without spilling when drunk: Wonton Soup and noodles.

With my soup and noodles, I continue homeward bound. It's at this point unfortunately, that the voice in my head is now also drunk, so his advice is no longer to be trusted. He sounds logical, but really doesn't think things through.

&gt;*""TheTDB, stop. Now.""*

&gt;""..what..?""

&gt;*""Think about this. You're drunk, and carrying hot liquids. You should stop walking and sit down.""*

&gt;""I should stop.. sit.""

&gt;*""There you go, why don't you sit down here where it's nice and quiet?""*

So I sit down, and continue to munch my noodles, and spill soup down my front. The police just happen to drive near, see me, and stop. It's when they start to talk to me that I'm told I'm sitting in the middle of a Dual Carriageway ('Divided Highway' to you American folk - tip of the hat to /u/longringfinger). 

&gt;**""Hello there..""**

Mouthful of noodles, I simply nod.

&gt;**""That's right, so why are you sitting there?""**

&gt;*""...""*

&gt;*""...""*

&gt;*"".....noodles.""*


They ended up taking my details down. I wasn't rowdy or a danger to others (only myself), so I wasn't in any large trouble, but they moved me away from the road, after me offering to share my noodles no less than five times with the pretty blonde police officer who was talking to me.

Food was rationed heavily and offered barely enough for people to survive let alone thrive, and armed guards were posted around the camps at all times.

True,bix783,,,"There actually was, but, despite a hundred years of study by archaeologists and historians, we still know relatively little about it. 

The people I'm referring to are the people who lived in the Southwestern United States. This group is sometimes called the Anasazi or Ancestral Pueblo, and the region they lived in covered the Four Corners region ([map](http://s3.amazonaws.com/readers/2009/12/29/487pxanasaziessvg_1.png)). This is the area where Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, and Arizona meet. This group, who I'll call the Anasazi for simplicity although there are some historiographical issues with the name, also seem to have extended into southern Nevada (the Lost City) and there has been evidence at least for their cultural influence in the Salt Lake region of Utah. Also, keep in mind that these borders are not well-defined -- they are largely based on pottery styles and there seems to have been a lot of intergroup trading within the region.

You can see the remains of their ""empire"" most spectacularly at [Chaco Canyon](http://www.nps.gov/chcu/index.htm) and [Mesa Verde](http://www.nps.gov/meve/index.htm), but there are hundreds if not thousands of other places throughout the Four Corners region and down into northern Mexico that were associated with this group. One of the smaller sites I particularly recommend is [Canyon of the Ancients National Monument](http://www.blm.gov/co/st/en/nm/canm.html) on the Colorado/Utah border. Mesa Verde [editorial note -- my absolute favourite National Park in the US! Go visit it today!!] includes [this famous place](http://www.es.flinders.edu.au/~mattom/science+society/lectures/illustrations/lecture18/anasazi1.jpg), called Cliff Palace. Chaco Canyon, meanwhile, is enormous and looks like [this](http://www.mousemusings.com/weblogs/uploaded_images/chaco31-766172.jpg) from above.

Stephen Lekson (a professor of anthropology at University of Colorado Boulder) has theorised in his book [The Chaco Meridian](http://www.amazon.com/The-Chaco-Meridian-Political-Southwest/dp/0761991816/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1362504590&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+chaco+meridian) (1999) that Chaco Canyon formed the ceremonial centre of an extended empire that lasted until sometime in the 14th century CE. Although his work is somewhat controversial and speculative, his core idea of Chaco as a central place seems reasonable and has gained acceptance among academics in this field. When this empire began is also unknown, because it grew out of the culture of the Pueblo (the Spanish name for these people -- generally used among academics) people who had lived in the area since before 100 BCE. 

The Pueblo culture is characterised by dwellings built of adobe (mud hardened by the sun into bricks -- you can visit an example of this style of living in Taos, New Mexico, which is still inhabited today) and incorporated into the local landscape -- high altitude desert, with mesas (high plateaus) and washes. Think of the classic [southwestern US desert](http://www.macwallpapers.eu/bulkupload/Wide/1/Widescreen/Desert%20Hot%20Weather%20Sand%20Widescreen.jpg) seen in westerns. This desert extended from the foot of various mountain ranges, most notably the massive volcanic uplift of the San Juans in southern Colorado/northern New Mexico. Water came from the mountains, as did timber. People farmed, growing corn, squash, and beans, which are hardy enough to survive an environment with climatic extremes and very little water. They also spent time in [kivas](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcR0SB45GlBBdupJ6rzC_bhNGhJctIx3ls9RHeZVlGRh09U0tMjNwg), round, sunken rooms that often had benches along the walls and pits in the centre of the floor. Kivas are still used today for ceremonial/ritual purposes among the Pueblo, but it is unclear if that was their purpose initially. However, by around 1250 CE, they had definitely become ceremonial/ritual and places like Chaco Canyon feature Great Kivas, which are very large.  

Around the 12th century CE, pottery styles began to change, which Patricia Crown and others associate with cultural change and the beginning of the ""Anasazi civilisation"". At some point prior to that, the adobe dwellings had become more elaborate. Places like Cliff Palace in Mesa Verde had been built, which were large structures capable of housing many people. The timbers that I mentioned earlier -- which came from the mountains -- have been used to date these dwellings. The dry desert air has preserved them and if you visit any of these areas you can still see the original timbers, intact and above your head. You can even touch a few of them! Using dendrochronology (and in fact, the science of dendrochronology was born in this area!), Cliff Palace has been dated to ca. 1190-1260 CE. Pueblo Bonito, the enormous structure built into the cliff wall at Chaco Canyon, has been dated to being from ca. 850-1150 CE. These structures may have been used as homes, but they may have been reserved only for high ranking officials -- we just don't know. [Evidence from human remains](http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/bae51/sec10.htm) is tricky to interpret, because many remains were cremated. It seems that only religious leaders or other high ranking members of society had their remains interred. Many of these have become mummified naturally by the environment, although some form of preservation of the remains may have taken place at the time of burial. However, as a result of the few human remains found by archaeologists at these sites, it is difficult to know how many people lived at each of these places. Some people, including Lekson, have speculated that Pueblo Bonito had very few people who actually lived there; instead, it acted as a storehouse for food and luxury items (more on that in a minute), and a place where only a few high ranking religious or other officials would have lived.

- When all of your friends and family actively try to tell you that the relationship is unhealthy and they don't like your SO, FOR FUCKS SAKE listen to them. &gt;&gt;OR AT LEAST TAKE TIME FOR INTROSPECTION&lt;&lt; If the whole chorus is chanting at you, the message must be pretty direct. Don't be that guy who's in love with a controlling, twisted, hurricane IV, with a strong enough wind to blow all three of little piggies houses down. Staying with crazy doesn't make you bold or noble, just naive. 

1. Don't ever date a girl who acts like a spoiled brat to her parents.

2. Don't ever date a girl who feels like it's okay to violate your personal space and cross boundaries inappropriately. 

3. Don't ever date a girl who's best friend you know first hand is a deviant liar and generally trashy, shit runs in pairs. 

4. Don't ever expect someone to change. Most of the time they don't. Likewise, don't expect someone to stay the same through the years, people always have potential to change in anyway. 

5. When a feelings gone, it's gone. STFU and move on. People only hurt them selves holding onto broken shards of glass.

6. Understand personality flaws and family archetypes before engaging in a serious relationship. A girls parents will show you how they deal with anger and problems, on purpose or on accident, and show you the girl's idea of a ""functioning"" relationship. 

7. Any significant other that's so insecure with their existence they feel the need to put down their SO in anyway, (verbal or physical harassment)  or use their SO's personal information that was spoken out of confidence against them, is probably a venomous bitch and ten types of crazy. (come to think of it, there's still a scar on my lip from where the bitch decked me when she was drunk, men are abused just as often as women.) Feel free to drop these girls where you find them and run like hell. They'll just knock your ego around to feel powerful and in control of something. Child on an ant hill with a magnifying glass. 

8. Don't date girls that fight. Girls that fight are hurricanes, they just come back around to rip shit up for fun, they don't know what they're fighting for, but verbally beating you makes them feel better. Only date girls that argue, who can eloquently and calmly articulate their reasoning and actions without throwing a tantrum or acting in the manner of a repulsive bitch. 

9. If you find yourself becoming someone you hate and don't recognize during a relationship, it's probably not the one for you. 

10. Love is as blinding as flash powder. You can love a girl to the edge of eternity and back, you can be every thing she's ever wanted, you can be one of the only people who knows her well enough to actually take care of her, sometimes thats still not enough. YOU MUST ALWAYS BE ABLE TO AT ANY POINT RECOGNIZE WHEN A RELATIONSHIP IS A LOST CAUSE.

11. We all have bad relationships, some people just don't work. Some people just can't see that while their in it.

12. When a girl try's to isolate you, bitch about your friends, and tries to drive a wedge between you and the part of your life that makes you your self, dump her unless you plan on marrying her. Because from that point on if your not 100% sure, your putting your own stability at significant risk. You never make a significant other constitute more than 15% of your life unless your on the marriage track, if they have a problem with this then (a.)they don't have enough going on in their own life to grow as a healthy individual. (b.) she's controlling and potentially vindictive and emotionally unstable, in which case, run. (c.) OAG, case by case interpretation, but still unhealthy. 

13. If you hooked up with a girl drunk, and then want to date her, quit being fucking simple. Any man with self respect doesn't mix pleasure and business. The girl you hooked up with last night is the girl out doing that every weekend, not the one you take home to mom. Think about how easily she goes home with you, and remember that's just who she is, your not that good. Hoes turn into house wives eventually, but the chance of you being that person is exponentially and unbelievably slim.

14. The best thing coming from years of dating experience? I found out exactly what I don't want in a relationship that i'll try and make last forever. Knowing exactly what I didn't want, allowed me to find exactly what I wanted.


IF YOUR INSTINCTS ARE SCREAMING ON THE INSIDE THAT SHES A MANIPULATIVE, LYING, POO-HEAD, AND SHES FUCKING AROUND WITH OTHER GUYS AND NOT TELLING YOU, CHANCES ARE YOUR INSTINCTS ARE RIGHT. YOU WON'T GET THOSE INSTINCTS WITH THE RIGHT PERSON. &lt;---------- This isn't even a rule because it's so fundamental in thinking. If I would of followed my instincts, I would of saved myself a few months of loving and having an intimate relationship with a girl, I dated for 2.5 years, who was lying to me about the many boys she was also being intimate with. (she probably didn't tell them we were still being intimate, scandalous.) Follow your rational instincts men, because at the end of the day, no matter what she says you can tell when somethings aloof.

True,Imhtpsnvsbl,,,"The short version is that the human sense of vision is a complex thing, and what you see is not always — in fact, not even *often* — a ""real"" image of what's ""really"" there.

There are many individual aspects to this story, though. The page you linked to in your comment addresses some of them individually, like the role of the fovea — the ""blind spot"" — and all that.

Another good example, which I don't believe was mentioned there, is the ""stopped clock"" illusion. Find a clock with a second hand on it, and look away from it for a moment, then look at the clock. The second hand, obviously, moves once per second. But when you *first* look at the clock, it seems like the second hand is momentarily ""frozen,"" lingering for a bit longer than it should. It feels like you have to *wait* for it to start moving.

The reason for this is subtle and wonderful. First, think about the process of looking from *over there* in the distance to looking at the clock. What has to happen? Well, obviously your eyes must pivot in their sockets; they have to physically rotate toward the clock. They also have to focus; muscles around your eye have to contract to slightly change the shape of your eyes so a clear image will form on your retinas. Your eyes also have to converge on the clock, meaning different muscles have to turn your eyeballs so they're not parallel, but pointed slightly toward each other, so you can form a binocular image of the clock.

All those things take *time.* Not a lot of time; just a bare fraction of a second. But they still take time. And during that time, you are simply not getting any useful ""information"" from your eyes. They're in motion, they're unfocused, they're not properly converged. Until they settle into the right arrangement, you do not have a clear, comprehensible image on your retinas.

If your eyes were cameras — and in the most basic respects they're like cameras, but as we're seeing at the same time they're *incredibly* not — the result would be a fraction of a second of useless noise recorded on the film. Motion-blurred (because your eyes are turning), focus-blurred (because they're changing focal length) and not properly converged. If you were making a movie out of that, you'd simply edit those frames out, because they're just noise anyway.

And that's *basically what your sense of vision does.* It simply ""edits"" that part right out. It does not get ""fed"" into your short-term memory at all. You are, during that fraction of a second, *not seeing.* Your eyes are working, but they are basically not connected to your mind until they're all aligned and focused and ready to provide useful information.

And yet, you don't experience moments of *blackness* during the day when your eyes get ""disconnected"" from your sense of vision. You perceive a continuous sense of vision, even as your eyes are darting around and focusing and reconverging and all that. How can that work?

Easy. You remember it wrong.

When you glance at the clock, it *feels like* the second hand is momentarily frozen. That's because that was the first clear image you got after your eyes moved … and when you *recall* what you were seeing during the time your eyes were moving, what you get is the first clear image that formed. It's kind of like your short-term memory goes ""Nothing was coming in during that time, give the first thing we have instead."" So even though you were not seeing the second hand on the clock ""frozen,"" you *remember it that way.* Because that's how your sense of vision works with your short-term memory to give you the sensation of continuous visual perception of the world.

There are a million little things like this. It's not one simple way your eyes and visual cortex and short-term memory collaborate to give you vision. It's a ton of little oddities which seem strange to us the first time we hear about them because they contradict our recollection. I *remember* the clock hand being frozen for a moment before it started moving! Well, of course you do. Because that's how your sense of vision works. It seems weird, but trust me, it'd seem much *weirder* if your sense of vision *didn't* work that way. If it were possible to shortcut your whole sense of vision and just see the ""raw"" images that form on your retinas — and you can do this by using cameras in clever ways and then watching the resulting footage — you'd find it much harder to follow.

The general principle is that your sense of vision does not exist to *show you images.* It exists to give you *information* about the world. And that means simply ignoring images that are not informative.",0,1362515300,,0,False,1,c8qbdk4,t3_19psx1,t1_c8qbdk4,t3_19psx1,,1431492419,11,False,explainlikeimfive,t5_2sokd,11

True,telefatstrat,,,"ok, your post really hit home with me. There really is nothing quite like the smell of dead squirrel. Years ago , I had a “squirrel problem” with my first house, memories of which I had managed to repress. Until now.

It was an old two-story century farmhouse in the country with wooden siding and a fieldstone foundation.  I could hear something running around in the first floor ceiling at various times throughout the day. I thought it was mice at first, but on further investigation, I found that a bunch of squirrels had chewed a hole through the second story soffit and made their way down the inside of the wall to nest in the space between the first and second floors.

At first, I didn’t hate them. I just wanted them to leave. I built a blind outside where I could watch them come and go so I could figure out when they were gone so I could seal their entrance hole behind them. I waited until I saw a bunch of them leave and then while they watched from the trees, I nailed a sheet of metal over the hole. I went back in the house, and was pretty pleased when the house was quiet for the rest of the day. 

Then holy hell broke loose: I had trapped a number of squirrels in the house. They got progressively more and more frantic as they discovered their exit was blocked. It soon became impossible to sleep as they ran around inside the ceiling trying to find a way out. Exhausted, I had to admit defeat. The next morning, I climbed up the ladder and removed the metal plate covering their entrance hole, expecting the trapped squirrels to escape to freedom. Instead, the rest of the squirrels who had been trapped outside moved right back in and to top it off, they were no longer interested in peacefully co-existing with me and my family. Their hellish racket made it difficult to sleep and I came to the decision that it was me or them. 

For a week or two, every day when I got home from work, I grabbed my gun and headed to my blind to wait. Sure enough, a squirrel would arrive or depart from the entrance hole and I would shoot it, pick up its corpse and put it in my garbage.  Despite this carnage, the number of squirrels living in my ceiling never seemed to decline. The noise was getting worse. I could only imagine the damage they were doing to my house.

I mentioned this to my brother-in-law, who was a farmer, and he recommended that I use Warfarin to take care of my squirrel problem. He told me that when vermin eat Warfarin, it makes them thirsty and they go outside in search of water only to die there. This sounded like the perfect solution to my problem, so I went to the hardware store and bought a big bag of cheese-flavoured Warfarin. 

I climbed the ladder and stuffed the whole bag (about half a pound) into the hole they’d chewed through the soffit.  The very next day, the house was completely quiet. I thought this was awesome. I climbed the ladder once again to reinstall the metal sheet over their entrance hole. When I did, I found the empty Warfarin bag – they had eaten all of it, every last crumb.
Within a few days, my house started to smell “funky”, sort of like sour milk. It got worse and worse and I came to realize that the squirrels hadn’t left the house to die – they’d actually died where they had lived, between the first and second floors of my house! 

I hoped that the smell would die down in time as they dried out, but that wasn’t to be. Within a week, two rooms on the ground floor were almost unusable because of the stench of dead squirrel. I was at a loss of what to do.

The turning point for me happened one day when I was sitting in the living room and I noticed these grains of rice on the living room carpet. Looking closer, I noticed they were moving. They were maggots. I looked up and the living room light fixture was full of maggots, like a horror movie. They were coming through the fixture from the ceiling above.

I grabbed my circular saw and headed upstairs. I pulled up the carpet and cut two  2’ by 2’ holes in the floor roughly above the light fixture. I almost puked from the smell as I opened up each whole.  Over the ceiling joists, I could see a half dozen or so squirrel tails sticking up marking the location of their rotting corpses. 

With gloves on, I peeled the rotting dead squirrels off the inside of my ceiling and put them into garbage bags. There were still several that I couldn’t reach though, so I reached in with my wife’s vacuum cleaner hose and sucked their tails into the vacuum hose and used this to pull them off the ceiling. I sprayed disinfectant everywhere and sealed the holes back up.

There is NOTHING quite like the smell of dead squirrel. To this day, I still have an unnatural hatred of the damn things.

Tl;dr Guy’s house gets infested with squirrels and he has to cut his house apart to get them out after they died.

""Rest in peace, Hugo Rafael Chávez Frías. As a Venezuelan, I didn't agree with most of your policies and politics, but I do not rejoice in your death and I do respect the pain of your family and supporters.

In 1998, when you campaigned for the presidency -and promised to end corruption- despite my disappointment with the traditional parties, I did not support you because you had led a coup against president Carlos Andres Pérez. I didn't like Pérez, but he was elected by our people and attempting to overthrow him was proof that you did not respect the will of Venezuelans.

I didn't oppose 100% of what you did. I was grateful, for example, that you placed the issue of poverty on the table and you put the spotlight on millions of Venezuelans that until then had been excluded. I knew that the Cuban doctors in the slums were unprepared and unequipped, but I understood that they meant the world to the mother that knocks on their door at 3am. I was also happy of the way most Venezuelans started to care about politics again (some because they supported you; others because they opposed you). The anti-politic feeling we saw in the 90's was precisely what got you elected. And I also kept in mind that a majority of Venezuelans did support you, so you certainly had a right to be in office.

These are my 10 reasons why I will not miss you:

1. Your authoritarian manner (which reflected a flaw probably most Venezuelans have), and your inability to engage in an honest dialogue with anyone that opposed you. Even from your death bed, you had a Supreme Court justice fired because she didn't agree with your politics.

2. Your disrespect for the rule of law and your contribution to a climate of impunity in Venezuela. In 1999, you re-wrote the Constitution to fit your needs, and yet you violated it almost on a daily basis. With this example, it is no surprise that crime exploded in Venezuela. In 14 years, our homicide rate more than tripled from 22/100K to 74/100K. While judges were busy trying to prove their political allegiance to you, only 11% of homicides led to a conviction.

3. Your empty promises and the way you manipulated many Venezuelans to think you were really working for them. In 14 years you built less public housing than any president before you did in their 5 year periods. Hospitals today have no resources, and if you go there in emergency you must everything from medicines to surgical gloves and masks. The truth is that you were better at blowing your own trumpet than at getting things done.

4. The astounding level of corruption of your government. There was corruption before you got elected, but normally a government's scandals weren't made public until they handed power to the opposing party. Now we've heard about millions and millions of dollars vanishing in front of everybody's eyes, and your only reaction was to attack the media that revealed the corruption. The only politicians accused of corruption have been from parties that oppose you, and mostly on trumped up charges. For example, Leopoldo Lopez was never condemned by the courts but you still prevented him for running for office. His crime? Using money from the wrong budget allocation to pay for the salaries of teachers and firemen -because your government withheld the appropriate funds.

5. The opportunities you missed. When you took office, the price of oil was $9.30, and in 2008 it reached $126.33. There was so much good you could have done with that money! And yet you decided to throw it away on corruption and buying elections and weapons. If you had used these resources well, 10.7% of Venezuelans would not be in extreme poverty.

6. Your attacks on private property and entrepreneurship. You nationalized hundreds of private companies, and pushed hundreds more towards bankruptcy. Not because you were a communist or a socialist, but simply because you wanted no one left with any power to oppose you. If everyone was a public employee, you could force them to attend your political rallies, and the opposition would not get any funding.

7. Your hypocrisy on freedom and human rights. You shut down more than 30 radio and television stations for being critical of your government, you denied access to foreign currency for newspapers to buy printing paper (regular citizens can't access foreign currency unless you authorize it), you imprisoned people without trial for years, you imprisoned people for crimes of opinion, you fired tens of thousands of public employees for signing a petition for a recall referendum and you denied them access to public services and even ID cards and passports.

8. Your hypocrisy on the issue of Venezuela's sovereignty. You kicked out the Americans but then you pulled down your pants for the Cubans, Russians, Chinese and Iranians. We have Cuban officers giving orders in the Venezuelan army. Chinese oil companies work with a higher margin of profit than any Western companies did. And you made it clear that your alliances would be with governments that massacre their own people.

9. Your hypocrisy on the issue of violence. You said this was a peaceful revolution but you allowed illegal armed groups like Tupamaros, La Piedrita and FBLN to operate. You gave them weapons. You had the Russians set up a Kalashnikov plant in Venezuela. You were critical of American wars but yet you gave weapons to the Colombian guerrilla, whose only agenda is murder and drug-dealing.

10. Your hypocrisy on democracy. Your favorite insult for the opposition parties in Venezuela was ""coupists"", but you forgot you organized a coup in 1992, and the military that was loyal to you suggested they would support a coup in your favor if the opposition ever won the presidential elections. There was no democracy in your political party: you chose each of the candidates for the National Assembly and for city and state governments. When the opposition won the referendum that would have allowed you to change the Constitution in 2007, you disavowed the results and you figured out a way to change the articles and allow yourself to be reelected as many times as you wanted. You manipulated the elections in 2010 to make sure the opposition didn't get more than a third of seats in Parliament even though they got 51% of the popular vote. Your democracy was made of paper, you made sure there were no meaningful checks and balances and all institutions were your puppets.

So no, Hugo I will not miss you. Rest in peace now, while we try to rebuild the mess of a country that you left us.""

True,[deleted],,,"1984

People think it's about CCTV, but it isn't.  It's really the story of a simple, average man.  He lives, works, socializes and should quitely die in a world designed to break down and destroy his soul in every way and at every level, simply so that the powerful and the powerless can maintain their accepted places in the world.  Quite by accident he falls in love, he didn't mean to, he is as cynical as the rest of us, and the rest of the world certainly didn't intend this to happen.  But by the end (spoilers) the world has caught him and it has killed his love.  It hasn't killed him, or the woman he loves.  They are fine, free even.  But it has destroyed their love.

The ultimate, final conclusion of 1984 is that love can be killed without killing the people.  That love is fragile and weak and falls in the face of fear.

True,Arcane_Explosion,,,"Let me ask you a question: Were you ""one of the smart kids"" growing up? Were you constantly complemented because of your intelligence and your problem solving ability, even when you know you hadn't worked very hard and the problems seemed easy? Did school seem to come easy to you even when you were surrounded by people who were struggling?

I bet you were. I know because I was too. School before undergrad for me was cake. Never tried, all As, easy peasy. Got into a top 10 US university and almost failed math (my best subject) my freshman fall. Had an existential crisis. I thought I was smart! Why was this so hard? My work ethic dropped and I started to do even worse. I read a lot of books on success, motivation, and work ethic but none of it clicked until I read Carol Dweck's book called ""Mindset"". It completely redefined how I defined ""smart"", a quick summary of which I'll make for you now.

The issue with your childhood (and mine, and so many others on Reddit) is that you were always labeled as smart. Without having to work hard, you were given a positive label that put you above other students. You were special. You were smart. You heard it so often (from parents, teachers, peers) that it became part of your identity. Not only that, but being smart was EASY...

...until it wasn't anymore. High school was cake. Then you go to college and realize you're surrounded by other smart people learning high level stuff. And all of a sudden it's not so easy anymore. Self-doubt and eventually panic set in as you're confronted with material you can't just whiz through with no effort and you encounter something you've literally never seen before in academics: failure.

So now what we're left with is a very intelligent individual who's never learned to work hard and never learned to deal with failure. And what are they doing? Failing. So guess what the cure is? You got it: working hard. And yet... we have no motivation to work hard! Why?!

The reason so many bright individuals get caught in this vortex is what I talked about earlier. When you were being labeled as ""smart"" by so many people, that label literally becomes how you define yourself. Your self confidence, how you look at yourself in the mirror, all of it, is based on the fact that you think of yourself as ""smart"". And you unconsciously make the (false) assumption that smart people don't work hard. Smart people should just get it. And since you're smart, you shouldn't have to work hard. So you don't. If you had to work hard, that means you aren't smart and your entire self image comes crashing down.

Have you ever looked at someone doing better than you in school and think to yourself, ""Well yeah, they're getting better scores but only because they work harder. I'm still smarter than they are""? If you have I'M TALKING ABOUT YOU. Nobody cares about smart! **Results are all that matters.**

The answer to this question is to redefine your definition of ""smart"", like I did. You think smart is something along the lines of IQ: an innate, defined, non-changing characteristic of each person that exists somewhere along a spectrum of stupid to genius. Well guess what? That's not what smart means. That's not what being smart is all about.

You need to start equating ""smart"" with ""progress"". My favorite quote that I've encountered in this process is **""Smart is just working hard enough to make something look easy"".** If you can think of anybody in your life who is good at ANYTHING, how did they get there? Lots and lots of hard work. Being smart isnt not needing to work hard. Being smart is realizing that you have the capacity to accomplish amazing things WITH hard work and then actually fucking doing it. You need to ditch your self-definition that relies on being labeled ""smart"" and realize that intelligence is meaningless without hard work. Ditch ""smart"" as the be-all, end-all, and begin worshipping hard work instead. 

""Smart"" is meaningless. The only thing that matters in this world is hard work. And guess what? When it comes to hard work you're stupid (as was I). But you can get better! All it takes is some dedication and a realization that you can accomplish whatever you put your mind to if you work at it. That's how I swapped my world view, and that's how I went from failing math freshman year to top 5 in my medical school class. You can do it too.

Also, look up Carol Dweck. Seriously. Her book Mindset is amazing. To drive this point home, she also has a study where two groups of kids were put through two sets of intelligence puzzles. The first set for both groups were easy, but the second set had a choice between easy or hard. After each group finished the easy puzzles, one group was complimented on their intelligence and the other was complimented on their hard work. When the second set came around, the group that was complimented on their intelligence overwhelmingly chose to do the easy puzzles instead of the hard ones and were frustrated the whole time. The ones complimented on their hard work overwhelmingly took the hard puzzles and had a great time with it. Hard work is the key to success. Smart is meaningless.

Anyway, sorry for the wall of text. Hopefully it helps a bit!

You're upset about mixed signals.  I think your problem is that you pay attention to signals at all.  Signals mean nothing.  Someone can be enthusiastic about you and then it turns out that was the last time you'll ever hear from them.  It happens all the time.  Signals mean nothing.

The only way to survive OKCupid is to expect absolutely nothing from anyone, ever.  Go into it expecting that every interaction is your last.  Then, if someone actually contacts you again or shows up again, it's a nice surprise.

True,shanonlee,,,"Hi there! 

I'm a similarly aged mother to an almost 2 year old. 

I have found myself seriously sucked in to this place, to the point that I check for new posts daily - several times in fact. 

I have one quick tip - avoid at all costs anything to do with Yue Yue. I saw the gif and regretted it immensely and I will never ever get those images out of my head. 

I generally avoid most things to do with child death and suffering. It's too easy for me to imagine my own child in that position and end up bawling my eyes out.

I definitely have an appreciation for how things can happen so quickly. I have many thoughts on how I would rescue my daughter in various situations. I now keep a heavy rock in my car as well as a seatbelt cutter in case of ever driving in to the lake. I am more cautious and there are things I definitely won't ever do with her after reading stories - ie: jaywalking.

I don't know if you have more specific questions  to ask :p I couldn't go through and answer all of them xD

It seems a normal thing to me to be fascinated, but I do try to avoid any overly disturbing images of suffering or death, especially when it comes to do with children. 

I definitely think I have become slightly more desensitized, and I hope if I am ever in a bad situation or accident that will help me to cope and be calm. Though primarily I hope my new awareness of how fleeting life truly is will help me to avoid such incidents in the first place.

True,mgrier123,,,"Ok, you see, people like you piss me off for many reasons. Now before I start my rant let me make a disclaimer, I am not Venezuelan, however I currently live here in Caracas and have lived here for what will be 5 years come this summer.

Outsiders look at what Chávez has ""done"" and say ""oh look, he's improved the economy. The poor are better off. The poor are more well off. He's built houses for them and continues to help them in any way he possibly can."" Wrong. It's all wrong.

You know what happens when you're sitting on vasts oil reserves, and the price of oil changes from [about $12 in 1999 to about $120 as of 2012](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Crude_oil_prices_since_1861.png)? You literally roll in the cash and would theoretically vastly improve the economy by bringing in mountains of cash. Currently, oil accounts for approximately [95% of Venezuela's exports](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Venezuela) which is extremely high. 

As a result of this and of the price controls on various products such as [eggs, oil, toilet paper, chicken, beef, medicines, milk, cement, rent, sugar, and flour](http://venezuelanalysis.com/tag/price-controls), there are constant shortages of these necessary products as well as staple foods, such as rice and potatoes. There are many times where milk isn't available for weeks or months at a time, or oil or flour or sugar, which is completely unacceptable.[ In addition, because of the various laws about renting, such as if they stay in the apartment even without paying for rent after a certain amount of time, it is impossible to kick the tenants out and they more or less own the apartment, as well as controlled rent pricing, no one is willing to rent apartments or houses to anyone anymore.](http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2011/10/29/venezuela-rent.html)

As of right now, the inflation is approximately [22.1%](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/venezuela/inflation-cpi), one of the highest in the world. In addition, the Bolivar is currently valued at [6.3 Bolivars to the USD](http://themoneyconverter.com/USD/VEF.aspx). However, nobody uses this value as it's absolute bullshit. The correct rate is about [26.4 bolivars to the USD](http://www.lechugaverde.com/) as of right now (wow, that's a lot. I haven't checked it since last Wednesday. Wow...) which is absolutely ridiculous. This is a discrepancy of 419% between the official rate and the actual rate. This radical difference in exchange rate makes items incredibly cheap to us foreigners, but incredibly expensive to locals. As an example, a Big Mac meal here is approximately 84Bs., last I checked, which at the 26.4 rate is $3.18. However at the official rate, it is $13.33. This is an absolutely ridiculous difference in price which causes many problems, such as the ease of corruption and because of laws put in place by the government saying that companies and individuals can only exchange a certain amount of money at a time, a relatively low amount for a company, legally, it is very hard for companies to do business here.

This is not to mention the fact that Chávez has expropriated thousands of businesses, such as [PDVSA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDVSA#Nationalization), the national oil company, in 2003, malls, banks, hotels, such as the Hilton in Margerita, and many, many others. Venezuela is currently [dead last](http://whatsnextvenezuela.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/International-Property-Rights-Index-2011-Report-04.18.11.pdf) in the International Property Rights Index and is [180](http://www.doingbusiness.org/data/exploreeconomies/venezuela) on the ease of doing business, as provided by the World Bank.  This is not a good sign. As a result, nobody wants to invest here and companies such as Chevron and Schlumberger are currently considering pulling their operations in the country as they work closely with PDVSA, who is and has been refusing to pay them, on the magnitude of billions of dollars.

In addition, the price of gas here is the lowest in the world, which is maintained at a fixed rate of [Bs .097 per litre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline_and_diesel_usage_and_pricing), which is $.015 at the official rate per litre. By selling oil at this incredibly low price, PDVSA loses money one every litre of gasoline sold, further lowering PDVSA's profits.

The economic growth rate of Venezuela as of 2010 was [2.8%](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_South_America#Annual_economic_growth), the lowest in the entirety of South America.  In addition, there is an official unemployment rate of 8.5%, making them 8th in the continent.  

All of these numbers and statistics are all well and good, but what about what it's actually like to live here under Chávez? Well, the murder rate is currently [45.1 per 100,000](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate), while Caracas currently has the [6th highest murder rate of any city in the world](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_by_murder_rate) at 98.71 per 100,000. Not to mention the thousands of kidnappings a month. I have many friends who have been kidnapped for ransom as well as the more recent examples of the [Mexican embassador](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/31/world/americas/venezuela-mexican-ambassador-kidnapped-then-released.html?_r=0) being kidnapped and more.

The buildings are falling apart. The roads are falling apart, as is the entire infrastructure. The Caracas metro has gone from one of the greatest in the world to one of the worst. Building projects never get finished. The port in La Guaira is currently being ""modernized"" and can only handle 1 ship at a time, maybe 2 if we're lucky and the planets are aligned, driving prices even higher, making products rarer and causing shipping companies to be less likely to dock here as they can be anchored off of La Guaira for weeks at a time waiting to be unloaded.  The runway at the airport is falling apart, causing constant delays. The road to the airport gets blocked by landslides all the time, effectively cutting the city off. 

Chávez has also cut water off to Polar, the bottling company for both Pepsi and Coke products, as well the maker of the national beer, causing soda and beer shortages throughout the country. Venezuela now imports coffee, when they used to export. Venezuela imports milk, fruits and vegetables, meats, and other food items as no one wants to produce them anymore as they won't make money due to price controls.  Every company that the government nationalizes either drastically reduces production due to mismanagement and therefore has to siphon off money from PDVSA, or just eventually goes under as it is making no money. 

During the rainy season, land and mudslides are a common occurrence, which blocks roads, and destroys thousands of homes, leaving tens of thousands homeless each year. This is not being helped as the government builds very little housing for the poor and because the houses in the barrios where these landslides happen have no foundation and are simply bricks on top of earth or concrete. The poor are not better off. There are some hospitals and clinics in the barrios, and many outside, but they are all severely understaffed and are all suffering from severe shortages of medicine and medical supplies, such as saline. 

Venezuelans have been leaving the country for the US, Europe, and other South American nations for years as there is no point investing here and the instability and crime here, it is not the best place to live or conduct business, or even conduct free speech. The government here is notorious for revoking broadcasting licenses of newspapers and radio/tv stations that don't agree with the government, or even imprisoning the operators. 

Cháves isn't hated in the US for being Communist, or being anti-Capitalist or any of that bullshit. He is hated in the US because his economic and social policies have been an outright disaster for the country as well as ruining what little economic stability this country has. Venezuela was in a downward spiral in the 1990's, I don't dispute that, nobody does. But Chávez has never been for the people. He conducted a coup in 1992 against the democratically elected leader President Perez. Chávez was a great orator, he really was, but his ideas and his implementations of his ideas would never work in the real world, and in the end did not. The only reason that Chávez was able to hold onto power as long as he did was because the price of oil skyrocketed throughout the 2000's.  If it wasn't for this, the economy would have collapsed long ago due to little growth in all other sectors of the economy. If you'd like to read another and less wall of text reason why, please [read this](http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-937093). It gives good insight from a Venezuelan's perspective why he was bad for this country.

So please, don't ignorantly comment about something you don't know anything about. Research it first, or better yet, live it.

EDIT: Thanks for the gold, whoever you are. As a reward, here are some more anecdotes about what Chávez has done here that I posted down below:

Like that the murder rate actual murder rate here in Caracas is most likely double what the official number says. I've heard stories of reporters being in clinics in barrios, like 23 de Enero, and having people bringing in people who have been shot every 5-10 minutes all night.

Or the fact that Chávez armed and supported many, many gangs in the country, forget the names, as well as allowing the FARC to operate near the Venezuelan-Colombian border.

Or the fact that Chávez has claimed about half of Guyana as the ""reclamation zone"" as he claims that it is really part of Venezuela, except everyone thinks he's crazy about this and no one recognizes his claim.

Or the absolutely untold amounts of corruption in the government. Governors of states have been found trafficking drugs to the states or have been found stealing millions and millions of dollars from public projects, like the Valencia metro.  For the record, the Valencia metro had been under construction for approximately 6 years, and as of now only has 2 stops.  Pitiful.

Or the law that states that after a worker has been hired for 90 days, you cannot legally fire him. So what ends up happening is that people are hired on 89 day contracts, let off, and then 6 months later are allowed to be rehired again. This law drastically raises the unemployment rates as now they are only working for 6 months of the year instead of year round.

Or the fact that he has been changing the constitution ever since he has come to power, even enacting a brand new one in 2003 I believe that just gave him more power.

Or that in the most recent election, the opposition got a majority of votes in the parliament, but instead of giving them the 52 or so seats that they won, the government only gave them around 42.",0,1362547114,,0,1362585961,1,c8qm3ew,t3_19qw2q,t1_c8qm3ew,t1_c8qiao6,,1431497589,710,False,explainlikeimfive,t5_2sokd,710

True,rob-sheridan,,,"I made the mistake of wandering back to this question's thread after seeing the Pitchfork headline... The original poster didn't deserve a legitimate response, but since this is apparently a question that some people have, let me chime in and shut it down... Why was NIN announced right at this time? The answer is we DIDN'T WANT TO ANNOUNCE NIN YET. We put it off as long as possible to give HTDA time to breathe before getting steamrolled by the NIN news. But when you book festival gigs, they have their own marketing rollout that is beyond our control and have specific times they need to announce their lineups. Even though the festivals don't happen until July and August, they happened to schedule their announcements right at the time we were releasing HTDA. So we had no choice but to make the NIN announcement. Not only is Trent not using NIN to help market HTDA or whatever garbage the armchair quarterbacking original poster spewed, we actively did NOT want the two to overlap. In fact, the HTDA album was supposed to come out last year, but then the Coachella opportunity came up, and in planning out a marketing strategy that would give HTDA the most exposure, it made a lot more sense to wait and release the album around the time Coachella was being announced. This ran the risk of putting HTDA a lot closer to NIN (which was already being planned) than we'd wanted, but it was the best thing to do for the project. There are complex logistics involved in how tours are planned, budgets and schedules, marketing strategies, production concerns, and a billion other things, and trying to do what's best for two projects at the same time sometimes means there will be sacrifices here and there.
Also, no one's getting rich off of HTDA. Even the money we'd make from something big like Coachella goes back 100% into the production budget so we can have a great live show. We're doing it because we think it's cool and we like making art, and that's really it. We want as many people as possible to hear about that art, so that led to the record label idea. And the relationship we've had with Columbia on this project has been great - it's allowed us to have budgets to do things like make more videos, and it's gotten us a level of exposure for the project we couldn't have achieved on our own. Turns out (some) record labels have changed quite a bit since the industry took a shit. Funny thing, when all the money leaves an industry, a lot of the money-grubbing assholes leave too. Most of the people we work with at Columbia are young, and are just music fans who want to make cool stuff happen. It's never going to be perfect, and we'll always miss having that heavy control we get doing things on our own, but so far this experiment has worked out well for the very specific needs of this project.",0,1362551186,,0,False,1,c8qn61k,t3_19q0r9,t1_c8qn61k,t1_c8qcxcy,,1431498065,325,False,IAmA,t5_2qzb6,325

True,theubercuber,med,Molecular and Cellular pharmacology,"Fecal matter is known to coat everything in the bathroom by being aerosolized from flushing.  Bacteria would behave similarly.

Bacteria aren't terribly motile, to move across objects they are reliant on transmission of some sort. Contact, air movement, etc. Being physically isolated from the counter doesn't change contaminants' general access to it.

Source: I work with bacteria and they get everywhere the air goes


Edit - some people are interpreting the question as **In absence of any assistance, how far can the bacteria from the counter go on their own?** Meaning ignore this is a bathroom and say it's a sterile, undisturbed environment.

The answer to this is - as far as they can plaque and grow naturally.  If there is *NO* airflow or aerosolized bacteria or movement or anything, bacteria on a large scale **DO NOT move on their own** beyond squirming around to grow.  A perfect example of this is a basic 100-level biology experiment involving growing bacterial colonies on a soft agar plate.  When you spread out the bacteria enough that individual cells are physically isolated, each cell grows a colony in its own spot.  It grows a spherical lump of bacteria.  But it doesn't send out colonies or spores, it doesn't invade.  It just grows.

Google ""bacteria agar plate"" to see some nice pictures of this colony-forming effect.  The fact that bacteria *DON'T* move on their own is critical to the way molecular biology is done nowadays.

**TL;DR** - bacteria don't really move on their own but we give them more than enough help to get anywhere they want.

Second Edit - I love the mods here :)


Third Edit - regarding other life forms

What I said about bacteria is only true for bacteria.  Other things that you might find in the bathroom behave differently.  Yeast and other fungi can throw out spores on their own without needing transportation.  Some forms of microbes - amoebas, protozoa, etc. are much better at wiggling around on their own.  Also let us not forget the tiny multicellular parasites that are constantly leaping around looking for a new host to infect.

I didn't even know until maybe an hour into watching it that it was a pure chariot tech 1v1 tournament once someone mentioned it in the stream chat. It was just an enjoyable watch.

For me personally, I view video game tournaments the same way I view sports. For me a lot of the enjoyment just comes from **seeing people doing amazing things that I'm not capable of doing myself**. Sure I have my favourite video games to watch (SCBW and DOTA), just like I have my favourite sports (Basketball and AFL), because I follow and appreciate them the most, but I don't shy away from other sports like Football (by that I mean Soccer), or Cricket even though I have a more limited understanding of the plays and the strategy that goes into each game.

Both sports and video games share a similar necessary set of fundamentals one needs to learn to be able to vaguely understand what’s going on. However, a lot of the more popular **sports have much simpler fundamentals than their video game counterparts**. Understanding basketball is pretty simple when you think about it; throw the ball in their hoop, don’t let them throw the ball into yours. You can admittedly summarise a game of DOTA or LOL to be just as simple, destroy their base, don’t let them destroy yours, but there are so many more complexities that make the game much harder to read for an absolute beginner. The **barrier of entry** for sports is much lower than that of a lot of video games. Games like fighting games are much closer to sport in the fundamental understanding but in this discussion I consider them a niche target and hard to classify along with other popular competitive games (RTS, ARTS games)

A part of the problem with this barrier of entry is the age of adoption. Sports are a household concept. Many people watch sport, and many children are exposed to sport at a young age. And given that most sports’ fundamentals are essentially the same (score more than the other guys by the end of the timelimit), it’s quite simplistic to understand and appreciate multiple sports without even understanding the rules fully. Hell I’ve been watching basketball for years and I still don’t know the rules. However, video games are complicated because the fundamentals are more complex. When you start putting in more complex areas into the discussion, such as hero selections, hero positions, hero roles, hero synergy, on top of understanding hundreds of individual spell animations, conditions, and effects with no noticeable cohesion or similarities, it convolutes the viewing experience. It’s much easier to appreciate how JJ Redick is pretty good at 3 pointers (or at least was, I haven’t really followed his career since his trade) than it is to appreciate a complex series of spell animations, timings, and combinations which change on a game by game basis, based on which arbitrary 10 of the 100+ heroes are picked and which set of spells from the 500+ list of spells was used.

Looking at this idea, I think games like Quake and Tekken are very easy to understand from a spectator position. It’s pretty easy to understand that one guy has more ammo and more kills than the other guy in quake, or a dude is hulksmashing another dude in Tekken. **You don’t need to understand the subtle nuances**; you don’t need to have memorised all the maps for quake, the portal locations, weapon and armour spawns and spawn timers to understand that one dude is killing the shit out of the other dude. Sure, knowing that he’s winning because he got an early red armour, got an early kill and secured the weapon spawns to keep his opponent locked down would add to the experience, but it’s not necessary. Similarly you don’t need to understand that a particular combo absolutely destroyed a guy because he got a frame perfect combo off, knowing the specific invincibility and recovery frames of moves, why specific pokes are safe and why certain combos were such a high risk high reward gamble don’t add that much to the satisfaction of seeing one guy win. But these games have a major **problem of limited exposure**.

These issues are all what I feel are the reasons games like DOTA and LOL are so successful when it comes to tournaments and e-sports. They are both such widely spread and well received games that the barrier for entry is so low, many many children are playing and will be playing this game in the foreseeable future so a lot of the issues of it being so difficult to understand don’t exist currently. The current generation is much more hugely exposed. The games have a huge learning curve and a huge viewing curve but they’re one and the same and people viewing have most likely already tackled this curve and gotten over it. **Complexity of fundamentals is reduced by overlap in gameplay** Hero spells, animations, compositions make much more sense when you play the game. However this is an issue as much as a strength.

This is a hugely popular DOTA2 video from The International 2 where the team iG (red health bars) go in for a huge team gank in what should be a completely one-sided fight and have it completely turned around on them by Na’Vi (green health bars). But its popularity is a complete farce. It’s a joke of a team fight. There was never a single change that they would be able to chain their crowd control spells in perfect sync as all the Enigma player had to do was mash his BKB button and then once he was immune to magic, he was given the opportunity for a huge black hole to completely shut down the whole play. This is a joke and a shame for anyone with a strong understanding of DOTA but to spectators it was amazing. The thrill of the hunt, the anticipation, it was amazing to see. The cornered fox is much more dangerous than the jackal... when it has a BKB. Basic understanding of the game makes this an amazing video; but deep understanding of the game makes it a huge let down. **Depth of understanding is counter intuitive to enjoying the viewing experience of games**.

One of the other major strengths of video games versus sport is the player interaction. So many great game players are now streaming themselves playing, talking with their viewers, interacting via facebook pages etc. While a lot of the competitive nature of sport and bias towards teams or players comes from regional competition and national pride, preference in personality can play a huge role in tipping the scales for professional gamers in developing a loyal and dedicated fanbase. While I may have loved the DOTA 2 team N9 (formerly AL, now disbanded) purely because they’re Aussie, I absolutely love and support the Dignitas LOL team because Kiwikid and Scarra are so jolly and cuddly looking that I can’t help but love them. I don’t like LOL as an e-sport because I think Riot’s approach is absolutely toxic and I think that DOTA is the superior game in both a spectator and player perspective, I sit through every dignitas game I have just because I like Scarra and Kiwikid (Crumbz is pretty rad too).

The biggest problem with competitive gaming is how fundamentally short -term it is. Games currently don’t, and probably won’t even have the long term sustainability of major sports. The shelf life of a video game will always be limited and even the greatest of games can’t stand forever. Starcraft Brood War (my personal pick for best competitive game of all time) was effectively killed off by the very company that created it because they wanted more publicity for their new game, Starcraft 2, a vastly inferior product both in terms of gameplay and spectator value. With technology constantly changing, one single video game will never last for decades, let alone centuries like real sports. While I would love for a company to just keep updating the Starcraft Brood War graphics as technology keeps improving, it will never happen and no matter how popular League of Legends is now, it has an expiration date. And there’s nothing viewers and fans can ever do about it. There’s no way to predict what the next major game will be once DOTA2 and LOL run out of steam either. It’s just too volatile a market.

True,drakanwolf,,,"That game had so many heart-wrenchingly great moments. The one that hit me the hardest, though, wasn't even part of the main or side stories.

I'd been out just exploring the Capitol Wasteland for a while. It had been a bit since I'd run across anything living, and (due to my having turned off the in-game radio) it was eerily quiet. Suddenly, I come upon a small group of houses. All but one of them had been reduced to a pile of rubble. I cautiously enter the lone edifice. The inside is as deserted as the rest of the surroundings, so I immediately set to work scavenging all that I can. Golf clubs? Junk. Squirrel on a stick? Sure, why not? Pilot Light? Could be useful. I finish salvaging what little trash I can from the downstairs, and I head upstairs. There, I find naught but a single bedroom. With little regard for anything else, I quickly head to the wardrobe, bypassing a casual suit in favor of some shotgun ammo buried beneath it. When I'm sure I've gathered everything useful, I turn to scan the rest of the room. That's when my eyes fall upon the bed.

On the bed, I see the house's former inhabitants, in the form of two skeletons. They are arranged peacefully, and they appear to be spooning. My first reaction is that they were caught unaware by the bombings, but I continue to stare a moment more. That's when it hits me. People saw this coming. They had enough time to scurry to Vaults, hide in bunkers, and make any number of haphazard preparations. Not these two, though. Their only thoughts were of each other. They decided that if they were to die, they would do it in the most comfortable place they could imagine: each other's arms.

At this point, I set the controller down, and I feel the remains of a tear begin to cool on my cheek. I marvel in awe as I stare at this couple. Be they man and woman, man and man, or woman and woman, that knowledge is lost to me as I gaze at their charred frames (I mean... it's not like I'm Joy Keenan). All I can see is a single act of love resonating from a time when hatred and hysteria reigned supreme.

True,SomethingFoul,,,"In hockey, fighting isn't seen as a way to injure someone, like it would be in ""real life"". There is a code of sportsmanship in hockey that goes beyond the rules of the game. When that code is broken, players will square off against the offender in defense of themselves or a teammate. For instance, it's not a penalty to intentionally bump the goaltender after play is whistled dead, but occasionally someone will. This is viewed as especially unsportsmanlike, so one of the goaltender's teammates will pick a fight with the player who bumped him in order to impress that behavior like that won't be tolerated, even if there isn't a rule against it. Essentially, if another player is acting in such a way that is considered unsportsmanlike, he might be challenged to a fight by a member of the opposing team. A player might also choose to fight as a means to motivate his team, especially during high-tension and high-pressure situations, and especially in the playoffs.

The code of sportsmanship also extends to fighting itself. Fights are usually agreed to (sometimes in advance) by players involved, and only occur during play. Except in extenuating circumstances, players will not fight with someone with whom they are mismatched (a 6'3"" 225lb player isn't going to fight a 5'11"" 190lb player, unless the 5'11"" guy initiates it), and the fight is over when either of the players loses his balance or the officials interfere.

Also, fighting is technically illegal and carries a 5-minute major penalty (5 minutes in the penalty box, team is down 1 skater on the ice unless both players get the same [offsetting] penalty, in which case the teams do not lose a skater), plus additional penalties for instigating (an extra 2 minutes, team is down 1 skater [5-on-4]) and game misconduct (player out rest of the game, team is not down a skater) should the fight occur when it's not agreeable to both players. Typically, a fight will result in offsetting 5-minute major penalties, the players involved sit in the penalty box for 5 minutes, and the teams carry on 5-on-5 as usual. Worst-case scenario is that one player unscrupulously picks a fight, gets a 5-minute major, a 2-minute instigation penalty, and a game misconduct so he can no longer play in that game, and his team has to send an additional player to the penalty box; the opposing player gets a 2-minute roughing penalty, which offsets the instigator, so play is 5-on-4 for 5 minutes. In the case of the example I gave above, it would likely be offsetting 5-minute majors with no instigator because the refs will view the bump into the goalie as a reason to start a fight.

**TL;DR: Hockey has an unwritten code of sportsmanship and fights are part of that.**

EDIT: Clarified offsetting penalties thanks to MookatWork and worsened worst-case scenario.

EDIT 2: Added team motivation as a factor. Thanks to mikemountain and Fox_That_Fights for reminding me I forgot to add that originally.

EDITED EDIT 3: For those claiming fights in playoffs are fewer/don't happen, consider this: according to hockeyfights.com, there were 546 regular-season fights last season, and 19 in the playoffs. There were 1,260 games in the regular season, and 86 in the playoffs. That works out to 0.42 fights per game in the regular season, and 0.22 fights per game in the playoffs. So there are fewer, but they do happen. *Fixed bad math and admitted defeat thanks to illioneus*

2. He didn't ""rewrote the constitution"". He called a referendum to decide if people wanted the constitution be rewritten and won. Then called election for the constituent assembly, where members of the opposition won seats and were co-participant in the writing. Finally that new constitution was voted and approved.

3. If someone could apport statistics in this field, it'll be appreciated. I could find only statistics until 2004.

4. Again, there's no scientific way to measure corruption. The current methodology is to asks a group of businessmen ""How corrupt is your country?"".

5. Venezuela's expenses  in weapons hasn't changed as a percentage of its GDP and is no bigger than countries in the region. When you add the diminution of poverty, improves in health care, access to drinkable water, deaths at birth, it's impossible to say that the money was thrown away. And that 10.7% (7.3% really) of poverty was 21.0% the year Chavez won his fist election [1]

6. From this point we can conclude that the author doesn't like nationalizations. We are supposed to accept that all nationalizations are bad all the time.

7. Attacks on the media: In Venezuela there are laws that stations must obey to have public signal. The author pretends that every closed station was due to political and not legal reasons. On the other hand, he doesn't name who those ""political prisoners"" are. Could it be those that successfully executed a coup d'etat against him?

8. So, the author doesn't like the policy changes in the oil industry. Maybe a Chinese company would be less prone to participate in the sabotage of the oil industry, as did SAIC when the 20 billion dollars lock out  made Venezuela, for first time in its history, an oil importer.

9. Baseless accusations.

10. Yes, Chavez organized a coup. He recognized publicly and was prepared to accept the consequences. And the he won several democratic, free and transparent elections. Can you believe that still today the majority of opposition denies that there was a coup d'etat against Chavez on April 11, 2002? Hypocrisy too much?

Finally, this is not truereddit worthy. It's just a bunch of unsubstantiated opinions and prejudices. But that's the beautiful of it, it took me more time searching for housing statistics before and after Chavez (and I didn't find them) that for him to pull accusations out of his mouth.

Needless to say I bought one. Beforehand I was a bit dumb on what size to get. Get the size ABOVE the size pants you wear.  Example if you wear 30-32, buy the 32-34. 

The customer service chick even told me they do FREE exchanges which is pretty awesome. I gave it the ol' college try on seeing if she could give me any coupon codes for the check out and she hooked me up with the free shipping - You can get free shipping for using the shipping code FROGGER77 . 

So not only are they on sell, but with that code free shipping. Im stoked. Just wanted to share!

EDIT: Just got my 2013 Black on Black belt in the mail! It's awesome and theBrig and his wife the Customer Service Chick included a FREE Gray leather belt with Silver buckle!
PS - They really do come in those cool little briefcase looking things too! Fancy!

I decided to drop into the shop that I saw it and peruse their selection.  While I did not find any used watches that got me going, I came across this limited edition Hamilton.  The store ended up with it because a store in California closed before the rep could deliver it.  This is the most I have spent on a watch as of yet, but I think it was a good way to get into the limited edition market.  The dual presentation of either being a ships mounted desk piece or worn on the wrist helped sell me.  I pulled the trigger partly because I love the lines of this watch, but also because the store gave me a great deal on a Hamilton Khaki Titanium Field Automatic in black.  That way my Hamilton's would have friends; this now brings my Hamilton collection to three.  Two manual wind and one automatic.

True,Daeres,middleeast,Moderator | Ancient Greece | Ancient Near East ,"I must state what may be obvious elsewhere; my perspective is primarily that of a historian, but with a strong focus in archaeological analysis and some of my fingers in the archaeological pie.

I cannot be under any illusions; history is not science. It is a hedonistic field, dominated by writing ability and the love of the subject rather than anything more rational. It relies on interpretation, and in ancient history on lots of educated speculation. The methodology and mindset cannot be described as a science. I feel that this is an entirely open conclusion and so I'm not bothered by it. I am bothered by those who want to argue that history is a science, and by those who wish to turn it into one.

I am not sure that there is a single school that I belong to. Especially since I am that most terrible of historians; I bite the hand that feeds me. I will always point out issues I have with authors and texts that I otherwise feel are brilliant, and I am a great believer in source criticism joining knowledge of historiography. I believe those to be basic elements of any decent historian's methodology, and am disappointed in those who are not actively engaging with their secondary sources. But I am very, very firmly of the school that historians should understand how to evaluate archaeological evidence like an archaeologist.

2.) The foreign aid we give to other countries is not welfare, it is a tactical diplomatic decision. 

3.) The United States is a democratic republic, our voice is heard through Representatives, who then vote for a majority. Generally still have this true. 

4.)Communism is a defined idea. If he is not a traditional communist, then he's not a communist, he can be a neo-communist, or something else, but a communist is a communist. Beyond that, I for one still have as much freedom to spend my money on what I wish, and only a fool believes that they have had any say in how they maintain their own freedom, unless you mean freedom of your mind, because you live in a society, which has laws which limit your freedom. 

5.) All presidents have passed executive orders, and many people have disliked the outcomes throughout time. A president sometimes has to make negative choices. As to your topic, you're probably discussing the sequester. Originally a republican idea, proposed by Mitch McConnell as a measure to make sure that we reduced the deficit as we raised the debt ceiling. Then, on July 26, 2011, White House Budget Director Jack Lew and White House Legislative Affairs Director Rob Nabors met with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to discuss the plan. Reid, like Boehner several days before, was initially opposed to the idea, but was eventually convinced to go along with it, with the understanding that the sequester was intended as an enforcement tool rather than a true budget proposal. Then it was passed with overwhelming republican support in the house, and high levels of democratic support in the senate...[Wiki article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budget_Control_Act_of_2011) It was an ugly thing, but defaulting on loans is uglier.. 

6.) Do I understand a disillusionment with the government, sure. Do I believe that I could change it, sure. If I ran for government. I would recommend every american who thinks that they can fix the problems in Washington, to run for office. Start at the local level, and then move to the Federal level. I think it is important also, that you focus on cutting your own paycheck while you are there. Most people do not want to fix the problem because they do not see a problem.

True,ayesee,dota2league,,"Folks, I've talked about this on my stream, on other streams, and in interviews, and I'm as serious about it as I've ever been with anything in my life:

**If you're a smoker, Electronic Cigarettes will change your life.**

I was a 2-pack a day smoker for about five years, and a smoker going back more than a decade. I tried my first eCig, decided to stop regular cigarettes cold turkey a week later (after I had smoked through those I had already bought), and I have not had a single cigarette since that time -- approximately 14 months.

It. Freaking. Works.

Let me list it out for you bit by bit:

* No more smelly clothes/hair/house

* All the nicotine, none of the carcinogens

* It is UNBELIEVABLY cheaper

* You can use eCigs ANYWHERE -- I use them in every restaurant, bar, airports, you name it.

* There are innumerable options in terms of flavors and nicotine content

* If your goal is to quit and not just switch to a better way of enjoying nicotine, this is without a doubt the most efficient way to taper down yet devised.

* Did I mention how much CHEAPER it is?

No joke, if you're a heavy smoker (1-2 packs a day), you'll be chewing through at least $150-200 a month minimum on your habit. 

Know how much my eCigs cost me? **Less than $100 per 3-4 months.**

It seems like most people don't wanna try it because they feel like it's too complicated, too niche, don't know what to buy, et cetera. And in fairness, if you just jump on a message board it's like anything else -- crazy lingo and so many options its overwhelming. Let me make it easy for you:

**What eCig Equipment To Buy:**

* [Joye eGo Starter Kit](http://www.ecigsupply.com/Joyetech-eGo-Starter-Kit_p_72.html) -- This is the exact kit I bought when I first got into vaping, and I rebuy a new kit every 3-4 months when the batteries start to wear out. Moreover, that link goes to the exact company I've been doing business with for more than a year. I'm in no way affiliated with them, so all you cynical minded, paranoid bastards can save your breath -- I'm endorsing them because in a year of doing business they've been great, not because I'm getting paid =)

* The system is simple. Charge the batteries, screw in the atomizer, drip the juice into the cotton filled cart (I'll get to juice a little later), put cart in atomizer, press the button, and inhale. You drip when the cart gets dry, you charge when the battery gets low. EZPZ. 

* [Replacement Atomizers](http://www.ecigsupply.com/Joye-510-Atomizer_p_14.html) -- The batteries outlast the atomizers (the little piece that actually vaporizes the juice), so when your vaping starts to seem a little thin compared to when it was fresh out of the box (usually 4-8 weeks per atomizer in my experience), all you have to do is buy a new atomizer, not a whole new kit.

* Eventually the batteries will get a little iffy, at which point it's usually worthwhile to just buy a new kit... but you get 2 batteries and 2 atomizers per kit, so it really isn't expensive at all. If you're a light smoker or someone looking to quit, a single kit will last you 6 months or longer. Me, being a heavy smoker, I get about 3-4 months per kit most often, with atomizers being between 4-8 weeks per.

* **NOTICE:** There's a TON of different variables from brand to brand, part to part, et cetera. What I've listed above is the starter kit plus the correct replacement atomizer JUST FOR THAT BRAND AND MODEL. If you want to get into it and experiment, just be very careful about mixing and matching, as there really is an ABSURD amount of technicality involved in what pieces work together.

**Dat Juice:**

* [Halo eLiquid](http://www.halocigs.com/e-liquid/eliquid.html) -- There is a metric shit ton of options available for juice... hundreds of companies, flavors, you name it. Personally, I use Halo eJuice because they're American made and very high quality. Feel free to explore on your own, but of all the brands I've tried (about a half dozen), I'm a sworn Halo user. Not to mention, their flavors are yummy.

**My Favorite Flavors**

* [Bella Valente](http://www.halocigs.com/bella-valente-cigar-eliquid.html) - My go-to flavor, and the one I use at least 75% of the time. If you're a former smoker -- especially one who enjoyed cigars-- this is definitely up your alley because it tastes VERY much like tobacco, with a nice hint of vanilla to it.

* [Smooth 8](http://www.halocigs.com/smooth8-eliquid.html) -- A bit more harsh, but in a good way. If you're the type who smokes unfiltered or Marlboro Reds, this is a good place to start. Tastes like very strong tobacco.

* [Tribeca](http://www.halocigs.com/tribeca-eliquid.html) - Really good place to start if you're a person who smokes light cigarettes. Very smooth with subtle flavors, all which simulate tobacco well. This is my go-to anytime I'm out of Bella and want something a little softer than Smooth 8.

* [Captain Jack](http://www.halocigs.com/captain-jack-eliquid.html) -- This shit is cray. There's really no other way to describe it. All I know is it is freaking DELICIOUS if you're drinking whiskey on the rocks or a strong stout beer. I don't use it often, but when I put it with the right beverage, it's amazing.

If you have questions, please ask them here, I'll be happy to respond. I really, really believe in this product, as I was on the way to speaking through a talk box and/or a black set of lungs if I hadn't have found a way to change my habits. I'd love to help others make that change, too... ESPECIALLY if I'm lucky enough to be invited back to cast The International again this year, and I can see all of you puffing away with no smell and no ashes =P

True,dave_L,win,,"The *real* culprit generate from that pesky *Hibernation/Sleep* option of Windows OEM. Windows had a couple of Hotfixes included somewhere (since XP &amp; up to win7) within earlier .Net/.Net1 and also security hotfixes. Within such updates, it also has HowTo for setting *work arounds*.

That particular oem ACPI option always interfere on auto-Update when left overnight (or more than a few hours untouch) and it somehow sets the drivers' *linkage Registry* askew and this is a well known Windows *Hibernation* setting's problem.

The *simple trick* to let Windows auto-reset/query for all drivers' proper listing on its Registry was to RESET through default BIOS setting... by disabling/enabling the CMOS Batt for 15secs or more, and unplugging from your A/C current. This process is known as expedited actual *cold-booting* (take note that it may not work on some particular mobos).

Once that CMOS batt was enabled and curent restored... the BIOS parameters has been set into default and the POST screen should automatically be manifested for resetting parameters and manual F10-saving. Once it has gone through the boot process and Windows OS appear and logon, one shall notice that the OS will automatically pop-out or prompt for all drivers' installation. EDIT : Addendum

At this final stage, do take note to disable *Hibernation*, check for Full win-Updates, and do the usual reboot. Once done, you are back to your original OS environment.

True,Liquor-is-Quicker,,,"I worked for an IT shop a long time ago. Some guy came in with a shuttle PC and had a ton of viruses. I called him up later and said I needed to wipe the machine, is there anything to back up? He was hesitant at first, but then said there were 2 folders on his computer that needed to be saved. I dont remember what they were named, but when I started the transfer, horrible filenames started flying by. I got my boss and he opened a few of them. CP. We called the cops. They came in and printed out every fucking picture found on the machine. They were there for 2 days.

They had us stall the guy for a few days. Saying the machine wasn't installing XP properly. Finally, they asked us to have him come in. 2 detectives and 4 cops were waiting for him. He didn't do anything. Not a word. Just cuffed and off to prison. I saw an article in the paper awhile later. I kept it for some time. 

About a month after everything died down, a lady came into our tech shop and wanted to talk to the tech who found the stuff. The guy at the counter said we weren't allowed to discuss it. She just said, ""Tell him my daughter has her life back.""

I read that he went to prison for 20+ years. I'll be forever haunted by what I saw on his computer. They actually had a counselor in house for our shop while the police were there. Being 22 at the time, I thought I was invincible. Terrible shit.

*EDIT* Jeez, I posted this before I left work and it blew up. I should clarify a few things. The cop had said sometimes these people need help and WANT to get caught. I dont know if that was the case or not. Also, 2 of the girls were his nieces. So it wasn't just some random act of ""I'm scowering the internet for CP."" He was actually taking the photographs and other terrible shit to them. HE was IN some of the pictures. That's the thing that cut the deepest. This wasn't some random, nameless victim.

True,yes_this_is_dan,,,"I agree with the argument that the theory of ""equal opportunity"" is unrealistic when you consider the lineage of wealth enjoyed by many upper- and upper-middle-class white people.

Something I never understood was why so many people treat AA as a binary issue, as if the only options are either to continue it as it has been, or dismantle it. If it is needed to balance the scales in favor of minorities ONLY BECAUSE they lack a lineage of wealth and privilege, then why not simply define AA as a mechanism to help ALL poor Americans? 

I am white, but I do not come from wealth, and I do not have any family connections. I am fortunate enough to attend an Ivy League school, but only because of generous financial aid (which is another debate in and of itself). I worked hard to get in, but I can see how poor people - preoccupied with things others don't have to worry about - could be at an enormous disadvantage. Leveling the playing field for ALL people of similar socio-economic status should be the priority. This shouldn't be a racial debate, but something that encompasses all skin colors.

True,LordKettering,,,"**Saratoga, 1777**

The dragoon got the jump on you. His saber slashed along your breeches, soaking the white wool until it drips with your blood. You clutch your musket in one hand, ignoring the searing heat of the overused metal barrel. Slowly and painfully, you hobble away from the fight. Beneath your gaiter, you can feel the blood trickling along your stocking and pooling in your cracked leather shoes. ""Devil take 'em,"" you curse through clenched teeth.

Hurrying toward the chattering report of musket volleys, an officer jogs from a stand of trees, sword in hand, leading a small party of hatmen. His eyes take you in, sizing you up. It's clear you're no deserter. With a simple nod to you, he moves on, the soldiers following. As long as you can move under your own power, it would be tactically irresponsible to detail soldiers to help you along.

You sway against your musket, following the rough route you had taken from camp toward the fight. It's not long before you come across a few more of the wounded. Some of them help each other. Those able to walk do their best to carry those who can't. An officer with a grievous wound to the chest is carried past you by four stout soldiers, none of them wounded. Every coughing breath he takes is accompanied by bubbling blood.

Passing troops of dragoons and companies of soldiers let you know you're heading in the right direction, along with numerous couriers and wagons of ammunition. At one point the gaggle of wounded part from the road, letting a gang of dragrope men drag an artillery piece toward the field.

Managing to stay on your feet, you walk to the large canvas fly set apart from the neat rows of tents and officers' marquees. Along with the others, you approach the fly, already emanating with the stench of blood. The surgeon's mate, Reide, is scrambling from one wounded man to the next, barking out orders to several of the soldiers' wives. They jog from one to the next, guiding them under trees and onto tables, dividing them as Reide sees fit. This is the rough form of triage your surgeon must use to treat those who most desperately need it.

Four stout soldiers pass, jogging back toward the field. The officer they had carried is nowhere to be found. When possible, officers and men alike were taken indoors to be treated, but the sparsely populated wilderness doesn't afford that space for all. The officer has been taken to a nearby manor house, as have many of the soldiers, but you've been unlucky enough to wind up under trees and canvas.

Flies pester and annoy you. Reaching to swat them, you fall. With a loud *thud* your body crumples into a heap on the grass. Reide jogs toward you, lifting you. Groaning in protest, you shut your eyes against the pain. Half dragged, you try to stand on your own, but manage little more than to push yourself with your one good leg toward the surgeon's table. Reide shoves a green glass bottle against your lips, pouring potent rum into your dry throat. You cough against it; it has been hours since you've last had water, much less hard liquor.

Your head spins in a haze, your eyes lose their focus. Reide draws away the bottle, but pushes against your chest insistently. Your blurred vision can't quite recognize the surgeon, but you can see the blade in his hand. With a skilled and practiced hand, he slices and cuts at your wound. You shout a slurred curse, ""Damn your eyes, you dog!""

Reide tries to comfort you, ""He's only cutting away the putrified flesh, it'll be over soon."" It's hard to take him at his word when he shoves yet another bottle against your lips.

The surgeon leans over with needle and thread. Quickly he lashes the string inside of you, tying off severed veins. ""It did not cut to the bone, thank Christ,"" he mutters the surgeon as he wipes away the sweat from his forehead, leaving a thin streak of your blood. Trading the stained needle for a frighteningly large one, he calls to Reide, ""Hold the wound closed.""

Inelegantly, Reide pushes your severed flesh together. You shout yet another curse, which grows only louder as the surgeon weaves the needle and thread through your flesh, closing the wound.

Without a moment to recover, a pair of soldiers' wives help you from the table, guiding you to a nearby pile of straw, covered in a woolen blanket. You lay back across the makeshift bed, writhing in pain.

True,Just_another_brother,,,"I work in a computer store where we custom build PC's and do repairs, a customer (around his late 30's) came in with his two toddler kids and had  an  old acer computer that wasn't booting, he didn't want it repaired he just wanted the data backed up, he specifically asked for emails, videos, photos and contacts he said the file size would be around 60 GB, so I sold him a 80Gb portable HDD.  He also wanted all the games the his children were  playing, Then he asked if if his documents would be secure, because he apparently was a victim of identity theft a few years ago. I told him his data would be backed up to our server and immediately deleted after it was transferred to a his hard drive.
So I start working on retrieving the data. 
Backed up his outlook files,
Backed up his address book,
Then I started on his photos and videos.
The documents folder only had a few photos and the OEM sample photos. so i assumed his photos were stored somewhere else, I started looking in other places. I found a folder in his C drive called ""Memories_2009_2012"" I opened it up to be complete shocked by its contents 12.7 gigabytes of child pornography! then my heart dropped when I recognised  his children in photos/videos. I was filled with rage, I felt like grabbing the hot soldering Iron beside me and shoving it up his arse. I spoke to the head technician in the back office and he said we needed to inform the police. I called the Police Beat (a small police office within the shopping centre) and explained the situation, the officer said to keep him there for 10min so he could send a some  officers to investigate.

I went back out to the front of the shop, and did my best to control my anger.knowing that the police would be here anytime I was relived.
I told him his data was copying to the new hard drive and would take around 10-15 minutes, he said he was going to browse the ""dick smith"" shop opposite our store until it was finished. I then started doing my Salesman Spiel  and got him interested in buying one of our laptops. 10 minutes later he decided to buy an asus laptop, I was getting nervous because the police hadn't shown up, as I was writing up the sale on the computer he asked if the data was backed up so I went out the back to the tech bench to check it ( I just opened up a few program's and made it look as if I was doing something) while I was doing that a man came up to me at the bench asking if we had fixed his laptop screen he said the head tech has it, so I took him to the back office to see the tech, which was when he told me he was a forensic technician just wearing casual clothes to avoid suspicion. He said he has 2 more officers outside the store to monitor the suspect and child services were on the way  , I show him the contents of the hard drive he skipped through the files with a plain face as me and the tech are horrified at what we are seeing, he confirms the fathers children are the ones in the video, and he checks the meta data to see the time stamps. He then informs us that his computer, hard drive and our server need to be seized as evidence , we happily say yes , and we both want to see this fucker behind bars. 

He pulls out his radio and informs the officers outside the report of CP on the hard drive, I go back out and see the officers walking in I lead them to the fucktard pedophile, relived that justice will be made. The officers arrest him and inform him what he is being charged with. He started saying that the computer isn't his, he says he found it at a garbage transfer station where he works. The officers make to comment and hand cuff him. At this point he children are crying hugging their dads legs, a child safety services officer try's to take the children into their custody and they wont let go of their father,they start kicking and screaming at officers, eventually the calm down and the child safety offices take them away. father was then taken to the station for further questioning I assume. The police question me and the head tech for a report, and we had to sign a contract saying that there are no other copy's of the illegal data and that we would not release any information about the children or the father to the media until he has been officially charged and to keep their identity hidden.

It was truly  one of the most disturbing things I have ever seen, a father abusing his own children and making extremely horrible videos of it. 

I had to testify in court about what happened on that day. 
He pleads not guilty, the police technicians also found out that he was distributing it via email and unloading them to ""the onion router"" (deep web) . They had enough evidence to put him away at a minimum of 6 years at a psychiatric prison. I believe this kind of crime should be ""25 to life""

I don't know the details of what happened to his children, as their identity a where protected.

The images if what I saw are burnt into my mind, every time I think about It I get really angry or upset.
Every time I see I child getting smacked for discipline my blood boils. ( I understand that discipline is necessary when raising children, but it just reminds me of those videos)  

Thank you for reading, I haven't told this to anyone except my psychologist or close family. 
I just wanted to get this story out 
and here anyone opinions on the topic and how to deal with it.

God, that sounded smug, didn't it?

This shit is what I do for a living.

The insurance company will pay for the dozer and the crane. They may even end up paying for the resulting damage to work that was already done, and delays to the project. Honestly, if they didn't pay in cases where the equipment was destroyed because the operator was a dumbass, they'd almost never pay a claim.

But they will also conduct a *very* thorough investigation into what happened, primarily so they can try to find someone, anyone other than their client, to pass the blame onto. With something like this, they'll make sure the crane was properly maintained so the alarms were working - if the construction company was farming out their maintenance, you could blame it on the 3rd-party mechanics. They'll make sure the dozer's weight was properly listed in the Operator's Manual. They'll make sure the compaction tests were done correctly on the soil the crane was sitting on. There are literally dozens of things someone else could have done (or failed to do) that contributed to this, and depending on what state you're in, that may be enough to make them share the financial burden.

All this is assuming that's not a rental crane with a rental operator, of course. You can't really tell that from the video. If it is, shit gets *really* complicated.

The *major* problem for the construction company is that they will probably be audited by the insurance company. They will go through training records, safety program documents, everything, with a fine toothed comb. If it turns out the company wasn't doing everything they were supposed to be (and most aren't) then the insurance company won't renew with them next year. They'll have to go with some other insurance carrier, and their rates will skyrocket.

How bad that hurts depends on how big the construction company is. This kind of accident puts smaller companies out of business all the time, but often people don't connect the dots because it doesn't happen until 2 or 3 years after the accident, when you just can't afford coverage anymore.

True,theremightbecoffee,,,"While there are many different styles of viruses and attacks, a lot of antivirus software deployed relies on a currently known threats or vulnerabilities. It is hard to defend against an unknown vector of attack (I use virus here generically), but some basic attacks/detections are as follows:

**Size**

An easy way to detect if a file has been altered is the size of the file. Some viruses like to tack on their malicious code at the end of the file, and that is a dead giveaway when an antivirus scanner scans it. It compares the before and after sizes, and if there has been no modification by the user, it suspects some malicious activity.

**Pattern Matching** 

Viruses often have a telltale signature that they use to infect your computer. It could be couple lines of assembly code that overwrite the stack pointer and then jump to a new line of code, it could be a certain series of commands that throw an error in a common application, or it could be using an unchecked overflow or memory leak to grab an exception thrown. Regardless, a lot of infectious software uses an reproducible exploit that is found on the target operating system or application, and those tell tale signs (because they have been spotted before) go into a huge database of known exploits and vulnerabilities. When your antivirus scans through it checks your programs for these malicious activities.

**Detecting Injections**

Since viruses like to use these known exploits, malware writers sometimes like to inject code into pre existing programs, like when you 'accidentally' installed that malicous program. These kinds of attacks typically inject code into dead regions of documents or files, and use a jump to go to the malicious code. To explain further, since blocks of memory are allocated to files, sometimes the very end of the memory block does not get used up, or in some cases, there are certain exploits within certain types of files that have legacy sections that are no longer used. This legacy section is a perfect spot to hide malicious code, since it does not increase the size of your program or file. An injection attack uses the initial startup code to 'jump' to the malicious code, and then 'jump' back, making it seem like nothing was ever wrong, and your program boots up perfectly. There are many many variations of this attack, but an antivirus program typically looks for those strange 'jumps' and code that looks like it doesnt belong in certain sections.

**Hashing**

Some antivirus programs analyze the programs/files byte for byte, and literally compute the sha-1 hash of the item it is detecting. It stores every single hash for everything on your system, and if the program has been modified it will not compute the same hash (that is the whole point of a hash, it changes drastically if only a tiny bit of the program/file changes). This detection is flawed, because if the virus discovers where all the hashes are stored or the algorithm used, it can overwrite the 'secure' hash with the malicious one and the antivirus will never know.

**Deeper Threats**

Whenever you start your computer, or plug an external device into it (hard drive, cd, usb, there are core drivers or 'code' that runs to setup the connections from your computer to the external device. Some viruses exploit this when the connection is being established, and could either execute arbitrary code (instead of the connection code) or can become a man in the middle, where everything acts fine but the virus is actually the one creating the connection, as well as inserting its own code where ever it feels like. Since these threats can work themselves deep within the operating system and core functions, these are extremely hard to detect. If the deeper OS calls are not compromised, like the antivirus calls to the OS, then these attacks can be detected. If the whole system is compromised, then the virus is embedded so deep that you some times have no choice but to wipe it and hopefully do a fresh install. If the code that starts up your operating system is compromised, you have even bigger problems because wiping will not get rid of it.

Hopefully this is in layman enough terms for anyone to understand, I didnt rely on any references so please leave a comment correcting me (I will probably be asleep). Hopefully I will wake up tomorrow morning and everyone will understand the basics of computer infections and detections.

True,commecharles,,,"Hi, final year as a DART student here.
The program's getting better, and better. 
1st year: expect some 3D, building a stool out of cardboard, drawing circles and lines without rulers. Look out for the maquette, wood working, metal labs. Book early if you'll be needing to create some 3d objects (They fill up quickly). Learn how to use markers. Damn.
** Do get FFAR done asap. 
2nd year: expect to start thinking about sustainability, stakeholders. Get familiar with the Cradle to Cradle concept. Start documenting your work a lot. They call this DOP (document of process). Choose your teammates wisely (lots of group work! If you are good at making presentation layouts then I say volunteer to do them). You will be thinking more than actually doing.  You will learn how to layout books and start binding too. (Sewing skills will get hot). 
3rd year: I took a year off to work full time. 
4th year: If you are into typography, look out for Nathalie Dumont. Very knowledgeable prof; do get ready for iterations. (Here your first or tenth idea is never good). Santo Romano is web. Do take him whenever you can. Oh, and Dart481 (DansLaRue) 6-credit course. Do it. 

Bon;
No matter the project, always try to ""bend the program"". Always make work that look and feel real. Don't try to be too conceptual. (It's easy to get carried away, especially at Concordia). Simplest ideas are the easiest to present. 

2 absences = a  full grade lower. Damn. 

Pay your CDA fees (45$) on your first day of class (and this, every new semester).  It's in a whole different building (7 mins walk away - but the lineups get long at the art store). 

Behance, designspiration, bench.li, dribbble. Copy if you must. 

Try open source fonts. (Fontsquirrel, google web fonts, losttype.com)

Try to be nice when critiquing. You will spend hours critiquing others work. 

Silkscreening, photography, web design come in handy. 

Get familiar with your printers. Rubiks.ca. I suggest you find another place (since most seem to go there). 

You won't have to buy any books! All pdf downloads. If you do need books, do go to the BANQ. Get some design books there. They are free (just keep renewing the rental). They come in handy when needing ""sources outside of the internets"". 

You don't have to write many essays; but when you do, it's MLA. 

Take online classes for your electives. I took all business classes. 

Try to maintain a 3.3 gpa. (Useful for independent studies, internships). 

You don't need a laptop. I prefer working on the iMac in the open labs. 

Try to bring a lunch; Café X is cheap; cocobun at the metro level is also inexpensive.

You have to understand some things about the situation.

1. I was a corporate technician for a big box retailer.

2. The client's wallpaper was a gaping asshole.

3.  I was in the client's home.

I had worked on this guys computers a couple of times, both in the store and at his home, and he seemed like a nice enough guy, weird, but nice enough. This is the South, you cut people slack for being a little weird. He had one of the malware packages that hides your files and says that you are experiencing hard drive issues. 

I was in the midst of cleaning it up, and copying the backed up files to the proper locations, when the file names going by were named things like child.jpg, teenz.jpg and the like. This guys had a lot of porn he wanted backed up, but he didn't have kids from the off hand conversations we had. Then the pictures folder generated large thumbnails and the blood drained from my face.

I wrote up the notes and fortunately his service was covered under a warranty service call, so I didn't have to talk with him, but I had to poker face my way through a final conversation with him before leaving very quickly. 

I called my boss, then I called the police, wrote a deposition and worked with the sheriff's office and state law enforcement to aid in the investigation. My written deposition got a warrant and when they claimed the computer it had enough CP to put him in prison for 10 years.

Just before the warrant was served I was so scared. I had never been in a situation like that in my life. I bought a shotgun for home defense, I was worried he might find out and come after me. It turned out okay in the end, and I'm glad that he was put away. 

What they don't tell you is that there is guilt when you do the right thing. You ask yourself if you actually did do the right thing. Now I do, but it has taken me some time to get here.

I don't do that kind of field work anymore. I'm a sysadmin now, and life is much different. If you want more stories, come join us over at /r/talesfromtechsupport and see what kind of a difference good IT can make.

Allow me to explain.  I'm a nerd.  Most would enhance that to ""fucking nerd,"" ""giant nerd,"" or ""oh god, not that guy again.""  I like to do nerdy things.  I like to watch nerdy movies.  My computer desktop right now--dual monitor 1080p--is an abstract Darth Vader desktop that I customized myself.  Nerdy, kay?

So I was interested in this girl.  She'd shown up one night out of the blue at the comic shop where I played Friday Night Magic: The Gathering (Nerdy, right?).  I'd talked to her for a couple of weeks, and we'd played some Magic.  Finally, I screw up the courage to ask her out between rounds.  Before she can answer, pairings were posted for the third round of the tournament.  We were playing each other.  She tells me that her answer would depend on the outcome of the match.  I knew for a fact that my deck would beat hers.  I took a deep breath, and played it straight, deciding not to insult her intelligence by throwing the match.  She teases me for the rest of the night, but eventually agrees to the date.

We go out to a local restaurant.  The evening goes well; conversation is brisk and chipper, the food is great, and the atmosphere rather romantic.  As I'm getting the bill, she leans over the table, bats her eyes at me, and says, ""So... you wanna come over to my place tonight?""  My heart froze.  She continued, after letting me feel like a deer in headlights for a moment, ""I've got Star Wars, if you want to watch it.""

My response?  ""Yes.  Yes, I would.""  We spent the night cuddling while Luke blew up the Death Star, and I literally staggered back to my dorm that night--it was then that I knew that I'd never fall for another girl again.

It's been nine years since then.  We're getting married this fall.  We're still madly, head-over-heels in love with each other, flirt relentlessly with each other, and pine for one another on the days we're apart.  Our secret?  Believe it or not, friendship.

We make pointless romantic gestures to each other whenever we can.  We respect each other, and help without hesitation when the other needs it, no matter what.  Every day, I fall in love with her all over again, and each day is better than the last, because I don't just love her, I trust her, I like her, I'm impressed by her, and I'm inspired by her--and she says the same about me.

If it were just love, we probably would've parted company long ago.  What keeps us together, what makes our relationship vibrant, is everything else.  I don't just love her.  I'm not just attracted to her.  Both of those things are true, in fairness.

What really does it, in the end, is the fact that I've never in my life had as much *fun* as I have when I'm with her.

Edit: I don't know what to say, guys.  I stuck my face in some student essays for a few hours and now I find Bestof and Reddit Gold?  I promise to give her a big, wet, obnoxious smooch for y'all when she gets home from work.

True,jarredfetus,,,"I've been playing Source for over 3000 hours my biggest accomplishment playing in ESL Major series in that game. If people are going to dish out advice they should preface their posts with their experience, some of the advice here is not of great quality.

First off, you are playing on 64 tick servers in MM so make sure you are playing on 64 tick DM servers. (In all honesty 64 tick is a joke and I urge you to get into a team of your caliber and playing with them. Counter Strike should not be a solo experience nor should it be played on a tickrate of 64 when 128 is available. But do what you think is fun, it's a game.)

Now...
You have a fundamental misunderstanding of what you accomplish by going on a DM server, like most people do.

Your KDR(kill to death ratio) is not important so I urge you to unbind tab. It makes the whole experience much less frustrating. 
You can unbind it by typing: unbind tab in console. When you want to see scores again for a match type: bind tab +showscores. You can probably find a way to do this in options as well. 
While you are at it unbind control(ctrl). It's the easiest way to reduce your spraying. Crouching is not very good anyways since you instantly become a stationary target easy to kill. I've had the problem of crouching and spraying to much and after a while I realized I had played many matches without ctrl binded. It is as far as I'm concerned the most effective solution in reducing unnecessary spraying. 

What you want to do when you are on DM is simulate an ingame situation. Say you are running out of A-lobby into long, how would you peek the angles in a match? 
First we would check the corner of blue container, next we check the corner at long, then we go out of the lobby and we peek pit, then we clear the bricks next to blue container on our left, then we check the far right corner on the right side of pit, then we peek long or clear pit. Every single time you go into long you peek it and go through all the motions you would(or should) do in a match.

If you have no special way of peeking corners or entering territory where the enemy could be you are a bad player and need to learn how to properly check everything. It is a simple exercise in logic but watching pro players can help. Look at how a team on DD2 as terrorists take over long for example. And as they run out of long lobby how what they check first and where their crosshair is.

Think about it this way: There is a correct way to peek every single angle in this game. I can enter long from A-lobby as a terrorist and if I peek my angles right I maximize my chances of getting a kill.

To be good on DM means you are always checking the radar, always turning around looking at spawns, and not very often focusing on corners like you do in a game. Stop thinking about score on DM and start focusing on killing the enemy you face fast. You are not on DM to get good at playing DM.

If someone flanks you it doesn't matter. If someone spawns behind you it doesn't matter. If you fail to kill the guy who you face when checking your angles you failed and should feel awful. If you were in a game that played would have killed you. If you face an enemy and spend 3 seconds spraying and kill him in the end very slowly with your pistol you have failed and should feel awful. His teammates would most likely already have killed you in a match. 
If you peek a corner and your crosshair placement is so perfect you don't even have to touch your mouse just tap left click getting a headshot giving the guy no chance of killing you, you have succeeded.  If you peek a corner and kill the enemy you face with a single burst in under a second, ready to face the next enemy quickly, you have succeeded.

Since most servers for various reasons only have DD2 playing you will improve most on DD2. Your peeks on other maps will be lacking but the concept is still the same. You can practice your peeks alone, finding the best way to enter ramp on Nuke or how to peek Arch and Quad in Inferno. Practice it, find smokes to help you with your peeks (for example smoking off Quad in Inferno and peeking Arch). 

And then, when you are in an MM game, you are sitting outside ramp in Nuke as terr, you know how you want to peek, you execute your strat, you throw your smoke you throw your flashes, they land where you want them to land, you execute, you peek your corners, you see and enemy, you shoot him in the head with 2 bullets, turn around, and since you didn't spray you can quickly dispose of the next guy, you have gotten 2 entry kills in a match, gotten ramp control and if you were in a real match the round is just about over. In MM your team is probably all sitting outside dead but that's another matter.

True,CoCJF,,,"I don't know what's happening to me. It's been a few months since I was warped into this world. I'm starting to think it's real... 

I remember sitting there on my parents couch, opening Oblivion for the first time, the *excitement* of the moment as I closed the tray. I never imagined what would happen. I don't know what's been happening in that other world. My parents probably went ballistic when they couldn't find me. Only a plastic wrapper from the case, a half empty soda bottle and the beginning screen of Oblivion playing over and over again, but what's the point in worrying...

When I woke up after first blacking out, I was stuck in a cell. There were chains hanging on one side, the bones from a previous occupant, the smell of death and decay...

The only other person there started mouthing off about how I was going to die as I tried to understand what was happening. Then he asked me if I could hear them as the sound of boots coming down the stairs reached my ears. ""You're going to die in here, Imperial,"" he said as a man in armor stood in front of the door. I was paralyzed.

""Stand back, prisoner,"" the man said in an authoritative voice after conversing with his companions. I didn't understand, I was already huddled into a ball on the sorry excuse for a bed they had in there. The door swung open, as if by magic and the man walked in. As he walked towards me, I saw another man. He was wearing expensive looking clothes and some jewelry. He paused in front of me as the man in armor moved towards the wall nearby. That's when I noticed the other two guards.

""I'm going to die here. I'm going to die a virgin in a dungeon and my bones will haunt the next person to die here,"" I thought. Tears began to form in my eyes. One of them slid down my cheek as the man with the jewelry said, ""You... I've seen you..."" He then started to spout out nonsense about dreams and gods. I didn't listen, I was too concerned with my impending death. After more nonsense, one of the guards opens some kind of secret passageway in my cell and the group moves on. I follow them, thinking they'll lead me to freedom.

Suddenly, men in robes appear and attack the group. You couldn't imagine how afraid I was as armor and weapons appear on them in clouds of yellow smoke. I froze as the group mercilessly massacres the people in robes. The smell of blood was everywhere.

After several more attacks, one of the guards die. One of the other guards tells me I can't follow them and locks the gate leading on behind him. The sound of crumbling rock follows as a giant rat leaps for my throat. I manage to avoid the feral beast and manage to grip the sword of the fallen guard just in time to stab the rat before it ripped out my jugular.

Trembling and covered in blood, I begin to cry again. ""I'm going to die!"" I wail as my last defense come crumbling down. After several hours of self-pity, I managed to stand up. ""If I'm going to die here, then I'll die fighting to freedom,"" I said to myself as I began to scavenge for anything I could use from the bodies. ""And I'm going to make it damn hard to kill me.""

Everybody loves how even 10 years later they can take each of those games out and play them again.  The full package, even the expansions.



Not everyone loves that EA is forcing the game to be always on internet - saying its designed from the ground up for multiplayer but really its to prevent piracy and further promote their in game purchases, destroying the 2nd hand games market.

Not everyone loves that when it is online on average consumes 40MB an hour of their bandwidth.

Not everyone loves waiting AGES to connect after buying the game because they are in a queue.

Not everyone loves waiting AGES to connect after buying the game because they got disconnected not just from EA (repeatedly) but because their internet is not that great either.

Not everyone appreciates that even though the game costs up to £70/$70 for the 'full' game - they are going to be micro-transactioned to death as if it was freemium, even though they paid full whack.

Not everyone loves that in 5 - 10 years time when they've put $300+ into the game, EA might decide it's time for a new one and turn the servers off at a whim.  You can't resale, cant replay and your invested money is gone.

Not everyone loves massive corporations that think they are god, buy up the fantastic developers out there such as Bullfrog or Maxis and run them straight into the ground.  Not everyone loves how EA can tie up sporting rights and contracts for decades at a time while re-releasing the same old crap just with updated stats, a new year (and micro-transactions)

Not everyone loves EA for what they have done to their favorite games over the years and it hurts them even more when it's one they loved so much.

Everybody loves Simcity gamerj9212.  They just want their games to remain games and not turn into profiteering rackets by incompetent greedy companies.

It hurts that I vote with my wallet and that I refuse to ever buy anything on Origin/EA for the reasons above.  I also hope others do too, maybe one day I'll get to love Simcity again, Syndicate or the next Dungeon Keeper?

I've only listed a few reasons why folk dislike EA, the longer the list grows so does the list of people that hate them, I'm curious what others I've missed - reddit is free to add to it.

(( Btw, Westwood,  Bullfrog, DAOC/mythic , Origin Systems, Maxis etc were my favorite developers from my own youth, it's almost like having children, giving them the best education you can - and then watching them turn into crack whores and heroin junkies ))

It's not because we don't care, it's because we care too much.

**Reddit's remarks on the translation**

Some of you have rightly pointed out that the sources have all relied upon translations into English. Could this have been another scandalous mistranslation, much like Ahmadinejad's infamous remarks on Israel? A growing consensus seems to indicate that North Korea's message was very strongly worded and threatening -- but less subjective in tone. Overall, it could be summarized that the English-language press has accurately paraphrased the Foreign Ministry, but did not perfectly capture its message.

/u/ideocl4st has an excellent full translation that should be read by everyone. You can find the full translation [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldpolitics/comments/19un0o/linebyline_translation_of_available_script_of_nks/). Small edits made by me for grammar.

(Key Resolve/[Foal Eagle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foal_Eagle) ) is an exercise of launching nuclear war against North Korea that aims for preemptive strike. Gone are the chances to resolve this by diplomatic means, but only military response remains.""

&gt;""Forging so-called 'Resolutions' in United Nations Security Council to justify their invasion, and undergoing invasion while acting under the guise of UN Peacekeepers is a hackneyed method of war for United States. (They are) looking for a way out of their domestic economic crisis by provoking a 2nd Chosun (Korean) War.

&gt;""As long as the United States is trying to light the fuse of nuclear war, our revolutionary might is going to exercise the right of a pre-emptive nuclear strike against the invaders' stronghold to protect this nation's prime interest.

&gt;""As long as the United States attempts to light the fuse of nuclear war, *(we) will exercise the right for preemptive nuclear strike on the aggressor's homeland/base*... At a time when a second Korean War has become difficult to avoid, we solemnly warn the UN Security Council not to repeat the sinful/criminal mistakes.""

So there are slight differences from AP, Reuters, and RT's translations, but the gist is the same. You can view their post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/19u5mp/n_korea_threatens_preemptive_nuclear_strike/c8retic?), so be nice and shower him/her with upvotes.

[NPR](http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2013/03/07/173712148/u-n-security-council-approves-new-sanctions-on-north-korea) has an alternative interpretation of the word ""aggressor,"" suggesting the word in Korean is more akin to ""invaders."" Thanks to [demoux](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/19u5mp/n_korea_threatens_preemptive_nuclear_strike/c8rfdsb?context=0) for pointing this out!

True,[deleted],,,"It doesn't take much to pull someone back from the brink. 

I remember coming back from combat and feeling more alone than I've ever felt. I had friends and family telling me that they understood and they could hear about what I had to do. I knew that they'd never get it. So gave them all the answers that they wanted to hear. They thought I was fine. They didn't know that I was making plans to hang myself with the rope I used for helicopter Ops as a Ranger. 

I was getting ready to roll out when I heard this pitiful yowling outside my apartment door. It was this little orange cat. She was pretty skinny. I was like, ""Fuck it. I can feed this cat. It's not like I'm going to eat this tuna"". After looking around my apartments, I found out that a couple had abandoned this cat and left her to die in the middle of winter.

After I found out she had no family, I pretty much adopted her. That kind of fucked up my suicide plans. I couldn't kill myself because I now had a cat that relied on me. I will say this, anytime I have bad thoughts about the war, my cat is there like she knows. I saved her, and she saved me. It's the little things that'll pull you back from the brink.

Edit: this is my [kitty](http://i.imgur.com/ZK8daRP.jpg) . She's going two years strong. And if anyone is wondering about my combat record, those are my canes in the background. 

Dudes, don't pay money for this. This is one patch in the quilt that history will sew together as the war.

True,[deleted],,,"Don't take it personally. What you are seeing is not, in fact, a real or even relevant assessment of your various human qualities, but instead an artifact of the large population you're sampling. 
 
When posting to the internet, we have a tendency to forget just how enormous our audience is. Take this post I'm replying to; if merely half of the TwoX subscribers check reddit today, that's still ~64.000 people that will potentially see your picture and decide whether or not they care. 
 
For reference, [this](http://media.courierpress.com/media/img/photos/2010/03/22/APTOPIX_South_Africa__Reyn_t607.jpg) is Cape Town Stadium at capacity (55.000 people). Now, merely out of the people you personally know, how many are prone to negative outbursts when they have bad days, how many get easily annoyed, etc.? In fact, if you think about it for a while, how often do you get annoyed in traffic at complete strangers for no better reason than that they're there? Now imagine standing up in front of Cape Town Stadium and saying, well, anything. Merely by chance, *some* of those people are going to be having a bad day, and some of *those* people will be in such an emotional state as to be vexed to an irate response. Not because there's anything wrong with *you*, or them, but simply because such are the odds given the human condition and a large amount of people. 
 
And that is just the will-be-there-no-matter-what proportion of negative responders. Then you could add individuals with a higher likelihood of negative response, either because they've just been broken up with, or that they have a complicated fear of rejection and are intimidated by beautiful women, or anything along those lines. They will see your pictures and come to completely unrelated emotional conclusions, not because there's anything wrong with you or them, but because human emotional development is a complicated stochastic process and there's bound to be some of them. 
 
All you can really do is love yourself and love them.

True,Flashnewb,,,"Definitely acquire an appreciation for wine. It is, without doubt, the most socially acceptable drink to order when you aren't on steady footing with the company, the venue or the event sophistication. Spirits and cocktails are either too strong or too quickly consumed to be proper social beverages, and beer has a tendency to make you burp and is best consumed in comfortable company. What's left? Wine. Restaurant lunch. Fancy dinner. Mingling with guests at a function. Business lunch. Casual seaside picnic. Upscale party where you don't know many people. All ideal wine times.

First of all, the only rules are: *Do not* drink sweet/dessert wines and believe you've made it into the connoisseur's lounge. *Do not* drink wine out of a cask (I think Americans call it a box) under any circumstances. I've heard rumours about wine in a can. I hope they are not true.

Try and make yourself familiar with wine varieties and regions. It really isn't that hard once you get started. White wines range from very dry (which is sort of tangy/sour and yet neither of those things) to very sweet (sugary, syrupy sweet). Red wines are much heavier and stronger, and can be mild and warm (Merlot) ranging all the way to fruity and flavorful (Cab Sauv) to spicy and hot (Shiraz). There are few sweet reds that are not fortified (port - traditionally a nightcap drink) or blended with whites (rose). Regions are just 'where the wine comes from', which makes a difference but not as much as the wine variety. For example, a Shiraz from California is called a 'Syrah' and is typically deep red. A Shiraz from Australia is typically deep purple. It's all academic. Try a bunch of them. The rest will sort itself as you go.

There is no correct way to open a wine bottle or drink it from the glass. Pour it and go. You'll see people swirling and sniffing and biting it and all manner of stuff. Let them go for it, they're having fun. What matters is sipping the wine and enjoying the taste and smell. You don't need to swirl and sniff and do a handstand to make that happen. 

Don't panic about matching wine to food. The loose guide is match the colour of the wine to the meat you're eating. Red meat, red wine. White meat, white wine. That's it. Beyond that, go by your taste buds alone. You'll pick up what tastes nice with wine as you go. As mentioned above, olives and cheese are common favourites. 

People will swear black and blue that there are *specific wines* for specific foods, but these people are largely making it up. Your own taste determines which wine you want to drink. Humour these people, for they will not be howled down, but take their advice with a grain of salt. They're likely just regurgitating what a posh uncle once told them, which they then converted to gospel. I say again. The only determination of a good tasting wine is your tongue. 

Remember that rule, because it applies to price as well. Try all kinds of price ranges if you can, but never make the mistake of believing expensive = better taste. Incorrect. Better taste = better taste. Your mouth will tell you which one that is. If it happens to be a $4 of cleanskin plonc, congratulations, you will save a lot of money over the years. If it happens to be a $60 bottle of reserve New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc, great. Fork it out. It's worth it *only* if you actually enjoy it.

Learn to appreciate wine and you'll always have a readily available drink that won't disassociate you from the company you're in. It's a drink that matches your circumstances. You'll look sophisticated in sophisticated company, you'll look casual in a relaxed atmosphere, you'll look professional in a business setting. Beer and spirits can't offer that. Wine is an easier and tastier drink than a lot of younger people give it credit for, and it is to their detriment. Give it a try. You'll never regret it.

Unless you become an alcoholic, in which case, you didn't hear about any of this stuff from me.

tl;dr - Wine.

*edit* - an extremely nice person sent me reddit gold, and I thank you heartily. I can finally find out what that is.

* North Korea bolstered by the lack of any real US response invades South Korea, against China's wishes. At this point the US is drawn in to the conflict and actual fighting begins. 
* Meanwhile, due to the focus of the world on the Far East, Russia and Iran increase serious aid to al-Assad in Syria. With the US and some of her allies tied up, it comes down to European powers feeling obligated to increase aid to the rebels. 
* Israel strikes Iran in the chaos, forcing the Iranian government to openly declare war.

This war lasted almost 50 years and battles took place all over the globe.

Many countries were invaded and taken over (Poland, Hungary, etc) and hundreds of thousands of people died.  Millions more almost died during the Cuban Missile Crisis.  So the cold war wasn't cold at all.  WWIII wouldn't have started with global nuclear war, it would have ended with it.

And if you want to get crazy, you could argue that we're 12 years deep into World War IV, also known as the global war on Terror.  Islamic Extremists attacked the American home front and the USA and our allies responded by launching a world wide war against ""terror.""

True,[deleted],,,"Brussels sprouts...so, you hate them because of how your mom made them when you were a kid, you say?

Yo momma don't know nothin' 'bout cookin' up some brussels sprouts. She probably *boiled* or *steamed* them without much seasoning, which produces mushy, revolting shit.

This is what you do:

Get your ass to the grocery store and pick up one of those little sacks of fresh brussels sprouts in the produce section. Shrink-wrapped? Fuck that noise, these bitches need to breathe to stay healthy and fresh. While you're there, get some kickass organic unsalted butter and kosher salt if you don't already have it.

Take those lovely little green bundles of joy home. Dump out that bag on your cutting board, and cut each one in half. But wait, you say, shouldn't I wash them first?? Shut the fuck up and do what I tell you. You cut them in half so that when you wash them, any grit that might be between the leaves gets washed out. Remember these are basically baby cabbages and they've been close to the dirt. I can't believe I even have to say this, but make sure you cut them *lengthways* because you need the solid part at the bottom to hold the whole fucking business together. If you cut them crossways you're gonna have a bad time.

Get a non-stick pan super fucking hot. Does your stove go to eleven? If it doesn't, then you may have a problem. Depending on how many sprouts you are preparing, you're going to want to chuck 2-4 tablespoons of butter in that pan once it is hot. If the pan doesn't instantly turn into a sizzling, bubbling pool of melted butter, IT ISN'T HOT ENOUGH. Now, toss your sprouts in that buttery goodness, cut side down. Sprinkle some kosher salt on top. Shake things around a bit to get the butter evenly distributed, but not enough to flip any of the sprouts. Turn the heat down and don't fucking touch anything for a few minutes.

You'll start to notice a distinct aroma, one which I doubt you previously associated with this vegetable. What you're smelling is the sprouts getting *browned*, which is the key to delicious sprouts! Pick one up with a pair of tongs and check out that browning action. Check them all until you are satisfied with the level of browning. Then, flip each one so that the other side can get browned. You may discover at this point that they have soaked up most of the butter. This is a good thing. If the pan is getting too dry, chuck some more butter in, you stupid fuck.

When they're browned a bit, but not too much, on the outside...they're ready. Season as desired; I like to sprinkle a bit of garlic powder and cracked pepper on them. If they seem a bit tough to you, don't be such a fucking pussy. Think about all the wonderful vitamins and minerals, not to mention fiber you're getting because they didn't get boiled away by your mom. If you simply *must*, you can cover them with foil for a few minutes to let them steam *briefly* and that will soften them a bit.

The flavor is...very different from what you'd expect. Nutty. Savory. Wait, is this really a vegetable?!? This shit is *good* for me?!? Well, I'll be fucked sideways.

Also, I'm sure your mom is a classy lady. Even if she doesn't know how to make good Brussels sprouts.

True,etrnloptimist,,,"The reason unicode is hard to understand is because ascii text, which is just a particular binary *encoding,* looks for all the world like it is understandable by examining the raw bytes in an editor. To understand encodings and unicode, however, you should try really hard to *pretend* you cannot understand the ascii text at all. It will make your life simpler.

Instead, let's take an analogy from music files like mp3. Say you wanted to edit a music file. To change the pitch or something. You'd have to convert the compressed music *encoding* which is mp3 into its raw form, which is a sequence of samples. You need to do this because the bytes of an mp3 are incomprehensible as music. (By the way this is exactly what a *codec* does, it decodes the mp3 to raw samples and plays them out your speakers.) 

You'd do your editing. Then, when it's time to make it a music file again, you'd convert it back, *encode* it, if you will, back into an mp3.

Treat text the same way. Treat ascii text as an unknowable blob. *Pretend* you can't read it and understand it. Like the bytes of an mp3 file. 

To do something with it, you need to convert it to its raw form, which is unicode. To convert it, you need to know what it is: is it latin-1 encoded / ascii text? Is it utf-8? (similarly, is it an mp3 file? Is it an AAC file?). And, just like with music files, you can *guess* what the encoding is (mp3, aac, wav, etc.), but the only foolproof way is to know ahead of time. That's why you need to provide the encoding.

Only when it is unicode can you begin to understand it, to do stuff with it. Then, when its time to save it, or display it, or show it to a user, you encode it back to the localized encoding. You make it an mp3 again. You make it ascii text again. You make it korean text again. You make it utf-8 again.

At this point, you cannot do anything with it besides copy it verbatim as a chunk of bytes.

This is the reason behind the principle of decode (to unicode) early, stay in unicode for as long as possible, and only encode back at the last moment.

    Day 3: Indian forces begin to receive new orders for war games near the north west border, as a 
           show of force against Pakistan. 

    Day 7: The army is in place. New orders are received to load real ammunition instead of practice 
           ammunition in tanks.

    Day 8: Non nuclear missile strike against Pakistani nuclear installations. Army ordered to begin 
           amassing on the border. President contacts the USA and requests they do not interfere.

    Day 9: Pakistani nuclear capacity mostly negated. Further strikes against non-nuclear military 
           targets begin. Invasion begins.

    Day 10: Pakistan retaliates by shelling the border. Plans are made for a tactical nuclear strike 
           against the main force of the Indian army.

    Day 17: India takes Lahore.

    Day 20: Pakistan initiates a successful tactical nuclear strike against an Indian forward operating 
           base near Lahore.

    Day 25: Invasion has wound down as Indian forces regroup. Pakistan, spurred by the success of 
           their first strike, initiate another nuclear strike against an Indian supply base in Indian territory.

    Day 29: India retaliates with a strategic nuclear strike against Pakistani forces amassing at Multan.

North Korea is a laughable threat as they are still trying to perfect ICBMs that US, UK France, Russia and China all had effective countermeasures for since the 70's. Any detected launch will be shot down within half an hour of launch. Moreover Russia and The US still have active air force strategic bombing fleets and each have at least 5 attack subs with ~30 nuclear warheads per sub in their pacific arsenal.  I could see a conventional war in the Korean peninsula but it would hardly be WWIII. No large country in its right mind would ally itself with NK. Russia and China will be passive allies and most likely wouldn't even provide aid besides food for fear of trade sanctions. Iran will not  be able to  do shit to help with its limited force projection. 


Middle east is another story. Israel has enough of an Air Force and missile defense system to effectively stave off Iran or Syria or both. That conflict will stay regional. The civil war in Syria wont bring in outside powers if it hasn't already. Civil war in Afghanistan is a little more tricky because The US and Russia both have Military installations there and they would be forced to either defend or abandon them. 

China and Japan will be a regional conflict (if that) because neither has power has enough of a navy to threaten invasion of the other and both have antiaircraft systems harmful enough  to deter bombings. the war would basically be over air and water. 


Mali and the rest of Africa will probably only draw NATO attention with  no serious protest from Russia or China, (see Libya) 


Pakistan and India are both aware that any war between them is mutually assured destruction.  Its hostile but its a stalemate (see Cold war). 

This is not even mentioning the fact neither Russia nor the US nor China are ready for large scale mobilization. The reason Russia is running all these drill and spending all this money on defense lately is because it is correcting its force readiness from crappy performance that it saw in Georgia in 2008. The US is tied up  in Iraq and Afghanistan and any further operations would force drastic expansion of the defense department by either bringing old assets (mostly Navy and Air force) out of mothball or straight up buying new equipment. There's simply no money for either one. China's navy and air force are scrapped together from old soviet equipment or knock offs of old soviet equipment. Their army is a little better but without a way to project it anywhere it is effectively meaningless.

True,[deleted],,,"I really wish atheists/theists would stop using ""agnostic"" as an adjective. But moreso theists, because I am a theist.

Do you think ""God exists"" is true? If yes, you're a theist. It doesn't mean you know God exists, it just means you believe that God exists. You could be wrong, as we all could be wrong. 

Do you think ""God exists"" is false? Great. You're an atheist.

Do you think ""God exists"" cannot currently, and maybe will never be able to, be assigned a truth value? Great. You're agnostic.

Do you think ""God exists"" is a nonsensical proposition because there isn't a coherent definition of ""God""? Great. You're an ignostic.

Have you never heard of ""God""? Great. You're a theological non-cognitivist.

Don't give a shit? Great. You're an apatheist.

Are you something other than a theist? Great. You're a non-theist.

These labels have precise meanings that are able to accurately convey information about your beliefs. In my opinion using these labels is preferable because they each express something about that which they refer.

""Agnostic"", as a modifier, is redundant. ""Gnostic"" does not mean ""has knowledge"" in the way we normally use the term ""knowledge"", which is a ""justified true belief"". ""Gnostic"" refers to a specific type of revelatory knowledge from God. There are no ""Gnostic atheists"". It's a walking contradiction, ""revelatory knowledge from God that there is no God"".

There are Gnostic theists, but that doesn't mean that they have a ""justified true belief"" that God exists. It just means that they believe God has revealed Himself to them personally in ways that one cannot obtain through the use of reason. 

We all all ""agnostic"" in the sense no one can prove that ""God exists"" is true or false and thus none of us have knowledge (justified **true** belief) that God exists or not. Still, people generally think God exists or think God doesn't exist (both of which are beliefs which need to be justified as true by the person who holds them in order for the person to be considered rational, even if others don't agree with the justification and don't accept it as true). If we think God exists, we simply think that we have sufficient justification for believing ""God exists"" is true, and are theists. If we think God doesn't exist we think we have sufficient justification to believe ""God exists"" is false, and are atheists. If we do not think there is sufficient justification to believe ""God exists"" is true or false, we are agnostics.

Fuck it's not hard. I'm a theist and it irks me more when someone describes themselves as ""agnostic theist"" because it allows atheists to wiggle out of having to present any justification for their very real belief that God does not exist by claiming ""oh I'm not making a claim, no burden of proof. I'm not saying God doesn't exist..."" and then in the next sentence they call theists deluded or worse for believing God exists. 

There is only one reason to be a theist or an atheist. You think you have sufficient justification to believe that God does(n't) exist. If you don't think you have sufficient justification, you're agnostic, and there is certainly nothing wrong with that. It is an honest position. 

These ""agnostic atheists"" are either atheists who are cowards/irrational, anti-theistic agnostics, or just people who have been taught how to use language poorly. I find none of these options an acceptable usage of the terms ""agnostic atheist"" (and hold a special contempt for the cowardly atheists who refuse to justify their belief that God doesn't exist), and calling oneself an ""agnostic theist"" just lends credence to their incredulity. 

""Agnostic atheist"" is irrational or redundant. If ""atheism"" is merely a lack of belief that ""God exists"" is true, ""agnostic"" adds no further information as a modifier of atheism besides telling someone that the person also lacks the belief that ""God exists"" is false and thus ""atheist"" is redundant. This being the case, Calling oneself an agnostic ""atheist"" is meaningless, there being no difference between being agnostic and being atheist. On the other hand, if one is agnostic, lacking sufficient justification to believe a truth value can be placed on the proposition ""God exists"", they cannot rationally claim to believe that God does not exist.

  
 There is no shame in being a theist (or atheist, or agnostic, or whatever). Just back up your beliefs with justification. If you can't, you shouldn't be labeling yourself as anything. 

Even if I end up disagreeing with your conclusion and don't find your justification sufficient myself I can respect anyone who holds their beliefs for reasons. Anyone who can't should be ignored; they are arrogant pricks, don't be friends with them they will only try and bring you down. /rant",0,1362672625,,0,False,1,c8rff6w,t3_19ogeo,t1_c8rff6w,t3_19ogeo,,1431511690,8,False,agnosticism,t5_2qic4,8

True,Epithymetic,,,"It appears to be a special warranty clause. There are three basic forms of deed: general warranty deed, special warranty deed, and quitclaim deed.

There are also six covenants (promises) implied by deeds. These are things like the covenant against encumbrances, which is a legal promise that there are no mortgages (encumbrances) on the property.

A general warranty deed promises that none of the six covenants is broken. A special warranty deed promises that the seller hasn't broken any of the covenants. The difference is that the special warranty deed does not promise that prior owners before the current seller adhered to the covenants.

Lets imagine that A sold the property to B several years ago. Now, B is selling to C (you). If B broke one of the covenants (for example, by having a lien on the property or secretly selling it twice) C could sue B. However, if A was the one who broke one of the covenants, C could only sue B if B had used a general warranty deed. Basically, the special warranty deed is the current seller saying ""I didn't break any of the covenants but you can't sue me if some owner before me did.""

A special warranty deed can be a problem if the prior owner who actually broken the covenants cannot now be located. You could not sue the seller because he didn't actually breach the covenants and you couldn't sue the prior owner because he's missing. A general warranty deed would allow you to sue the seller for something a prior owner did to break the covenants.

Practically speaking, special warranty deeds are fairly common for exactly this reason. A seller may think he is ok but doesn't want to be held liable if you later discover that some prior owner before the seller broke a covenant. A special warranty deed is not an alarm bell that something must be wrong.

True,ilikepix,,,"You know what would be cool? A site where people pledge money they *would* have spent on something to a charitable cause. Kind of like a boycott, but active instead of passive.

For example, for this SimCity debacle, you would have to donate $59.99 to a charity (Child's Play, for example) through this hypothetical website in order to have your name appear on a list of people who would have bought SimCity if it didn't have the crappy DRM.

It would be a really powerful form of protest because the publisher could see x thousand dollars of revenue they know they actually lost out on, instead of a list of people who might never have bought the game in the first place.

And the money itself isn't wasted because it goes to a good cause.

This kind of protest wouldn't just be limited to video games, you could use it to protest a bunch of stuff.

True,calantorntain,,,"Honestly, I don't mind the absurd situations like that.  Partially because I never felt in any *real* danger for any of them\* (being 6' tall and ""thick"" helps.  I would probably feel different if I was 5' and twiggy), partially because I get amusing stories out of them, and partially because it's so *obviously* wrong, that even random men on the internet agree that it is obnoxious.

What I dislike more are the smaller, more insidious things.  When I tell of how pulled a knife and scared off the handsy masturbator, few are going to say I overstepped my boundaries.  

But for the too-touchy uncle of a friend (from this past weekend), or the coworker who suggests you go home with him despite the fact that you have a boyfriend (a few weekends ago), or the cat calls and the honks and the other smaller bits of invasive attention that intrude upon my day, and that I have no desire for... those are the ones that are tiring, and it feels like any response will be judged critically.  And when it piles on a little too much and a guys says a lewd (but now forgotten because really, I don't give a shit.  It was two weekends ago) remark and you shout back, ""I will choke you with my cock\*\*"" suddenly *you* are the crazy an inappropriate bitch who can't take a compliment.

And heaven forbid you complain about this sort of thing, because *obviously* that is just a subtle form of bragging, because we women should feel so *honored* by this ""complementary"" attention.  After all, many men would love go have their asses grabbed by a stranger in a bar, so we should appreciate it!

So, to answer your question of ""how I cope,"" the answer is: you just learn to deal with it, by not giving a shit, or learning to laugh about it.  Or you can give into the belief that such attention is a measure of a woman's worth, and thrive on it and worry when men aren't acting disrespectful because it means you are no longer beautiful (aka the most important thing ever).

\*Except for that bathroom related incident I just remembered.  If my father hadn't been there, and there had been no people around (as opposed to few people around) that would have been scary as shit.  I'm big, but if something went down he would have had the physical advantage.  But luckily I just get yet one more weird story about it.

True,[deleted],,,"YOU. THERAPIST. NOW.

You're not listening to the people who say this gently in the thread, so I am going to put it bluntly: You could literally be Johnny Depp and you would look ugly to most women when you are suicidally depressed and convinced that nobody will ever love you. That's probably why you got such a different reaction by video than from your pictures. You can fake body language and expressions in a photo, but you can't fake it in a video. This girl was incredibly rude to hang up and delete her profile, but self-loathing gives off a repulsive glow. You know how in the Sims when your Sim doesn't shower, little green lines start coming off it and all the other Sims are repulsed? Extreme depression is emotional body odor, and it's one hell of a terrible odor. It's repulsive.

You know why that is? Because people who are suicidally depressed and never do anything about it drag the people around them down, and over thousands of years of evolution, non-depressed human beings have learned to shy away from the depressed ones as a survival mechanism. You can't hunt and gather and reproduce while you're in your cave convincing your depressed caveman friend not to kill himself. It's like the natural aversion to touching poop--poop can carry dangerous bacteria, so people evolved to avoid it. Depressed people can make it impossible for their closest loved ones to function, so people have evolved to avoid becoming the closest loved one of a seriously depressed person.

You are being rejected in horrible ways time after time because the amount you hate yourself is repulsive and frightening to any person who is even remotely sane. I've been the girlfriend of a person this depressed, and it's an experience that I would never want to have again. If he'd already been in that shape when I met him I would never have even gone on a first date with him. Being in love with someone who is suicidal is like trying to save a drowning person twice your size whose flailing just pulls you underwater before you can even start to drag them to shore, and then if you twist away from them and swim a few strokes away so they can't drown you too, they scream that you're just sitting there letting them die instead of doing anything. But grab them to try to save them again, and there you go back under the water.

There are medical professionals trained to help you. That is their job. If you do not see one of those medical professionals immediately, if you *do* find a girl who is attracted to you despite the depression, you will ruin the relationship because you will still be somebody with untreated severe depression and as soon as the excitement of a new relationship wears off, you will start dragging her down and blaming her for being unable to magically make you feel as good forever as you felt in the first thrilling weeks of your first serious relationship.

I have met and even dated men who are not at all attractive objectively who are very, very sexy because they love life and are excited to share their passions with someone else. They smile, laugh, they are self-actualized and fulfilled, they don't *need* me to be happy but they're happier to be around me than to be without me, and they love to listen to me sharing my happiness, too. That's incredibly attractive and appealing. I want to be around those people. 

You're not objectively ugly, and many of the sexy men I'm talking about in the above paragraph are objectively much uglier than you. But you are not happy. You don't make someone want to be near you to listen to you sharing your happiness. You don't make someone want to tell you when *they're* happy, because you'd resent it rather than having your own happiness redoubled by knowing someone you care about is happy. 

You can fix this, and it will be the hardest thing you ever do in your life because the depression that is trying to kill you is doing so by telling you that you can't get better and that you don't care anyway. If you had cancer, you would be exhausted and in pain and want to stay in bed, but you would get your ass to chemo instead because you would know chemo can save your life. You have depression. Depression of this severity can easily kill you if you do nothing about it. I know you don't care right now and you don't think you can ever get better. I don't give a shit. You feel that way because you're sick, not because it's true. What is true is this: A therapist and some medication may save your life, just like an oncologist and chemo can save someone with cancer. Get your ass out of the house, go to a therapist, admit you're suicidal, get put on a 72-hour hold and medicated if necessary, and start treating this, whether you want to or not.

True,Stellar1557,,,"Ok, my inbox has been blowing up with people asking me to share what I do. This is a little lengthy for reddit, but I broke it down into sections to share with everyone.

Getting Started: If you are super poor, you should start out by doing raids or get a gathering skill (herb, mining, skinning). Use herbalism to level alchemy or inscription, Mining to level Jewelcrafting, Skinning to sell the skins on the ah (I explain why at the end of this tutorial). Even old content (like old world raids up to probably WOTLK content) that you can either solo, or do with 2 or 3 people can yeild a lot of gold (just from the gold loot its like 300g a run or something) plus all the stuff the bosses drop is worth 10-50g some stuff (like molten core) can drop pets or that ingot thing that is worth some bank on the ah. Overall it is a little painstaking at first, but it really pays off once you get those skills to max level.

Alchemy: Right now, I am making my gold with Primal Diamonds. I buy Golden Lotus for 50g or less each, buy the Alexandrite, Tiger Opal, and Roguestone to make the mats for Primal Diamonds. Why buy the stuff to make your own gems? If you are a xmute master, you get procs (up to 5) for one set of mats. So if I have enough mats to make 20 wild jade, I can usually get 25-30 of them. Then when you make the primal diamonds, you also get procs (up to 5) for one set of mats. If I get enough mats to make 20 primal diamonds, I usually get 25-30 (sometimes more) each of those procs are literally free gold. So I make the gems for approx 55g each u need 3 types and 2 each of those 55x6= 330g to make a primal diamond. They usually sell for 400-500 each and each proc gives free gold.

Inscription: I buy green tea leaf (or other panda herbs) usually for not more than 50g/stack. Mill these up and make Scroll of Wisdom. You can only make one per day, but I make the darkmoon cards for approx 500g each and sell them for 1000-1500g each. Also there is always a market for Glyphs, it is usually harder to move glyphs on a regular basis so I don't use this method, but it is a great way to get started because you can make glyphs for like 5g each and sell them for 30-500g each depending on what the ah has them at.

Enchanting: I offer enchanting services while I sit in a queue for a raid or something. Some people want stuff Disenchanted, some want stuff enchanted, some want to use your sha crystal cooldown. Just post it in trade and people will bring you mats and tip (usually generously). While leveling, if you have to make a block of shitty enchantments to move on, offer them for free (tips appreciated) in trade chat. Some people will tip 50g for a 5g enchant (not sure why).

Jewelcrafting: I really only use this to cut the primal diamonds I make into various ones to have a bigger spread on the markets (I make lots of Primal Diamonds, usually 100 or so at a time) Just stay away from the less popular cuts. You can also buy stuff like pandera garnets (iono if thats what they are called or not) and cut the popular cuts and try to get the ""perfect"" cuts. the rest really are just vendor trash.

Other skills: Aside from that, I have found tailoring/blacksmithing/leatherworking/etc. To be a bit of a waste of time. Bags are about the only thing these skills have to offer on a regular basis and they are expensive to level. So if income is your goal, you may want to pass on these.

* 2. Never dip the Q-tips in alcohol or gasoline. The tip is cotton to grab dirt and wax, not so that it can hold flammable liquids.
* 3. Don't use your goddamn left hand. You suck at the left hand.
* 4. Go very slow, no in-n-out motion or ""jackhammering"".
* 5. Never use an old, or soiled Q-tip, that can introduce infections into your ear canal, which are painful.
* 6. Never attach needles or other objects to the ends of the Q-tips to get hard-to-reach spots. Cleaning your ears isn't like picking your teeth.
* 7. Put your phone in another room or turn it off while you are cleaning your ears. You can probably figure out why.

True,sehrah,female,♀♥,"I know this is going to be an unpopular opinion, but here goes:

On the one hand, I like that there is a term that has weight, that women can use to call men out on their behaviour. It's good that being called a creep is harsh. It needs to be harsh to do it's job. 

And i don't think it's comparable to slut shaming, in the sense that there's not really anything wrong with being a ""slut"", but there's something wrong in genuinely being a creep. 

*However* the term is abused. It's often used by women to shame men who unattractive, or just minorly socially awkward. It's overused by some women, and wrongly applied to some men. 

I get that where and how someone may feel their boundaries have been crossed can be very subjective. But I don't like that it seems like women want the right to use it with impunity. If you use it inappropriately, you deserve to be called out on it. 

If you want it to maintain it's weight, don't just throw it around for minor social infractions. It's not fair on the men in question, either. Objectively, some women use it as a shaming technique. I think we need to acknowledge that this happens. 

I also want to say how disheartening it is to see that the comments by men with opposing views have negative karma. I know we can't take responsibility for every voter, but those opinions are still valid, even if the consensus is that they are wrong.

True,zeidrich,,,"How anti-virus software really detects viruses:

1: Registers a service with the operating system under highly privileged credentials, acting essentially as a rootkit.  

2: Installs a crude software firewall that does not properly respect the exceptions that the user sets and obscures the ability to create exceptions in the first place.

3: Denies the user the ability to disable the firewall for more than 5-10 minutes at maximum, while causing many of the user's programs to fail to work as expected due to poor exception handling and poor alerting of the user to circumstances when traffic is blocked.

4: Sets up hooks on all file IO and registry operations, and analyzes every IO operation before letting it through.  Statistical data is written based on the analysis of the IO operation to the disk generating more IO traffic.  A poor set of default rules lets this realtime IO monitor constantly need to monitor something like the drive indexing service's index as it's constantly changing.  As it writes its data to the disk the various 3rd party search programs installed on the users computer continuously update their index with information from the real-time monitor's log.  While these services all use background IO priority, the drive head is still wildly flailing all over the place while all software tries to get the last word. 

5: Pops up windows constantly informing you of your protection status, requesting definition updates, software updates, and more money for subscriptions. In some cases cumulative updates can start taking up many gigabytes worth of space.

6: Installs toolbars and browser extensions to further impact your user experience and cause your already sluggish system to load these before contacting your browser.  These tools will often phone home with all of the websites you visit to find out if they are ""safe"", invading your privacy and causing you to wait for these requests to be processed before showing your requested content.

7: When you access a website with a flash exploit causing you to run remote code, the antivirus doesn't see anything wrong. Flash is running, and it trusts flash, and while flash might be doing some funny IO stuff, it's generally allowed to. Flash then gets instructed to install and run an executable on your system.  The firewall doesn't protect you against this intrusion because it all came over a request you sent to some web server's port 80.  Everything you're doing is above board as far as the antivirus is concerned.

8: When the trojan is delivered through remote code exploit, the antivirus software might detect it, assuming the virus isn't too new for the definitions and acting in a way that avoids the heuristics.  When the anti-virus software tries to clean the virus it finds out that the file is locked because at first it's being written by flash, and then later it is being executed.  The virus creates helper programs that restart eachother when one or the other is killed, sometimes changing names when doing so.  The anti-virus software throws up it's hands and says that the virus is detected but can't be removed.  It perhaps suggests a restart.

9: When the trojan detects a restart and that it's being targeted for removal upon restart, it quickly changes its name so that the restart process is unable to target it.   Upon restart the file reports as invalid and the anti-virus software notices another virus that it can't remove.

10: Upon restarting into safe mode and disabling startup programs, you try to clean it and it remains held fast because it's also hooked itself in to your shell, has registered its own service, changed your image execution options to run itself before you can execute any .exe file and various other fun things.

True,SW4506,,,"I had a stranger rape/abduction of a young child that the case went badly that I think about often.  I did everything I could to work the case, but due to things outside my control we lost the case and it still causes my stomach to drop an inch or two when I think about it.

Edit: People have asked for some additional detail about the case and the circumstances.  I won't go into a lot of detail because I have more respect for my victims than that.  I will say that the abduction/rape occurred in the child's neighborhood and the person lived close by.  The circumstances that were beyond my control were that we had another case (not investigated by me) that received some very negative press for the way the investigation was conducted.  That case was also an alleged sexual assault.  The defense attorney brought in news media and brought of this other case (once again, not investigated by me and had nothing to do with my case) up over and over again.  The ploy worked, the judge stopped paying attention to the case and paid more attention to the news cameras.  When he delivered his decision he did it to the camera, not to the prosecutor, the defense, or the victim, but to the camera.  

I don't hold anything against the defense attorney because he did his job.  

Edit 2:  If you are looking for a silver lining I would argue that this case caused me to pursue more rigorous training and assignments that made me a more effective detective and witness.  I also started going after child pornographers full time and did that for a number of years before seeking my fortunes out west, where I am back on patrol.  I have put many child molesters, rapists, and pornographers behind bars, but each one is a little bittersweet because it reminds me of the one that got away.

Edit 3: Everybody is making a big deal that I said, ""my victims"".  When a detective gets a case it becomes theirs.  Typically they don't have to answer to anyone about it unless they royally screw it up.  They are my victims because I own the case.  They are my responsibility.

Real evidence becomes the ONLY way to quell this self-talk psychological torture. That's why it's justified, you don't care about their privacy anymore, just your own state of mind.

True,buhnyfoofoo,,,"right, but what you are doing is NOT paying it down faster; you're just paying a month or two ahead, which means your loan will still end at the same time it's supposed to.

Now, if you pay ONLY toward principal, that's an extra $400 that they can't CHARGE INTEREST ON. Which is what we are trying to explain to you. Just because you pay an extra coupon/month/payment in advance, it only counts toward that ONE month's payment, not toward what they are charging you interest on. Read the comment from the guy who thought he paid off his car early, and you'll see that you are just doing what he did. This type of thinking is exactly what WF and other banks prey on. You think you are being proactive, but you are still working on their timeline. In the case I just mentioned, he paid like 2 years in advance, and they were still just counting it as a regular payment, not principal payment. The issue I had with my load was that the check I had just sent it only counted as a regular payment and not a principal payment. Trust me when I say that any extra money you pay, you tell them in writing to count it toward principal. 

To sum it up, here's what you are doing: 
You are paying ahead. Awesome! But when they show you that a certain amount was applied to principal, they are showing you the principal balance for the month they applied it, not the whole lump sum. Of course, every payment has to go principal in some aspect, but when they bump your payment back, it's only applied to the principal amount on your next payment. Same example: my car is $330 per month. If I pay$660, they just push my payment back another month. If I pay $990, they push it back 2 months, etc. That means the majority of that 990 now goes MORE toward interest (3 mo worth) and less toward principal, but what you want is to put it ALL toward principal so they collect less interest. But meanwhile, they are still just collecting interest on the same principal amount each month. Now, if I take that same $990 and apply it solely toward principal, that's $990 they can't charge interest on AT ALL. So you save more money in the long run.

Check out this [link:](http://money.msn.com/home-loans/how-to-pay-off-your-mortgage-early-bankrate.aspx)
Yes, I understand it's about mortgages, but substitute your school loan for mortgage and it's the same concept. All you have to do is google ""Difference between regular payment and principal payment"" to see what I mean. Please google, and please read. It will save you money... lots and lots of money!

&gt;When you pay extra, make sure the extra is applied to the principal balance, not just set aside for the next payment. And before you make extra payments, read your contract and make sure you won't have to pay prepayment penalties.

Why am I so adamant about this? Not because I want to argue on the internet, but because I want to help you not fall into this trap that so many people do. It's a false sense of security that you are being financially responsible by paying ahead, when they are really still just taking advantage of you paying ahead. 

Your method works when you know you are going to be tight on money for a few months and just want to pay ahead to avoid defaulting. But if you have any extra money in your pocket AFTER making your regular monthly payments, tell them, IN WRITING, to put it ONLY toward principal.

True,roryrhorerton,,,"Oooh, I'm a social scientist! (Sociologist, to be specific)  Fully answering this question would require much more expertise in historical sexual relations than I have, but I might be able to help point in the right direction.

Now, I can't tell you why opinion shifted from ""small is good"" to ""big is good.""  I think this is just one of those cultural factors that has some historical reasoning somewhere, but deep down is just as arbitrary as most social practices. I think the key to this question is why the obsession is there in the first place.

I think one of the key factors here comes from the psychological concept of ['precarious manhood.](http://www.psychologicalscience.org/index.php/news/releases/think-its-easy-to-be-macho-psychologists-show-how-precarious-manhood-is.html)' Basically, the idea is that while womanhood and femininity tends to be tied to biology, manhood tends to rely much more heavily on presentation.  Because femininity is a marked characteristic, having specific body parts is enough to say ""oh, that's a woman.""  But since masculinity is unmarked, having male body parts is just what is considered 'normal.'  To truly be ""manly,"" you need to continually prove your masculinity.  You wear manly clothes, adopt manly speech, and threaten to be physically violent (super manly!) with anyone who compares you to anything feminine. And even though penis size is biologically determined, somehow we consider it a personal achievement.  Think about it: it's not enough to show someone you have a penis to be manly--you have to show them you have a BIG penis. (And if you look at women, there is no competition.  If you've got the parts, you're in. [With further complications coming from things like menopause which may in fact push somebody out of 'womanhood,' but that's a whole other post]).  So in our quest to present ourselves as manly, penis size becomes part of the show just like our carefully chosen clothes and speech.

But where, you may ask, does this obsession with seemingly ridiculously sized penises come from in contemporary society?  It's one thing to say bigger is better, but we're entering the area of the absurd.  Our biggest porn stars would be seen as freaks and mutants if any of their other body parts diverged so greatly from the norm.  Here I think we need to look at the impact of the porn industry on society and Baudrillard's conception of [hyperreality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperreality). Technological shifts have really influenced the ubiquity of porn in our society.  VCR's mean you can watch it in the comfort of your own home, and the Internet means you can get it instantly without having to talk to that creepy clerk at the video store.  With greater ease of use, you get greater adoption and familiarity.  But the thing people forget is this: porn is not sex.  Porn stars are having sex, yes, but the sex in (commercially created, not intentionally feminist, etc) porn has as much relation to reality as your favorite sitcom.  It's a created product, and aims to be more real than reality (e.g. hyperreal). You have positions that people without cameras would never devise, acts that look much better on film than they feel, and stars with perfect bodies and massive genitalia.  A porn star's body is as far away from the norm as is a body builder's or circus freak's, but that's OK with most people, because it tends to overconform to social norms rather than underconform.

But here's where the real key of hyperreality comes in: eventually, people lose track of where the connection between reality and the created product lie.  Umberto Eco called hyperreality ""the authentic fake.""  We've entered an era where the sex you see in porn IS sex, even though it has little relation to actual human reproductive/pleasure acts.  And so you get people trying things in the bedroom that were only created because they look good on film.  You get normal folk shaving their pubic hair (and in such numbers that they [might be killing off pubic lice](http://mentalfloss.com/article/33520/are-pubic-lice-really-going-extinct)) and bleaching their assholes to 'fit in.'  And you have people thinking that the statistically unlikely massive penises seen in porn are what are needed to truly prove masculinity.  And because masculinity is being partially defined as having a bigger penis than the next person, you get an arms race of sorts that pushes society further and further in to the hyperreal.  So you get statistically 'normal' men becoming more and more worried about their masculinity, and the images they receive becoming more and more distant from reality. (You can also apply the hyperreality analysis to things like beauty for women; patriarchy kind of screws over everybody in its own ways)

That's just my (kind of) quick and dirty breakdown, but feel free to throw parts in to this I may have missed, everyone.

True,Neamow,kerbal96,,"I just figured it out last week, after I got frustrated with all the tutorials not working, so I just did it by myself for hours until I finally understood it. I would suggest trying the same, but I will write it down for you. This is as basic as I can write it:

1. Get into orbit.
2. Set your destination as target.
3. Plan a maneuver so you get a close intersect (within 20 km is nice, but under 50 km is still fine), with the future apoapsis as close to the intersect as you can. Execute the maneuver.
4. At the apoapsis circularise your orbit. It should now have similar dimensions as your target's orbit, though you may still be quite far from your target.
5. Click on the little velocity display above the navball to change it to the relative velocity to your target, if it didn't happen by itself.
6. Burn prograde or retrograde to bring that number as close to zero as you can. You'll never get it to precisely 0.0, but anything less than 1.0 will do.
7. Now turn towards your target and burn slowly while looking at the map view. Your new intersect will keep getting closer. Get it to about half of your current distance, so your new orbit doesn't go too much out of whack, stop burning, and get to the intersect.
8. Repeat 6 and 7 as many times as necessary - reduce your relative velocity, then burn slowly towards the target. You may have to do it ten times, or you may do it in two. Doesn't matter.
9. If you get closer than half a kilometer to your target, kill your relative velocity for the last time, and use only thrusters to get closer and dock.

It's not an easy thing to do, in fact I would go and say it's about the damn hardest thing in the game. But it's a learned skill. You need to do it a few times before you get the hang of it, and many many more times before you master it.

EDIT: Okay. So, I'm getting a hell of a lot of replies that are all similar, so I'm going to state my thesis in simplest terms for anyone who wants to reply to anything I've said below.

One of the points of this campaign seems to be to give people who have a negative self image a chance to recognize that their body isn't abnormal. Even if they're *below* average, that's still okay, because you're not alone, and you shouldn't have to worry about it. It had to be ""in your face"" because someone set up a booth and said ""come here for pictures of nonsexual vaginas!"" no one would go near it for embarrassment. This way, someone who possibly thinks their vagina is abnormally beefy or dark can walk by and think ""Hmm. Perhaps it's a common thing."" It likely isn't as much of an issue on the campus because, unlike reddit, it's on display in a *mature and academic* environment.

Before you ask, I really wouldn't give a shit if they were weird or unappealing dicks, because it's still aiding people with questionable body image. I think the reason this campaign is aimed at women is because (aside from social and developmental reasons) people don't seem to know what normal, every-day vaginas look like and seem to get really up-in-arms when they don't see a vagina that was picked explicitly for fapping to (either in porn or the pre-sex work your girlfriend does.) An example of this is the reaction of *absolute disgust* many of you have been showing when really none of them look all that bad.

Women don't walk around with pussies that are always DTF. I'm sorry to pop your bubble. I'm not an opinionated woman (before anyone jumps to that conclusion again,) I'm just a guy who knows the basics of physiology. But I digress. I'm sour from all the [explicit and illogical misogyny I've encountered tonight.](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/19uxt1/there_are_pictures_of_vaginas_all_over_my_campus/c8rptyn) If you think my arguments are needlessly bitter or harsh, just look at some of the things people have replied.

In regards to this whole Reddit-Hates-Sarkesian thing, I'm referring to the 'typical gamer'-rage response where (typically) guys were mad at her for even mentioning sexism in games and acted like they were completely justified at gender-based hate-speech against her for her even mentioning legitimately problematic things in the industry. They feel somehow oppressed or attacked or exploited because this lady points out parts of video games that objectify and push away women while pandering to men. 

The term is just generally used when someone acts willfully ignorant to the plight of others to the point of denigrating or insulting that group of others, especially in a smart-assed tone like they are really explaining the reason that neckbeards are the real victims. 

Real example: I saw someone seriously post this rant when World of Warcraft got rid of the more porny loading screens in favor of ones that show off less gratuitious cleavage (something a lot of people have complained about over the years). The guy was just completely freaking the fuck out yelling about how he's being oppressed and how if 'men are majority of gamers we should have tits in our loading screens GODDAMNIT, NO MATTER WHAT THOSE FEMINIST BITCHES ARE WHINING ABOUT', etc. It just makes them look really spoiled and ignorant -- how bad could it be to not look at boobs on your loading screens when it makes other people more comfortable with the game? You see the same kind of thing all over Sarkesian's story, repeatedly on /r/gaming in particular.

If you're worried it might be kind of a slur, I've thought about that before. I don't really think it is -- it describes a specific behavior. It has nothing to do with actual beards on necks, and sorry if anyone who has a lot of anxiety about their actual neck beard feels as if I was specifically trying to call them out.

[Here's a subreddit called neckbeard rights](http://www.reddit.com/r/neckbeardrights), which is a parody demonstrating the use of the label.

Even if unfair, grizzled hero soldierman has agency and can actually change/accomplish things, the damsel as noted here has no free will and simply exists to define the hero's journey. It also kind of implies like looking into the problem of women in video games isn't the real issue, and that it's more important to look at the problems of males in video games. Even if there are problems with men's issues in gaming, what's wrong with talking about the women's issues with it? What does it threaten? Why, exactly, do these gamers get so mad about it?

True,[deleted],,,"The problem lies in the cost of reunification. [Take a look at the German reunification in 1991](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_history_of_the_German_reunification). There are still economic problems in the eastern portions of Germany today.

Realize this: even in 1991, East Germany was still one of the leading economic powers in eastern Europe. In contrast, North Korea is one of the most impoverished nation in the *world*. A Korean reunification would mean these three things (barely scratching the surface, obviously):

- A large starving population
- A large unskilled labor force unsuited for many of the jobs offered in the ROK
- Massive re-education program tackling all fronts (social, cultural, etc.)

The economic cost of lifting the North Korean population - some 24.5 million people - from out of their average income of $2000 per year to that of the poverty line in South Korea ($9000 per year) is absolutely mind boggling. South Korea would have to somehow more than quadruple the income of 24.5 million people, and that **only gets them to the poverty line**.

Let's just say that only half of the North Korean population are fit for labor. That's still 12.2 million people who will need to be provided jobs *that they can do*. When you've spent your entire life working in a cigarette factory or a beer bottle factory, it's not exactly easy to suddenly transition to working for Samsung. (For reference, I'm using the Chinese model, which actually still has cigarette factories and beer bottle factories even today)

This is just scratching the basic economic problem. If you want those 12.2 million people to become effective members of the workforce, you have to educate them from the bottom up. Sure, basic skills like math might not be an issue, but once you start getting into even slightly more technical tasks, you'll start running into incompetency. North Korean workers--through virtue of not having any exposure to things that their southern compatriots have--will not understand a great deal of the requirements for their new jobs. Just as you wouldn't want to hire someone who's never even seen a computer to be a programmer, many ROK companies will not want to hire the new DPRK workers just because re-educating them to become effective workers will be a hassle.

Moving even deeper, there are social issues. Say what you want about the population of North Korea, but they've been brought up believing in the propaganda their government spreads--to a certain degree. Sure, they may know that their country blows and isn't all that rosy, but do you honestly expect them to be able to step into Seoul and say ""Word, this ain't shit""? No. Additionally, because of DPRK propaganda, they will inherently have a completely different way of thinking compared to their southern compatriots. The best parallel for the difference that I can come up with on the spot would be to read some of the posts in [r/asianparentstories](http://reddit.com/r/asianparentstories) and compare that to an 'average' Caucasian American middle-class family life. The difference is night and day.

I'm debating a kickstarter now.

---

I've been waiting for this question my whole motherfucking life.

The answer to this question is busy work.  I would fund and manage a small company that is entirely designed around busy work.

What do I mean?  Allow me an example.

You hire an individual, we'll call him Steve.  Steve is brought to a warehouse, it's empty, but one wall is stacked to shoulder level with blocks.  Foam padded, safety blocks, with ergonomic handles.  Light, too, maybe 5-7 lbs.  Something easily transportable, doesn't really wear you down.

Steve's job is to move said blocks from one wall to the other.  That's his entire day.  He's got to do it without any assistance whatsoever, and he's denied any creativity on how to do it - one set way, one block in each hand.

He works each day until the job is done, and the thing is designed to take 9.5 hours - just longer than the standard workday.

For this, Steve is paid $65,000 annually, with excellent benefits.  He's probably making more than his peers, probably working longer hours.  He can afford a decent car, afford to start a modest family, to take a wife.

But how does one explain just how menial his work is?  How does he justify the waste of his time?  The very next day, he has to move the same blocks back where he got them from, place them all back just in the same order.  Needless precision.  He gets barely any exercise from it, but it's draining nonetheless.

How does he explain this to his daughter on Take Your Kid To Work Day?  How does his daughter explain his job to her friends?

How does he keep friends when the jealousy abounds?  He has no qualifications, he didn't finish uni, but here he is in this plum job?  They seethe when he complains of how stupid it is, because the core result of his work is significantly more money than they make!

How does he tell his parents that he's become a success?  How could you define this as success?

And the list of pointless jobs are endless, you could employ as many people as the bankroll could support!  Pay one guy to separate all the skittles by colour, pay another one to watch him do it, watch closely for any errors, and then shake it up when he's done and mix it all up again.  And pay the watcher/shaker about half what you pay the sorter, and subordinate the shaker to the sorter, make the sorter the boss, the manager, ensuring that his employee checks him constantly for errors and delays not a moment in shaking up his skittles again.

Hire a guy to solve three simple math problems.  Just three.  Sit him in a room with a couch, a water cooler, and a coffee table full of two-year-old magazines and give him a sheet of paper every day with three simple problems on it (3 + 12 - 4 = ?).  End of the day, he has to turn it in, and the problems have to be correct, or he loses his $75,000 salaried job.  When would he solve them, in the morning, at the end of the day?  Would he mix it up?  What if he got one wrong?  Think of the self-deprecation and shame he'd suffer for years if he did!

The idea is to just keep these people locked in demonstrably meaningless work.  The evil of it is that their friends, spouses and peers they try to commiserate with will never understand, but when they try to lend a sympathetic ear to those same friends and spouses, the complaints will sound exactly the same - they'll feel they DESERVE common ground and respect for their suffering, but nobody will give it to them.

This is the best use of the money, hands down.  Employ people for fucking years to do nothing.  You'll ruin the story of their lives, you'll fuck their narrative, and they'll thank you for it.",0,1362715411,,0,1362752575,2,c8rtryz,t3_19va55,t1_c8rtryz,t3_19va55,,1431518626,1855,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,1855

True,SuperConductiveRabbi,,,"One day in the recent past mankind was triumphant in producing a series of small mechanical devices, made from metals so rare that entire processing facilities had to be constructed just to separate them from the crust of the earth. These devices could contain information with unrivaled density. A device 3.5"" in size, no bigger than a paperback book, could contain 1/10th of the words ever written by man.

The leaders of the world, recognizing that the devices' existence would be of paramount importance to every sentient man on the planet, assembled ten of these devices on a pedestal in the center of a valley. They appointed cultural attachés to make voyages to the devices, and instructed them to bring the works of their culture. The cultural appointees took these works and poured them into the devices. Every scholarly article, every academic textbook, every encyclopedic entry both meaningful and trite, and every piece of literature anyone had ever written, in every language ever spoken, were organized with feats of mathematics of such unrivaled brilliance that any entry could be accessed within fractions of a second.

Recognizing the enormity of this achievement, and predicting the skepticism that every right-thinking man would express when he heard claims that it had been accomplished, the leaders of the world's powers constructed a public edifice around the ten drives. Here would be a demarcation to everyone that came upon it: an icon, boldly claiming that on this spot mankind performed a miraculous feat. The leaders then invited man, woman, and child from every nation on earth to make pilgrimage and witness this great place. The thing contained here, in these ten drives, is all that mankind toiled to learn over the course of one-hundred thousand years, and so profound were the implications that a Biblical wave of people surged from every nation on earth. People spent their entire fortunes to come and see it for themselves.

The GIF you see are the peoples of the earth still coming to this great place, where the drives were laid 2,013 years before. But no longer do they come to marvel at the data contained within them, which once seemed so massive; instead, they come to see the place where humanity first recognized its triumph over superstition and the blind rule of ignorance. They surge around the holy relic so that they can pay tribute to their forebears, who forever changed humanity and brought them out of the dark ages.

True,reginaldaugustus,,,"Forts such as this (in the 17th and 18th centuries) were rarely directly assaulted. Generally, an attacking army would immediately demand the fort's surrender. The surrender was rarely given at first. 

When the fort refused to surrender, the attacking army would bring up its heavy siege guns and start pounding the forts' walls, trying to destroy the generally smaller fort guns. Trenches, almost parallel to the fort's walls (called parallels) would be dug, back and fort, slowly inching closer to the walls. At some point, the siege guns would open a breach in the wall towards where the parallels and traverses were approaching. 

Eventually, the trenches would be relatively close to the walls. Another call for surrender would be given. If there was no hope of relief from a nearby friendly army, the defenders would be allowed to leave, often with their weapons, generally under a pledge to not participate in fighting for a certain period of time. If the offer of surrender was refused, then the attackers would plan to storm the breach.

The first wave of the attack, known as a [forlorn hope](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forlorn_hope) was expected to die almost to a man, but competition to participate in the first attack was fierce because young officers were almost guaranteed promotion if they survived. 

If it came down to a storm, the defending force rarely won The forlorn hope would be butchered, but hopefully last long enough to gain a foothold in the breach and for further waves of men to come up to reinforce them. If an attacking force had to storm a fort, the lives of the defenders were at the mercy of the attackers should the attack succeed, and cities generally were pillaged, burned, and raped if an attacking army breached the walls.

This fort was only actually assaulted *once* in the almost 200 years it remained an active military position. That attack was repulsed, though.

True,Ftumsh,,,"I'll have a go. 

I loved my ex. I wanted her to be happy. If she was unhappy it ruined my day, my week, whatever.

She too wanted herself to be happy. 

In a normal relationship, there is always going to be disagreement, discussion, sometimes argument, then compromise or acceptance.

In a relationship with an emotional terrorist, this does not occur. If something displeases them, the disagreement goes ballistic immediately. Any point of disagreement, no matter how small, turns into screaming, crying, door slamming, even violence. And it can last for weeks.

You can stand your ground and at first you do - hey, you're an adult man - but every time there's a point of conflict you already know the outcome: there will be a huge bust-up. Guaranteed. No matter how trivial the issue.

The bomb of agitated conflict is inadvertently being held as a threat against you. 

So for a quiet life you start to let your ability to disagree rationally erode. Little things at first: on your way out to meet friends and there's a disagreement? If you stand your ground you know there'll be a fight and you'll be late or arrive in a state of tension or anger.

So that one time you just capitulate.

Then the things you compromise on, because you're just so exhausted with the fighting and screaming, get bigger and more important. Paint color for the living room? New fridge? Fuck it, it doesn't matter. 

And bigger. New house? Which neighborhood? Eh, I'm an easy-going guy, I'll roll with what she wants.

And bigger. How to raise the kids? Fuck it, I can't stand all the screaming. It's not good for them.

Your life has become quieter but you've lost part of yourself, and that lost part gets bigger too. 

You only ever bother disagreeing with her if you've got the time and energy, and the issue is important enough to warrant the ensuing conflict.

The ticking bomb starts to affect how the couple works as an entity, and eventually how you work as a human.

After several years you have been conditioned. Eventually all but the biggest decisions are hers to make. And discussing those huge decisions results in nuclear warfare, so you avoid them when you can.

The whole time you're in the relationship you know that the bomb is there, primed and ready to blow. 

And you're just so. fucking. tired. 

(Then you escape, and you remember this is not what a relationship is meant to be, but it takes balls to get out. And your conditioning affects your other relationships; you need to work on yourself for years to get back to normal.)

True,paradox1123,Geth,Dr. Buzzkillington,"Legion in ME3 betrayed every single ideal that Legion in ME2 emphatically assured me that the True Geth defined themselves with.  In ME2, Legion said that ""Geth build their own future, Heretics ask the Old Machines to give them the Future"". Then when the Reaper Code offered the Geth a quick and easy path to military power, Legion took it without hesitation; and without the consensus of its people who were too weak to object. (And don't say that ""they needed the Reaper Code to defend themselves from the Quarians""; Shepard could have lied to Gerral and saved both sides just as well.)

From an out-of-universe perspective, Legion in ME3 is a very lazily written character.  Legion in ME2 was explicitly *not* a Pinocchio AI like Data from Star Trek who ""just wanted emotions and individuality"".  Legion was *supposed* to be a somewhat unpleasant construct to us; a being whose very nature abhors individual thought and yearns for pure conformity and consensus among all members of its society.  But, instead of challenging audiences to accept something so alien, they took the lazy route; making Legion a bland, wholly sympathetic, character whose journey to ""being more human"" is fully entrenched in our collective understanding of how *good* AIs ""should behave""; rather than beings with their own identity and unique (and actually interesting) goals.  

So, if Legion was referenced in the Citadel DLC, it would have been the one who did nothing but spout boring platitudes of ""how great it feels to be finally sentient like humans now"", and celebrating their ""great sacrifice"" for that.  I would have probably been cringing the entire time.

Yes, It would end the conflict almost imminently, but these nations know the power they wield and do not feel the need to take such risky measures. South Korea would most likely be sent into its highest alert state. If a ground war did break out(the most likely of scenarios) then it would boil down to a few select factors.

The North has experienced a severe [drought in recent years.](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/26/korean-drought-worst-in-century_n_1626932.html) The south being a first world counrty will maintain and support open trade almost ensuring that their supplies will not dwindle. The North on the other hand is severely lacking in both allies and resources of its own. The soldiers of the North will struggle to continue to fight when the rations cease to flow.

* The technologies each country uses on the battle field will play a huge role in this 21st century battle field. It equates to the speed at which the military can react to changing battlefield situations. The South is backed by the USA which is a leader in the connected war field. The technologies that will be used will allow all branches of military to act will maximum efficiency and precision.  The North on the other hand still maintains an industrialized military, that is far less reliant upon technology. These differences would be quite hard to overcome. Yes the North is slowly attempting to have technology enter its military might(as are most nations,) but the fact remains it is hard for the to acquire such technologies. 
  
* The two populations that ultimately feed the militarily's  are quite different. On being based upon a command economy the other being based upon a market economy. This would mean that the North would be able to shift itself into a stance where it can imminently (if it hasn't already) begin the manufacturing of war time necessities. The other faction would undoubtedly shift quite quickly, but it would take slightly longer to mobilize the means of production. The Northern s most likely have a strong sense of nationalism , yet these feelings are easily swayed when you no longer have food upon your plate to maintain your own life. The drive would ultimately fall upon the North to feed its population so that they can produce for the war effort. The South will not face such issues. However they will face a most certain (possibly small, or large) opposition from within it borders. Some people don't like war. Factors such as these will play into affect.

Silly example, taking out the trash. When you look at the trash bag and think, 'Ah, what the hell, I'll do it later', you're just passing on the problem to future-you. Future-you is NOT going to want to do it any more.

We have something called present bias that makes us think that our immediate comfort is more important than an abstract, future one. The moment you realize this is a fallacy, there's really no excuse anymore for procrastination... You see something unpleasant that needs doing, you do it right away.

After a while, as future-you becomes present-you, you'll start thanking past-you for doing jobs you wouldn't want to be doing. That's positive reinforcement, and over time it will become second nature.

"" The headline is very ambiguous. For something as serious as this, the context is crucial.""

""problem isn't translation, but context.""

""it's out of context. Read the whole paragraph""

Totalmente d'accordo. Io ho letto la stessa intervista e capito una cosa diversa, non ho visto una minaccia ma un'ipotesi sul futuro (peraltro probabile, che esista una situazione esasperata e che Grillo faccia da tappo a rabbiosi sommovimenti senza capo né coda è un fatto). Che si critichi Grillo perché è approssimativo e criptico e perché di fatto non ha ancora deciso di che morte dobbiamo morire.

Mi sembra rientri, questa incomprensione, in una strategia suicida, l'ennesima, che riduce tutto a posizioni manicheiste (noi siamo i buoni, voi siete i cattivi) e che ci sia in giro una specie di psicosi collettiva alimentata da titoli come quelli del Corriere e in generale da un giornalismo mediocre.

True,rzwitserloot,sultai,,"CAVEAT: This is personal advice. I am wrong often.

Snapcaster sees quite a bit of play across all constructed formats which means its value will not be dropping much, if at all, when he rotates out of standard this October. If you want to play those right now in a deck, buy them. You can always sell em later for about the same price you'll be buying them for now, and even if they are rotting away in your trade binder for a few years I doubt they'll drop. They'll probably go up actually, if magic continues to become more popular over time. The odds that his price will skyrocket depends heavily on what standard brings; if a top tier deck shows up where 4 snapcasters is key, he'll easily climb up to $30. If not, he'll stick around his current $18ish.

Shock duals: I doubt they'll be changing in price until M14 comes out. Then they'll rocket up. DGM also has shocks in it, and the draft format will be DGM-GTC-RTR, so people will be opening up shock lands as much as they are now pretty much. In fact, shocks might become a smidge cheaper until M14 is released. From there on out until they see another reprint or something crazy happens like no-restrictions snow-covered duals in a standard legal set (I _REALLY_ doubt that'll happen), they are the premier manafixing dual of modern and casual. Make sure you have your playsets ready around july this year or so, after that, there is very high risk that these will become $20 cards. Feel free to buy them right now, they won't drop much.

Sphinx's Revelation: This is a key driver of slower W/U control. It's depressed right now due to the hyper aggressive blitz decks running roughshod over the standard format, but this card is going to be standard legal until **October 2014**, and we'll see 6 changes to standard in that time. Odds are high that at least one of those 6 are conducive to U/W control, and if U/W control is a tier 1 deck, then Sphinx's Revelation will be an expensive card for it. This card will fall off a cliff, value wise when it does rotate out of standard though. I doubt this is going to become much cheaper, and whenever U/W rolls back into tier 1 status this card will probably go up again. I'm less sure about this card.

Supreme Verdict: It's $3.50 now. It's not gonna be much cheaper; it's a perfectly servicable wrath. It's also a legacy playable, because it's a wrath that you can pitch to Force of Will. If you think you need these in the future, you might as well pick em up now. The downside is low (maybe SV becomes $2.50, but not lower), the upside is high (it might become a 6 buck card!)

Innistad stuff: Bad buys across the board with the exception of modern staples like LilianaOTV and Snapcasters, which simply keep their value stable for the next few months. You already missed the boat on these, basically. No point trying to collect them now! If you need some of these for your standard deck, welp, bite the bullet. You're paying full price, nothing you can do about it.

True,rudeboyskunk,35,,"I have to agree with you here.  I've been using Ubuntu as my primary OS since it came out back in 2004 (by that point I had only been using a combination of RedHat 9 and Debian for about a year).  Of course I would use other distros on the side, mostly for fun (Fedora, Opensuse, Gentoo, even some BSDs).  I've truly always enjoyed using Ubuntu (I even enjoyed Unity from the get-go).  However, when 12.10 came out with the Amazon stuff, I started to get a little fidgety.  I'm still running 12.04 now (mostly for stability), and I'm holding my breath about whether or not to switch to 13.04 or later this year go to another distro.  I don't really have the time to learn the basics of another distro (been years since I've used Fedora or Opensuse, so I don't really remember much and I'm sure it's all changed anyway) since I'm working full-time and going to grad school full-time.  So what it basically boils down to is this:  even though I've been primarily using Ubuntu for the past 9 years, it's reached the point where I don't enjoy it that much and am only using it because it's so familiar to me, and it's easy to adjust to the changes they have been introducing.",0,1362741403,,0,False,1,c8ryoru,t3_19v1b2,t1_c8ryoru,t1_c8rr397,,1431520950,0,False,LinuxActionShow,t5_2sp2j,0

True,Cenodoxus,asia,North Korea,"Great question! As you'd expect, South Korea has studied the process of Germany's reunification very closely, as it's the most appropriate analogue to the post-World War II division of the Korean peninsula. Unfortunately, the most critical lesson it's learned is that reunification is probably not possible in the short term, and that the damage done by the Kim regime will take decades -- and possibly even the better part of a century -- to fix.

I'm going to try to stay within the /r/AskHistorians rules concerning pre-1993 events as much as possible here, and I also don't have as much in-depth knowledge of German reunification as I'd like. However, I can tell you what a lot of German and South Korean historians and analysts have written or said about this issue:

**First, there are a few important differences to note that made Germany's reunification much easier.** They didn't make it *easy*, mind you -- just easier. Germany isn't my field so I doubt this is comprehensive.

 - **East Germany wasn't completely closed off to the West.** Its citizens could, albeit with extreme difficulty, still travel elsewhere (although traveling to another communist nation was considerably easier than going further), got radio and TV broadcasts from outside the country, and had some Western products in their stores. For the length of the Cold War, the public had a much better sense of where the quality of life in East Germany stood in relation to western Europe. Obviously, that has not been the case for North Korea, although the state's grip on the information reaching its populace has weakened since the 1994 famine.
 - **While poor in comparison to West Germany, East Germany still had a functional economy and was (as Expectoration notes) the richest economy within the Soviet sphere of influence.** It did suffer from a problem that was very common within communist regimes -- too much emphasis placed on heavy industrial capacity, and not enough attention paid to the production or distribution of consumer goods -- but it still had a reasonable number of exports. Granted, that was more to developing countries, e.g., nobody who could buy a Mercedes or a Ford was going to buy a Trabant. As Jaap Sleifer noted in *Planning Ahead and Falling Behind: The East German Economy in Comparison with West Germany, 1936-2002*, the East German GDP per capita was [consistently about 56% that of its Western counterpart](http://books.google.com/books?id=DMRr7it0KE8C&amp;pg=PA51&amp;lpg=PA51&amp;dq=east+germany+gdp+per+capita&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kAeccF3QFV&amp;sig=uQTf1Uk6dZGXkEUhP6RNpPhuHaI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KcM5UaTOE8zI0AHGs4DICw&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=east%20germany%20gdp%20per%20capita&amp;f=false). By contrast, North Korea's GDP per capita as of 2011 was estimated at around $1,800: South Korea's was $32,100. This is a terrible gulf to overcome.
 - **East Germans didn't have a very high opinion of their political leaders.** While it would be impossible to characterize them as a free people given the power, influence, and sheer brutality of the Stasi, whole families weren't packed off to prisons or work camps simply because one member had criticized the government. And, thanks in part to their access to Western media, they could always compare and contrast what their leaders were saying against what people elsewhere were saying. For the last decade or so of its existence, East Germany's government had to face [a relatively organized popular resistance](http://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/06/opinion/no-room-for-difference-in-east-germany.html) and lacked the resources to shut it down. By contrast, the North Korean mania for collective punishment was, as Andrei Lankov wrote in *North of the DMZ,* considered unusual and disturbing even by the Soviets, and there has been no mass revolt by the North Koreans against their government. (Though this, too, has changed somewhat since the famine. The level of [obvious public discontent surrounding the 2009 currency exchange](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/02/business/global/02korea.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0) was unprecedented in North Korean history.)

So Germany vs. Korea is not as comparable as the South Koreans would like for the purpose of constructing a ""road map"" for their own reunification. East Germany was no bowl of chuckles, but by any standard, North Korea has been a more reclusive, economically dysfunctional, and belligerent entity. (Admittedly, the Stasi would have fit right in to the North Korean context.)

Germany has spent roughly $1 trillion per decade to reintegrate East Germany, and [the process is far from over](http://www.economist.com/node/15640987). The South Korean Ministry of Reunification [floated a figure of $245 billion for the Koreas](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/northkorea/8974612/North-Korea-death-of-Kim-Jong-il-revives-reunification-debates.html), though I have yet to see an economist who's anything but pessimistic about that number. Reunification would be the equivalent of a never-ending mortgage for the country as a whole.

That *Economist* article is well worth reading, by the way, because a lot of the East Germans' complaints in there will sound very familiar if you've read North Korean defectors' accounts of their new lives in South Korea ...

In a speech titled ""Second Korean War is Unavoidable,"" DPRK's Foreign Ministry spokesman said, ""now that the U.S. is set to light a fuse for a nuclear war, the revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK will exercise the right to a preemptive nuclear attack to destroy the strongholds of the aggressors and to defend the supreme interests of the country ([Korean News, the DPRK's official news agency](http://www.kcna.co.jp/index-e.htm))."" North Korea gave this speech hours before the UN Security Council was set to vote on new sanctions against the state.

2. The United Nations passed new sanctions against North Korea targeting arms manufacturers, the export of goods to North Korea, and financial transactions ([CBSNews](http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-202_162-57572980/north-korea-vows-nuclear-strike-against-u.s/)).

**Summary**

North Korea tested an Unha-3 rocket in December 2012, part of the development of an ICBM capable of delivering a nuclear weapon. North Korea claimed it was a peaceful satellite. On 12 February 2013, North Korea conducted an underground nuclear test, the third and largest of its nuclear tests. The combination of these two events led the United Nations Security Council to pass stricter sanctions against the country yesterday. North Korea's government made a series of threats today and yesterday to intimidate the UN into reversing course.

North Korea has stepped up the level of its threats in recent days to a degree not seen in several decades, but the message to take away from all this comes from within OP's article:

&gt;""Daniel Pinkston, a North Korea expert with the International Crisis Group in Seoul, said that while Pyongyang's rhetoric has been ""more shrill than usual,"" it is almost certainly an effort to get South Korea, the US and other states that have joined the sanctions against it to back down.""

True,bushx,,,"This fucking guy.  Afraid of failure?  You already ARE a failure.  Before the inevitable flood of downvotes, let me explain.

In general, I consider mediocrity to be failure.  Good job, clean house, reliable car, 6/10 wife?  Congratulations, you've accomplished what everybody does, you're exactly average and deserve zero recognition for it.  You're not even at that level.  You're talking about doing shit that millions of people do every day as a minimum standard.  And you can't even do that.

Everybody here so far is right.  Get up and do it.  Don't bitch and complain, don't think about what's going to happen if you fail.  Just get out there and fucking do it.  Even if you crash and burn like the Hindenburg, you should learn something in the process and you'll be better off than you were yesterday.  All the tutorials and productivity methods in the world are going to fall short because you need to change your mentality. 

I fail at something probably five days a week.  Minor failure, major explosion, whatever, followed occasionally by crippling depression.  But that doesn't matter because it gives me the experience and mentality to power through the other two days when I actually achieve something.  Instead of thinking, ""What happens if I fail,"" start thinking ""What's next if I succeed?""  

And get out of bed before 11AM.  Most successful people have done twice as much by 11 as you'll do in an entire week at this point.  Eat breakfast, go for a walk, reflect for 15 minutes on what you can accomplish by 11AM.  And when finally you do it?  Stop.  Take the rest of the day off.  You accomplished something today, and you're a better person for doing it.  Veg out, whack off, eat junk food, and accomplish something new tomorrow.

Yes, you are already a failure, and with the attitude you have, you're going to stay one for a long time.  This world is absolutely FULL of 20-something failures vegging out every day and complaining about lack of opportunity, girl problems, or shit jobs.  What are they doing to improve their situation?  What are YOU doing to improve YOUR situation?  You need to recognize this.  Because you aren't going to change it until you start doing something about it.   Become the person you want to be... by being that person starting now.  

Those of you still hovering over that downvote button, do me a favor before you click.  Are you doing it because you disagree, or because I'm right?  Because I wish somebody would have told me this going into my 20s - I had to spend most of the last decade figuring it out for myself.  If you can wake up every day and can achieve one thing - just ONE thing - before taking the day off, you'll grow as a person.

True,[deleted],,,"Since this issue has been brought up so repeatedly, let us clarify.

**No one has ever disputed the President's authority to act in the immediate defense of the United States** against an actual attack that is in progress. That the Constitution requires Congress to declare war has _never_ been interpreted at any point in U.S. history to require a Congressional mandate in order for the president to intervene in the case of such immediate attacks as Pearl Harbor or 9/11.

What Senators such as Rand Paul, Mike Lee, Ted Cruz, and Ron Wyden have been asking is **does the President believe he has the authority to kill NON-COMBATANT Americans on American soil?** The president has already claimed the authority to [maintain a secret kill list](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/29/world/obamas-leadership-in-war-on-al-qaeda.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0) that includes American citizens, as well as to [kill non-combatant American citizens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anwar_al-Aulaqi) on foreign soil. It is therefore logical and reasonable to wonder whether the President might also be willing to kill a non-combatant American citizen on American soil.

The [Fifth Amendment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution) to the United States Constitution requires that **No person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.** However in the case of killing non-combatant American citizens without a trial, it appears that due process has not been granted in accordance with the Constitution.

The [Sixth Amendment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution) to the Constitution further requires that **in all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial**. Of course accused terrorists are frequently not given criminal trials, but it is hard to know for certain that they are indeed terrorists unless they have been tried and found guilty. Indeed, Nazi war criminals were tried at the Nuremberg trials. It is difficult to understand why al-Qaeda sympathizers cannot be tried in the same way that the Nazi war criminals were tried.",0,1362754852,,0,False,1,c8s0w58,t3_19wt5b,t1_c8s0w58,t3_19wt5b,,1431522248,157,False,politics,t5_2cneq,157

True,PissFuckinDrunk,,,"Let me give you insight into how this affects the child after they've grown up. I deal with it every day.

Because Dad gets very angry, and abusive, when he is sober, the child develops a survival instinct that relies on instantly pinpointing when Dad is beginning to get angry. That instinct gets so good that the child can now independently gauge his fathers needs in order to NOT get angry. This constant awareness of another's emotions goes well past a habit. It becomes completely instinctual. 

Now that child is an adult and is in a relationship. (so that I can explain this better, that child is a she). She is now INTENSELY cognizant of her BF's feelings, needs, wants, desires. Just like her father. Here's the rub. BF comes home, he just got cut off on the road, it pisses him off. He walks in, GF sees his face and goes into full alert mode. She fusses, she presses, she literally hangs on the edge of her seat for the rest of the night, WAITING to anticipate what BF's needs might be. BF just wants to sit down, cool off and move about his day, no big deal. But to her, this situation is life or death. Her childhood programming is YELLING at her that if she doesn't make BF happy, there will  be EXTREMELY dangerous consequences. 

This continues ALL the time. BF stubs his toe, mutters a curse, FULL ALERT MODE. She will literally conform her entire existence around trying to anticipate what her BF needs, or what she THINKS he needs. 

After a while, BF feels totally smothered and breaks up with her. He leaves. Just like Dad. Her world falls apart and she becomes deeply depressed. This abandonment just reinforces what her childhood told her; that she must have gotten his needs wrong and that's why he left. She vows to do better next time. 

Next boyfriend comes along, she tries HARDER to anticipate what he needs. Same result. He leaves her, her world falls apart, abandonment gets reinforced. This constant reinforcement can get so bad that simple disagreements, to her, carry the full weight of a lifetime alone. Because that's what her instincts tell her. If she leaves the butter on the counter, and BF asks her to please remember to put it away, she goes into full alert, ""He's gonna leave me!!"" mode. 

Naturally, this wildly irrational overreaction totally baffles the BF and eventually, he will also leave because he can't handle how unpredictable she can be.

Because she spends so much time concentrating on other's feelings, she learns to completely disregard her own wants, needs, desires, and emotions. This gets to be so deeply entrenched that, when asked, ""how do you feel"" she will be completely unable to consciously grasp how she is feeling. If prompted ""Are you happy"" she will respond with ......""I'm not sure. I think this is a moment when I'm supposed to be happy, so maybe I am?""

Likewise, if she can't identify her emotions, they also can't be expressed. BF buys her a really nice bouquet of flowers, brings them home, gives them to her.......stone face. ""Oh. Thanks."" No smile, puts flowers in the vase, continues on with day. BF is crushed.

Sitting on the beach in the Bahamas with BF, BF leans over and says that he loves her and this is perfect. Stone face. ""Oh. I love you too."" 

OK. There is so much more but this is long enough. Sorry Reddit.

True,hkdharmon,,,"So it's sad story time. When I was about 20 I had to move back in with my parents. I had a full-time job, I was just in between homes after my wife left me. I worked nights.

My dad was a raging alcoholic ever since I was a kid. He was never unemployed and worked for IBM for 25 years until he died, but he was a mean drunk, and he was always drunk. Wouldn't drink a cup of coffee that did not have a proof number.

I would get home and get into bed and he would start hollering up the stairs for me to run him errands. He had no shame or concern that I had just pulled 12 hours and drove an hour to get home. One time it was to get him some cigarettes, another time something else. I would ignore him, but he would sit downstairs and let out his drunken wail while I tried to sleep and the only way to get him to stop was to acquiesce.

One time, he needed help changing his piss-stained skivvies because he was too drunk to stand up. I literally had to change my fathers underwear for him because he pissed himself. I decided that the next time, I would put a pillow over my head and he could fuck himself.

The next time, we was wailing ""ohhhhhh, hkdharmon, help meeeeeee......."" over and over and wouldn't stop. I tried to just ignore him and pretend I was asleep and let him pass out or change his own underwear or whatever piss drunks who can't make it up the stairs do for fun, but it kept floating up the stairs ""ohhhhh, help me...."". 

Since it seems a falling-down drunk okie has more ability to stay conscious than an exhausted, yet-sober, young man has to fall asleep, I finally did what I had been trained to do, I gave in. I went down stairs.

""What do you want?""

""I need to go to the hospital.""

My dad was sitting in a pool of blood. He was hemorrhaging internally and it was all leaking out his rectum. He was bleeding to death out his ass. I carried him to the car and drove ridiculously fast to the hospital. In the ER, they had him on the toilet shitting blood while racing to get enough blood into his arm to keep him alive and they were having a hard time of it.

He ended up spending a year in the hospital, coming in and out of consciousness, having strokes, heart surgery, and hallucination before he died.

This is the guy who beat me, my siblings and my mother, and mentally tortured us out whole lives.I often think I should have stayed in bed. No one would have known.

I know that little kid is young, but I hope someday he just keep walking and leaves the shit on the ground.

True,bluepilled,,,"Rand Paul's anti-drone filibuster lasted 13 hours, but no Democrat besides Ron Wyden showed floor support.  Individuals at your network have even been openly hostile to Paul.

John Brennan has been on the wrong side of numerous controversial post-9/11 issues.  Four years ago, his advocacy of torture forced him to withdraw for top CIA spot. Yesterday all but two Democrats voted to confirm him.

So after ceding authority on drones to Repulicans, Democrats gave near unanimous approval to a scoundrel.

* Hasn't this been a pathetic showing for ""progressive"" Democrats?  

* Are power and party so much more important than (alleged) principles?  

* Was Democrats' anti-war talk of the 00's just opportunistic sloganeering for electoral success?  If not, what happened to them?

**EDIT:**  Wow, many thanks for all the thoughtful responses, even if my question was not selected by Rachel.   And many more thanks to the generous person who Goldened my account!

Bottom line I'd like to see more Democratic pressure on the administration - from the media, the public, and especially Congress - regarding warrantless wiretapping of phones and email, indefinite detention, Guantanamo, extrajudicial executions, undeclared wars, etc.  Maybe that's totally unrealistic.  But it's been very discouraging to witness the diminished appetite to oppose the expansion and institutionalization of Bush-era terror policies overseen by a president elected on his principled anti-war, constitutional law credentials.

If we finally return to these issues because an unpopular opposition party sees crossover appeal with the issue of drones, I'm all for it.  Maybe this will all be forgotten again but I hope that's not the case.

True,tengu38,,,"**The Attack and Response:**

If NK launches a nuclear weapon, what follows will depend to some extent on *who and what* they launched it at. It is not believed that NK has the ability to launch a mid-long range nuclear attack. In other words, they can’t hit the US from Asia. Their only viable/realistic target option for a nuclear strike is South Korea.

A nuclear response depends on a state’s second strike capability – their ability to continue a nuclear war after the first salvo. If NK launches a nuke, the probability that their missile facilities will survive long enough to ever launch another one is extremely low. NK knows this, which means two things:

- They know they’ll only get one shot. If they are dead set on causing an international nuclear incident, they’ll launch it at Seoul and kill 13 million people off the bat.

- They know that a retaliatory nuclear response directed at them is unlikely.

Honestly, it doesn’t make a lot of sense from a strategic standpoint to nuke NK into nothingness, and China / Japan will never stand by and let that happen, to say nothing of South Korea. The ecological consequences make this too costly.

In the event that a US &amp; SK –led coalition take military action in NK, China is going to get extremely antsy. It would require a nuclear attack, or something not far short of one, to get China to begrudgingly allow US military action there. The politics of the situation there will “ensure” a “short” war. 

In other words, the campaign will end with the essential destruction of NK and the unconditional surrender of their government. An attempt by the US to occupy NK would be disastrous, but most likely it would be politically unnecessary. In this instance, the US is fighting a defensive war against a lunatic nuclear antagonist. The West will have a grace period of letting the military go in and kill like they’re supposed to before people get upset that we aren’t fixing our enemies houses and schools up nicely after we reduce them to craters. Besides, NK could use the renovations. 

**South Korea is Screwed:**

Regardless of whether or not NK led off with or ever commits a nuclear strike, the war will transition from that point to a conventional war. Assuming Seoul is spared a nuclear holocaust, North Korea has 50 years’ worth of artillery aimed at Seoul and SK targets. It doesn’t really matter that they’re cold war technology; they’ll kill a lot of people. 

NK stands little to no chance of resisting the US military; we’ll dominate. Whether or not we can dominate without them managing to encroach into South Korea and making the border areas a terrible place to live is another question. Probably not.

North Korea has been insane about its borders, because nobody wants to live in North Korea. This means that they’ve left themselves few corridors in which to advance South, one of which is a major highway. All of these have been fortified and mined, and any bridges/overpasses are rigged to blow in the event NK tanks come rolling toward them. My guess is that NK would likely have to burrow their infantry in with tunnels under the DMZ. Either way, most of the costs vis-à-vis destroyed infrastructure (especially modern infrastructure) will be incurred by SK.

Pyongyang is a fortress city and is nigh-invulnerable to drone and air strikes, but the rest of NK is not and we can burn them out from as far away as Guam (but more likely from a fleet of submarines all around the Korean peninsula.)

SK will be burdened with most of the post-war costs. 

**Conventional War:**

It’s worth mentioning that NK has a standing army of 1,000,000 people. This seems like an intimidating number, and it should be. However, it’s worth mentioning a couple things:  

NK is a shitshow that can barely keep the lights on. Clothing a million man army with sweatshop/slave labor and substandard materials is enough of a challenge to NK that they can barely feed anyone. Once a war starts, and they start losing supplies, food, equipment, and personnel – that’s it. They aren’t getting anymore, and they don’t have the infrastructure to produce it, especially not during wartime.   


NK has to buy it’s Cold-war equipment from others. They aren’t going to be able to afford that once the war starts, and they aren’t going to be able to shift that production capability into their concentration camps.  

**Ideology:**

This isn’t from experience, but from what I’m told about North Korea: North Koreans either realize what a pathetically outrageous excuse for a government they have, and wisely keep their damn mouths shut about it, *or* they don’t realize anything about anything because they’ve never seen or heard of anything except the nonsense that NK spews 24/7. The folks who believe NK discovered a unicorn, but who have never heard of television.

It would definitely be foolish to underestimate ones’ enemies, but it’s never foolish to try an understand their motivations. Compare NK to Al Qaeda; AQ will “never” be defeated because they will always resist the West ideologically, no matter how many of their leaders we kill, and in fact more so because of how many of their leaders we kill.  NK, on the other hand: I just don’t see these people fighting an incredibly drawn-out and sustained conflict. Like that pudgy fuck Kim Jong Un is going to rally anyone? Liberate two death camps and we’ll see how long that lasts.

**The Goal:**

NK has no realistic expectation that they will be able to win a nuclear, or sustained conventional war. Thus, their tactic is likely to make any victory over NK a pyrrhic one, where it is so costly to the US and SK that we are unwilling to see it through to the end.

This points to a likelihood of conventional warfare tactics, relying on artillery and fortified gun and AA emplacements hidden in a country that’s all mountain and forest to drain US/SK resources and raise casualties. 

They don’t have to beat us, they just have to not let us completely destroy them before Big Brother China steps in and wants us to stop. China will have no patience for a decade of sustained conflict on its’ border involving anyone, let alone its’ rival superpower.

True,wizr0b,,,"I've addressed this issue with a lot of players in my DMing career and also in my professional career teaching stage acting and improvisation to college students.  First of all, what you are experiencing is, in my opinion, exactly what most players go through when first learning to enjoy roleplaying games.  You are not alone!  Even if you do nothing, the problem will slowly resolve itself as you gain experience and become more comfortable at the table.  That said, I think there is a lot you can do to improve matters more quickly, if you like.

The subject of how to learn to improvise (which is essentially what roleplaying is) could cover months of coursework, but I think as far as your specific concerns go, you should focus on the following bullet points:
1. Be boring
2. Look stupid
3. Don't be anyone other than yourself
4. Stop protecting yourself from imaginary danger

1. Be boring - As humans, when we are put on the spot creatively we feel tremendous pressure to impress our peers.  We want to be funny or profound or astounding, etc.  The problem with this is twofold; first, it is extremely difficult to be awesome on demand (go ahead, I dare you, do something awesome RIGHT NOW!!!!  See?), and second, when we try to be awesome and fall short we come off as annoying, like we are trying too hard (I'm sure you can think of someone you know who does this).  The solution is to remind yourself that you can be boring.  The people sitting at the table with you already like you, you don't need to impress them.  Your character is interesting enough without you reaching to make him super awesome.  Instead, just go with whatever ideas come to you and trust that they are interesting enough.  By opening your mind up to its natural flow and not editing the ideas it gives you, you will actually come up with better material than if you try to force great ideas.

2. Look stupid - If you're like most people, you spend a significant amount of time and energy trying not to look stupid in front of others.  Perhaps you fear that they will reject you, or perhaps you don't even think about it, as the society you live in has trained you not to look stupid from childhood.  If you want to be a great roleplayer, you need to let this go.  Think of your favorite actor or actress.  You've almost certainly seen them do something that looks stupid and you probably loved those moments watching them.  What would comedy be without characters looking like fools?  Imagine your favorite dramatic movie without any of the performers appearing vulnerable.  Trust that your audience (which in this case is your friends) will not turn on you when they see your vulnerability or insanity or weirdness and just be yourself.  Your crazy, messed up self.  :D

3. Don't be anyone other than yourself - You mentioned that you are playing a tribal warrior and that you are having trouble relating to such a character.  The truth is, every character is just a reflection of yourself.  You don't need to do a weird voice or accent.  You don't need to change your language, making it broken and halting or super fancy.  You CAN do these things if you want to, but you can also just talk like you already do.  Imagine yourself as this tribesman; instead of worrying about what would he do, think about what you would do.  Note that I don't mean you should never add things to your characters that are different from yourself; you can and should if you want to.  I simply mean that when you feel overwhelmed trying to build this whole person, you can set all that aside and just use yourself.  Start by playing you plus the ability to use a spear and slowly add things from there when it suits you.

4. Stop protecting yourself from imaginary danger - Every actor and roleplayer I have ever worked with does this.  Actually I would guess all creative people do this, but I haven't studied other media closely enough to be able to point it out.  I believe it is naturally selected behavior.  As a species we lack sharp claws and teeth, armor or poison, flight or extreme speed with which to defend ourselves, instead relying primarily on our ability to cooperate.  As a result, when we feel like we are separated from our group, we have an emotional reaction akin to the fear of death.  Performing of any kind places you alone, facing a group and can evoke this emotional response.  But the truth is, the audience wants you to succeed.  The short name for this phenomenon is ""stage fright"", and despite the lack of a stage, I have seen countless gamers go through it when trying to roleplay.  Recognize that any fear or intimidation you experience when you are trying to talk in front of others is an outdated inate response.  Feel it, and then dismiss it and do whatever you were going to do anyway.

All of this is very academic so I'd like to close by offering a few concrete suggestions that will help you implement this philosophy.  

First, you have to force yourself to talk in session.  So here's what you do, every time you interact in the game, make a tally on your notepad (or wherever you keep notes).  At the end of the session, compare the tally with the amount of time played and determine how often you are interacting each hour that you play.  Then, if you feel like you did not interact enough, give yourself a quota for the next session.  For example, ""I must speak up at least once every fifteen minutes"".  Yes this is stupidly mechanical and artificial, but it will force you to talk until you feel comfortable talking and can abandon your quota as no longer necessary.

Second, in between each session, write at least one paragraph about your character.  You may write more if you wish, but one paragraph (four sentences) is all you need.  This does not have to be important material at all, but it should pertain to what is going on in the campaign.  The important part is that it will force you to think about your character and commit those thoughts to page.  Once those juices are flowing, start thinking about things like, ""how does the character's history relate to his current situation"", ""how does the character feel about what happened in our most recent session"", and ""what might the character be hoping to do in the next session"".  Don't worry about grammar or spelling or formatting, no one else ever needs to read any of this.  But do commit to thinking about your character outside of actual game sessions (when you may feel on the spot to perform).

On top of everything I have said, it's important not to think of your character as existing in a vacuum.  (S)he exists in collaboration with your GM and the other players at the table.  Think about reacting to the things they do, as opposed to always creating new ideas yourself.  Think about how you can help contribute to their characters and plots being awesome.  Talk to your fellow players about your concerns and let them lift you up, just as you try to lift them up.

Don't forget to smile and have fun.  Roleplaying is awesome and you are awesome.  Let me know if you would like me to elaborate on anything I have said.  I hope that some of this helps and that your game goes well.  :D",0,1362760174,,0,False,1,c8s2hnv,t3_19wv1p,t1_c8s2hnv,t3_19wv1p,,1431522979,122,False,rpg,t5_2qh2s,122

Now to make things a bit clearer, its not about, not giving a fuck about the past, or living your life, and it has nothing to do with these kids not being part of the conflict. Its about admitting history and accepting the past. 

The Jews hating Germans part can be used to bring my point across, because the Germans accept the holocaust and the genocide, that's the difference. You will have a really hard time trying to find a Serb boy or girl living now in Bosnia that thinks that Srebrenica was an act of genocide, or that even people were killed there. The amount of disregard to the acceptance of guild and the blame for the war is almost non-existent in Republika Srpska, its a much worse mentality in that regard then in Serbia, where you have a small liberal movement. And that's the thing, because there would be no problem in this couple if the lets say they both accepted their share of the blame in the war between Serbs and Croats, but its hard to find people who would be willing to do that. Thats if a German boy and a Jewish girl were a couple now, and the boyfriend is reluctant to accept the blame for the holocaust, saying stuff: it wasn't the Germans fault, the Jews are a greedy people. Implying stuff like that in such context is enough too destroy the picture of the person you had previously.

True,thisispathetik,,,"So, these companies, and others, get their money and power from people buying their products. When you start to see something wrong with a company (whether it is child labour, animal cruelty, unethical treatment of workers, ecological irresponsibility, sexist marketing) then you start making more conscious choices about where to spend your money. People do this all the time - cigarettes, fairtrade coffee, no-sweat clothes, cruelty-free cosmetics.  But usually it requires someone pointing the issues before you see the product/company that way. What Sarkeesian is trying to do here, as I understand it, is increase awareness of the stereotypes in the gaming industry, and thereby induce people to support the games and companies which portray women as 3D characters, and not always as stereotypes, and to call out the industry when they see games that continue to spew these stereotypes. She might also cause some of the companies themselves to reflect on these habits. This could have a huge effect, much more than producing your own movie or show or game would. Or it could be the start of a growing consciousness about these issues. To solve a problem you first have to identify it, and that is what she is aiming at. Once seen, these things are hard to unsee - I can't help but apply the Bechdel test to movies I watch now. 

I think it's facetious to argue that it would be better to make an independent game - that would also be great, and these videos aren't stopping anyone from doing that but it isn't necessarily the best thing to do, it is definitely not the only thing, and for someone like Sarkeesian who is now well known and has a well established platform for her videos and writing, and is not a game developer,  it is not the sensible thing.

I thought this was supposed to be about why men, got my age, feel like there is nothing to live for.  Having dealt with depression on and off for a number of years I have contemplated suicide.  I read something recently that summed it up, which I will post below.  But for me stress is a trigger, not one thing or even two but when a number come together you can reach breaking point.  I had the death of my father, a very ill partner and money/work pressure.  Any two of the three would have been ok but three together were too much.  Fortunately I recognised that I was not thinking properly and sought help.  But if I had let it go on I think my thought patterns would have become such that I would no longer have realised something was wrong.  I now know the signs so last year when I was diagnosed with cancer, split up with my partner and get made redundant I knew that I would need to look after my self.  It didn't block out the feelings of hopelessness but I am still here! 
I don't think men can admit weakness.  I work in a field which is male dominated and competitive.  Stress is seen as a weakness.  But at least a quarter of mt long term colleagues/friends have suffered stress and/or depression.  It's not till you start talking do you realise how common it is. 
A lecturer, when explaining stress management to a class, raised a glass of water and asked, ""how heavy is this glass of water?"" Answers called out ranged from 20g to 500g. The lecturer replied, ""The absolute weight doesn't matter. It depends on how long you try to hold it.""

""If I hold it for a minute, that's not a problem. If I hold it for an hour, I'll have an ache in my right arm. If I hold it for a day, you'll have to call an ambulance. ""In each case, it's the same weight, but the longer I hold it, the heavier it becomes.""

He continued, ""And that's the way it is with stress management. If we carry our burdens all the time, sooner or later, as the burden becomes increasingly heavy, we won't be able to carry on."" ""As with the glass of water, you have to put it down for a while and rest before holding it again. When we're refreshed, we can carry on with the demands of life.""

* [The US has the second largest active military in the world after China.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_number_of_military_and_paramilitary_personnel) This is complemented by the US's air and naval forces. Speaking of which:

* [The US has the most aircraft carriers in the world BY FAR at 10.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_aircraft_carriers_in_service) Second place is Italy with 2. **The US has as many carriers in service as the rest of the world.** Think of each one as a mobile air force base. These are all Nimitz-class carriers, meaning they are a class of super-carriers that can hold about 90 planes each, travel at around 30 knots, and house 2 nuclear reactors for propulsion. **These motherfuckers can go over 20 years without refueling!** That means the US has 10 mobile air force bases that essentially never rests. The US is the undisputed Queen Bitch of the seas.

And that's only the carriers. Globally, there are 28 Cruisers and 150 Destroyers. [The US owns 22 of those Cruisers and 62 of those Destroyers.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_level_of_military_equipment)

* The US has the biggest air force, bar none. Technologically, the Russians have come out with an almost equivalent air fighter but the US has a much larger air force and the logistical capability to fight anywhere efficiently.

* As if all these conventional weapons aren't enough, the US's nuclear capabilities are mind-boggling. Everyone knows the US and Russia generally have the same amount of nuclear weapons (around 5,000) but the US's delivery systems are unparalleled. The US holds 71 of 134 total nuclear powered submarines in the world. 

Out of these 71, 18 are Ohio-class. These are capable of holding 24 Trident SLBM missiles that each hold up to 8 MIRV (multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicle) nuclear warheads. Each of these MIRV warheads hold a firepower of 100 kilotons of TNT. **That means each of these subs could hold 24 missiles that can each separate into 8 nuclear warheads, totaling 192 warheads, each with a range of 4,600 miles. That means a sub off of NYC could hit Anchorage. You read that right. We essentially have 18 mobile nuclear launch bases that can move underwater.**

Say there is knowledge of an impending nuclear attack by, say, North Korea. Suppose that US satellites saw North Koreans fueling the missiles and that they were going to launch a warhead. Before they were even done fueling, I am sure the US would have a few subs in the area and be capable of independently targeting each major city and military site in North Korea and nuking them. If they wanted to.

TL:DR The US is Queen Bitch of the world. Militarily.

People tend to have revisionist history for these sort of things: 

- Landscape (Spacewalk) - Spacewalk didn't exist when Landscape started (and didn't have support for Debian distros back then, not sure what the status is currently), either way this is a commercial product that we sell for people who want it 
- Launchpad - We needed a tool to build a distro, and the idea of melding the bug tracker with the blueprints and the codehosting was pretty much new back then. 
- bzr (git, hg) - bzr has existed in some form since 2004. Back then the idea of dvcs was TLA and bunch of older programs, etc. Then a bunch of them came out and competed for mindshare. git has obviously won that war. Ubuntu still uses LP and bzr, it's just in maintenance mode. We're not going to spend 2 years to redo the entire thing with resources we could be spending on Ubuntu when lp/bzr works just fine.  
- Upstart (systemd now) - Again, predates systemd, we needed a modern init so we made one. Someone else made one, and that's great, but again, we're not going to go through another 2 years of stabilizing on a new init system when upstart works just fine. 
- Unity - We wanted to make a desktop, so we did. 

Other than Landscape, all of these things are OSS and free for anyone to hack on. People act as if there's some magical entity that says ""if you're not using systemd then you're doing it wrong."", most people I know could care less about init and would rather have us fix other problems, *shrug*, but whatever, if people in /r/linux want to keep claiming that upstart is some NIHed implementation that came after systemd because we felt like it then there's not much we can really do about that.

I spend all day in a profession where I'm not allowed to lose my patience, try to be constantly positive and encouraging, and try to teach people the fundamentals of the game.  /r/soccer is a bit of a release from my day job where I can call everybody stupid and a cunt and generally be a bit of a balloon without it effecting my life.  

My point is that whatever ranty tirade I'm on, I'm always available to actually discuss the game of football.  Whilst I'm certainly a fan of football, I'm primarily a student of the game rather than a fan.  My entire existence now is based around football; either coaching, watching, planning, discussing, writing or reading about it and I wouldn't swap that for the world.

In regards to your Post Match Tactical Analysis, perhaps you might find the following helpful in terms of how you approach it?  I'll say straight away that I'm relaxing with a bit of music and a few cans of lager whilst writing this so this could be a tiny post with insufficient information or a huge post detailing everything that ever happened ever.  I'll try to keep it brief bu I'm passionate about most of these subjects.  

Never try to analyse a game from the team you support live.  You get too caught up in the fun and drama of football to actually see the game properly.  If you want to analyse United, I'd recommend watching the game in peace/as a fan, then get a replay of the 90 minutes to actually *watch* the game.  You get the best of both worlds then; I don't ever want to watch a City game and be looking for invited pressing opportunities, I want to have a beer with some mates, have a sing song and watch the game.

Be aware of the opposition.  In fact, to get a really good picture, go and watch their last couple of games and concentrate entirely on them.  You need to know why your team have chosen the decisions that they have.  

If you are just starting analysing games properly, I'd recommend the stop-start technique.  Essentially, you stop the video every ten seconds or so and try to understand what player is where, what runs are being made and think about why, etc.  This will allow you to see the game at a much slower pace than it was played.  Footballers have been working on decision making speed since birth and are experts in it.  Ferguson in particularly runs problem solving drills near constantly and sees this as fundamental to his style of football.  United's players are not the technically best players in the world, I think we all accept this.  The reason they are consistently at the top is not because Ferguson is some magical wizard; it's because he trains his players to not only make decisions quicker than everybody else but to make the correct ones more often.  Decision making is the root of Premier League football and the team that gets more of those split second decisions wrong will generally lose the game.  
This is why numerous observed events happen; why goals are scored late in games more often after people's concentration levels are low and their anxiety is high, effecting their ability to make decisions.  Don't ever forget that footballers are people and undergo the same psychological stress responses as the rest of us.   It's also why significantly worse teams can beat the best.  It's also why long ball football is successful (it requires a smaller amount of decisions but applied more often).

In fact, I should probably talk about analysis better.  It's a huge subject, akin to peeling an onion.  Hopefully the following will go down a few layers but I can tell you that to go down to all layers would require thousands of pages.  Football is a science, the one big thing that annoys me here is the simplistic view that people have about football.  It's so much deeper than people realise by watching it.

---

**How to watch football**

A couple of basics:

Football is a game of phases.  Traditionally, we say three phases; the attacking phase, the defensive phase and the transitional phase.  As you might imagine, it goes:

&gt;  Defensive &lt;---&gt; Transitional &lt;---&gt; Attacking

As you're a United fan, I'd comment that you should pay special attention to the transitional phase of United and your opponents.  In particularly, the speed which you move through the transition phase after winning or losing the ball.  In English, this means how quickly you revert to the shape and the tactical plan that is required in that particular phase.   There's also possessional phases that differ from both attacking, defending and transitional but another thing to ignore for the time being.  Think of those three as the chapter headings in a book, of which there's sub-headings breaking them into more detail.

Just to say, absolute formation does not exist; it's a myth.  There's no such thing as playing 4-4-2 or 4-2-3-1.  Every team has at least an attacking shape and a defensive shape.  Some teams are more complex and have a shape for certain attacking phases, certain possession phases and certain defensive phases but for now we'll ignore that.  Nobody plays 3 at the back.  That's fucking stupid, you have 10 outfield players, why would you put 3 in defence?  3 at the back really means 3 in a transitional phase, 2 in an attacking phase, 5 in a defensive phase.  All of formations are the same.

Your first job is to determine the attacking and defensive shapes of both your team and your opponent.  Just for the sake of brevity, I'm going to call your opponent Norwich but it applies to everybody equally.  
When Norwich have the ball in an attacking phase (and United out of possession in a defensive phase), where are the players on the pitch?  Stop and count.  Now do the opposite for when United are in attacking phases and Norwich defending.

I'd recommend now that you pause the video, have a brew maybe and think through their respective shapes.  The things you are looking for is:

Who are the hybrid players?  (Players that are in one position in defensive phases but different ones in attacking phases and vice versa, at United I mean your fullbacks, your striker dropping off, your centre mid, etc).  Hybrid players are a potential target in a transitional phase.

Where do natural overloads occur?  An overload is where there are more  players from one team in one area than another.  An example might be Neville overlapping Beckham creating an overload in the opponent's left back area.  Another could be Giggs helping Rafael to close down Ronaldo thus creating an overload in their left wing slot.  Any time somebody has more players in one area, it's an overload. 

An overload will also include a time when a player is in space of a position thus there's 1 player there to the opponent's 0.

You can be pretty confident after this that you've got a high level view of the game.  Of course, you need to relook at this every few minutes and see who has moved to where and think about how this fits into the overall picture.

In analysing the shapes, you should also see exactly how many players are involved in each phase of play.  Don't be fooled here though; even players not immediately involved in one phase might have their own job to perform.  Here I'm talking about things like Carrick ""making himself the easy option"" (forming the back shape) or ""guarding the midfield"" (preventative positioning).  Just because they aren't bombing forward does not mean that they don't have a crucial role in an attacking phase and vice versa.  Perhaps a spoiler but everybody apart from the CBs and the GK are involved in United's attacking phase whilst all 11 are involved in the defensive phase including the forwards.  

You will use this big picture to then look at the next categories; everything comes back to what you've learnt in this initial layer of the onion. ",0,1362775612,,0,False,3,c8s7oko,t3_19uk53,t1_c8s7oko,t1_c8rk65n,,1431525514,1109,False,soccer,t5_2qi58,1109

A buddy of mine has done some theoretical BiS sims for T15 and it puts haste on top over mastery and crit ( 1 point of haste = .49 agi, mastery = .47, crit = .47 from the last one I saw, this could have changed a lot).

Using close to BiS T14 (511 iLvL) gear UF + AS is still sims the strongest talent combination for me. 10% haste is a ton even at lower iLvLs, which edges it over EoE for almost every single target encounter right now. (EoE wins in AoE such as Wind Lord). PE is great with haste, but unfortunately will need a shitton to get out of control scaling, and will need the bloodlust trinket to get insane. It just doesn't scale as well with lower haste ratings.

By the time you get to T15 Heroic gear with Bloodlust / Juju trinkets and the Legendary Meta, PE + AS with heavy haste will be top DPS spec for sure, however the tricky part is figuring out when to make the switch. I'll probably switch once I get my legendary Meta. Until then I'll haste cap around 6900 and go heavy Mastery with UF+AS.

So to summarize:

Low iLvL - UF+AS / Mastery reforging/gems (EoE for AoE)
Higher iLvL  (With Legendary Meta) - PE+AS / Haste reforging / gems (Still not sure about AoE, maybe EoE still, though lots of haste with AS could be tons of FS ticks for AoE)

True,Mephistia,,,"My advice is predicated on the assumption that you've provided your mom/ dad/ brother with a guest key or other means of entering your home when you aren't there. 

Change your locks, keep doing what you're doing. Maybe see if you can invest in a security or alarm system.

1. **Option 1: Alarm system** If you can invest in an alarm/ security system, see if you can get one that allows you to set a guest code, or set the code remotely. I don't know if those exist, but it seems reasonable that they do. This would allow you to remotely set and reset the code if, say, your brother or dad need to get in the house for some reason while you're not home and you want to let them, but you're worried they'll give the code to your mom. 

2. **Option 2: Electronic Locks** We live in a rental duplex, and we just bought [this](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004GSFFMU/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) and installed it. You can manually change the passcode if you need to -- so, like, if you go on a family vacation and have your family members stop by the house to get the mail/ feed the pets/ water the plants, you can give them the code. Then when you get home, you can change the code. 

3. **Option 3: Change your locks** If you don't want to do or can't afford the first two options, then at the very least, invest in changing your locks and don't give out the key.

**Non-lock related advice**
If I was wrong about my previous assumption (that your family has the ability to enter your home whenever they like), then this section is more relevant.

1. **Coping Strategy 1: Curtains and peepholes or property cameras** Having opaque curtains and a peephole/ camera is so that you can conveniently be ""on a walk"" whenever your mom stops by. Doesn't matter if your car is in the driveway -- you were out. That's your story and you're sticking to it. 
2. **Coping Strategy 2: My house, my rules** My husband and I have had in-law issues from day one. For instance, my family and his family don't get along, but they both wanted to spend the holidays with us. So we tried a combined family holiday, and his family was just super, uncomfortably rude -- sat off to the side, only spoke to each other, and shit-talked the other guests (and me) within hearing. After that fiasco, my husband and I decided to alternate holiday family celebrations (like bad divorce custody agreement). After a few drama-filled Christmases, we gave up on alternating Christmas and claimed that as ""our"" holiday. If either side of the family complained, we just pointed to the fact that weren't spending it with spouse's family, either. On a similar note, both our families liked to store their shit with their kids. Obviously, I was aware of my family's tendency to do this, and wanted to put a halt to it asap. With his family, the stuff was more of a placeholder -- like, the fact that their stuff was at our place meant they were part owners/ occupiers of said place, and they could come and go as they pleased and treat anything on the grounds as theirs. Once I realized this, my husband and I set a ground rule to deal with this: *We won't store your stuff at our house. Ever.* And in the 12 years we've been together, we have only slipped up twice -- both times, we regretted it and it reminded us of why we had that ground rule. In this vein, make it a ""house rule"" that your mom cannot enter your house unless you are home. It doesn't matter if you're right down the block, she can't come in -- to reduce drama, you may have to enforce this rule on all family members who come to the house so you can cite it as policy for everyone, not ""just"" mom. If questioned on any new house rules, you don't have to explain or defend them. Your house, your rules. If you feel an explanation is absolutely necessary, either keep it brief (We've had some issues with respect for personal property in the past, but we don't want to single anyone out specifically so it's the same rule for everyone) or go into a super long but very vague description that will make their eyes glaze over and cause them to never ask again.
3. **Coping Strategy 3: Get a pet** Get a pet your mom can't handle, but you can. Is she allergic to/ dislikes cats and dogs? Get a cat or dog. Is she terrified of snakes or rats, but you're okay with them? Get a snake or a rat. This is basically making the environment inhospitable to her so she'll voluntarily limit her time at your house.
4. **Coping Strategy 4: Move the party** Not move house or town or whatever, just move the family get-togethers off your property. You don't have to make a big deal of it, just kind of casually start moving any get-togethers away from your house. Family dinners? During the summer, meet at a local park for a cookout, and during the winter suggest some inexpensive restaurant you've been ""really wanting to try."" If your mom wants to come visit, say, ""Oh, I've got a ton of errands today -- want to come with me while I run them?"" If she takes you up on that, tell her to ""meet you at x store,"" so you're at least in different vehicles. 
5. **Coping Strategy 5: Never volunteer to host** If you're volunteered by someone else or pressured into it, structure the celebration so it's as stress-free as possible --for summer holidays, arrange to go to a park or lake or the beach, and for winter holidays set a time for a ""family dinner"" and don't answer the door if they show up early ""to help"" (I say that, but I know full well that's impossible and everyone answers the door in that situation. Really, just make sure everything is taken care of so they have nothing to help with and have to sit in the living room awkwardly for 3 hours before the dinner actually starts. Politely refuse any offers they make to help, saying, ""No, you're my guest!"")
6. **Coping Strategy 6: You're great!** If your mom calls (as in the situation described above) and offers to come help clean/ watch kid/ whatever, just politely decline. Every time. She'll probably throw up a fuss and make a big deal of it and maybe even try to rope your brother and dad into guilt tripping you, but your response is simple: *I didn't need her help -- what was I supposed to do, make up busywork for her? That seems kind of patronizing. Believe me, if I ever need her help, I'll ask!* That last part doesn't have to be true, it's just reassurance that you're not breaking off the relationship for good.
7. **Coping Strategy 7: Interior locks** If all these other strategies are impossible, at least put locks on the rooms you don't want your mom going into, and making sure they're locked when she comes over. 

The goal here is to make sure your other family members feel welcome in your life, yet setting clear boundaries for your mom. The best remedy, if you feel there is no way to cut her out of your life, is to make your home a safe haven, a place of retreat. That means doing everything in your power to limit your mom's unsupervised access to/ presence on the grounds. 

By applying perfectly reasonable boundaries evenly to all family members, you're setting a standard. Further, because the boundaries *are* perfectly reasonable, your mom will be the only one flipping out about them. If your brother/ dad/ mom try to guilt trip you into relaxing these boundaries, **do not** show defensiveness or guilt. Respond calmly, with a light and dismissive/ flippant attitude. Stick to your guns and reiterate that these are perfectly reasonable requests that will be respected in your home. 

I would also suggest that if your mom instigates another episode like the one above, you should call the police and report the incident (if there is no pot in the house, or you live in WA or CO). The goal is not to put your mom in jail, or even a 24-hour psych hold; the goal is to have a record of her behavior so that if she ever does try to call CPS or something on you, you have evidence of her issues.

To the executives at EA, from one of your employees

I am deeply embarrassed by the troubled launch of Sim City and I hope you are too. When I walk around our campus and look at the kind of talent we’ve collected, the amenities we have access to and the opportunities working at such a big company affords us, I can’t imagine how for release after release, EA continues to make the same embarrassing, anti-consumer mistakes. We should be better than this. You should not be failing us so badly.

Another thing I see when I walk around our campus are massive banners that display what are said to be our company values. They are on posters on every floor, included in company-wide emails and hanging above the cafeteria in bright colors. You even print them on our coffee mugs so we see them every day. But somehow when planning the launch of Sim City, you threw them all out the window.

Most important of the values you are ignoring is Think Consumers First. What part of the Sim City DRM scheme, which has rendered the game unplayable for hundreds of thousands of fans across the globe, demonstrates that you are thinking about consumers before you are thinking about yourselves? Does “first” mean something different in boardrooms than it does to the rest of us? Does the meaning of that word change when you get the word “executive” in front of your title?

You can’t even pretend that you didn’t know consumers would be angry about this. Common sense aside, consumers complained about this during your public betas. In fact, when one of them posted his criticisms on the forums, he was banned! You tried to silence your critics. The same thing is happening now as users write in to demand refunds. What part of this behavior aligns with our company value to Be Accountable?

What you’ve demonstrated with this launch is that our corporate management does not believe in our core values. They are for the unwashed masses, not for the important people who forced this anti-consumer DRM onto the Sim City team. This DRM scheme is not about the consumers or even about piracy. It’s about covering your own asses. It allows you to hand-wave weak sales or bad reviews and blame outside factors like pirates or server failures in the event the game struggles. You are protecting your own jobs at the expense of consumers. I think this violates the Act With Integrity value I’m looking at on my own coffee mug right now.

On behalf of your other employees, I’d like to ask you to fix this.  Allow the Sim City team to patch the game to run offline. If Create Quality and Innovation is still a core value that you believe in, then this shouldn’t be a hard decision. Games that gamers can’t play because of server overload or ISP issues are NOT quality. Be Bold by giving the consumers what they want and take accountability for the mistake.

Finally I’d like to ask you to follow the last company value on the list in the future: Learn and Grow. When you made this mistake with Spore, the company and all your employees suffered for it. You didn’t learn from that mistake and you are making it again with Sim City.

So please, learn from this debacle. Don’t do this again. Grow into better leaders and actually apply our company values when you make decisions. Don’t just use them as tools to motivate your staff. With the money, talent and intellectual property available to EA, we should be leading the industry into a golden age of consumer-focused game publishing. Instead we’re the most reviled game publisher in the world. That’s your fault.  Things can only change if you actually start following the company values and apply them to every title we launch.

It’s about covering your own asses. It allows you to hand-wave weak sales or bad reviews and blame outside factors like pirates or server failures in the event the game struggles. You are protecting your own jobs at the expense of consumers. I think this violates the Act With Integrity value I’m looking at on my own coffee mug right now.

&gt;On behalf of your other employees, I’d like to ask you to fix this.  Allow the Sim City team to patch the game to run offline. If Create Quality and Innovation is still a core value that you believe in, then this shouldn’t be a hard decision. Games that gamers can’t play because of server overload or ISP issues are NOT quality. Be Bold by giving the consumers what they want and take accountability for the mistake.
Finally I’d like to ask you to follow the last company value on the list in the future: Learn and Grow. When you made this mistake with Spore, the company and all your employees suffered for it. You didn’t learn from that mistake and you are making it again with Sim City.

&gt;So please, learn from this debacle. Don’t do this again. Grow into better leaders and actually apply our company values when you make decisions. Don’t just use them as tools to motivate your staff. With the money, talent and intellectual property available to EA, we should be leading the industry into a golden age of consumer-focused game publishing. Instead we’re the most reviled game publisher in the world. That’s your fault.  Things can only change if you actually start following the company values and apply them to every title we launch.

&gt;To the executives at EA, from one of your employees

&gt;I am deeply embarrassed by the troubled launch of Sim City and I hope you are too. When I walk around our campus and look at the kind of talent we’ve collected, the amenities we have access to and the opportunities working at such a big company affords us, I can’t imagine how for release after release, EA continues to make the same embarrassing, anti-consumer mistakes. We should be better than this. You should not be failing us so badly.

&gt;Another thing I see when I walk around our campus are massive banners that display what are said to be our company values. They are on posters on every floor, included in company-wide emails and hanging above the cafeteria in bright colors. You even print them on our coffee mugs so we see them every day. But somehow when planning the launch of Sim City, you threw them all out the window.

&gt;Most important of the values you are ignoring is **Think Consumers First.** What part of the Sim City DRM scheme, which has rendered the game unplayable for hundreds of thousands of fans across the globe, demonstrates that you are thinking about consumers before you are thinking about yourselves? Does “first” mean something different in boardrooms than it does to the rest of us? Does the meaning of that word change when you get the word “executive” in front of your title?

&gt;You can’t even pretend that you didn’t know consumers would be angry about this. Common sense aside, consumers complained about this during your public betas. In fact, when one of them posted his criticisms on the forums, he was banned! You tried to silence your critics. The same thing is happening now as users write in to demand refunds. What part of this behavior aligns with our company value to **Be Accountable?**

&gt;What you’ve demonstrated with this launch is that our corporate management does not believe in our core values. They are for the unwashed masses, not for the important people who forced this anti-consumer DRM onto the Sim City team. This DRM scheme is not about the consumers or even about piracy.

True,Fenwick23,,,"I grow weary of this repeated conspiratorial usage of the phrase ""planned obsolescence"". They would have you believe that there are engineers out there designing products with the *intent* of causing them to break down sooner. Ridiculous. People just don't understand how competition in manufacturing has shaped consumer product design. One of the oft-cited examples is the venerable Hewlett-Packard LaserJet printer. Back in the early 90's if you bought a low-end HP laser printer, you got a printer built like a tank. The damn things were slow, but they never wore out. Contrast with the low-end now, which are flimsy, come with 3/4 empty toner cartridges, and certainly won't be functional in 10 years. ""Planned obsolescence"", the conspiracy theorists conclude smugly. But wait... how much did you pay for that LaserJet 4 in 1993? Yeah, it was over $2000... in 1993 dollars. How much did that shitty HP P1600 printer you're complaining about cost? Yeah, it was $200. If you spend the equivalent of two grand in 1993 dollars, which is over $3000 today, you get something like the [HP M575c](http://www.shopping.hp.com/en_US/home-office/-/products/Printers/HP-LaserJet/CD646A?HP-LaserJet-Enterprise-color-flow-MFP-M575c), which prints, copies, and faxes **in color**, and it's built like a tank. 

What people don't realize is that in the ""good old days"" of a given product, a cheap version simply *did not exist*, so all products of that kind of that vintage were well built. This happens in every industry, at various rates. Engineers are under constant pressure to reduce manufacturing costs to widen the consumer base. Those $200 printers sell at far more than 10x the rate of $2000 printers, because every college freshman is buying one. To that end, certain parts must by necessity be less durable. Ikea isn't making bookshelves out of particle board to sell more bookshelves when they break, they're using particle board because not enough people can afford $500 oak book shelves to keep all those Ikea stores in business.

""But Fenwick23"", you ask, ""What about that inkjet printer that had an **expiration date** coded into the inkjet cartridges?"" Well, that one's sadly all too easy to explain. Engineers, under the aforementioned pressure to cut costs, came up with a way to make inkjet systems for *much* cheaper. The only tradeoff was that they had limited useful life before the ink dried out and clogged the nozzles. No big deal, just add an expiration system to the all-in-one nozzle-head-ink-tank package that lets the customer know that they need to buy a new one. This design is so much cheaper than the old design, they won't mind buying it more often. But as so often happens in big corporations run by non-engineers, between the engineering department and the store shelves some upper-middle-manager looked at these cheaper ink jet cartridges and said ""WOW WE CAN MAKE MOR PROFITZ IF WE SELL THEM SAME PRICE AS THE OLD KIND!"" As a result, the anticipated reasonable tradeoff intended by the engineers disappeared in a puff of pointy-haired logic, and six months later HP is stuck with a PR nightmare that *looked like* planned/programmed obsolescence, but which was in reality the result of managerial idiocy.

There are, of course, some *real* examples of planned obsolescence. The canonical example, from which the phrase was popularized, was Brooks Stevens use of it to describe 1950's automotive marketing strategy. Brooks wasn't  talking about the cars *breaking down*, though. He was talking about aggressively marketing **styling changes**. The idea was to make last years model *seem* obsolete by changing the body designs. In essence, Brooks' notion of planned obsolescence was nothing more than adopting the same strategy as the high fashion clothing industry. Sure, your car and your jacket work fine, but don't you know that *this* year the cool people have wider lapels and round taillights? 

The one place where planned obsolescence **is** a conspiracy to make you throw away perfectly serviceable items and buy new ones in order to prop up an industry is **college textbooks**. Renumbering pages and shifting end of chapter questions around is exactly the sort of sinister behavior people accuse HP of. The reasons educational publishers stoop to such tactics is quite clear, though. Their customer base is not expandable by making the product cheaper, so in order to maintain profits they have to make their otherwise durable product ""expire"" somehow. It's evil, but understandable.

I applaud people repairing serviceable goods. Heck, I make a **living** repairing broken things. I just get sick of idiot ""journalists"" from places like *Wired* parroting the tired notion that the obsolescence of products in our cheap consumer society is the result of sinsiter motives, rather than the fact that **we're all fucking cheapskates**.",0,1362790856,,0,1362791518,1,c8sc7nq,t3_19xmd3,t1_c8sc7nq,t3_19xmd3,,1431527695,2808,False,DIY,t5_2qh7d,2808

True,xaxers,,,"It has been neither.  The problem in Afghanistan is that it's Afghanistan and we did not commit any serious amount of ground forces until around 2010.  Most of the time we've been there, it has been under 40k troops, which isn't enough to garrison North Carolina, let alone Afghanistan.  The number of soldiers available for patrols was actually fairly limited for most of the time there, which meant that it was possible to constantly withdraw and regroup.  Which, uh, is how they fight in Afghanistan.  

As for cost, over 12 years, it has been about 600 billion.  [Source](http://costofwar.com/).  That sounds like a lot, but it actually isn't.  It's close to 50 billion/year, which is 10% of what we spend on the military in general, and a pittance in terms of our GDP.

For lives, we have lost approximately 2000 soldiers.  Over, again, nearly 12 years, of which 75% are combat losses (the other ~400 are accidents and diseases), this equates to less than 130 killed a *year*.  This is not a lot.

So, when you say ""huge drain"", you need to understand that it isn't, and the reason for the long occupation has been a severe lack of troops, not because of the skill of our several opponents (the Taliban actually are only the largest force that opposes the government, HiG is a very large organization that has been active since the early 80s).",0,1362791930,,0,False,1,c8schow,t3_19xf1f,t1_c8schow,t1_c8sbyv0,,1431527834,346,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,346

There is no mention of North Korea at all. Sure, our northern brethren are frequently in the news, and tensions are rising. But the vast majority of South Koreans really don't care. The government under our new President, and the military might be preparing and not letting us know yet, but as a whole, we are simply carrying on with our lives.

As an example, as a high school student I must wake up at 5:30 AM, get to school by 7:30, and study at school until 10:10 PM(this is a Foreign Language school, one of the most rigorous educational institutions in the country). Add the tons of homework, projects, and all that shit, and we have no time at all. We barely get 5 hours of sleep on average.

I'm just a high schooler, imagine what it must be like for the drone like workers and college students, as well as all the other adults. North Korea is a definite problem, and we do worry, in the back of our heads, but frankly we simply have too much on our minds. The public opinion is still changing, but on the whole we believe that since the US has been keeping their soldiers on our soil, they will help us out. And we are developing our own military to a great extent as well.

Unfortunately, foreign countries seem to perceive the situation as a chess game between the outside players, and focus less on us, the  ones who live on the peninsula, and the ones who will inherit and rebuild it.

I would like to hear Reddit's opinion, as well as any corrections to my statement. Just as a reminder, compared to the general Reddit population, there are few South Koreans, and what South Koreans feel is different than overseas Koreans and foreigners.

True,[deleted],,,"Funny story, this happened to me once.

When I was a wee boy and I was living in British Columbia with a foster family, I was getting 'urges'. I had been looking for new ways to masturbate but let's be honest here fellas, I wanted something in my ass. For some unholy reason, I had told the girl who was my age about this and she told her mother. Her mother then went out and bought me a small blue bullet (with a tiny rope to make sure you could pull it out) and a big pink behemoth that spun around like the devil and had spikes.

She also gave me a big bottle, and I mean big, of KY lube. Now one night, when it was quiet and I was alone, I thought ""Fuck it."" I went to just ram the big spinning devil up my arse but it was a fair size and my butt wouldn't take it. Instead I thought ""Let's work up to it with this little bullet."" So I popped the bullet in, wrapped the rope around my finger, and started working it. It was vibrating away and felt quite good. Hit my prostate more than once. That felt amazing.

However something went awry. The bullet slipped away and the little rope broke. Now I've got this blue bullet in my ass and I can't seem to get it out. I tried putting in two fingers, to a both ecstatic and painful end, and pulling it out but that was fucking impossible. It was still vibrating, knocking around inside my ass. 

I froze. I'm sitting on the bed, my fingers and dick covered in lube, and I'm staring at the wall in what must have looked like pure shock. I tried everything to get this bastard out. I tried squatting and trying to crap it out, I tried deep breathing and relaxation. After 2 hours of having this thing stuck in my ass I started to panic. I started getting dressed to go talk to my foster parents. 

After getting my boxer-briefs on I went to pull up my jeans and the bullet tipped and landed directly against my prostate. My face immediately went like [this](https://i.chzbgr.com/maxW500/1726967552/h4983CD03/) and I slumped against the wall. This thing was bouncing off of my prostate and it was getting hard to control myself. I wanted to get it out but I didn't want to move. 

I'm trying to stabilize myself but this thing keeps knocking away at my prostate and I fucking explode. Undies are utterly soaked in one of the biggest loads I've ever blown. I'm still making the Janeway twitchy face but now I'm moaning like a wildebeast. I'm not a loud guy but holy fuck, the noises I made. Foster mother hears me and knocks on the door, asking if everything is alright. I straighten up too quickly and I get ""Yeah, every..."" out before I get dizzy and fall back onto the floor.

She opens the door to get an image of me laying on my back, dick trying its best to rip a hole in the fabric, fabric that is soaked with countless potential children, most of which are now running down my legs and making strange patterns as they creep around my leg hair. I'm on my back, and she goes ""Oh my god!"" and I try to scream at her to get out but all that comes out is ""Argghhhnnnhh"" as the bullet keeps bouncing around and hitting things that feel quite amazing.

She ends up getting me in a bathrobe, giving me a fresh pair of boxer-briefs that were quite difficult to put on and we leave. I'm wiping my legs off with a paper towel in the car, she's trying to keep a straight face but I can tell the only thing going through her head is ""Jesus fucking Christ."" We're driving along, the rumble from the car and the bullet, which is still going strong as they were brand new Lithium Energizers (They really do keep going and going and going) and they were showing it. The motor in this poor thing was getting a true work out for the first time. 

We go into the ER and she signs the paper work and talks to the triage nurses. I get pushed over to a corner in a wheelchair, this thing STILL going and causing some strong aftershocks. The waves of pleasure that are coming from the vibrating and from the massive load I had blown were too much and I kept making grunting noises. Hopefully, and I do hope, that everyone thought that I was just mentally defunct which I must have looked like.

We get brought back to an Exam Room after an hour (still going but its now been pushed away some how and it's vibrating and I can feel it but it's not doing much for me anymore so some of my mental facilities are coming online. The doc comes in and starts laughing, I start laughing because I have no idea what the fuck to do at this point. He explains that it's common, which made me feel better, and that it wouldn't be an issue. 

After about 2 hours (and an x-ray as well) they popped this bad boy out. I can still hear the noise as it landed in the tray and rattled against the tin. The nurse looked at it and all I said was ""Twist the base to turn it off"". 


And that my friends, is a detailed account of having a vibrating bullet pulled out of your ass by strangers after you blow a load so large that you couldn't think straight for the next 24 hours.

The thing was, you needed a new credit card after every disc. As long as you canceled before the month was out, didn't cost  anything. 

After moving through around seven AOL discs, asking parents and uncles and stuff if I could use their card, I ran out. The well was dry. I'm sure most of you can understand that by this point, I was hooked. I had to do something.

When I bought my computer it came with a piece of software, which was basically a free ad supported internet service called net zero. The genius that I am got it up and going in no time flat, and I must say I was pretty impressed with myself. Ad supported browser sure, but I could still play a bunch of games. 

My mom was pretty afraid of the internet when it first came out. She has severe reservations about the whole thing, and it took a lot of convincing on my part to get the internet in the first place. One of her big rules was to never divulge any sort of personal information. I was pretty okay with that rule, didn't affect me too much at all.

When I got net zero up and going I had to enter in my address and all that in order to get it running. In order to maintain anonymity, I chose the location of a time share my grandma owned in Florida. This seemed like a genius idea at the time, and I must admit I felt pretty good about it. Little did I know.

Well, after running this stuff non stop for almost an entire month, I was reading some message boards and my error finally clicked in my head. I was dialing up long distance to Florida every time I logged on, I live in Canada, and long distance was fucking expensive back then.

She was *livid*. As much at the phone company as she was with me. She was upset that, after having been a customer for however many years, they didn't give her some sort of warning that a massive bill was being racked up in long distance charges.

She ended up negotiating the bill down to half, $1600. This was now my responsibility, my burden. My dad ended up getting me a job in a, I kid you not, box factory. Just a side note, working in a box factory was more physically demanding than I would ever have assumed. I ended up working an entire summer, ten hour shifts, four days a week, in order to pay back the debt. 

Mind you, I made a lot more than $1600 which was appreciated when the school year came around, but I still consider this to be one of the biggest mistakes of my entire life. ",0,1362799614,,0,1362799895,1,c8sefnb,t3_19y46v,t1_c8sefnb,t3_19y46v,,1431528732,1345,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,1345

True,necrosxiaoban,,,"Hello, and welcome to the life of an astronomer! I'm going to give you a broad overview of your scope and what you can expect to do with it, as well as some other tips. I'll try and **bold** anything you ought to check wikipedia etc for more information when you have the opportunity.

For starters, congrats on your **Newtonian Reflector** on an **altitude-azimuth** **GOTO** mount. GOTO mounts can really simplify finding and tracking objects in the night sky. The key with any GOTO mount is to ensure it is aligned as accurately as possible during setup in order to give the computer the best possible fix on your location. From there, its just a question of telling the computer what you want to look at and letting it show you the sky. Your telescope is equipped with Celestron's StarSense auto-alignment technology, so it *should* handle this task on its own. I've never had the chance to use it before, though, and would be interested to hear what you think of it. 

As a reflector, your telescope has a **primary mirror** at the back of the telescope which focuses light onto the secondary mirror near the front of the telescope. Protruding near the front of the telescope is the **focuser** which can be adjusted to provide the sharpest image. 

Of course, you're probably curious to know what you can look at, so lets assess your equipment. You've got a 130 mm **aperture**, with a 650 mm **focal length**. Aperture is the diameter of your telescope's primary mirror and affects how much light the telescope gathers. The focal length is useful for determining magnification. You should have a 25mm and a 9mm eyepiece. To find the magnification yielded by each divide the focal length of the telescope by the focal length of the eyepiece. 650/25 = 26x, and 650/8 = 72x. That'll give you a low power and medium power configuration.

The maximum useful magnification of a telescope is 50-60 * the aperture of the telescope in inches, which in your case would yield at most 300x. Bear in mind that this will be achievable only excellent conditions when the air is dry and still, without vapor or heat shimmer distorting the image. 200x, however, is not unreasonable for this telescope. 

You actually have a fairly low **f/ratio**, or focal ratio, which is the focal length divided by the aperture. This results in relatively low magnifications. If I were you, I would aim to acquire a **Barlow lens** which can be coupled with any eyepiece to double or triple its power. A 2x Barlow would give you additional magnifications of 52x and 144x, and a 3x Barlow would give you 78x and 216x. The 78x option seems a bit redunant though, when your 9mm eyepiece alone provides a similar magnification. 144x is enough to clearly see the rings of Saturn, though, so you may be perfectly happy with a 2x Barlow. If you're interested in other eyepieces, **Plossls** are a reliable, relatively inexpensive design many beginning astronomers use. 

With that in mind, you should be able to see the rings of Saturn, the bands of Jupiter (albeit very small), the **Gallilean moons**, and the surface of the Moon. Jupiter and Saturn *will* be small, but don't let that deter you; Gallileo himself observed with magnifications between 3x and 20x. Bright **Messier** objects like the **Pleiades** and the **Orion Nebula** should also be visible. **Deep Space Objects**, especially low contrast objects like galaxies will largely be inaccessible for you, except under very dark conditions. The Andromeda Galaxy should be within the capabilities of your scope, for instance, but is likely to be nothing more than a fuzzy gray smear. 

If you're looking for a sky map program, I highly recommend **Stellarium**. There are some other, paid, solutions which offer a few extra features, like **Starry Night**, but I find Stellarium good enough for most purposes. 

Also, there are two excellent publications, **Sky &amp; Telescope** and **Astronomy Magazine** which both provide very useful information, give a summary of upcoming astronomical events, tips and tricks, etc. and are well worth a subscription to. 

Also, I would recommend you visit redditor /u/eyesontheskydotcom's website, http://eyesonthesky.com where he provides a lot of helpful videos, as well as weekly updates as to whats going on in the sky.


Edit: Almost forgot! One other consideration, with your telescope being a reflector, it is necessary for the two mirrors to be in alignment with one another in order to produce a clear, sharp image. The process of alignment is called **collimation** and there are many helpful articles and videos available on the web to help you through that process.

The only thing you can change is yourself, your own gameplay, and your own attitude. 

Solo queue isn't about working together with your team. It's about using what Riot gives you to work with.

Just pretend the other players aren't even real human beings. Pretend it's some super advanced (but still terrible) AI that Riot created. Every solo queue game is a randomly generated disaster scenario.

Go play a bot game. When Annie Bot fucks up, do you call it a noob? Do you ever count on Annie Bot? What if it spouted auto-generated text that trolls you when you make a mistake...would you get mad at Annie Bot? Or would you just be like ""fuckin' Riot...what a bunch of assholes...""

Your job in solo queue is to develop and run tests to figure out what capabilities your bots and the enemy bots have been given. The bots (almost never) respond correctly to even very basic text commands and (usually won't) respond correctly to pings, either. Their reaction time is on the order of seconds. They aren't capable of complex reasoning or intricate strategies. If you just assume these kinds of things **until they prove otherwise**, you'll be more prepared and less surprised when they do the next monumentally stupid thing.

When the solo-queue bots you've been given don't come to take a free dragon, are you going to get mad at them? Are you really going to try to reprogram the thousands of bots in your tier one-by-one via the chat box?

True,hestonkent,,,"Once upon a time, in the magical land of Toolbox, there was a small wrench who was born amongst the others. The wrench lived a happy toddler hood and led a very normal life for the first years of his life, until his parents realized something was simply not right. 

For little wrench was not growing, like a normal toddler wrench should be, no, he stayed the same. His parents were disgusted. In every wrenches life, theyre supposed to be put to some use, but no bolt could *possibly* be that small for that wrench to be of any use. So his parents simply gave up on hope of him growing, and tried to be as supportive of him as they could. 

Well, little wrench went to Toolbox elementary school, and on the first day, many whispers could be heard in the classroom, of tools who were curious how a wrench so small in size could be even living. Little did he know, this judgemental behavior would make his life miserable, throughout elementary school, middle school and high school alike. 

One day in his junior year of high school, he was being bullied in the hallway by two hammers, when the principal jackhammer of Toolbox highschool came running quick down the hallway. ""Everyone evacuate immediately! The acid piping is going to burst, and theres no tools to fix it!"" Everyone stampeded down the hallway, trampling the little wrench, shortly after the bullies let him go as they ran for their lives. 

Little wrench stood there in the middle of the hallway, all alone and abandoned, he could see a smoke/steam coming from the boiler room where the acid piping was located. ""Maybe, just maybe ill be of some use"" he thought to him self. ""If not, i might as well just die anyways, since i'm of no use at all"". Little wrench ran down the hallway and into the boiler room, and sure enough, there were 6 bolts on the piping that fit him just his size, and he was able to tighten all 6 of them and stop the piping from bursting. He walks out of the high school and announces that he fixed the problem, and he is cheered and carried back into the school, a hero.

True,slicksps,,,"This makes me think of a specific dog who I didn't protect well enough and still regret. I'm sorry for the overly long story. Shadow's ashes are in my lounge right this second... the only past pet to have such an honour. I just can't part with him despite losing other pets since. 

I made a silly mistake one day which led him alone into a busy road, but before I could do anything he was hit square across the nose by a car. His death was right in front of my eyes and the road was quickly stained in blood! But it seemed quick (if not instant) and probably (hopefully) painless... He did grab the ball beforehand so hopefully was mentally distracted before the impact. Another driver quickly and kindly came up behind and offered to take us to the vet, but the amount of blood spilled... or more importantly the rate that it was spilled was obviously far too much for a vet to save! The driver who hit him collapsed on the grass verge in tears by the side of the road and I comforted her. She told me she was scared that it was a child! But quickly apologised for the comment as she was relieved it was 'only' a dog... I dismissed her apology due to emotion on both sides. I don't forgive her, it was a bright pink ball which landed in front of her vehicle seconds before, if she was focussing, she should have seen that at least! She hit him after he passed one lane of slow-moving traffic into hers to grab it. The side he passed stopped for him (it was rush hour so bumper to bumper 20-25mph ish traffic. But she didn't stop in time... She obviously showed remorse however, whatever the excuse. I touched her leg as she sat on the grass next to my beautiful but lifeless dog. I was crying and she was crying but I had to reach out.

My wife was due to walk this way from college within minutes. Her phone was out of signal, I had to leave these people; one the murderer, others kind passerbys to keep watch over his body while I intercepted her en route... this was not the way I wanted her to find out. She needed to know first, before seeing the blood! The fastest and most emotional walk of my life so far. I picked up and carried our other dog just so I could move more quickly.

Shadow will never be forgotten. I made a stupid mistake and saw him die! I see it everytime I visit that park or drive along that road! I paid for his cremation; the first cheque on my book every time I open it... but we quickly found another rescue dog to take his place! Part of us wondered if it was the right thing to do... he was another rescue but the description of his replacement; Jake's personality was identical... we met him (my wife was reluctant) but we fell in love with him!

Jake and I go to the same park as I did with Shadow, but I don't throw the ball in the same way as I did that day (it's on a steep hill leading down to the road Shadow died on, there's a large hedge and fence between but you can guess what pushed Shadow to find the only hole through the chain link fence. I thought the ball hit the fence... obviously I was wrong, it bounced over and landed in the opposite lane of traffic).

I miss Shadow terribly and regret the stupid mistake I made. But following on by rescuing Jake in his place? Priceless! Where would Jake be now? He was brought up in an upstairs flat but as a high energy Doberman Colllie cross he would have gone insane! He now has a large garden, regular walks and his aggression towards toddlers and other dogs is easily retrained or avoided with no toddlers to upset him (his flat had a soon-to-be-toddler in!). He has Shadow's place and Shadow is sorely missed, but without us could easily have been destroyed.

It's hard to regret saving his life (if separated from our events)

Shadow and Jake would never have gotten on. But that's life... it continues. I love both, and without Shadow, my love for Jake continues. On Jake's passing I will happily find another to fuss about diet with, to walk, to cuddle, to cycle with, to play with, to teach, to train and to be by my side.

I'm sorry for the long post, but so far never has a perfect opportunity to reflect on my relationship with Shadow to be spewed out!

Shadow never would have forgiven me if after rescuing and losing him, we left that space in our hearts empty.

True,kharl,,,"[EDIT] Disclaimer: I wrote this post to explain de Grey's metaphor, and the graph in the OP. I don't support this ""model"" of the aging process and anti-aging treatments. 

[EDIT2] More Disclaimer: Apparently nobody knows the difference between a metaphor and a scientific model. The ""Aging as Falling"" thing is a METAPHOR. It does NOT actually describe the real aging process in any way. It is not a scientific 'model' of aging. It is not meant to make scientific predictions or statements about aging. Do NOT take it LITERALLY; Grey is just trying to get the reader to think about what would happen if we could slow or reverse the aging process.

--- original comment: ---

In de Grey's metaphor, your distance above the ground represents your health, and the speed that you are moving up or down represents your decreasing or increasing health. When you ""hit the ground"", you die. If you are falling down, then your remaining lifespan is decreasing (the normal state of affairs). If you are rising upward, then your remaining lifespan is increasing.

If you think about aging like I've described, then you can imagine that when we are born we are in ""mid air"" - far above the ground. At that time, our health is not deteriorating very quickly, but our remaining lifespan is not increasing either. We are born suspended in mid air, so to speak.

However, the force of gravity/aging immediately begin to pull us downward with a constant force. Over time, this force accelerates us into a faster and faster velocity towards the ground/death. 

When we are 10 years old, we are moving down towards the ground, but very slowly.
When we are 30, we are moving downward faster.
When we are 60, we are moving quite fast.
When we are 80, we are moving so fast that there may be no way to reverse our ""fall"".

Now, let's imagine ""anti-aging"" treatments as UPWARD forces, counter-acting gravity/aging. Early aging treatments will pull upwards with a force that is less than gravity: they will slow aging, but not reverse it, so we will continue to ""fall"".

One day, hopefully, an aging treatment will be invented which will be MORE powerful than gravity/aging. Maybe it will pull ""upward"" towards longevity with 150% the force of gravity/aging! Unfortunately, this won't be enough to save everyone. The lines on the graph are labeled with numbers. Each line traces the hypothetical trajectory of a person who is of a certain age when the treatment becomes available. Each line is labelled with that age.

If someone is 80 years old, they are exposed to the same gravity as a young person, but over their life they have built up a lot of downward ""momentum"" - they are moving downwards very fast. Even with the upwards pull of the longevity treatments, they may not be able to ""pull up"" in time, and they will die. (See the lines on the graph marked 80, and 100)

However, younger people may be able to pull out of their dive, and begin to ADD time to their lifespan - not merely slow the reduction of lifespan. (See the lines on the graph marked 30, and 50)

If someone is born after this treatment is invented, then they will never lose lifespan. Their life span will increase instead of decrease, so that even if they are cut off from the treatment at some point, they may have 200 years of ""natural"" lifespan ahead of them. (See the line labelled 0 on the graph)

Does that make sense?

(By the way: keep in mind that this is just a metaphor. We don't yet know if it is actually valid, and it makes a lot of assumptions. For example: it assumes that the force of aging is approximately constant - that it doesn't increase exponentially as we age. Plus, we don't know if treating aging like a ""velocity"" is even valid in the first place. It may be simply too complicated for such naive models. Time will tell...)

It's called ""the mistake across the lake"" and ""the borg"". Paul Allen's Vulcan real estate is responsible for most of the intense redevelopment around downtown and Amazon.

We actually don't like Amazon very much either, and it's employees are sometimes called ""amholes"" because of how fucking rude many of them are to the service industry and how they treat downtown and South Lake Union as their personal business campus.

Shit like groups of clueless devs walking slowly in packs 5-10 across and basically denying sidewalk use to everyone else, snapping fingers at retail staff instead of being patient or using their adult words and many other forms of exceptionalism. Fuckin' overpaid manchildren behaving badly.

*****  

**Edit:** I'm going to hijack my own comment because reddit's threading sucks and because I can, and I want you to read my insane rantings to explain this bar called The 5 Point because it's actually informative and supposed to be fucking funny. Be aware that a lot of this hyperbole, but it's factual hyperbole. And if you don't like swearing: fuck you. Paste begins below:

*****  

**Whoo boy, a whole lot of bullshit in this thread.**  

I live right down the street from this bar.  

Yeah, Dave's a troll and a publicity fiend. He's probably both serious about this and just trying to get a rise out of people and some free publicity. You're giving him both. This hit the front page of reddit and a bunch of A-list sites and blogs in less than 12 hours.  

Yes, he has reasons to ban them from the bar. People have been 86'd for being assholes with cameras. Sure, you can hide a camera in the button of your shirt. That just makes you an asshole with a *hidden* camera. All you're going to get footage of is people being drunk and unwinding and talking about shit like they do in a bar that has regulars who need therapists but go to a bar instead. If you want to record that kind of shit, you're probably a dick.  

No, ass kickings don't actually happen at The 5 point. At least not in the 3+ years I've been living in this neighborhood.

The closest I've personally seen that was ""Well, we should go outside and finish this conversation"" was when I was mouthing off about how I don't like the Blue Angels because they're a 100 million+ dollar a year propaganda and recruiting machine mainly targeted at children and I offended some ex Navy guys. So we went outside and I mouthed off some more and told them they were just proving my point about violence being stupid. No violence happened, but granted I'm really fucking intense and I can handle my own in a bar fight *and* and an argument, so I'm a really unattractive target for an ass whooping. I also hold my liquor better than basically any of the regulars in that place because my liver still works.  

Your mileage, however, may vary and you may actually get your ass kicked, especially if you're the kind of shitheel that walks around with a Bluetooth headset or Google Glass without thinking about how it fucks with everyone around you.  

Non-regulars have been known to get belligerent on the weekends when the regulars stay home. They get their asses handed to them by staff and the bouncers and sent home, or to the drunk tank in jail.  

No, Dave isn't saying this because of Microsoft. Fuck Microsoft.  

Most of Seattle fucking hates Microsoft. Microsoft is known as ""the borg"" or ""the mistake across the lake"", even by the lifers who work there, and especially by the abused ""contract"" workers that Microsoft uses to get around tax and benefits laws.  

We also tend to hate Amazon for being the 800 pound gorilla in the room. Amazon has totally changed and fucked up most of Belltown and South Lake Union.  

We're basically ambivalent and meh about Google. The offices here aren't that big.  

So whatever puerile nerd fantasies you may have about corporatism and and corporate rivalrys are dead wrong because we mainly don't give a fuck. There's a lot, lot more to Seattle than Microsoft or Amazon.  

Dave isn't banning Google Glass for any of these reasons, he's mainly looking for free publicity and he just found a fuckton of it. This isn't new. He was just on Bourdain's Layover for Seattle. Note that there's barely any film used in the show but Bourdain talks about it quite a bit.

Yes, The Five Point is a real fucking dive bar. It's basically Seattle's oldest bar and it's been in operation since 1929. If you become a regular there you're probably an alcoholic. Regulars all over my neighborhood get fucking plowed into the dirt there on a daily basis. I've had to collect neighbors off the sidewalk and drag them home dozens of times in the last few years.

The bar opens at 6 AM and closes at 2 AM. There are regulars who grab stools at the bar at 6 AM to start drinking.

The kitchen is open 24 hours but may God have mercy on your soul and greasy asshole if you order food between about 3 am and  6 am because that's when they're cleaning, and you're going to get some blackened triple-fried fries or half-assed food and you'll deserve it.  

It's also not a ""hipster"" bar. The Five Point does get some hipsters, but it's also still fully working class stiffs. Construction workers, ex military, retirees. There's a tone of local music scene shit that happens there, too, and not the ""i'm here to be seen"" scene, but ""I'm here to talk business about work or contracts or money"" scene.

If you want to see a hipster bar in Seattle go to the fucking Unicorn or Narwhal. Or maybe even Shorty's if you want an older dive bar with hipsters.

Last, if you've had ""terrible service"" at The Five Point and want to complain about it - get in line.  

You were probably being a fucking asshole, a schmuck, a dick or a jerk. The place is famous for abusing assholes and taking their money. There's a fucking neon sign on the front window that says ""WE CHEAT TOURISTS AND DRUNKS"" and it's not an idle boast. It's a fucking warning. Heed it. They'll take your money, pour you a shitty drink and kick your ass to the curb. If you don't like it, don't go. They don't need or want your business. They probably tried to communicate to you multiple times before taking your money. If you weren't smart enough to take the hint, sucks to your assmar, piggy.  

I've never seen someone who was polite and patient get shitty service there. People who are nice and who treat the staff like humans get stiff drinks and better service. People who don't get cheated. I think that's fucking awesome and I wish the whole world worked this way. If you disagree with this chances are pretty good you're a selfish asshole.  

If you want some entertainment, look for the 1 or 0 star reviews on Yelp where some pretentious, presumptive, abusive fucker makes the mistake of going to the 5 point and trying to treat the staff like wage slaves at a fucking Applebee's or Chili's. They bitch about not getting 5 star service in a fucking dive bar that has a ""cook on duty"" sign that's intentionally modified to make it say ""cock on duty"" and they get their asses handed to them. Hey, tourist? You're trying to get dinner in a place where the cook is a tattooed freak with hair longer than Ozzie Osborne and they're probably in recovery from all kinds of hard drugs. Go somewhere else, ok?  

Yeah, you saw this place on an Anthony Bourdain or Man vs. Food show. That doesn't mean it's your kind of place or you can actually hang out there or stand the heat in the kitchen. It doesn't mean they want or need your business. It's really not a place for fucking wussies and tourists. It's actually a real place for real people who work hard and play harder and who don't give a fuck about their blood pressure, liver or heart disease. It's not a *nice* place. The *nice* place is down the road at Tilikum Cafe or something. Go to fucking Salumi or Zig Zag, ok? Go to Clever Bottle or List. Don't go to the 5 Point. It's gross and dirty and it'll fuck you up.

I respect Dave for how he treats his staff. He treats the like human beings and doesn't let some random jerk who is only going to be there one night abuse them. 

There's very few places left like The 5 Point in Seattle. It's a fine place full of real humanity. It's not sterilized. It's not Disneyland. It's not fucking Microsoft or Amazon.  

And it's also not a fucking zoo. It's a place with real people with real problems. Leave your Google Glasses and cameras at home. Put your fucking cameraphone away.

Don't be an asshole and learn to take a hint and you might get poured the strongest drinks in Seattle and you might meet some really interesting motherfuckers.  

**But if you don't get any of this? If you think my rant here is just bitter and angry? Fuck you. Don't go to The 5 Point. It's not your kind of bar, and the bar doesn't want to serve your kind, and the regulars won't like you.**  ",1,1362823404,,0,1362840170,2,c8sis8n,t3_19y3h8,t1_c8sis8n,t1_c8shwvj,,1431530867,46,False,technology,t5_2qh16,46
True,Ardinius,,,"&gt;It is illegal to enter a country other than by a designated port of entry/customs post unless alternate arrangements have been made in advance with the relevant government.

Incorrect.

Australia provides protection for asylum seekers who either:
Meet the United Nations definition of a refugee, as defined in the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol (Refugees Convention), or

Are owed protection under other international human rights treaties and conventions which give rise to complementary protection obligations.

under article 33(1) of the refugees convention, a contracting state has an **obligation** to not expel/return (that is, refoule), either directly or indirectly, a refugee to a place where his/her life or freedom would be threatened on account of his/her race, religion, nationality, membership
of a particular social group or political opinion. 

Under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights - Article 14: **Seeking Asylum is a BASIC HUMAN RIGHT**

&gt;These people are NOT refugees.

This is a pathetic, unwarranted and untrue claim. Your sweeping (and overtly racist) generalisation will not be the arbiter of who this country is (or isn't) legally obliged to protect under international (and its own) laws. The fact is that the majority of asylum seekers who arrive in Australia by boat who are subjected to Australia's strict and overly excessive processing procedures are **found to be genuine refugees** fleeing persecution, torture and violence. 

&gt;Being Australian is a privilege

Which is precisely why we as Australians have a duty to protect those who come from the most destitute and war torn places in the world, *especially* when many refugees who flee to Australia are coming from *precisely* the war torn countries that the Australian Military has had an active role is destabilizing.

&gt;Generally these illegal aliens end up as a non-productive social and economic burden on a society

First off, let's point out your disgustingly racist sentiment here by recognising that we are talking about **people**. Not aliens.

Secondly, this is another unwarranted claim. Australia has largely been very successful (in comparison to other nations) in integrating refugees into the work force and making them productive members of society. I doubt you've actually had any meaningful contact with an actual refugee in your life, but amoung the many I have met, they are the *hardest* working and most grateful people I have ever had the pleasure knowing. And when they successfully go on to become citizens of this country, they are amoung the proudest Australians that I know.

&gt;They are simply queue jumping illegal aliens

If you were actually intelligent enough to know the facts concerning asylum, you would recognize that asylum seekers (the majority of which who are found to be genuine refugees and who go on to become productive members of society) constitute a measly 3% of all immigration in this country. If you're really hell bent on giving people from different ethnic backgrounds a hard time, instead of focusing on the most destitute of people, you'd be better served focusing on the 97% of immigrants who come to this country and take Australian jobs because of how highly skilled they are [Just be aware that it might not be as easy to vent your racist views here, as the majority of immigrants who come here (British and New Zealanders) may share the same skin color as you].

    NSString *directoryPath = NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains(NSDocumentDirectory, NSUserDomainMask, YES)[0];

You can then get the path that you want to write the file to by calling [`stringByAppendingPathComponent:`](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSString_Class/Reference/NSString.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/NSString/stringByAppendingPathComponent:) on the directory path:

True,Immaneuel_Kanter,rainbowdash,,"I never said animation or storytelling isn't important. I overstated when I implied children's cartoon shows are always unimportant. I don't think or mean that. I do think, however, that *Friendship is Magic* and other shows like it are unimportant.

Let me illustrate this by turning it around.

I am a scince fiction and creative non fiction writer. Writing is how I make my living. No matter how important I might feel my writing is, or how much other people like it, or how much it effects them personally, my stories aren't important--by themselves.

What *is* important is how stories affect human emotion, relationships, and learning. Other people could write stories very similar to mine and achieve similar results, even in terms of theme and emotional impact. Those are the important things.

So, to sympathize with you, I wrote elsewhere a lot more than I should have about how the model for seasons two and three have the potential to negatively impact the animation industry. What's important there? Surface level details, like whether Twilight Sparkle becomes a princess? No. What matters is people's livelihoods. Children's acclimation to advertising. Companies buying time, or entire studios, to rake out cheap kitsch to sell a product instead of tell a good story. Whether the show's purpose is to teach something lasting and meaningful through the trappings of story, character, and art, or if it's driven by a desire to sell a product. Those are the things that matter, not whether Applejack the farmpony learns the importance of holding back every once in a while. Those surface level details are, by definition, unimportant.

I have no problem with people having fun with and discussing the characters, plots, settings, and themes of programs they enjoy. I don't even follow FiM anymore and I still do that. Making it more than something fun, though, is a problem, like someone who fiercely argued with me a few months ago that the fictional character The Great and Powerful Trixie was, ""evil."" That's just foolishness.

*Friendship is Magic* is a cartoon targeted toward little children that, at least now, abandons storyline, pacing, and characterization when Hasbro asks them to sell something.

I shrugged it off, my wife loves me; we're in this forever.  After she finished her degree we decided we needed to wait a year because we wanted to buy a house and our loans were way out of control and we couldn't afford it.  


Time went by and a few years later I had the chance to start college.  After 3 years she found a great new job in a global company and start getting promotions really quickly.  She worked long hours and spent a lot of time with her boss.  I was entering my final 2 quarters when I got a call from the bosses wife on 12/18/2010 at 10:52 am.  My wife was having an affair...

True,p3ndulum,,,"I have some theories. (Warning: Heresy.)

TV/movies/the media, religion, ""the education system"", parents...

All of these things attract the attention of our *mind* and plant more and more of their own ideas about what it is we are, or what we should be. Basically, most humans are ""living a lie"" because they are always trying to act/behave in line with the things their egos identify with.

For example, if you ask a man who fights fires for a living what he *is*, he may say ""I'm a firefighter"". But he isn't. He is ""*a human being* who fights fires"".

On a superficial level, this might not makes sense (I might not be making myself very clear), but consider that the biggest difference between human beings and most other animals and mammals is *the ego*.

In the animal kingdom, a newborn baby tiger will always grow up to be a   tiger, still. Not a ""doctor"" or a ""bus driver"" (obviously tigers can't be doctors or drive buses, but hopefully you still get my point).

In the human world - perhaps in an effort to separate ourselves from ""animals"" - we pick an *idea* (i.e. whatever it means to be an ""accountant"", for example), and then we begin to surround ourselves with only (mostly) the things that support that *idea*.

We almost deny what it means to be born into this form (this *avatar*) in order to pursue these... illusions, or whatever it is we *think* (or what we want *others to think*) we are.

So, instead of being ""a human who helps other humans process and pay for their groceries"", we become ""cashiers"". Instead of ""a human who relays food orders and meals"" we become ""waiters"" and ""waitresses"" - which gives permission or allowance to other human beings to speak to us or treat us in accordance to what *they think* it means to be a waiter or a waitress, and how one should be spoken to or treated.

And much of what we end up ""*becoming*"" has much to do with the pressure that's put on us by the demands of society (Religion/school/governments, etc, as I mentioned earlier). Our brains, our minds, and the functions of our bodies provide us with an incredible amount of potential, but because of these pressures and the conditioning we're subject to by others, we are eventually *moulded* into anyone one of these *roles* that we play.

If you take away religions, governments, and the education system, all you're left with is ""the collective"" (everybody), ""the tribe"" (smaller groups of like-minded/like-spirited people), and ""the individual"". And within all of that, everything that's needed to sustain life.

Individuals do what they can on their own to survive, and then they seek out and join tribes through a desire to relate to and be assisted &amp; supported by others - all of which makes up ""the collective"".

The world we live in today requires that we put great emphasis on identifying with a particular *role* and then stick with it. Maybe to make it easier to identify and categorize us for the sake of control/manipulation and profit?

Personally, I find myself to be an incredibly versatile individual with potential to fulfil many different needs and roles. I see this is the foundation of what it means to be a human. So I don't like to be labelled as anything in particular. I don't even really like that I was given a name to be perfectly honest with you.
There is something vibratory about a name that influences ones identity. Consider how much different your life might be if you had a different name. Maybe a name that is one syllable shorter or longer. A name can be the difference between being bulled in school or not. So then it becomes the name that is being bullied, where the individual that has to wear the name becomes the scapegoat or martyr.

I would say that you were hypnotised (as most of us were) to systematically forfeit (y)our personal power to, as well as respond to external authorities without questioning them. 

I've always found it strange that so many people are willing to allow other human beings to make so many decisions for them (think police/government). One might argue that ""it's for the greater good"", or that individuals would become unruly without the influence of these establishments, but I don't see it that way.

I think that the most ""successful""/""wealthy"" people on this planet are the ones who are able to recognize just how easy it is to condition large groups of humans, whether intuitively or through outsourcing the research of how to do it effectively to ""marketing"" teams.

I think that religion is an extremely clever thing in that respect. I realised while working for an extremely large telecommunications company that the majority (almost *all*) of the front line representatives did *exactly* what they were told without questioning as long as the policy came from anybody so far up in the organization that you never saw their faces around the campus. I thought, ""if I were to start a company, I would *never* show my face"" and then referred to it as ""the God effect"".

In another thread somewhere here on Reddit, I talked about how televisions are in almost every home in the civilized world at this point. And, everything that is broadcast is carefully/mindfully scripted to illicit a very specific response from the collective. The result was that most people now pretty much all believe the same things, share the same goals, speak the same way, and all want &amp; buy the same stuff, yet all think they are unique, independent thinkers. It's like the majority of ""people"" are actually robots who are programmed by their televisions and the media.

Basically, we've (most of us) have all been *hypnotised* to believe that we are what we *think* we are. And we *think* we're those things because life has become a very *intellectualized* thing: mass marketing through advertisements/billboards, communication through text, and the like has taken the focus of our minds off of the *now* and our *immediate environments* and put it on the things that we *don't* have and the places we *aren't*.

We've stopped listening to our *guts* and our *instincts*, but instead have been conditioned to make decisions with our minds and have begun trying to bend the maya to fit with the images or ideals we hold there (in our minds eye). And because each of us has a slightly different variation of what we believe it should look like, ultimately we experience a great deal of bitterness, anger and frustration in our attempts to control it. This leads to things like greed, conflict with other competing ideals, insecurity and hoarding.

There really, truly is *enough* on this planet for everybody to thrive, if not live comfortably (assuming we reach an appropriate birth/death ratio). But because of all of this conditioning, things are way out of balance, and that won't change until we *wake up* to who/what we really are.

Beyond that, considering what you've described, as an *isolated* case of ""hypnosis"", I have no idea.

True,magnuss,,,"The adblock problem is a business model problem. Ideally, ads are offered by large companies because it is a huge benefit to them for very little cost. Companies have seen over time that the more they spend on advertising, the more successful they become. This works in small scale pizza shops and large scale mega-corporations like CocaCola. The internet is a fantastic place for them to offer their advertisements because there are a bunch of users, who sort themselves by demographic based on the sites they visit, and the cost of advertising there is exceptionally low compared to standard advertising.

The webhosts who create actual content that provide a service or a product to internet users benefit hugely from advertisements because it is a rather well accepted and easy way to get funding. You don't need to create a product that your users pay for, you just need to create a product that brings users and it ""pays for itself"" through advertisement.

What most internet content creators fail to realize is that they are leaving out the consideration of their user in favor of the advertiser. They are handicapping themselves by making advertisement the business model. If the ads don't do well (for whatever reason), then the business doesn't do well. Where does your customer come into play in all of this? Hoping that they passively accept advertisement and your business model is clearly not working. The users more often than not do not care about how successful or well funded your business is. There is nothing invested from the user's end. They are there to see the content that you produced and you charge them for it without asking their permission, assuming that the consumption of the content is a fair trade-off and justification.

How many advertisements do you see in a day? The ones you can think of off the top of your head are likely about 10% of the total you've actually seen. Of the advertisements you have seen today, how many of them did you ""like"" or ""appreciate"" for the service they provided you? I'd be surprised if anybody said more than 1, and even that would be an exception. Advertisements serve to distract and draw attention from the task that someone is attempting to accomplish. Even subtle ones are, almost by definition, annoying. 

So what is the solution to this problem? The solution that many are trying to appeal to is to make the users actually care about the website or content. I do not visit Destructoid for gaming news as I haven't seen anything from them that is particularly stand-out in my opinion. When I get linked to something on their site, I may read it and nod my head and then move on. They are not a community that I take part in. So why should I care if they are profitable over another website? If I browse the internet casually, why should I care, as a reasonable consumer of goods, if their business model isn't bringing in enough revenue?

Do I care if the local WalMart or Dominos gets shut down? Probably after it is gone I might, but I certainly don't care what their business model is up until that point. I have nothing invested in the products they provide which are easily supplemented elsewhere.

So the solution to this problem is the same as it is for small scale businesses. Get your customers to care about what YOU do for THEM. Words on a page can be written by anyone and even the exclusivity that Destructoid can get from its staff and journalistic access does not provide them with a significant benefit compared to their competition. Offering programs where you provide something extra to people who care about you have been seen to work because they make the monetary connection from your users to your business model.

I think all gaming and journalistic websites need to take some basic business plans into consideration and recognize that they need to create value for the consumer, not the advertiser. Otherwise the advertiser becomes your customer and the consumer of your content either accepts that or doesn't and will move on. It can make things very difficult for very small scale websites because they won't have the content to pull in large viewership to make subscription or bonus models work. Businesses are difficult! This is the way it should be. Advertisement to get start-up revenue may lead to enough success that you can improve your business model, but it cannot be a long term solution unless you're willing to accept the growing capacity to block advertisements.

TLDR: Make me, the reader, care about your content and I will be willing to pay for it.

Hello Mr. Gazarik,

Your recent article concerning drug overdose deaths has made its way to a very popular internet forum (www.reddit.com/r/trees) where marijuana smokers, legalization advocates, hobbyists etc. post marijuana related stories, pictures, articles, and legalization support opportunities. We were made aware of your article that claims your county has recorded eleven marijauna overdose deaths. I'll keep this short, this is simply not true. Studies, like one published in The Lancet in 1998 have reported that there has never been an overdose death officially attributed to marijuana. This is probably because, according to marijuana researcher Dr. Paul Hornsby, in order to ingest the amount of THC (delta 9 tetrahydrocannibinol, the chemical in marijuana that gets the user 'high') that would cause an overdose, one would have to smoke an amount comparable to 15,000 joints in around 20 minutes. It simply can't be done. 

Me, my fellow r/trees subscribers, and legalization advocates worldwide are working very hard to spread the truth about the abomination that is marijuana prohibition and we are trying to inform the general public of the many lies and common misconceptions about marijuana. When people publish falsities about marijuana into trusted sources like your newspaper it is very damaging to our cause. Your readers trust you as a credible journalist working for a known news outlet which leaves you with a lot of responsibility. 

Now i'm sure you didn't deliberately publish false facts, and to you this probably doesn't seem like a very big deal. I assure you that to many of us this is a big deal. We are very passionate about ending prohibition so we would very much appreciate a fact check when reporting statistics like you did in this recent article. Thank you very much Mr. Gazarik! Sorry I didn't keep it as short as I had intended.

True,twiggy_trippit,,,"I'm a man. I don't get catcalled by construction workers. I don't have to worry about walking alone at night. I am far less likely to be abused emotionally, physically, or sexually by my partner. No one is trying to legislate away control over what happens in my body. Most people in positions of power are men like me, although this is slowly changing.

No one is saying men cannot be victims of violence. I'm a sexual abuse survivor myself. Men's issues and men's rights are important to me, and I work with young men as a teacher and as a sex educator. There are many issues that are specific to men, and there *are* situations where men are treated unfairly, and these must be addressed.

But let's fucking face it: women as a whole have it much harder than men. Historically, it's only very recently that we've seen major headway in this regard in the so-called ""First World"", and we're barely recovering from centuries of male domination. If I had a daughter, I would not kid myself: I know she would be more vulnerable in society than if she was my son, not because of anything inherent about her gender, but because of our culture.

For all these reasons, this is why I will be one of those one million men to pledge an end to violence against women.

EDIT (19 hours after original posting): Wow, top comment in this huge thread! First of all, thanks to whoever gave me Reddit Gold. :) I will not reply to all the comments in this thread, as it would be quite redundant. For people who want statistics on violence against women, google it - I'm not being snarky, it's just that there is so much stuff out there about it that you will get a much more thorough picture than whatever I could post on it. Also, a big chunk of what follows is me nerding out on crime and gender (I happen to have a degree in Applied Criminology). Being aware, however, that a lot of people won't read the whole thing, here is something I want to say. 

This is not about the finer points of whom is the most like to be a victim what. Women's issues (especially violence) are real, and there are specific to women. They have a very specific dynamic that is rooted in misogynistic attitudes and gender dynamics in our culture. It is a violence that is different than most of the violence men face. Many people have said in this thread that we should fight all violence, and not just violence against women. Of course we should. Refusing to acknowledge, however, that there is something specific that is being done to women *because* they are women contributes to make the issues invisible, and helps the perpetrators of this violence. There is a similar truth to men's issues, as in they can be specific and need to be addressed as specific issues. 

But this campaign is about violence against women. It is an important campaign, that has a right to exist, and that does not diminish in any way efforts that can be made to also address men's issues. There are people out there who believe that gender politics are a zero sum equation. They believe that doing something to improve the wellbeing of women must necessarily take something away from men. This belief is ridiculous (unless you *want* men to hold power over women), and people who see feminism as a war against men are getting it all wrong. They are part of the problem, and not part of the solution. And quite frankly, if advocacy for women's rights makes you feel uncomfortable in your status as a man, maybe you need to reconsider the foundations of your identity as a man.

Now I'll indulge in some criminology nerdiness (the most important bits were above, feel free to stop reading unless you love geeking out about crime and society). About violence against men, here's what I know. Men ages 15-25 are the most likely to be victims of a crime (although I have recently seen something that said otherwise, so it's possible this is shifting); most of these are not random, late-at-night acts violence, however. They tend more to be assaults that happen as part of a verbal confrontations that degenerate (although the range of crimes to which men can be victims is broad), or targeted violence where there is nothing random about the choice of victim (""I hate your gut, thus I'll stab you""). Walking alone at night *is* much safer for men than it is for women, and as a response to statistics on this, many large cities have implemented measures to alleviate this (among other things, changes to how public transit works). 

Now here's the catch: young women are also very likely to be victims of crime (even worse for women who are not caucasian), but what's particular is that a huge chunk of those crimes are perpetrated by someone whose gender is different from them (unlike men who are mainly victims of other men). Also, a sizable portion of those crimes are perpetrated by men these women know and trust, or by a romantic partner. A lot of that violence is sexual in nature. There is also something about the psychological profile of those men that indicates that they are a lot more likely to hold misogynistic views, but that they also think the violence they perpetrate is something most other men also do (*although the vast majority of men do not victimize women*). Gender dynamics and how culture deals with gender are a significant factor in those crimes (although there are other aspects, like anger management and conflict resolution skills). This is why efforts to target potential perpetrators with all sorts of prevention campaigns tend to be effective in reducing those crimes (there was a very successful campaign like this in Vancouver in 2010 that is correlated with a decrease of 10% in sexual violence against women).

I thought I would add something that's also of relevance when it comes to men and sexual abuse. Sexual abuse in general is underreported (people tend to shut up about it), but it is far more underreported for men. It is also often not taken seriously, especially in the rarer instances where perpetrators are female. I think a stellar example of this happened when Jimmy Kimmel interviewed Lil' Wayne on ""losing his virginity"" at 11. The host jokes about it while Wayne is obviously uncomfortable as he describes how his older babysitter (who was 14 or 15) just yanked his pants down and proceeded to have sex with him, no permission asked or nothing. Wayne even says it clearly had a negative impact on him, but Kimmel keeps on joking about it (talk about being oblivious).

There are also issues of having double standards in terms of relationship violence when it comes to men being on the receiving end of it. There is higher social tolerance of men being insulted or hit by their partners (female or male), and it's extremely important to address this. Women, however, are a lot more likely to be injured, murdered, or sexually assaulted by their partners. I don't want to belittle to damages of emotional violence (it can be devastating), but there is a matter of scope that is simply not the same.

tl;dr: There are situations where men are more likely to be victims of a crime, and there are social taboos when it comes to men being victims of sexual abuse and relationship violence; these must be addressed. There is, however, something very specific about violence made against women that involves misogyny and gender dynamics, and the outcomes of that violence tend to be far more devastating. It is important to address the specificity of those issues, as it otherwise makes them invisible, and this is what the One Million Men campaign hopes to address.",0,1362859070,,0,1362932957,1,c8sp53u,t3_19yzib,t1_c8sp53u,t3_19yzib,,1431533960,483,False,news,t5_2qh3l,483

True,PicklesInParadise,ziggs,,"I disagree with some of the general attitudes expressed in the article. One author stated if it were up to him that he'd delete 95% of the content that gets submitted to /r/lol. He also expressed that there is a lack of Quality Discussion threads and too much fluff/pro player/Riot Plz.

His justification for this opinion is that a large portion of the /r/lol community is retarded and upvotes stupid content and stupid comments. Thus the opinion that moderation is necessary and a fully democratic subreddit of this size would be a trash dump.

My problem with all that is this:   
This person is saying that HIS opinion of ""good"" content is correct, and the stuff that the community upvotes is trash due to the Lowest Common Denominator aspect. I'm sorry, but that is a **piss poor and self-centered** attitude to have. Just because the latest ""Reginald Penta Kill Video"" has wide community appeal and gets upvoted to the front page and the latest ""In-depth Discussion of Champion X"" has more limited appeal and never makes it past page 2 or 3, DOESN'T mean the penta-kill video is garbage, circle-jerk, content.

The expressed opinion in the article that the content the community upvotes is trash and that the type of ""less fluffy"" content these individuals enjoy should receive artificially increased visibility through more moderation of said fluff - **I find highly egocentric**.

Personally, I LIKE seeing the pro player house tours and it pisses me off when the mods start trying to censor that type of content.

The real problem, and why I'm a proponent of a tagging system, is the lack of a good way for people to find the content that appeals to them. If ""original content"" creators only submit to a smaller subreddit like /r/summoners, then they potentially miss out on a lot of LoL players who would like their article, but don't frequent there. So they are left with the choice to only submit to /r/summoners and have a small readerbase, or dual submit to both /r/summoners and /r/lol to try and reach as many people as possible. 

**It's not a problem of content type X is better than content type Y**, it's a problem of content type X has a much greater appeal base, so content type Y gets lost in the noise and people that might otherwise enjoy Content Y just never even see it.

I agree that good content getting ""lost in the noise"" is a problem on Reddit. I'm just saying that the way to fix it isn't censorship. Maybe Reddit needs to change their algorithm that determines what gets to the front page, or maybe Reddit needs to make it easier for community mods to highlight quality content that might otherwise get lost.

.   
.   

**TL:DR** - Some of the authors have bad self-centered attitudes.

True,[deleted],,,"Because people would rather protect their beliefs from criticism  than address the problems that exist within them. This is why we're looking at a picture of four people ""tolerating"" each other, rather than four people sitting at a table having a frank discussion about their beliefs in the hopes of finding and correcting any flaws that may exist. The latter would put religious beliefs at risk, and that can't be.

With tolerance, problematic views are ignored so long as they don't cause a fuss, but they don't actually go away. The end result is that you get an environment that's a bit like a game of whack a mole: whenever an issue becomes so big that people can't ignore it, they get into a frenzy and try to snuff it out, but no one is willing to open up the machine and get rid of the moles themselves, so they're just endlessly milling about waiting to pop up again.

You have billions of people who are taught that faith is valuable and a good reason to believe something, and then when they happen to believe something dangerous, they're smacked with a mallet. But is the basic belief in faith questioned? No, chances are the people wielding the mallet are armed with faith themselves. They continue to spread it, and since it supports all things equally, it will continue to support whatever they disagree with. After all, if one person has faith that a god is anti gay marriage and the other has faith that it's pro, how would one go about demonstrating the correctness of their position? Faith supports what the oppose just as well. 

You have people spreading the idea that there are magic spirits who can heal us, as well as figures like Jesus who roamed the Earth exorcising demons, and then they get shocked when there's a faith healing death or people being accused of witchcraft/being possessed. You have over a billion people believing that the majority of the human population will be entering an eternal torture camp or some other form of punishment for not being part of their group, and yet they are surprised when these kind of beliefs contribute to violence. 

It's all really silly.  People want change, but they don't want *to* change, and after spinning in a few circles, they end up settling on telling the people who say they should change to knock it off. And when you tell some other Christians to be pro gay marriage, they want *you*  to knock it off. Clearly things would be much better if no one made a fuss about what they did or why.

Plus, I really think all of this theorizing often makes the same flaw of taking our current world, changing only one detail (making immortality possible and universally available) and then extrapolating. You can assume with pretty good certainty that that is not what is going to happen.

Firstly, seems to me that the computer power and the software necessary to model human brains will mature before true biological immortality is possible. At the very least, the two will progress in parallel. 

As a result, you'll never really have a human as we know them now, but immortal. I don't think that will ever happen outside of a few special, deliberate experiments. Instead you'll end up with some technological/biological hybrid that has part of it's consciousness within a computer network, and part of it in an augmented body that can be repaired/replaced as needed.

And the consequences of people being able to endlessly duplicate/modify/augment their own bodies with hardware/biology, while doing the same to their minds using software will have a way more gigantic impact on humanity than the fact that people stop dying.

If your mind exists within a computer and can be endlessly duplicated/merged with others, how do you even define what death would be in that kind of a scenario? Individuality will kind of cease to be a real thing at that point anyways. 

It very quickly gets to the point where it's kind of impossible to speculate about how humanity would evolve. Which is the very definition of a singularity.

Transsexual women on HRT for more than 2 years have the same levels of testosterone that cis women do. These trans women also often have lower levels of total and calculated free testosterone (both &lt; 0.001) than ovulating women, the peak of the hormone cycle.

The IOC which is the deciding body for the Olympics tested trans women and their body mass/muscle mass extensively before making the decision to accept them as physically women. Muscle mass decreases on HRT, bones become less dense, skin thins and softens. 


The governing body of MMA, as well as medical boards of the LPGA, The IOC (Olympics), MMA, WNBA, the NCAA, and actual doctors everywhere say the same thing. Hormone therapy for any significant length of time, especially coupled with gonadectomy eliminate any natural ""male"" muscle mass and any advantage it may provide. All allow trans women to compete as women.


Most of the organizations that allow trans women to compete as women test many things (including testosterone, both free and bound) and have stringent requirements regarding length of time on HRT and a gonadectomy.


There is no bone shape, bone density, height, weight, or center of balance that a man could have that a woman couldn't also have. There are 3.6 billion ways to be a woman on this planet, there is ample room for significant variation.


Fallon Fox is 5' 7"", hardly huge and in fact only three inches over the ""average"" height for women in the US. Here she is with her last opponent who is visibly larger than her  http://imgur.com/a/54TIc

If she were huge it wouldn't matter, as the IOC has already allowed a man named Antonio Silva to fight, who has the condition of Acromegaly (a form of gigantism) Shown here with a much smaller opponent http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ZX8tq6Zhd4c/TVaunsGsI4I/AAAAAAAAA6A/t6xygV1Q68U/s1600/002_Fedor_Emelianenko_and_Antonio_Silva.jpg .


The arguments of muscle mass, bone density, and overall strength already fall under the ""handled by hrt"" category, feel free to go read the science on that one. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone_replacement_therapy_(male-to-female) 

There are a number of conditions that would induce high ranges of testosterone (free and bound), these women are not barred from women's sports. -footnote-These women often take the same testosterone suppressing medication (anti-androgens) that are taken by trans women.


A thought exercise, if you believe Fallon Fox should only compete with males, would you find it appropriate for a Trans man fighter on HRT as being able to only fight women? If not, Why?


If you believe this is a matter of ""genetics"" please understand that
XX and XY otherwise known as the ""sex chromosomes"" aren't even where the genetic information dictating physical sex are primarily expressed.


Conditions exist in which people with XX chromosomes naturally develop physiologically male bodies and vice versa (XY develop female bodies). There is even a case of an XY mother giving birth to an XY daughter.


For the ""genitally focused"" group (penis=man, vagina=woman), we are all phenomenologically female (some would say neuter but without the male hormones the female structure presents) to start with until testosterone is introduced during fetal development

http://www.smithsonianmag.com/multimedia/videos/We-Were-All-Female-Once.html

I'm not a molecular biologist or a doctor but from what I understand we share the same genital structure in both fetal males and fetal females until the SRY on the Y chromasome causes the creation of enzymes called transcription factors, which promote the expression of various other genes that lead to a masculinized phenotype. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRY *No enzymes introduced due to not possessing SRY or other reasons, and the female phenotype develops* , so I think it's fair to describe it as the default setting. 

In the end a clit is a just little penis, and a penis is really just a big clit. Besides hormones and the effect they have on different stages of development, there is very little physiological difference between men and women. All the pieces are the same, just adapted by hormones here and there.

If one would argue that transsexuality is simply a psychological condition, please watch this Stanford lecture from an accomplished nuerobiologist

http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=A3C4ZJ7HyuE 



Besides all of this being factual and not what a few internet people think, but what actual medical science (and law!) thinks (please someone invite R/skeptic), this is all important to consider just on the effect that widespread anti trans sentiment and transphobia has in the world today



- 49 per cent of transgender people attempt suicide (mostly due to the unavailability of transitional treatment, or being exiled from their family and social framework because of rampant anti trans sentiment)
- Transgender youth account for 18 per cent of homeless people in cities such as Chicago, but researchers estimate fewer than 1 in 1,000 people is transgender.
- 265 trans people have been murdered worldwide in the last 12 months.
- In the US Transgender women made up 40% of the 30 reported hate murders in 2011, while representing only 10% of total violence survivors and victims. This was comparable to last year’s report where transgender women made up 44% of the 27 reported hate murders, reflecting a two-year trend toward disproportional and severe violence faced by transgender women.
- Transgender youth whose parents pressure them to conform to their anatomical gender report higher levels of depression, illegal drug use, suicide attempts and unsafe sex than peers who receive little or no pressure from parents.


And for all those who think people go around regretting transitioning and shouldn't be able to decide their own gender- Less than 1 to 1.5 per cent of individuals experience persistent regret after sex-reassignment surgery.

Besides ""It just feels wrong"", an argument with which I have no traction and am unlikely to gain any on, I can't imagine what else people think could possibly bar this awesome fighter from continuing to do what she loves.

I know that ""she used to be a MAN"" seems to be enough for some people, short sighted as that is. Once upon a time, she used to be a baby, something that I'm fairly sure is barred from competing in most major sports at the professional level. I'm expecting a bit of backlash on this post, but what can I say, I get it. Haters gonna hate.

True,alexistheman,europe,Commonwealth History and Peerage Law,"**The Man Who Ordered a Sword**

If you’ve never heard of the Lippe Succession Crisis, you aren’t alone: it’s a relatively unimportant affair that people would openly scoff at if it were to take place today. Even in the late 19th century, Lippe was, quite frankly, a rural backwater and little more than a private hunting ground for the Prince of Lippe, who also held the title of Count of Lippe-Detmold. However, the Lippe Succession Crisis soon became a cause célèbre due to the personal intervention of Wilhelm II.

In 1895, Prince Waldemar of Lippe died with no issue. His sole heir was his brother, Prince Alexander, who had been declared mentally ill in 1870. In theory, the crown was supposed to descend to Alexander’s closest living male relative but the Lippe Diet demurred from this course of action and proclaimed Prince Adolf zu Schaumburg-Lippe as regent instead.

There is no one reason as to why the Lippe Diet broke the chain of succession. Both primary and secondary sources offer a slew of reasons, but virtually every source agrees that Berlin influenced the outcome of their decision. Adolf was the third son of the Prince of Schaumberg-Lippe and, as such, had a distant but valid claim to Lippe’s throne. He was also married to Princess Victoria of Prussia, the sister of Wilhelm II. As the senior heir, Biesterfeld was furious. He brought his case to court, leading the Lippe Diet to request arbitration in Berlin. In 1897, an impartial panel composed of the King of Saxony and six other jurors met to discuss the issue.

The King’s panel recognized that the Count zur Lippe-Biesterfeld was the closest living male agnate. Prince Adolf’s lawyers argued that Biesterfeld descended from an unequal marriage, thereby invalidating his entire line’s claim to succession. Moreover, Adolf argued that a marriage with a woman of the lower nobility was illegal for a member of an altgräflich family. The King of Saxony ruled against both claims, the details of which you can read more about here. Ernest zur Lippe-Biesterfeld was formally declared Regent of Lippe and next in the line of succession after the impending death of the insane Prince Alexander of Lippe. In 1897, the case became public knowledge after Wilhelm II refused Biesterfeld the privilege of being called “erlaucht” or “His Illustrious Highness.” The other crowned heads of Germany were outraged by Wilhelm II’s machinations. The matter of succession would continue in and out of court until 1905, when the Imperial Chancellor ruled in favor of Biesterfeld. You can read more about this [here](http://www.heraldica.org/topics/royalty/HGLippe.htm#1905_verdict).

The presenter of your sword was therefore this man: Count Ernest zur Lippe-Biesterfeld and his wife, Countess Karoline zur Lippe-Biesterfeld (nee von Wartensleben). The “F.F.E.F” inscription is probably a plural form of [“Their Most Excellent and Illustrious Highnesses,”](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illustrious_Highness) although I can’t be sure. In 1889, the Count Ernest zur Lippe-Biesterfeld was living at Schloss Neudorf with his large, extended family. Like many German royal families, the Lippes collectively owned considerably more land than the portion under their direct sovereign control. Schloss Neudorf was [Biesterfeld’s seat](http://books.google.com/books?id=BgIWAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA37&amp;dq=%22Schloss+Neudorf%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=NzU7UbSDJsuq0AHcr4AQ&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwADgU#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Schloss%20Neudorf%22&amp;f=false) and his father, Julius, probably acquired it around approximately 1850 from [Edward von Pourtalès](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schloss_Neudorf). von Pourtalès had badly managed Schloss Neudorf, but both father and son were apparently successful in converting the decaying gentleman’s seat into something more lucrative. In 1897, [Biesterfeld signed his declaration of intent to claim the regency at his home at Schloss Neudorf](http://books.google.com/books?id=z4s1AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA188&amp;dq=%22Schloss+Neudorf%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Pjs7UaLvMcny0wGKg4GYBw&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwADgo#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Schloss%20Neudorf%22&amp;f=false) and the house was of some importance to him.

**The Owner of the Sword**

Karl Lietsch, the owner of the sword, is a relatively enigmatic figure. The earliest source I can find for Lietsch describes him as living in [Westphalia and married to Eleonore von Pressentin](http://books.google.com/books?id=xV87AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA148&amp;dq=%22Karl+Lietsch%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dZw6UbOCNZO40QHS-ICACg&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=karl%20lietsch&amp;f=false). At the time, he was a reserve officer in the army and claimed descent from the [Großbürgers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Burgher), a class of patrician (but non-noble) stock in the republican trading cities. His occupation was listed as “court assessor,” although it’s unclear whether or not he ever worked for Biesterfeld’s by the time this article was published.

According to the source above, Lietsch's wife was one Eleonore von Pressentin. The von Pressentins were an obscure Prussian family that belonged to the untitled low-nobility. Neither distinguished or undistinguished, the von Pressentins were merely one of Prussia's numerous *junker* families that inhabited Germany's countryside. At some point in the 1880s, she was the governess of Lippe-Biesterfeld's daughter Adelheid, who was later married to Prince Frederich, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen.

von Pressentin's entry gives us the most information about Karl Leitsch. He was a Lieutenant in the German Army reserves, and he was most likely a [Großbürger](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Burgher) whose family hailed from Rostock, a Hanseaten city. In Rostock, the Leitschs were the *Rentmeisters,* or tax assessors, of the town and must have accrued some prominence by virtue of their position. By 1890, Leitsch was working as a Comptroller to the Household of some royal house but, unfortunately, the article says nothing about his employers.

In 1925, [we have him listed](http://adressbuecher.genealogy.net/entry/show/209597) as living at [Burgstraße 7, Burgsteinfurt](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Burgstra%C3%9Fe+7,+Burgsteinfurt&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS526US526&amp;aq=f&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wl) in Westphalia. His occupation is listed as “kammerdirektor” or Lord Chamberlain. Finally, a more modern article sheds some light on his career, this time from the [Westphalia Heritage Association](http://www.lwl.org/westfaelischer-heimatbund/pdf/wanderung.pdf). By 1899, Lietsch was working as the Lord Chamberlain for [Prince Victor Adolf of Bentheim and Steinfurt](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Adolf_zu_Bentheim-Steinfurt), a mediatized princely family of considerable means. In the 1930s, Prince Victor Adolf had Leitsch's name inscribed on a prominent boulder in memoriam to his work. Leitsch was a faithful employee, and was widely admired for his ability to manage the estate in a variety of difficult conditions. He retired in 1931. After this, I can’t find anything more concrete about Lietsch.

What I’m about to say is entirely speculative: I believe Lietsch was probably an official of some standing in the royal household of either the Count zur Lippe-Biesterfeld or the Prince zu Bentheim und Steinfurt when he was given this sword. At some point, he was engaged or married to Eleonore von Pressentin, the governess of the Biesterfeld’s children. He worked as the Comptroller of the Household until 1899, when he was definitively in the employ of the Prince zu Bentheim und Steinfurt as the Lord Chamberlain. This sword may have been a wedding gift from the Biesterfeld’s to the Lietschs; a dowry if you will on the occasion of their wedding. Both Lietsch and von Pressentin were of reasonably good stock – not royal, but certainly not peasants either. This wedding gift would make sense given the context of the time.

The exact reasons behind the gift are probably lost to the sands of time. Given my current resources, it’s impossible to determine anything more beyond the identity of the presenter and the owner. The sword is therefore a secret in between Karl Lietsch and the Count zur Lippe-Biesterfeld. Perhaps it should remain so.

My platoon was in a heavy fire fight one day when we were pinned down near a market-residential area. A small child can running from behind us with an AK-47. Instead of firing on him, I got up and ran to him and as I approached the child that could barely lift the weapon I snatched it from his hands and grabbed him in the other arm slinging my carbine over my shoulder. I ran him into the nearest house where with what little Arabic I was taught I said to the woman in the house "" him safe"" and as I walked out a man comes running towards me with his arms waving yelling and pointing. I raised my weapon to him and he ran to me trying to hug me or something. As I pushed him off and ran back to my position he ran into the house. After the firefight at our base a few days later I heard over the radio there was a father and son that were telling the interpreters that an American soldier had saved their lives. I walked to the gate to see the same boy and man.  The father recognized me and forced his way to hug me and he embraced me. The whole time the translator kept telling me he was repeating thank you and Allah bless me. He stated that his 8 year old boy had given into neighborhood clans that wanted to fight Americans and saw what I had done during the battle. 17 years later after combat I received a letter from a now american citizen who had moved his family to Houston Texas and was driving a cab. He had memorized my name tag on my uniform and had used the Internet to track me down to catch me up on his son graduating from medical school. We talk occasionally on the phone and he still cannot thank me enough what happened that day on September 21st, 1993.

When you only have a small number of nuclear weapons, you have to pick your targets based on your aims. If it's terrorism and just being a dick, sure, go for cities and civillian targets. But if you actually want to win a war, and get some actual use out of those damn expensive systems you keep bragging about, you need to draw up a target list based on what makes the most important setback to the enemy and make sure you're not wasting them on stuff that you could have just knocked out with artillery or chemical weapons.

The target list for the North Koreans involves taking out the South Korean military and it's US support on the peninsula, then taking out nearby US naval forces, then probably a warning shot against Japan, most likely killing two birds with one stone by attacking okinawa and the US forces based there, then probably an attack on Diego Garcia and any other major US bases in the immediate area to make counter attack harder. Depending on how ballsy the Nooks are feeling, they'd also probably be trying to destroy US nuclear launch silos, but may not be as they realise such a task is impossoble. After all of that comes US bases further away and on the US mainland, then after all the military targets comes US government and administrative facilities and high importance military industry, then general defence contractor targets. Your friends and family are pretty safe. 

If they hit the US mainland, they'd hit naval bases on the western seaboard after pearl harbour, and also airbases; anywhere drones are operated from and long rang strategic bombers are stored. Then sea ports in general and possibly major army personnel bases, as that would slow down the US response, but this would also increase the chance of the US retaliating with extensive nuclear weaponry so they might not risk it. Much better to try to drag the US in to a long drawn out ground and insurgency war on the peninsula if they try to retake it. I'd expect chemical or biological agents to be used against personnel targets, as they're much worse than fatalities. 

Not that it matters. You'd need hundreds if not thousands of accurate weapons systems to break America's military in an effective first strike. Russia could do it (or could have done twenty years ago) and China might be able to, but beyond that... 

The UK sure as hell couldn't do it, even teaming up with France. NK is wasting it's weapons attacking the US mainland. It's only real strategic hope is to wipe out military infrastructure in South Korea, rapidly dominate the peninsula, disseminate and entrench its forces in population centres and then fend off US and Japanese naval forces in the short term, making it too costly to retake the peninsula. 

The US would probably strike pyonyang and military/government targets in NK with nuclear weapons if nukes were extensively used on US military personnel, but there's actually a high likelihood that the US would voluntarily abstain from using them in retaliation for the following reasons:

* North Korea is a spent load. There's no need to prove anything to them now, you can't stop what's already happened

* The US doesn't need nukes to destroy NK's military. It has more than enough conventional capability, some of which, oddly enough, might be better suited to penetration of deeply protected targets

* China will go ape shit at nuclear weapons being used on their doorstep, particularly as during their flight path they'll look a fuck load like they're aimed at china

* Nuclear weapons produce heavy civillian casualties. They're not discriminatory weapons. If NK uses nukes and the US holds back, it's pretty clear who the bad guy is. If both sides use them, and America does it 'better', well... That's really not what the west needs for international PR

* It sets a precedent that nuclear weapons can be used into actual conflict, and aren't just cold war relics for the threat of total annihilation. It would totally and permanently change the world's view of modern warfare back to the huge escalation scares of the cold war years.

True,Perhaps_Perhaps,,,"There's a little known history about the Ken John family that I felt like revealing to the world tonight.

You see, Ken John Dunn's father, Ken John Gil, was a nasty and crazy son of a bitch.   He was born in Fargo, and wanted to grow up to be the greatest ice fisher of them all.  He hated Star Wars because he thought Carrie Fisher was an ice fisher and he thought she had fishing in her genes/last name.  So when he's about 14 he steal a car and goes on this road trip to find the perfect pond to fish in.  On the way, he gets lost and sees these billboards to see the White Butte.  Having driven for hours on end, he pulls over and jerks off to the idea of a White Butte.  After his post-fap nap, he realizes that was the best sleep he ever had, fuck fishing, I need to go find this girl with big White Butte.  When he got there, he was disappointed to see it was not a women.  But he met this drifter that was camping out there and trying to write a novel, and the drifter told him that there IS a women with a white butt that you can see, you just gotta pay $20 bucks and cover your eyes so that you can only see the women's butt.  Gil paid the $20 and covered an his eyes while the male drifter pulled down his pants and mooned him. Gil closed his eyes again until the drifter pulled up his pants, and the drifter said that the women disappeared, to South Dakota, where she was married to this dude that was good at golf.  Gil flipped the fuck out and was like, ""fuck you drifter man!""  

So then Gil ran for governor and won at the age of 19.  He ran on an anti-South Dakota campaign, proclaiming that they better return the women with the White Butte.  South Dakota replied that North Dakota had the White Butte.  But Gil said that he knew from a source that some golfer was fucking the white butte.  A reported asked if it was the Byrum brothers, Tom and Curt?  

Gill flipped the fuck out.  His schizophrenic mind jumped to the conclusion that she was in a constant finger cuff with the Byrum brothers.  He passed laws creating a demilitarized zone between North and South, and didn't allow tourists.  His distracted mind (always finger cuffs) prevented him from dressing properly or with a modern hair style, and as North Dakota went to shit, he wondered how could the Byrums be so good at golf when they are always fucking?  Then he realized they must be scientists too, and found some loophole in the time space continuum.  Gil figured the only way to top them was to build nukes.  So he did. 

Meanwhile, I know you're wondering why wouldn't the federal government step in?  Well, look at fucking Mississippi, past and present.  

But THEN!  Gil runs into that drifter again and the drifter says that the girl with the white butte has children now, has matured and just wants to apologize for all the confusion.  It was funny at first but it's gotten a little out of hand with the nukes.  Drifters are hippies that don't like nukes and microwaves.  

Gil didn't hear anything besides has children.  So then Gil impregnates a gummy bear miraculously and Ken John Dunn is born.  But how did that miracle happen?  How!  Well, Gil was a professional fapper that grew tired of clean up.  So he just came all over the floor (to the idea of the White Butte of course), onto gummy bears.  Meanwhile, a freshmen Fighting Sioux that was fucking nuts stuck that gummy bear up her uterus.  

Gil could never explain to Dunn how he was born.  He tried to.  He told him that his mother was a gummy bear.  But Dunn was so fucking stupid and the Dakotan word for bear and worm are very similar, that he thought he said your mother is a gummy worm.

True,[deleted],,,"Personally, I think that guy is a condescending douchebag.  He nailed nothing other than to reinforce the exact reason why Anita Sarkeesian needs to be making her Tropes vs. Women series; misogyny is rampant throughout the gaming culture, and it creates a hostile environment for both men and women.  

In the same way that the video's creator argues that, ""each and every single video in the [Tropes vs. Women] series can be rounded down to a fine point of, 'We want this to appeal to a 15-25 year-old male demographic who are the core demographic of video games,'"" this 8:10 video can be rounded down to a fine point of, ""The author's a priori dismissal of Anita Sarkeesian's work and any potential argument about misogyny in video games is a glaringly ironic example of the very misogyny in video game culture that Anita Sarkeesian purports to explore in Tropes vs. Women.""

Seriously.  

In case you didn't know, [women make up roughly half of all gamers](http://www.theesa.com/facts/pdfs/ESA_EF_2012.pdf), and that percentage is on the rise.  It's quite likely that women will overtake men as the majority of gamers during this very year.  And yet, women are still terribly represented in video games.  

The creator of the video you linked asserts that ""people already understand this issue,"" but asserts that the problem isn't the way men think about women and how they reinforce a very narrow, stereotypical and shallow idea of women within the gaming culture, but that the problem is how women want to be portrayed in games.  

Really, Parsignia?  You're going to buy into that?  Is that really the problem?  

The creator of the video's advice is simply to not do anything because the Tropes vs. Women series isn't going to do anything.  [Not exactly good advice.](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/The_Simpsons/Season_3#Homer_at_the_Bat)  

The fact of the matter is that just by creating her kickstarter, Anita Sarkeesian has changed things.  She's shined a spotlight on the terrible, awful bias within gaming.  Simply by raising a few thousand dollars on a crowdfunding website for a web series she was probably going to produce anyway, she has evoked an incredibly misguided rage among thousands of people like yourself.  She's shown that just by being a woman interested in woman's issues in relation to video games, people want to threaten to rape and kill her.  And she's gotten global coverage of her plight and the disgusting response it elicited.

Seeing him walking into the kitchen with a diamond ring, I had another bad idea and followed behind him.  When he got down on one knee, I pulled my balls out and flopped them on top of his head.

Im a good guy that gets along with everyone,  So seeing I could handle the camera on rehersal and test days,  they would put me behind the camera on the real shoot days.  Initially if a cameraman needed a bathroom break,  but then when they had an extra camera for a special shot,  and they would just tell me to stay on it the whole show, and end up cutting me in once in awhile.

The company did it on the fly like this and its actually a lot of fun.  It also gets taped,  but they try and rough it in like this so the edit is almost there and real quick.  It might seem stressful, but once you understand whats going on,  it comes off really organized.  You really just listen for your camera number, and be ready when they tell you.  Or they might suggest a shot to you that they want you to get.

The fun part is when you find a cool shot while they are watching the other cameras and someone else is live,  and they will tell you to go back and grab that again, and they will go to you on the fly.   In the video you can hear that they know the crews names and everyone is very comfortable with each other.  So its kind of nice when you grab such a good shot they actually take a second to compliment you on the radio with everyone else. It sounds crazy, but everyone i worked with on these kinds of shows was really low key and very kind people.  (different then some of the movies and TV shows i work on now)

* it failed the temp check (meh)
* have 47 or so bad sectors (pay attention, if it starts growing you have a problem but otherwise, meh) . 

SMART fail is not an automatic dying drive indicator.

Download Hiren's Boot disc (google for a torrent) or if you don't want any of the other stuff on there you can just down load the bootable MHDD ISO.

* http://hddguru.com/software/2005.10.02-MHDD/

This is seriously the best program for hard drive diagnostics because: 1) it skips BIOS and reads the drive directly 2) it gives you the a real indicator of failure - bad blocks or failing blocks that exist on the drive or are appearing on the drive as it is being tested.

The last part of #2 is why it is recommended to always do a back first if you suspect your drive is crapping out.  Doing a test could cause more problems and data corruption and you are SOL.

Ok, so download MHDD and burn the ISO to a CD.  Change BIOS to be in 'compatibility more' instead of AHCI for your SATA.  If you are confused about this I can explain more.  Boot into the disc and run a scan.  If you are getting a large amount of sectors over 300ms that is bad.  If there a growing number of bad blocks that is really bad.  If it crashes in the middle of a scan, also bad.  ~Replace the drive.

True,[deleted],,,"Edit: Thank's for the gold =)! I really hope that this inspired someone to pick up exercising, it does more wonders for you than you could ever imagine before actually embrace a routine and stick with it. Guaranteed results for everybody, that's the beauty of physical work-outs!

If you're looking for motivation, /r/progresspics 

And yes it does work, as a guy who recently began exercising again after years of putting it off and making up excuses, it has radically transformed my psyché as well as my physiology for the better over the last couple months. The first few times I started working out (I started just after my birthday), it was literally hell, I hated it with every ounce of my out-of-shape-body. The thing is, my entire attitude has changed completely now, two and a half months later. First of all when I do work out it's not a negative feeling anymore, I can genuinly say that I enjoy breaking a sweat now. Secondly, instead of being an activity that I would dread days in advance, I genuinly look forward to my next session, because it is such a great stress-relief in that it forces your brain to excrete tons of great chemicals to you. I have thusly begun associating work-outs with amazingly vivid and powerfully positive emotions (such as the feeling when you've advanced one step on the ladder of fitness, be it the ability to run faster/longer or the ability to lift heavier or to do 10 push-ups), instead of associating it with the torture that it more resembles during your first month of working out.

All of the feel-good-shit aside, it has also helped me in a number of different physiological ways. I sleep *a lot* better and more regularly, I actually have an appetite during the morning, my desire for sweets/salts have dropped way down (surprisingly, I actually crave *less* unhealthy foods now); all of this combined has lead to so many expected and unexpected positives. For example, my skin looks way better (less break-outs etc.), I am able to be more happy (not going to say that I'm magically super-happy, but my emotions aren't as dulled and I have a generally positive outlook as compared to before), my immune-system is *so improved*, I used to get infections constantly in the throat/sinuses/eyes/whatever, and I haven't had one for a quarter of a year now. Although, it may be so that the lack of infections/disease is more due to my superior diet, as I began focusing on getting enough vitamins/minerals through my diet during the same time that I began exercising. One thing that definitly contributed was my decision to quit sweetened drinks alltogether, it was boring to begin with but I've learned to love water/tea/milk/coffee a lot more now.

TL;DR, I would strongly recommend that you begin doing some form of exercise, at least 2 times a week to begin with and preferably 3-4 times a week when your body is ready for that kind of physical stress. It has so many advantages that you wouldn't even have thought of beforehand as well as all of the obvious benefits such as trimming your appearance etc. Stop making excuses, literally nobody on this earth has such a stressful schedule that they cannot allocate 20-40 minutes on any given day to run/lift weights/swim/bike/whatever, the only thing that's hindering you is your brains ability to make excuses and you know it.",0,1362927407,,0,1362948710,1,c8t2mif,t3_1a0q0p,t1_c8t2mif,t1_c8t28mz,,1431540465,3,False,AdviceAnimals,t5_2s7tt,3

Absolute certainty is a red herring, and is not the same as knowledge.

Taking it to another topic, do you believe in Vampires? For the sake of simplicity, I'm talking actual vampires, dark magic, demons, creatures of the night, can turn into bats, etc. Not some sort of bullshit ""Well, I suppose if someone had a blood disease that made them photosensitive""...

Cutting out and assuming your side of the conversation, I'm going to say that you don't.

You don't believe in vampires. The idea is silly. You know they're just stories, old myths that were nonsense people used to believe in. There's no such thing as vampires. Of course you know that. I mean, even aside from the lack of evidence for vampires, the entire mechanism of ""vampireness"" is utterly unreasonable, and irrational. It's counter to everything we know about the world around us. People can't turn into bats, their mass would have to go somewhere. All things have a reflection, the lack of one is nonsensical, it couldn't be visible otherwise. You know all this. It's known. You know it. You get where I'm going with this?

You don't have to sit there and say ""Well, I can't possibly know for sure that there's no such thing as vampires, and therefore I remain agnostic to their possible existence.""

You don't have to say ""Well, the existence of the Easter Bunny is impossible to prove or disprove, so in the absence of certain evidence, I remain an agnostic abunnyist.""

The mental pretzel people have to make to twist themselves into claiming not to have knowledge that nonsense is not true irritates me.

**KNOWLEDGE IS NOT CERTAINTY**

These words are not synonyms. I have a knowledge that I have to go to work in the morning. I have knowledge of where I work. I have a knowledge that my socks are in the dryer and will be done before the morning.

None of this is certain. An asteroid could kill me in my sleep. Or destroy my work. I might be stabbed by a burglar, and be in the hospital. Or my socks might not be dry.

We live 99.99999999999999% of our lives and thoughts without this suggestion that to know something we must be 100% certain about it. Nothing is certain. Ever. So why do we suddenly feel this need to apply certainty to the God question? Why do we suddenly decide that while saying ""I know there's no such thing as the Easter Bunny"" is utterly reasonable, saying ""I know there's no such thing as God"" makes you, in your words ""on the same logical level as a theist"", like it's some unsupportable absurdity.

True,ZaeronS,,,"OK, since this ELI5 is about tipping, it's going to go to shit really quickly. Lets start with the obvious:

&gt;I ask because we went out to eat last night, and the service was horrible. It took over 30 minutes to get our food (even though the place was dead), the order was wrong, and our server left in the middle of our service. Maybe her shift was over, but I'm not sure. We had to ask the manager for our ticket, and when we were asked how the experience was, we, well, told them it was kinda shitty, and explained why. The manager listened, then when we were leaving, she asked us if we were going to leave our tip on the table or if we wanted to add it to the bill at the register.

This is a great situation in which tipping isn't expected. You were exposed to extremely unprofessional service, and more importantly, the manager was extremely unprofessional. The first rule of tipping from the restaurant's perspective is that you don't talk about tipping. This is the golden rule. Exceptions are made only for talking about mandatory gratuities and things like that - under no circumstances should a manager ever, ever be telling you 'what you should tip'. Certainly not after a meal that they fucked up.

Second, tipping is a social custom which gives diners the option to reward good behavior and punish bad behavior. The system works relatively well when non-assholes are on both sides. Sometimes the system doesn't work so well, because you're an asshole, or your server is an asshole. It happens.

Third, tipping is a way of allocating the cost of service *for the restaurant*. Example - on a monday afternoon, Bob's Burgers does $500 in sales. On a saturday evening, they do $2,500. However, it's very likely that on monday, $400 out of that $500 in sales all happens right at once (right around 630pm) - so Bob still needs to hire 5 waiters. Since Saturday's sales are more spread out,Bob only needs 7 waiters for the whole shift (he doesn't need 5 times as many waiters even though he's getting 5 times more sales).

Tipping naturally allocates a percentage of *sales* to the waiters, as a kind of commission. If Bob switched to 'paying his employees himself', Bob would probably have to go up to ten or twelve dollars an hour (the average a server actually makes at a place like, say, Chili's). Suddenly, Bob's labor costs on those shitty Monday afternoons go sky high, so Bob has to use only 2 waiters - but since Monday shifts don't have evenly distributed patronage, the quality of service goes downhill for everybody who shows up at 630.

Are there other ways that this system could be structured? Absolutely. Would it be easy for any individual restaurant to use any of those other systems? Absolutely not. Good waiters keep waiting tables because they make *a lot* of money waiting tables. Average waiters do it because it's an unskilled job that can compete with the kind of wages you'd get from factory work. Waiters like the system. Employers like the system. Customers may not understand the system, but the reality is that they're not paying more than they 'should' for food, and in fact have the option to pay less.

The problem is simple: Since waiters are people, and people have internet access, sometimes waiters come and post about their shitty night where some assholes came to Bob's, messed up the joint, vomited in the bathroom, and left two bucks on a hundred dollar tab. And then everyone else gets butthurt and throws a shitfit and says 'but tipping is stupid!'

Which, sure, whatever. That's fine. Lots of things are stupid, but in a polite society if you don't understand a social custom, you still follow it. This is the core of the issue - service at a sit down restaurant is an implied social contract  between you and the waiter. You're paying him to serve you, and not be a shitbag while he does it. If he fails to serve you, or fails to not be a shitbag, then don't pay him. If your food shows up on time and nothing gets fucked up and he manages to not be an asshole for the entire meal, pay the dude for doing the job you asked him to do.

True,GeeJo,,,"A corollary to this is to make the challenges female characters face *human* challenges and not just *vagina-based* challenges. In TV particularly, there's a marked tendency of lazy writers falling back (sooner or later) on the pregnancy/rape schtick. [This comic](http://www.homeonthestrange.com/view.php?ID=4), while not perfect, does at least lay out most of the reasons for it.

Rape, in particular, is seriously over-used as ""character development"" in fantasy, and it's rarely done well. You want to show how brutal and evil the bad guy is? Rape. Need to reveal that a ""strong female character"" was once weak and overcame that? Rape. Need to establish the goodness and strength of a male character? Have him save someone from rape. Honestly, I can pick up a random swords-and-shields fantasy book from the shelves and have **at least** an 80% chance that at least one female character is either going to get raped or face the direct threat of it. 

And, frankly, it's a bit *weird* how fans of the genre jump to defend their favourite works from this criticism. They start to cry ""realism! that's how it was back in the medieval period!"" - for fuck's sake, you're reading a story with wizards and dragons. The author controls every aspect of the story, and this is a lazy and (at least mildly) offensive cop-out of trying to build believable characters without falling back on outdated tropes. I wasn't aware of just how pernicious and far-reaching the rape trope was in fantasy until a friend of mine asked me for recommendations of fantasy books *without* rape in and I started to come up blank after female authors like Ursula K. Guin and the occasional Mormon author like Brandon Sanderson. (Not that Mormon authors are immune to this either - David Weber seems entirely unable to write a female lead without rape in her backstory.)

But all of the sharks have no finger bones inside their fins. They swim very effectively. 

Aha! you might retort, whales tend to be larger than sharks, it's a bonus to movement in large species. Compare a blue whale to tiger shark for arguments sake.

Unfortunately no, dolphins also have the same finger bone set up, and most species are the same size or smaller than tiger sharks. 

Dolphins and whales are both cetecea, closely related. Both have finger bones. Cetecea and chondrichthyes (sharks) diverged 462 million years ago, not closely related. Sharks have a different set up for swimming to the ceteceans which came later.

True,marina2021,,,"BTW, when debating politics with Venezuelan opposition supporters, you might want to know their ""logical"" explanations about why they don't like Chavez. I compiled a few of the most memorable phrases and rationale:

* Chavez hated us because we have money, being rich is bad according to him
* If you don’t live in Venezuela you can't have an opinion on favor of Chavez, however if your opinion is against Chavez is OK.
* There is no freedom of speech in Venezuela that's why we have been saying that on national TV and newspaper for 14 years, so it is clear what the situation is.
* We are open to arguing with you as long as you think like us, but if you have anything to say that might even questioned how evil Chavez was then you most be a moron, poor or black, and we don't want to talk to you.
* We are very angry with Chavez socialist movement because he gave freebies to  the poor, we all know poor people are lazy and they don't deserve anything. We went to college and study hard they didn’t, if someone should be getting anything that should be us.
* Chavez is the worse president in the history of Venezuela and the world. We read Venezuelan history in 5th grade and we got all the knowledge to say that, thus did we mentioned we lived in Venezuela (at some point), we now live in Miami, but our opinions are still very valid because we lived there. 
* It is so unfair that Chavez put restrictions for Venezuelan to get American dollars, we can't go shopping to Miami with just $3000, what was he thinking? He is such a dictator.
* Chavez gave away oil to other Latin American countries for nothing, he even helped the poor in the US giving free heating oil.  He shouldn’t care about helping other nations, we need our oil and the money from it.
* Chavez is so unsophisticated, bad spoken, violent, and black that makes us embarrassed. Not all people in Venezuela are so black and unsophisticated. See Capriles the opposition candidate, he is so white, handsome, sophisticated, well-spoken, world-traveled, rich, thus he hate Chavez, he is perfect.

The biggest advantage of ballast is sound dampening and the ability to 'tamp' the tracks after installation to ensure that they're in proper alignment and that trains don't sway side-to-side as they pass over the tracks. The advantage of concrete slabs is more solid alignment over the lifetime of the trackbed. New York City's trains are also heavier than Bostons, but the weight limit of what can run over tracks is determined by number of ties per length of track and the actual weight of the rail.

Even in Boston, you can hear the difference on the Orange line as it passes from the old underground sections between Chinatown and North Station to the newer sections where the trackbed is made of pre-cast concrete slabs.

True,Tokyocheesesteak,,,"My great-grandfather was in Auschwitz as a Soviet POW. He almost escaped at one point during his two year stay. Being a watchmaker, he pretended to cooperate with the Nazis by fixing their watches and other tech. He would ask them for instruments and materials for the repairs. What the Nazis didn't know is that he was using these instruments for assembling heavy duty wire cutters capable of cutting through barbed wire. Once these were finished, he snuck out in the middle of the night and got past the inner perimeter, on his way to the outer perimeter which consisted of three barbed wire fences. He was attempting to escape with two other inmates. All three were crawling on their hands, with my great-grandpa in the front, armed with the cutters. They made it through the first fence. All clear. Second fence. All clear. As he cut through the last fence, he looked up and found himself staring down the barrel of a gun wielded by a Nazi guard patrolling the perimeter. His life flashed before his eyes - turns out the near-death life-flashing thing is quite real. After a few intense moments, the guard shook his head in such a way as to tell them to crawl back into the camp. As per protocol, the guards were supposed to raise the alarm immediately. An alarm was raised, but only 15 minutes later. We still don't know why they let my great-grandpa off the hook, but our family speculation indicates that it was likely that the guard was familiar with my great-grandfather, and maybe even brought his watch for the guy to fix.

After two years in the camp, they were liberated in 1945. According to dipshit Soviet protocols, some of these POW's were shipped straight to Siberian prison camps, ""just in case"". Well, my great-grandpa escaped from the train taking them to the camp in Siberia, and made it safely back to his hometown and his family. I'm not sure how he slipped through the cracks in the system and did not become a wanted man - I guess the Soviets just didn't care enough to pursue him after his escape. After the war, he became a deep mine rescuer that would go into burning, collapsing shafts to rescue workers. He lived to be 88 years old and died as a watchmaker in the year 2000.

Edit: Since people seemed to like my great-grandpa's story, here are some more stories about the man. For instance, when he was a kid, he was at a boy scout (the Soviet version) camp and they were on a cruise boat for a field trip. Something went wrong and the ship began to sink. Half the kids died in the tragedy, but my preteen great-grandpa was able to survive because he stood on the bow of the ship, which remained stable in its vertical position as the rear of the ship has firmly embedded itself in the river bottom.

Another brush with death came from his frontline years, before the capture. He and a platoon of about 100 men were digging a trench, preparing for an oncoming Nazi onslaught. The trench was about seven feet deep and everyone was crouched over, frantically digging away at the earth. Only two guys were up top, keeping watch. My great-grandpa stood up for a quick second to stretch his hunched over back. Then suddenly the trench walls cave in. The two guys at the top were like ""Holy shit, fuck, everone is down there!"" and began digging for whoever they could rescue. They saved my great-grandpa and another guy at the other end of the trench, who also stood up to stretch his back. Their heads were really close to the surface. Everyone else perished. The trench became a mass grave.

He was a very wise man, from what I remember of him. He taught me three rules by which to live life - passed down to me from my dad, the guy's grandson:

1) Never worry about money. Of course, you should be able to put bread on your table and strive for a well-off living, but you must never obsess over money and allow it to consume your essence, as money troubles are not the end of the world (figures, HE would know, as someone that has been through things way worse than just being broke).

2) Don't be attached to rubbish. If you have something that you don't need but feel too stingy to throw it away - give it up and toss it. It is only an unnecessary burden.

3) Instead of always saying sorry, live your life in a way that you never have to apologize to anyone, for any reason. Before doing anything, think about the consequences and if you might have to say ""I'm sorry"" afterward, don't go through with that situation if you can help it.

He seems to be talking about pop music (quote ""Hollywood produced, over use of effects, very polished, use of auto tune""), where instruments are played in a conventional way and then wonders why something as specific as a bass chord isn't used in it. Out of the top of my head, I can't think of a lot of pop music (or ""Hollywood produced, over use of effects, very polished, use of auto tune"" kind of music) that uses bass chords, but that's ok. I don't hear guitar solo's either, it's not something you *have* to put in every other song.

At the same time, I can think of a lot of music (although admittedly most of these songs are a bit more obscure) that does use chords on bass:

* [Norah Jones - You've Ruined Me](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGzKZQEOm_Q).
* A video that has been posted in this subreddit a little while ago: [El Ten Eleven - My Only Swerving](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1SMAihtAEA).
* [Jungle Funk - Torn](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_JJqdWSJuA) with Doug Wimbish on bass. Absolutely beautiful.
* *Obviously* a lot of stuff by [Victor Wooten](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA-ZKDOoBnk).
* [Jaco Pastorius - Portrait of Tracy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsZ_1mPOuyk). Yes, it's mostly with harmonics, but chords played on a bass nonetheless.
* Most, if not all solo stuff by Michael Manring. I give you my favorite, [Selene](http://www.youtube.com/watch?gl=BE&amp;v=6eTBc7aWBGw).
* Subtle but really beautiful use in this classic: [Paul Simon - Diamonds on the soles of her shoes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMJbJJldSNw).
* [Mission of Burma - That's When I Reach For My Revolver](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8piMHsOya4), made (more?) famous Moby, who covered it.
* [Arsenal - Lotuk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55TVk15DSNQ) (around 2:25, vocals by John Garcia).
* [An entire album by a duo called Ashleigh Still and Nick Salisbury](http://www.myspace.com/ashleighandnick).
* [Dot - Swim](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr8XUfLT5oI) (it's kinda mandatory to check out [other stuff](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuunY8BTqNs) he's done as well).
* [The Reddings - The Awakening](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QFv4nq9n9w), also covered by Les Claypool. A few but tasteful uses of doublestops.
* Now that we're talkin about Les Claypool: [Primus - Last Salmon Man](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Mvs_FwfhGg).
* [Back Door - 32-20 Blues](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7QQ1jJVpeQ). In fact, check out everything by Back Door and [Colin Hodgkinson](http://www.notreble.com/buzz/2012/12/13/transcription-colin-hodgkinsons-catcote-rag/).
* [Rage Against The Machine - Bullet In The Head](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_-QGNUYL5g) (as well as in some [other](http://www.youtube.com/watch?gl=BE&amp;v=4smim2MNvF8) songs too).
* [D'Angelo - Playa Playa](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWerXhjUYVU), frequent use of doublestops on that entire album.
* [Iron Maiden - Rime Of The Ancient Mariner](http://www.youtube.com/watch?gl=BE&amp;v=t7zk4as9kzA).


That should give you lots of listening hours.

EDIT: I actually wasted a part of my good night's sleep on this. If there's any interest in this, I could make a spotify playlist or something where I add these songs and even more music.

EDITEDIT: now that I'm busy, I'll also add these.

* [Rush - Force Ten](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCn7DyDCLyc)
* [Level 42 - Dune Tune](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_rjBbI40QE)
* A good portion of Dune Tune is practically a rip-off of [Stanley Clarke's School Days](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMQ7xGxI3ME)
* [Daniel Lanois - The Maker](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-JtAcpKtYQ).
* [Metallica - Orion](http://www.youtube.com/watch?gl=BE&amp;v=-qYqi-EMErU).
* Same band, different bass player: [Metallica - My Friend Of Misery](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_98Gyg1er-k).
* [Tool - The Pot](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycAByDNZYrA).
* [Some over-the-top solo by Stu Hamm](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnq3ZW6OyTI).

About three and a half decades ago a young cousin of mine wandered away from her minders into the Alabama wilderness skirting my aunt + uncles farm...  pack of hungry, wild dogs spots her...  
  
My uncle and I were mending fence (cliche!) nearby and his foundling mutt (named Dingo) quasi pointed for about half a second and then took off like a bat out of hell...  my uncle grabs his firearm and we follow on foot as fast as we could.  
  
Awful scene plays out - pack of wild starving dogs bearing down on terrified/paralyzed toddler in the middle of a fallow field... moving humans have the high ground.... uncle raises rifle to his shoulder and starts downing dogs... they keep coming... we begin sliding down the hill while Dingo appears in the lowground... charging across the field like she has the whole of Vergilian Rome were behind her...  
  
Dingo slams into the bulk of the pack, brick walls their charge... Bravest thing I ever saw.  
  
Dogs turn on Dingo, ignoring cousin.  
  
Dingo is torn to shreds.  No good fight, no powerful stand.  Just jaws, blood spurts and bowels.

Dog pack leaves with pieces of Dingo.  Cousin is safe.  Uncle picks off retreating member of pack.  
  
I finish my sprint next to my cousin but uncle speeds on past her to his downed dog.  Gets a quick glance at her open midsection, reloads and puts a bullet through her brain.  Even a young me saw that as a kindness.

True,Lord_Monboddo,scotland,Home of the deep fried everything!,"Here's part 6! I was a bit pushed for time on this one so I don't think it's quite as bonnie as my last part.

This one mostly covers Ireland's issues in the Union. The first thing mentioned is the [Concert of Europe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concert_of_Europe) where the main European powers tried to maintain relatively good relations and avoid conflict. This of course broke down over time for a variety of reasons. 

Also mentioned in this part is the famous [Irish potato famine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Famine_(Ireland\)) and the slightly less well known potato famine in the [Highlands of Scotland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highland_Potato_Famine). The Scottish one had significantly less deaths (hence why Scotland is less concerned in this one, also the Highlands was being turned into a sort of theme park for the rich by this point) but drove even more highlanders off their lands and into the cities and abroad, the Irish one of course caused a massive loss of life (in to the millions) not helped by inaction by the British government (there were attempts at mitigation but they were slow to act, the yellow stuff is meant to be the sub-par maize bought from America which was practically inedible and if not cooked properly lead to serious stomach complaints). This drove desire for [Home Rule in Ireland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Home_Rule_movement) which became a major political problem in the UK parliament which was divided and constantly arguing over it, bills were also put forward for a Scottish parliament but shot down (Scotland was less concerned with this politically though there were some arguing for it). 

The rebirth of radicalism in Scotland is to do with [Red Clydeside](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Clydeside), civilian unrest in Glasgow during the War and in particular the [Battle of George Square](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_George_Square) (where tanks and machine guns were placed in the city in case of revolution, it did at one point nearly boil over in to a communist revolt). Out of this came [James Connolly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Connolly) (who is represented by the little blue ball jumping on to Ireland, that is the flag of the [Irish Citizen Army](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Citizen_Army) set up by Connolly by the way) an Irishman born in Scotland who after becoming involved in Socialist movements in Scotland returned to Ireland and was instrumental in the [Easter Rising](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Rising). The Easter Rising was quite a small affair with only part of Dublin taken and public opinion in Ireland on the most against it at first but the overreaction of the British government and army (in particular executing a heavily wounded James Connolly who was so weak he needed to be propped up in front of a firing squad) made the people side with the Republicans. This lead to Ireland declaring Independence and the subsequent War of Irish Independence.

Next time will cover the End of WWI and the acceptance of Irish Independence and partition of Ireland, WWII and the Welfare State and the NHS.

I also just noticed the final panel looks dangerously as if Ireland has eyebrows, it isn't meant to be eyebrows but just detail and emphasis around the eyes but if the mods feel it's wrong I'll happily take it down and resubmit. I also realize some stuff is out of sync historically (like the Scramble for Africa actually came later than the famine, the Battle of George Square was after the war) but it was just to help the story along.

True,SuperSural,,,"I too am in your situation, but it gave me an extremely unique advantage. By looking back on any social situation I was in, I could begin to see that even the coolest motherfucker slips up REGULARLY. Every time you encounter a person and have a one-on-one talk, I guarantee at some point in that conversation there will say or do something that you will find particularly weird, or awkward, and it won't affect your opinion of them in even the slightest. 

Here are a few of my favorites:
Jacked dude at my gym cannot stop flexing and looking at himself in the mirror. Flexes when taking off earbuds. Flexes when putting back in earbuds. Flexes when answering phone. No one gives a shit.

Know a guy that will look up and the ceiling when he talks to you. It was kind of silly looking, but no one ever calls him out on it or even gives two shits.

Know a guy who can barely speak to you because of his social awkwardness and wears the same shirt every single day. NO ONE CARES.

Know a guy that laughs like this. ""Hu-yuh, hu-yuh, hu-yuuuuuuh"" I can't really articulate the sound Via text, but it is obnoxious, and you can't find a person in our social circle that gives a fuck.

People are fucking weird by default. Every action we make is something we basically improvise on a split second notice. Every word, every movement, every thought is formulated and acted upon almost immediately without any actual thought most of the time. If you allow yourself to get hyper conscience of every action you make you'll drive yourself mad. If you catch yourself saying or doing something stupid, just try not to do it again and move on.

True,loosebrick,,,"so, after taking a peek at the reference, I think I'm going to pass on this one. Here's why: The photo is really, really odd, and even if you did a perfect copy it would feel like an interesting abstract exercise gone wrong. 

I looked through the photos you had picked out on pinterest and I think there's a pattern here... the lighting in the photos you've picked out is interesting, dramatic, highly artificial and quite complicated. Not good for studies. There's a reason most of the greats studied flowers and fruit, and it's not because flowers and fruit are inherently interesting. They are made of simple, forgiving shapes that let you focus on painting beautiful, delicate, and simple lighting. Making an object look real is always a question of subtle value changes and shifts from light to dark, and making it beautiful and dramatic is about pairing those subtle changes with big value changes and contrasts.

If flowers and fruit aren't your thing, I would also suggest film studies. Take screencaps of films you like that have good lighting, and copy them. Film is a good for this because good cinematographers try to simplify the lighting the same way painters do, and will have taken pains to set up the shot in discreet areas of light, midtone, and dark.

True,SamOldman,,,"I'll not go into what causes it, because I was only 3 years old when it began for me, and 8 years old when it ended.  I will tell you what it is like.

Nobody cares about you.  They make a big deal about you when others are watching, but when it is just you - forget it.  Homeless adults get ignored because everyone thinks they got that way on their own.  Homeless children get ignored because people are selfish, uncaring assholes.  

You are 5 years old.

People see you on the street and they cross the road.  They pretend to not hear you when you ask for spare change.  You are carried out of the hotel lobby, in the freezing Salt Lake City winter, because your presence bothers the guests.  Some people will -try- to hit you with their car if you stand too close to the road with your sign.  You get real good at stealing candy bars and beef jerky.  Canned foods are a snap to pocket.  Dad doesn't ask where it comes from - he is too drunk and stoned to care.  Your older brother helps you cook it when the wind dies down enough to start a fire.

You are 6 years old.

You discover that supermarkets and delis throw away food that is out of date, and when they do it, and on those days you feast.  The rest of the time you eat nothing unless you steal it.  You steal bottled water from the gas station because they won't let you use the faucet in the bathroom.  You pretend to be just some kids playing in the duck pond at the park, but you are actually bathing.

Your father tries to do the right thing so he enrolls you in school, but then the school notices you wearing the same clothes every day so they call DCS to check on you.  DCS sees that you live in a tool shed in some old lady's back yard, so they send you to foster care.  

Your foster parents beat you daily, and force you to study the Bible every waking hour, and then you go to sleep on a piss soaked mattress with 7-8 other paychecks (I mean foster kids) in the corner of their basement.  

Every morning you are required to stand in a bathtub, naked, with 3 other children holding a quarter sized dollop of shampoo in your hand for 5, 10, 15 minutes....  however long it takes for your foster parents to come into the bathroom and certify that you are not wasting it.  I don't want to tell you what the older kids do to you when nobody is looking.

Your father is finally let out of rehab and regains custody of you.  You move in to a friend's house while your dad gets back on his feet, working as a high-rise satellite dish installer.  Eventually the alcohol gets him kicked out again, so you move into a motel.  Next week its a new motel.  And again next week.  Sometimes we move in the dead of night.  Sometimes we are chased away.

You are 7 years old.

The years of molestation and beatings from other homeless kids and foster parents has really started to do a number on you.  You find yourself starting fires just to see things get destroyed.  You release hundreds of captured bees into a hotel ventilation system to get back at how they treated you.  You put rocks through windshields.  You get picked up by the police over and over, and not once does anyone do anything beyond the bare minimum required.  Nobody ever asks why.  They just want to forget abut you.

You move to Maryland and live in squallor in one of the most dangerous towns in America.  Someone is murdered in the motel room directly above yours.  Distant relatives discover what has been going on.  They send for you.

You are 8 years old.

Big house in the country.  Food on the table.  Nobody hurting you any more, but for 10 years you are constantly being asked why do you never smile?  They years of psychologists and psychiatrists try everything to figure out why you never smile.  Why you avoid people.  Why you lock yourself in your room every night.  Why you never have friends over, or why you never visit friends.  You are so incredibly intelligent but when you make it into the best university you can't even manage to go to class every day...  but you won't touch alcohol.  You don't do drugs...  you don't smoke cigarettes because you are too afraid.  Your only friend in college is someone as fucked up as you are.

You are 22 years old.

You move to a new town.  You start a new life.  With your abilities you are able to buy your own home within 2 years.  An empty home.  Just you and your cats.  You don't allow family to visit.  Your couple of friends have never seen the inside of the place.  Every single door is barracaded so you can try to get some sleep at night.  But you can't.  Any time a girl fancies your company you make sure to let her know that you are absolutely not interested in any sort of romantic involvement, because every relationship you have ever been in has ended disastrously.

You are 30 years old.

You are the Co-Chair of a major online retailer.  Your company does millions of dollars every year in sales.  You do everything you can to be sure that your employees are happy and productive.  And every night you cry yourself to sleep because you know that if your business faltered, even for a second, those employees would drop you like a hot rock.

You are 35 years old.  

There hasn't been another human being step foot in your home in years.  You finally decided last week to replace the only pair of shoes you own because after almost 3 years of wearing them every day you got tired of the snow coming in and soaking your socks.  You could have bought every single pair of shoes in the store with the cash you had *in your pocket* but you still bought the cheapest pair of shoes that fit.

You go home and lie down on the couch with your tablet and read various news websites until you fall asleep.  You pay $55 per month for cable and broadband internet with Charter, but you haven't even taken the cable box out of the styrofoam since you got it 3 years ago.

35 years old.  I have a place to live that is all my own, but I am still homeless.  I have shelter but I can find no solace.  I have all the money I could ever need or want, but every day I wake up wondering why I didn't pull the trigger the night before.

That is what it is like to be homeless.

EDIT : WOW.  I just sat down at my computer and saw all the support and all the messages.  It's hard to talk about things like this when you are staring face to face with someone because you can hardly get the first sentence out before you start to tear up.  When I originally wrote this post I was only able to do it because there was nobody around to see me cry.  After I finished writing it I thought nobody would ever really see it but it still felt like I had actually gotten something off my chest.  I really did feel just a little bit better to think that maybe out there someone would hear what I had to say - that maybe I'd break through the noise *just a little* and someone out there would understand.  My advice to people who had to deal with similar stuff in their childhoods : don't keep it bottled up inside.  It will turn black and it will start to eat you.  Talk to someone - write it down if you have trouble speaking the words. It has helped me and it might help you too.

True,abeuscher,,,"To put the blame on the individual is convenient, but really only one side of the story. The attitudes and lifestyle that you are describing are developed systemically, and do not reflect the laziness of individuals in the slightest. A couple of things to think about:

 - While there have been improvements in the past 10 years or so, health was not generally focused on in early development or at any point in lower education. Yes - there were physical fitness classes, but very little focus on nutrition, or on how to apply critical thinking to how one feeds and treats oneself. This is on the improve, especially now that childhood obesity has become a hot button issue in the press, but many of the programs that are in place even now don't do a lot to make being physically fit or eating well seem appealing at all - they just sort of present the facts and then when you go to the caf it's still pizza day, and the vegetable and fruit offerings are low quality and unappetizing if they are present in quantity at all.

 - Outside of school, the free market is at work, and big food is lowering the quality of produce while fast food and crap restaurants are so ubiquitous it's embarrassing and often remarked upon by foreigners from other countries. There's messaging everywhere telling us to eat crap, drink booze, and sit around and watch the idiot box (all of which I'm guilty of - I'm not some health nut who doesn't see the value in these things - just trying to be observant about what's being promoted around me).

 - Finally, we have this crap attitude that oscillates between victimhood and total blame on the individual, which is completely ignorant that there is more nuanced middle ground that more accurately describes our relationship to commercialism, education, and critical thought. On the one hand, I disagree with your basic premise, which is coming from one side of the table; people are not completely to blame for their attitude toward physical health. They have to work long hours, longer than even 20 years ago, food is more expensive, and good food is generally harder to find than crap food. On the other hand, the points I have raised don;t make us completely blameless either; just because the information is not being spoon fed to us doesn't mean that we shouldn't be taking a greater interest in self care. 

All that being said, the healthcare system sits between these two opposing forces and does a crap job of communicating to people how to best behave because it has a profit motive and not a wellness motive driving it.

True,[deleted],,,"What a lot of people--especially on this subreddit--don't realize is that it's not only very difficult for KJU to take that position but that it's impossible for him to do so. 

The North Korean economy and overall political strategy has been defined by [Juche](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juche), itself an idea developed by Kim Il Sung in the aftermath of the Korean War. The concepy of Juche is becoming self sufficient without external aid by devoting as much of the economic effort towards the military to prevent the humiliating losses taken by Korea since the [First Sino-Japanese War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juche) when Korea became a colony of Japan and was subject to a brutal occupation that lasted for decades. When the Korean War Armistice was signed, it became painfully obvious that North Korea could not compete militarily against the West (considering that China did a tremendous amount of the fighting in the Korean War).

Because of the Juche policy, North Korea shifted the majority of its attention to the military--particularly its generals and other ranking party officials in the upper echelon of the Korean People's Army. By the time Kim Il Sung died in 1994, the KPA had effective control over a vast majority of the Korean economy. 

Now, when Kim Jong Il took power, it was a largely a ceremonial transfer of power. He had already been seen acting alongside his father in the late 1980s and early 1990s, which made it easier for the military to accept his leadership. This is an important point that we'll need to keep in mind as we approach modern day. 

Right around 2006 when North Korea started their nuclear weapons program, we start to see an increasingly militant rhetoric/actions taken by the North Koreans. This comes as no surprise to those who have paid attention to the issue primarily because this was when KJI was rumored to fall into worse and worse health. 

While people in the West saw that as ""Great, the leader of evil is dying"" they're actually missing a VERY important piece of the puzzle: the grooming of a successor for KJI. 

Keep in mind that KJI had nearly a decade to make himself familiar to the rankings generals and the propaganda machine. When you look at the transition of power from KJI to KJU, you see only a few months of power transfer. 

And herein lies the biggest problem. The generals are NOT accustomed to seeing the current Kim in power and many of them probably hold doubts about his commitment to the Juche ideal (Remember that these ranking generals benefit the most from Juche). Throw in the fact that the man originally intended to take power after KJI was involved in the Japan Disneyland scandal made the transition all the more unstable. KJU was never meant to be the next leader of North Korea (his western education in Switzerland was a HUGE hint at that). 

So now, these hard line generals see their potential power and influence being potentially affected by a Western educated leader are starting to react. If anything there is a silent rebellion happening amongst the North Korean generals as they weigh between sticking it out on their own or risk losing everything. What this means is that KJU is put into a VERY dangerous position. He needs the generals to keep the country from falling apart but he can't enact any reforms that could potentially alienate even a single one of the generals. 

As a result, he is forced to play into the party line and do the bidding of his generals even if he actually wants to enact reforms. Essentially, he is held hostage by his own generals to keep following a failed ideal. His best hope for reforming the country would be to either remove ALL of his ranking generals and replace them with people that are willing to open up the country for reform (highly unlikely due to the entrenched political and military support these generals have) or simply wait for the generals to die to do the same (and run the risk of falling prey ton an internal assassination attempt)",0,1362976820,,0,False,1,c8tgfm1,t3_1a25jf,t1_c8tgfm1,t1_c8tf98i,,1431547224,536,False,worldnews,t5_2qh13,536

Why indeed.  Of course, Mohammed has more followers.  I guess he's more ""right""?  Or is it not a contest?  If you have millions of followers, that somehow makes you a great person?  Someone tell Justin Bieber - he has more than 35 million followers on Twitter.

True,Antije,,," You brought tears to my eyes because you reminded me of something that happen a few years ago. I was a sophomore in HS and walking home from my bus stop. I was already aware that the family at that end of my street had a missing dog, well when I got to the corner of my street there was their little weenie dog laying in the road. He'd gotten hit by a car and was not only dead but his body in general was just demolished. I knew the families daughter would be getting off her elementary school bus soon so I ran home and got gloves and a bag and went and bagged up the dog so she would not have to see it while walking home. I went and left the bag behind some of their bushes (since no adults were home at the time) and left a note in their mailbox. I even managed to make the area where he was a little less bloody looking by squirting my water bottle over the area.

True,ferretinjapan,,,"This was also asked of Satoshi way back on the mail archive cryptography forum:

&gt;&gt; We want spenders to have certainty that their
&gt;&gt; transaction is valid at the time it takes a spend to
&gt;&gt; flood the network, not at the time it takes for branch
&gt;&gt; races to be resolved.

Satoshi's Response

&gt;Instant non-repudiability is not a feature, but it's still much faster than 
&gt;existing systems.  Paper cheques can bounce up to a week or two later.  Credit 
&gt;card transactions can be contested up to 60 to 180 days later.  Bitcoin 
&gt;transactions can be sufficiently irreversible in an hour or two.

What this signifies is that though Bitcoin can be used loosely as a payment protocol, it's main purpose is to serve as a currency. Other systems can/will probably be built around the Bitcoin protocol that are willing to take a small part of the risk in order to deliver instant verifications. Bank-like entities, those that store coins on other person's behalf can locally clear funds if they are trusted. Ripple is seen as also potentially filling this niche.

From a different perspective, digital services can easily shield themselves from this risk even if the payment is double-spent, since they can revoke the service soon afterword with very little loss. 

Bitcoin is not optimal (though lets not forget it's pretty damn good regardless) for small, instant clearing of transactions between two anonymous persons where one party could quickly revoke the transaction and run off with the goods in 10mins, but the fact that you can clear a $200,000 USD transaction using Bitcoin with a 0.5 cent fee in as soon 10 minutes is certainly nothing to scoff at.

True,nfl_jets,,,"I cannot speak for every case, but rejecting an offer after already accepting it is generally extremely bad professional etiquette. 

After already accepting a job offer you first of all should have stopped applying to any other positions. Secondly, if you have already accepted, you should also withdraw any current applications you already have. This is because by continuing with the application process, you are not only being dishonest with the employer whose offer you've already accepted, but also with the employer with whom you are still interviewing. If any side found out that you already accepted an offer but still continued to interview, it would not be good.

I understand that it is too late to go back on what you did, but the best course of action would have been to ask the company you've already accepted to wait. Especially, if you were already interviewing for your other eventual offer. Before you accepted the first offer, you should have said something like ""I am very excited for this opportunity, but I have already accepted an interview with another company. While I would very much enjoy working with your team, I feel like I still have to honor my commitment I made with the other company.

Anyway, this is no longer an option, or maybe you did do the above and they said ""no, we don't want to wait"". In either case, best case scenario, by rejecting their offer, you've definitely burned bridges with that one firm. (You probably cannot apply there ever again). 

At the same, time, you listed four reasons why your alternative option is better than what you have. So you have to decide for yourself whether this is your better option given the risks.

Although unlikely, (I'm not sure how unlikely) you never know how connected one company is to another. People who work in HR can be very connected to others and this could possibly hurt your reputation elsewhere. Again, I do not know how likely this is. Furthermore, if your other alternative company ever found out you turned down an offer you've already accepted, I'm sure that certainly will not help you in the future. 

Basically, what I'm trying to say is that you're definitely in a sticky situation. I really don't want to sound condescending or anything (hopefully this didn't come out that way!). But, you should not take rejecting an already accepted offer lightly. It is something pretty serious, and even though it may not have any ramifications on your future career at all, it's definitely not the best thing you can do for yourself. So, I'm glad that you got the other offer. In this economy, there are people who would kill to have just one job and you have the problem of having one too many! If you're sure that the other job is THAT much better and you are committed to working for that firm, then that is your decision to make.

She never got over her ex, and probably has continued to love him waiting for an opportunity the entire life of your relationship.  I had an ex that was the same way.  I didn't realize it at first because she talked rather poorly of him when we first started dating, but over time it went from ""I would rather never see him again"" to ""If I see him whatever"" to ""He was like my best friend"" to a flat out ""I miss him"".  She had never moved on, despite the fact that he was literal human filth.  She chose to take their 8-9 month relationship, and ignore the fact that--according to her friends and family members--she spent about 6 months of it arguing with him constantly and fighting non-stop, and remember those few good moments and the fact that he was her first serious boyfriend.

Now, it's nothing against you as a person, but I know for a fact that's hard to accept.  People are fucking stupid sometimes.

The two crossing of the Colorado River on the 89A and 89 are both beautiful areas, though I'd say the 89A slightly edges out the 89. The North Rim is worthwhile, but it is a bit of a drive in and out to get there.

True,biskino,,,"I'd wager I'm a good bit older than most of the people posting about how 'naive' you were for not automatically assuming the only reason this guy was nice to you is because he wanted sex. 

I've had plenty of close, sometimes slightly flirty, friendships with women who I had lots of interest in beyond wanting either sex or romance. I know the dating geniuses and alpha bros making those comments have a hard time wrapping their heads around this, but there are plenty of guys who like hanging out with women, enjoy a bit of flirting and see it as something a lot more complex and mutually pleasurable than a mere prelude to sex or some sort of stalking strategy. 

It really depresses the shit out of me to see the attitude that 'any man who is friends with you is after sex' is inevitable or somehow programmed genetically. If you think that targeting every woman in your life as a potential sex partner (or, as is implied, rejecting any form of friendship with a woman you don't want to have sex with) you're gonna have a bad time. Some of my best friends, closest business contacts, best mentors and most productive employees are women. If I couldn't engage them in friendship and yes, even engage in a bit of mutually acceptable flirting, without thinking that the inevitable end-game is sex I would consider myself socially, financially and emotionally crippled.

True,IrateProfessional,,,"So the points this article is making boil down to: ""Managing a career and family is difficult. Childcare in America is pathetic."" These are not new concepts and the article's solution is legislation. Great.

I'm a 23 year old working professional myself. I am currently part of one of the largest companies in the world and my organization has an aging, old school workforce -- the majority of my colleagues and superiors are WASPy, grey haired males. To add to that aspect, the city I'm currently based in has the smallest number of women in executive/BoD positions in Canada. I see the issues and attitudes that my mother struggled against because some of the men that blatantly (or even unconsciously) impeded female success in her generation are managing the companies around me. And it pisses me off.

But you know what? There is a new generation coming along as we speak. My generation! We aren't as big as the baby boomers, and we're going to struggle to fill the gap they will leave behind, but the biggest 'pro' in my generation: we have different expectations and attitudes. I truly despise these discussion because it's always posed as 'women against men!'. It's not like that anymore. The attitudes of the men my age are different! Often times, I am treated more like an equal by my male peers than any other men in the workplace. Women need to work to change their attitude towards these issues, because men's attitudes are changing towards them as well. It's not an 'us versus them' deal anymore. It's about working towards a common goal, just like any good partnership.

If career-oriented women of all ages don't continue to step up and **demand** *partners* that will work to compromising *with* them and **expect** workplaces that will work *for* them, there will be no change. No childcare legislation. And no better future for my generation and the generations coming up behind me. Pressure from the workforce puts pressure on the corporation and, in turn, the government. Change like this takes time. But speak up, ladies. Lean in. Expect better.

In one of my elementary ed classes, there's this middle aged woman who looks like she is straight out of the 90s. We had to give a ""book talk"" on a book of our choosing. Basically, you give some info about the book to inspire others to read it.

She chose the Three Little Pigs. Every other student is winging it, just kinda saying stuff, but this woman comes up with a fat stack of note cards and I knew I was in for a treat. 

So she begins by saying the typical stuff; author, illustrator, how difficult the book is to read. Then out of no where, she says: ""The book is 7 inches tall and 11 inches wide."" No one else listed any measurements, so I was ...baffled. Why did she decide to measure the fucking book? There had to be a reason. 

I looked at the rubric. One of the requirements was ""Book length"". As in how many pages. This woman saw that and *measured the fuckin book.* Like with a ruler. That's some god damn Amelia Bedelia shit right there. 

I looked straight down at my lap with my mouth covered so I wouldn't completely lose it. What sucks is that I looked around to share this moment with *someone* and everyone was on their damn phone or something. It was like I was the only person to witness it.

True,misanthropicusername,,,"All right, I'll take a crack at it.

Basically, matter particles (""fermions"") can't be in the same place and the same quantum state at the same time. This is why, for instance, the electrons in atoms form into orbitals. If the electrons could all be in the same place/state at the same time, they'd all fall into the lowest energy state - the lowest orbital. Instead, only two can fit there - same place, but they're spinning opposite directions (different state), so it's kosher. The reason *why* this happens is a little complicated (it is quantum mechanics, after all), but it basically boils down to all particles behaving like waves and all particles of a given type (e.g., electrons) being identical. Since they're identical, their waves can interfere with each other, and this ends up keeping them apart.

That's the Pauli exclusion principle: no two fermions of the same type can be in the same place and the same state at the same time. ""Degeneracy pressure"" is the pressure pushing them apart. It isn't a real force - you can't use it to do any work - but it is an effective force keeping things apart. It can also be overcome. Neutron stars form when the gravity of a white dwarf is strong enough to overcome this, forcing all the electrons into their atomic nuclei.

Now, remember the atomic orbitals. The electrons can't drop to lower orbitals because they're already full of other electrons. Electrons can also jump from atom to atom when they're close enough, so with two nearby atoms - one from one surface, and one pressing against it - you can think of it as a continuum of orbitals from one atom to the next. This is how it keeps matter apart. All the lower energy states are occupied on both sides, so the electrons have nowhere to go.

The paper I mentioned above calculated the strength of this degeneracy pressure and the strength of the electrical repulsion of electrons and found that somewhere around 2/3-3/4 of the force keeping matter apart was degeneracy pressure, and without this force atoms would basically slip past each other. So if you placed a block of wood on a table, you'd see it melt into the table as the atoms found ways around each other.  To give an idea of how tricky it was to figure this out, the idea was proposed around 1920 and that paper didn't demonstrate it until 1967.

Sorry, that was probably a bit muddled.

For starters an open order is just that, open. This is a contract that allows the department to purchase up to 1.6b rounds of ammunition at the agreed upon price. There is 0 obligation to actually purchase that amount. There for, this contract is actually a cost saving measure! With this open order they can purchase ammunition at the agreed upon rate even at lower quantities on an as needed basis.

This has happened in the past with border patrol, and other agencies that enter into these contracts. They never actually purchase all of the ammunition, but are able to do so at reduced rates if they need to. The NRA loves to spew this and point to it as the reason for the ammo shortage, which is actually driven almost purely by consumer demand as a result of fear tactics. This open order does not change the rate at which the Department consumes or purchases ammunition.

They are in fact going to the Navy - Marines. 
I will also put in the snopes link that others have posted. http://www.snopes.com/politics/guns/ssabullets.asp Be sure to give them the credit for this. 

Addressing the issue of hollow points. The reason law enforcement use this type of ammo is because it is safer in urban environments. These bullets tend not to go through walls and kill innocent people when an officer misses his target. 

As pointed out by dcduck (http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1a33h0/16_billion_rounds_of_ammo_for_homeland_security/c8tw67f)
The DHS is making a bulk purchase for multiple national agencies. Other types of ammo are being purchased in bulk and then being shared. All of this was purchased at once to make expensing it easier rather than giving each branch of government oversight to purchase similar materials separately, which would obviously be inefficient in both time and costs.

To actually try to answer your question:  Magick exists to the extent that you make it exist.  It is one of many mental models that you can use to explain things.  To refer again to my original statement... at some point you must realize that every belief you have, whether based on science or trust (and science itself involves a lot of trust, unless you have an awful lot of spare time) or intuition or magick or just plain prejudice, can be traced to a set of axioms (which by nature are unprovable) which are more or less hard-wired in your reality tunnel (at least, harder than most things); and that these axioms were built up from, and operate on, sensory data filtered by and often wantonly intermixed with unconscious and semi-conscious material, that is also subject to an unquantifiable yet significant amount of distortion based on mood, environment, time of day, drugs ingested (including the less spectacular drugs, like coffee, chocolate, and potatoes)...

I think that, scientifically speaking, it would be silly to think we can operate only on data that is falsifiable, repeatable, objective...  Not only do we not have the time or the means to treat everything scientifically, but certainly we can't rely on natural events to be repeatable, and many of the most important things that will ever happen to us occur on the inside of our skulls, so objectivity is often not an option.

True,Illusionweaver69,,,"Hi all, 
My name is Jeroen Van den Bosch, I'm the co-founder and (ex) Creative Director of Sinful Robot. I'm really happy to see this much interest in Erotic Virtual Reality Games :)

but I also have some sad news : two weeks ago the main investor of the project (and co-founder)pulled out [no pun intended] and left a trail of destruction. In January he convinced me he was going to help me realize my dream. He flew me from Belgium to California, put me in a shiny office in Irvine where I started working hard on making Sinful Robot happen. Everything was going very well at first: I managed to hire 4 amazingly talented developers from the AAA video gaming industry but 2 weeks before they where supposed to start development he froze all funding. He made me call those 4 game developers and tell them they wouldn't be hired after all (one of them already cancelled their previous job), he cancelled the office, he took away the car I was using and he cancelled my accommodation. Sinful Robot was reduced to nothing but a name &amp; a website. He basically left me out here without any means of surviving and with a broken dream.

But, I highly believe it's in moments like this that true entrepreneurs rise to the occasion so I am currently working hard to keep my dream alive. I have resigned from Sinful Robot and am now in the process of starting up a new company. 

Some of the game developers I was about to hire really believed in my dream. So much so that they offered me to help create a prototype in their spare time. We are currently making good progress and it looks like we will have a prototype and running by the end of this month. 

However, my situation is pretty hardcore for the moment: I'm in survival mode, using Airbnb to have a roof over my head and a craigslist bicycle to get around in Irvine (lucky for me there is a shopping mall at every corner here hah!) The next few months are going to be tough, but I really believe in my project and won't stop until I deliver the world's most immersive erotic videogame! But I'm not gonna lie: I could use some help right now. I don't know anyone around here, so even someone to talk to would be nice lol :)

I would love to do an AMA today if people would be interested? (how would I do that?)

True,goonsboro,,,"North Korea and South Korea are like brothers without parents. While they were growing up they had a huge fight and just recently NK stopped talking to his brother. They each grew up separately. SK got advice from some well-to-do friends and got his act together: got a job (respected economy), a decent house (soverign nation), and some healthy kids (working healthy citizens) with bright futures. But NK went off the deep end. He picked up a mis-interpreted radical poli-philosphy, went on a pride induced hate bender, fucked up his life on a house he couldnt afford and began going to other distant family members (USA, China, Japan, etc) one at a time for handouts for money, medicine, and began begging for food. After a while, they thought NK was getting better and helped out when they saw that he needed it but now they can see he's only using them. 

They all wanted to go ahead and intervene for his kids sake (citizens). But no one really could. They all had their own problems and everyone knew without NK there, the burden of feeding, educating, and sheltering all of his kids was not something anybody could afford or wanted to be stuck with. Not to mention the fact that NK would fight to the death to keep them under his abusive care.

And let's be honest, if and when NK just loses it, as much as others want to help, it'll be SK, the one who's been apologizing, explaining, and hoping all this time for his lost brother despite all the shame he feels, that will have to take on the majority of the cost to restore the humanity of NK's children.

Now it's all coming together for another outburst of rage. The family's doing better after some financial hurting. So they're having a small get-together to talk. But they didnt invite NK, because he's a deadbeat with nothing to contribute. But guess who showed up at the door emotionally lost, silent but full of anger, hopelessness, hunger and fear with a loaded gun.

China is stunned. She was the closest to him and all this time, she had been telling NK to keep it cool and never wanted it to get to this point. She doesnt know what to do.

Japan just wants everyone to stay calm. It knows better than to get further involved than it has to. 

USA is nervous because he knows he and NK have a seriously bad history and might have to jump in the fight if shit hits the fan. 

And SK is on the other side of the door. Waiting to see if NK is gonna put the gun down and talk, or if he's gonna start shooting his way through the doorway damning all of their kids inside.

Tl; dr: no one wants to deal with it until they have to.

EDIT: I've gotten a few questions. So, I'm following up with further thoughts. PM if you'd like. Loving the talk.

More metaphors, since some of you seemed to like them.

China's like the gal in the Mcdonald's drive thru who's already told the cashier what she wanted to buy. Unfortunately for her, she doesn't want the food anymore after she paid for it but has to eat it anyway.
After backing NK in the war, she's got a large amount of US debt in her pocket, a budding communist economy that needs continuing trade to grow and feels the same way about the US as we feel about her: cautious and civil.

If we're the home batter and China's pitching for the visiting team, NK isn't her curve ball against us to keep us off guard. NK is a group of rowdy drunk visiting fans that came with her. Yeah, she supports them but honestly, it doesn't look good for you when they're getting the stink eye from security and just ruining the game for everyone. 

For example, China is NK's biggest economic partner (about 72% of NK's export/import, totaling about 6 BIL) and even repatriates NK defectors instead of giving them refugee status. However, China's signature is on that armistice agreement that NK just said was null and void.  And, China has clearly indicated the opposite opinion from that of NK's. Recently, her Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said in response to North Korea's threats that ""the Korean armistice agreement plays an important role in safeguarding peace and stability on the Korean peninsula.” (link below) Most Chinese share the opinion their country's ""little brother"" is an embarrassment. He's belligerent and frustrating; kept around only to be a buffer between SK and the US on the phone. But she's stuck between her leverage and her economy: the more China pressures North Korea to behave, the more support it has to provide so that it doesn't crumble, and aid accepted from China is US aid that NK doesn't have to lean on or repay.

She's stuck with him and in a way, so are we. Regardless of who started it, we're all still paying the consequences for that war and for any wars in the future. No one wins completely.

Microchips are built to ±1 *angstrom* tolerances. If that's not impressive, I have no idea what is. Not only that, but companies have to be able to put out a large yield of them to be profitable. Those large wafers have *hundreds* of them, and they do them well... typically getting yields of 80-90% ""good"" chips.

Artist statement: ""The green pieces represent peace, and man's desire to love and be loved.  The red pieces are symbolic of man's violent, destructive nature, and tendency to make war.  The pieces of both colors are in varying sizes, shapes, and quantities.  This reflects that there is never a universal template for peace or war, but simply patterns of chaos.  Those viewing the installation are not only allowed, but are encouraged to walk through it, disturbing, displacing and mixing the pieces.  The continuous mixture creates a natural flow which represents the interaction of, and conflict between, the two opposing sides of man.  The fact that the viewer causes this ongoing change to the piece makes the viewer aware of his or her effect on the shifting winds of hatred or love.""

True,[deleted],,,"&gt;science is often blind.


Only in double blind trials.


&gt;Many people try to use science as the all explanation-but truth is, science can be blind to simple facts. Science doesn't understand many aspects about inner workings of the body no matter how big microscopes or analysis you run on it (because scale of molecules and complexity is so large and many intricacies of relationship of biochemical processes are unknown).


No, we don't understand everything through science. But is that supposed to counter the argument that some wishy washy non-tested non-proven method that is flavour of the month in the tree huggers group, is somehow better?


&gt;The plants and animal kingdom are very much connected through a billion year relationship, and both are products of super-intelligence that manifested in material world we live in.


Ehm, excuse me, are you saying that plants are used for medicine? Damn right, science isolates the compounds which are effective against ailments/disease and uses those more effectively in actual medicine. As the saying goes: ""What do you call nature medicine that is proven to work? Medicine.""


Or is this some pseudo religious bullshit? I'm guessing parts of both. Neither is something you should care much for when you have cancer.


&gt;I find that many on reddit have blindly accepted the new faith- science as the new religion, and fail to look deeper into their own nature, and the miracle of the creation itself.


Because science can be proven, beyond anecdotal evidence and ""this and that deity works in mysterious ways"", it's easier to believe. Facts over fiction, unless you are looking for entertainment. 


&gt;Science is very good at observation, and transcribing it, but it still lacking that intuitive sense which reaches beyond mathematical mind.


You really don't understand science, do you? Science doesn't do anything, it's a tool, to prove/disprove what people think. It's a very good tool, because it can be done again, and again, with many different methods to prove that you're either right, or wrong, or at least at a pathway towards working something out. The intuitive sense is most often what is tested with science, by people.


&gt;In application to cancer, science, like most man made antibiotics just wants to run erase program, flooding body w/ toxic chemicals in hope that the cancer (or whatever you want to get rid of) dies before you do.


Not really, just the comparison between antibiotics and fucking chemotherapy shows ignorance. Chemotherapy, at it's infancy, was more or less pumping rat poison in your veins until it hopefully died off. We have come a long way since then, thanks to... science. They use much more effective ways now, and less damaging. The overprescribing of antibiotics is thanks to idiots like you who doesn't bother getting a basic grasp of diseases and the cures for it.


&gt;But truth is, there's more clever ways of dealing w/ imbalances, and the solutions are available in nature. Anti-biotics cause immune system destruction, instead of making it stronger and more resistant.


Anti biotics are **not** chemo. What the fuck are you smoking, hippy? And what's this bullshit about ""imbalances""? Did you just invent an entire vocabulary to cope with never having the grades to go to med school? There might be better solutions in nature, but damn straight you haven't found them, otherwise science would be there to test it.



&gt;I found from my own experience that the natural ways of healing are always better in the long run, and result in total recovery instead of a band-aid solution that the ""science"" or western medicine provides.


Yeah, your long experience with antibiotics, which you mistake for chemo. Was it cancer you had, or the common cold? Either way, anecdotal evidence isn't evidence. Fuck this noise.


&gt;Not to say that there are applications where western medicine and science has proven effectiveness, with some level of risk of course- such would be surgery, tools for identifying disbalances and so on.


Disbalances again, as if that's actually a thing that isn't made up. Medicine has actually helped us come a long way. Look at the world population charts after antibiotics and penicillin came to be. Exploding, to say the least (somewhat curbed by war, but otherwise exploding). That's medicine. Look before that, and see what ""natural remedies"" did.


&gt;Lets also not forget Chinese medicine which predates western thousands of years, and has been successfully healing people for millenia, generating one of the largest human population on this planet- China!


Strange, they seem to have hospitals in China. Kind of strange if their ""natural medicine"" was so strong.


&gt;Chinese healing methods of restoring balance such as acupuncture and chinese herbs are becoming well accepted even in America today as the main healing tools- even your mainstream medical insurances cover acupuncture.


Becoming accepted thanks to some proof of pain relief from lower back pains. Note ""proof"", and also note ""some"". A good portion of that is because there's loads of people who are gullible. Acceptance doesn't mean effective. There's also the placebo effect, which acupuncture isn't that far from.


Please stop trying to seem like some all knowing guru that will heal cancer with herbs and excersise. The man needs a doctor, not someone hellbent on playing one.

And the thing is that, if MF ended up with Double buffs the game could have been lost for you as well. Also if MF went straight back to lane instead of going back to buy.

There were a lot of things that could have gone poorly with your decision to not help, but it went out fine THIS TIME. That is why it is a case-by-case scenario and it isn't possible to tell you whether or not it was the right call.


Like lets say you went and helped, and you ended up getting a double kill on their Sona and MF and now have double buffs to just dominate your lane (best case), that would probably be better than just staying in lane.

Lets say it's just a neutral case though, and Shaco makes it out alive. In that case, it was also a positive and Shaco may go around and create havoc with the Double buffs that you stopped him from losing.

And then it could have gone really poorly and you, the support, mid, and Shaco end up dying for free.

True,jackdarton,,,"Depression.

People find suicidal thoughts in depressed people both selfish and cowardly, but allow me to present an analogy which hopefully sheds some light on the thought process.

You know when you're tired at night, you're absolutely exhausted and the only thing you want to do is sleep. Your eyelids are heavy and the thought of your warm, comfy bed is overwhelmingly appealing. Picture that moment, but imagine you receive a call from your friends who want you to go out and party all night instead of sleeping. You've been up for 36 hours, you're barely standing, and you're standing there looking at your bed. Your angelic white covers, the cool pillow, the soft sheets and you know you have all day tomorrow to sleep in. But no, your friends are persistent and you don't want to let them down so you drag yourself away from your bed and push on through the night. Your friends, they're not tired, they're alive and kicking. They don't empathize with your exhaustion, they just tell you to forget it, come out, have fun. Simple.

Now, contemplating suicide is very much akin to this. Except you're tired of life. You're exhausted, mentally, physically and emotionally. You just want to sleep for a very very long time. The thought is comforting, it soothes you like the thought of taking your shoes off after a long day's work. The people around you however can't empathize with this, and tell you to push on. One more day, keep going, think positive, you'll feel fine.

Magnify that feeling of going out with your friends after 36 hours of physical work, turning down the possibility of a comfortable bed by an unfathomable amount, and maybe you'll appreciate what each and every single day with this condition feels like.

True,rjshatz,,,"I'm a man, and I call myself a feminist instead of equalist, humanist, egalitarian, etc. for a few reasons.

I do think that we should keep *everyone's* interests in mind when it comes to activism of this sort. But keeping goals specific helps maintain focus in what sort of societal change we want to see. If we're calling an end to violence on everyone *by* everyone, then where do we start? Gang violence? Child abuse? War? All noble causes, absolutely, but hard to tackle all at once. And I think it'd be misguided to say that some issues aren't worth examining because there are other, larger ones at hand.

I think most people would say that they're not excluding themselves from any other areas of social justice by calling themselves feminists. Most of the people I've met who care deeply about stuff like environmental issues, gay marriage, racism, worker's rights, etc. also call themselves feminists. In fact, I get most of my updates on things like that from feminist blogs because those people typically see each other as allies, not competitors.

So, with that in mind, I also want to help try to remove the stigma that, as you've mentioned, is attached to the word feminist. From what I've seen, feminism has morphed into more than the simple creed that women and men should be equal. It's about general acceptance, compassion, assistance, and addressing the glaring inconsistencies and injustices in our society. I suppose a lot of people don't think feminism is the best vessel for change, but from what I've seen, it's a damn good one.

On Earth, the Earth might be pulling you with 500 Newtons while the moon pulls you by with a fraction of a trillionth of a Newton. 85% of the way between the two, the forces will be very close in magnitude and also very small. They'll both be well under a millionth of the force of gravity on either's surface.

True,clinkytheclown,,,"I've had this one my mind for a while now and don't know where else to put it so here it is. 

The path of having ""oh wells"" instead of ""what ifs"" is not a straight path. It's a path that is exciting. A path that leads to more fulfilling friendships than you know what to do with. A path that leads to more self discovery than anything you've ever done before. This path leads to you making connections that might change your life. This path leads to finding the girl of your dreams and falling in love. To looking in her eyes and saying “Man, she loves me, how cool is this?”

This path is also scary. This path leads to disappointment in who you thought people were and who you find out they really are. This path leads to disappointment in yourself, because you think you messed up by taking a chance. This path leads to losing friends that you thought you'd have forever. This path leads to getting your heart broken over and over again. This path leads to times where you wish you had never started, that you had just stayed in and said ""nah, I'm gonna play some video games."" 

This path is rewarding unlike anything else and unforgiving unlike anything else. This path will lift you up higher than you've ever been, and then knock you down to your lowest low. You will learn from your mistakes, only to make new ones. You will come so close to having everything you want, just to have it yanked away at the last minute. This path will show you what love looks and feels like. This path will teach you what loss and heartbreak is too. 

You will learn what it feels like to be in total control of your life. What it feels like to have friends around you who would do anything for you. You will know what it feels like to have people in your life that love you for you.

There will be times where you feel like you have no control. That everything important to you is just out of reach. That you're totally alone, no matter how many people are around. That there is something wrong with you, all because you the wrong chance. 

You will learn that you're a human who makes mistakes, and that everyone around you is the same. You will know what its like to lose something so special to you because you were afraid. You will know the triumph when you get something you hold so close to your heart because you were brave. You will learn the sorrow and paralyzing heartbreak when you lose something that you have wanted for so long, even when you were brave, but because she was scared. 

You will succeed. You will fail. You will love. You will lose. You will have more ""oh wells"" than you know what to do with. You will learn to forgive, to speak your mind, to be kind and nurturing, to be stern and forceful. You will find all that life has to offer. You will develop a character that you never knew was in you.

You will learn what it means to be a human being. ",0,1363059905,,0,False,2,c8u0y31,t3_1a48jo,t1_c8u0y31,t1_c8ty0h7,,1431557376,483,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,483

(1)We are not racists, misogynists or rednecks. I believe in equal opportunities for everyone.

(3) Note to liberals, America is not Europe. Just because a system works for them doesn't mean it will work for us. Americans don't understand the word ""moderation"". Also, since when has Europe had anything work out well besides imperialism?

(4) Murder is already illegal, so don't bother with more gun laws that would keep me from protecting myself against criminals. 

(5) I wish welfare wasn't necessary because it makes people dependent on the government, which is the opposite of what America is about. However, I don't mind my taxes helping out single mothers. 

(6) How fucking dare the government use my tax dollars on benefits for illegal immigrants that don't pay taxes and take our jobs. Seriously. By the way, that comment is not racist. 

(7) Our government is currently borrowing money from China to give to Egypt. Just think about that for a second.

(8) I am ashamed of what Fox News has become. It is a horrible network. However, don't think that MSNBC isn't getting that bad the other way. Possibly less blatant, but definitely very biased.

True,buttchuck,,,"""Assault Weapon"" is not a classification of firearm. The weapons used in recent mass shootings (Sandy Hook, Aurora, Virginia Tech) are not more inherently dangerous than any other firearm typically used for hunting, home defense, or target shooting, and the currently proposed ""Assault Weapons"" ban (as well as the ban that expired a few years ago) only restrict aesthetic and ergonomic features such as grip styles and shoulder stocks. Banning those features doesn't make anyone safer, it just hurts the collectors who like to dress up their rifles to make them LOOK more authentic.



Its like calling a pair of camoflauge cargo pants ""Military-style Assault Pants"" and banning them from civilian use.

I'm in support of any sort of gun control that actually makes people safer that employs educated, rational restrictions, but this kind of thing isn't it.



**EDIT:** Since there seems to be some confusion; An assault RIFLE is a classification of firearm, typically a rifle chambered in an ""intermediate"" cartridge (laymans terms: a medium-sized bullet) that has selective fire modes (semi-automatic, fully-automatic, or burst-fire.) These are currently ILLEGAL for civilian ownership in the USA. There are a SMALL, FINITE number of civy legal select-fire weapons in the country, but their ownership is registered with the ATF, and due to their rarity they are VERY expensive and VERY rare and only exist in the hands of wealthy collectors.

The Assault WEAPON ban proposal does not restrict those (they're already restricted, and as far as I know, have never been used in a crime). Instead it restricts certain features of SEMI-AUTOMATIC rifles (that is, one bullet is fired when you pull the trigger). But these features are ergonomic or aesthetic and don't make the rifle in question any more dangerous.



I'm not asking you to love guns, or support gun ownership if you don't already... just, please, educate yourselves about the topic before jumping to conclusions. A little searching on Google or Wikipedia can get you a substantial amount of information in no time at all.

I am in a wheelchair. I was fine in elementary school, you know, before you really notice that people are different. Middle school and high school were hell. So much so, that my district had implemented a character ed program. I was bullied by teachers, classmates. Everybody. I fought back hard and it's still difficult to say as to whether or not my district is accepting in terms of accommodations for the ""special needs"" kids. I was ill fitting. I ate my lunch in the bathroom stall once, I thought of suicide, not only because of school, but because of abuse at home and my chemical imbalance. Guys used to hit on me as a joke and hand me notes stating that I was the most beautiful girl in my high school and then giggle to themselves, or give themselves a pat on the back.

True,dr_victory,,,"That sucks. I'm not even going to try and say anything otherwise. That. Fucking. Sucks. And I'm sorry, no human being deserves being dealt a hand of cards like that. I know it feels helpless, I completely 100% understand that. I can't imagine your situation, but I can understand the feelings that could arise from it.

This might sound impossible, it won't be easy, but you need to get the fuck out of there. I don't know where you are, but I know you have a computer. Fire up the good old google and see what your local resources are. There are people who will hear your story and help. You can go to them and they will help you turn it around. It will be so, so hard. 

But you deserve a new start, because you're a person and that's all I need to know about you to know that you matter and deserve a fair chance. You have not had one yet, but that doesn't mean you never will. 

You're 17, in high school I'm assuming. Do you have friends who you can go to? Them and their families could be excellent support. What about a teacher who you feel comfortable enough to confide in, or a school counselor? It is not easy to go to another person and ask for help, to show them your soul and your hurt and cry in front of them because it's just so fucking hard to be you. But there are people who will see you, understand you, bend over backwards to help you. 

Maybe when a friend's parent hears your story they will welcome you into their home. You'll never know unless you try. You could find that the space on the couch in your classmates house is where you needed to be all along to come into your own, to finally thrive like you deserve to. 

And maybe the people you need to help you haven't entered your life yet, you might have to search for them. Like I said, do some research about organizations who can help survivors like you. There are shelters out there for people like you, people who need somewhere to go because they can't stay where they are. You can go there, you can rest easy at night, people will talk to you and help you.

And do you know why? Because you matter. You've grown up being told you don't but you do. It might take you a long time to believe that, but I promise, promise, PROMISE you that it is true. 

You are 17 years old. I mean it when I say the world is ahead of you. You have been hindered, but you have the power to scream ""FUCK YOU!"" to your current life and leave. It will not be better right away. You will need time to heal wounds that are so very deep. You will have this be a part of you forever. BUT, that does not mean it defines you. You have to remember that the abuse you've been through does not make you who you are. You are so much more than a punching bag for some asshole. You are you, and you may not know who it is yet, but when you finally meet you you'll be so happy you stuck around long enough to do so.

Because you is an awesome, beautiful, talented, infinite individual. You will be your best friend, you will always be there for you when it's night time and you feel sad, you will see you through the dark times and smile when the light starts to finally beam through. 

But then there's all the people out there who are just waiting, whether they know it or not, to meet you. Out there is someone who will so badly want to be your friend, who will want to hear your story and tell you their's. And then there's someone, maybe multiple people, who will fall in love with you. There is someone who will see you and be hellbent on knowing your name, getting to hold your hand, hold you closer than they've ever held anyone, who will smile brilliantly at you when you do something so simple as run a hand through your hair. And you'll feel the same about them. 

And then there's places! Things to do! Things to see!

Have you ever given yourself the opportunity to dream? Thought to yourself that maybe, just maybe, someday you'd like to climb a mountain, kayak down a river, eat a croissant in France. Maybe none of those things are for you, but there is something out there for you that you'll want to get around to seeing someday. 

And you'll do it. Because you can do anything. Because you're fucking awesome. And you fucking deserve it.

I don't know all of your circumstances, I don't know if it will be as easy as asking a teacher for help. It might be harder. But it is possible. Maybe you have to wait until you're 18 and can go to college somewhere. Does that seem impossible? It's not, there are scholarships and loans and you can do it if you want to. 

Or maybe you'll just have to leave. With no plan. Just leave. Maybe that  cousin 100 miles away will have a place for you while you get on your feet. Save every bit of money you have in case you need to just leave, so you have something. Hide it under your mattress, bury it in the backyard while everyone else is asleep. Just have it, you will be grateful you do.

I've said a lot of stuff, it might not read very coherently, I tend to ramble when I have a lot to say. I want you to walk away with one thing, at the very least.

You have the power to SCREAM. You have a voice! You find people and you MAKE them listen. It may feel small after being stomped on for so long, but it's there and it will get you places. 

It will be hard, but you're a badass and you can take it. You are in charge of you. Use your voice. Do not fear asking for help. Do not give up even when you feel like you do now. 

Even if you don't believe in yourself right now, I do. That might not mean shit to you, but maybe it will feel nice to know someone out there does.

True,BillTripple,,,"I was at a smelly petting zoo, there was this gumball machine that was filled with feed. I purchased about two quarters worth of it and started hand feeding the sheep . I was about 15 at the time and the sheep's warm wet tongues really made my head spin,and as a result,I got a throbbing boner. So I drop my little handful of grain on the ground and tried to conceal my boner with my slobbery hands. 


I then exited the gate leaning forward to hide my boner. after a few steps things cooled down and I decided to walk to the portable shit house. But they were all occupied, so my quest for privacy continued to the trailer where they transport the animals. I look around to see if the coast is clear and I then climb onto the trailer . I go to the very back of the trailer and start to fap. (Keep in mind that I haven't washed my hands after I hand fed sheep) I finished on a pile of hay and walk out unnoticed. I felt like James Bond 


A week later my genitals get warts and itch like fuck. My mother asked me why i scratch so much. She then made a appointment for me to go see the DOC. I see the DOC and he asked me if I was sexually active and things of that nature. My mother was in the office at the time and I try to come up with a smooth story. my dumb ass said ""I took a dump without using the paper lining in a public restroom"". He nods and tells me to ""drop em its ok I'm a trained professional"" I drop my pants and he/ mother sees my dick. It looks like that red thing with one eye from that show yo gabba gabba. He tells me and my mother that I had a condition called HSV-2. My mother thought I was banging chicks and was going hysterical in the doctors office.  She started saying shit about me losing my innocence at a young age and should have used a rubber. 


I should have stuck to my guns about the toilet and the lack of seat covers, but I was weak, and had to confess. I told them everything that happened at the petting zoo.  The fapping in the trailer, the not washing my hands before hand, and that I had gotten aroused by sheep licking my hands. She has never looked at me the same way again.

True,Shaasar,,,"I've read a lot of the comments on this thread and I have to say that I disagree with the majority of them.  A lot of people say that the way that American high schools are depicted in movies is inaccurate, and that's certainly true.  However, it's less of the overt, open bullying and ruthlessness, and more of the silent, lonely agony type of things more than anything else.

They never show in movies about what it's like to have no one talk to you for two weeks straight and have not a single soul remember your name after a full year.  They never talk about how no one ever sits at your lunch table or even bothers to smile at you, no matter how nice you try to be.  They never talk about the devastating experience of sitting in a crowded room of people, the library or the cafeteria, and yet feel completely alienated, alone, on a separate little island that you can't swim away from and no one else can find on any map.

They always show the open things like some beefy kid pouring a carton of milk on the nerdy kid's head or the same kid punching someone in the face.  Those aren't really the kind of things that get to you after a while, because (at least as a guy) you can nail them right back in the mouth or tell a teacher and then point to the evidence-- there's really no evidence that you can show for the silent side of high school suffering.

It's much harder to have your soul eaten bite after bite after bite because while you don't feel it at first like you would if someone ripped it all out at once, after a bit you can't feel anything at all.  High school was like Novacaine for me, and not in a good way.

College works wonders, though!  If I had half the confidence then that I do now, I would be drowning in underage, as Ted Nugent so eloquently puts it, poon-tang.

True,quigonjen,,,"Here are some more:  

Goodwill:  Go to Goodwill stores in wealthier areas.  You have a better shot at getting nice stuff that rich people didn't need/want.  I once found a Roomba for $15.  Clothes and housewares are good purchases.  Furniture (beds, couches, etc.) is not a good purchase because of bedbugs.

To use a film industry term, ""source"" things out.  Use the internet to compare prices, even on things like toilet paper.  You may have to do your shopping at 3 places instead of 1, but you will save a fair amount of money.  Some things are worth getting the generic brand.  Exceptions include Q-Tips and toilet paper--it's worth the extra buck.

Day-old food (bread, occasionally entrees and fruits/veggies) are steeply discounted, and if you're planning to eat them same-day or next-day, they're worth it.  Beyond that, the food poisoning risk can outweigh the savings.

Stay in with friends instead of going out.  A six-pack at the store is going to cost you less than a single drink out, frequently.  Similarly, Netflix (rather than cable) will help keep you entertained.  Also, some movie theaters have discounts on the first showing of the day--the one near me charges $5 for the ticket.  Second-run movies sometimes screen for $2.

A Little Caesar's pizza and some crazy bread will feed me for around 3 days for under $10--you get sick of it, but it has most of your basic food groups.

Never pass up a free meal.  Learn to love leftovers...it's another meal you won't have to pay for.

Forever 21 and H&amp;M have men's and women's clothing on sale for cheap.  If you only buy classic-looking, non-trendy pieces, you can look great for job interviews, etc.  Target's shoes are usually pretty solid--they last longer than Payless'.  Also see the Goodwill note up top--I've gotten $150 never-worn designer jeans for $7.

Learn to do repairs yourself.  If you can find a way to fix it, you won't have to buy another one.  This can apply to sewing clothes, caulking your shower, or fixing your car (simple repairs only--leave the trickier ones to a mechanic).

Get friendly with the dollar store.  Sometimes they have great stuff.  Their can openers, however, suck balls.

Ask for things you want AND need, rather than things you want but will never use for birthday/holiday gifts.  Ask for Amazon and Target gift cards.  You can put them toward things you really could use but couldn't justify buying otherwise.

Haircuts are available at your local salon school for cheap.  Paul Mitchell School charges around $12-17.  Ask for an advanced student--they'll still be cheap but will know what they are doing.

Last but not least, treat yourself once in a while.  For me, it's getting a $15 foot massage every couple of months.  You need to survive, but part of that means having some semblance of mental and/or physical self-care.

True,mittenthemagnificent,,,"This is true. I taught 8th grade for many years, and high school for many, many more. I used to straight-up call the 8th grade girls on their shit. The eye rolls, the sarcasm, the icy cold voice... all of it. And it does help. If everyone, everywhere, called bullying out every time we saw it, it would make a huge difference in kids' behavior. My classroom was a bully-free zone, because I wasn't afraid to just take the bully down in front of the whole class by calling it what it was. Surprisingly, 12 year-old girls do not like their bullying behavior pointed out and criticized... they tended to knock it off, at least in my presence, which was the best I could do.

And then, when I got to the high school classrooms, I'd have to start chewing out the boys for being bullies and calling each other ""fag"" all the time. By senior year, they were all reasonably human. 

I miss that part of my job, actually. I really liked the moment when I turned to a kid and said: ""You know what? That was totally mean and unwarranted, and I'm going to need you to apologize not just to the person you just insulted for no reason, but also to me because I just had to stop class to deal with you being a mean person. And after that, I think I'd like to hear you tell the class why you thought it was acceptable to use that sort of language in my classroom. And after that, let's talk about what sort of people think they're gaining social status by cutting other people down publicly. I'd like to hear what everyone else thinks about bullies.

True,bvman,,,"Dude,

With some experience in this situation I can give you some advice. Your wife will need to learn to build a life without you there, that will be one of the hardest parts. Instead of guiding her into a new relationship guide her into being a person who was better off with you in her life, if for only a brief period.

My significant other passed sometime back and that idiot(lovingly) made an online dating profile for me. Don't do stuff like that, instead help her alleviate as much hate as she will have for you. Trust me she will have some. She won't hate you, she will hate you for leaving her. Write her a letter, don't talk about yourself. This letter is not for you, that should be a whole another letter/issue altogether. Write her a letter about what makes her great/awesome/unique. Tell her the things that make her attractive and not only to you. Make her feel better about herself. 

Gush.

Give her the ability to have some closure and make sense of what is going on around her, so she can move forward. DO let her know that when she is ready, she should begin dating. DO let her know that you don't hold it against her. DO let her know she shouldn't feel guilty checking someone out. DO let her know that she deserves to find someone else that doesn't necessarily replace you, but rather compliments her. DO let her know that it is alright for her to have feelings for someone when she is ready.

Let her know that the hobbies you shared are okay for her to still enjoy without feeling remorse or guilt, let her know that it is okay for her to share them with others. Let her find peace with you when your gone. She will find her own way in the way world and in the matters of her heart. DON'T try and facilitate that for her. 

It is admirable, heartwarming and heartbreaking that even when your no longer here you want to help, care and provide for her. 

You can't completely, let her find her own way. Just help her along with making sense of you.

**tl;dr:** My fiance passed, learn my lesson. Let her know it's okay, don't try it your way. She has to do it herself.

EDIT:Grammar, punctuation and crap.

True,Archchancellor,,,"I really like these arguments, and - as a pinko, commie, liberal - I think they can be adapted to both sides of the aisle rather easily:

* **Liberal policies do not necessarily mean that we hate capitalism or the free market, or that we want to reignite the Bolshevik Revolution.**  Many of us simply come from a conflict-theory perspective, in which we see the ways in which those with lower socioeconomic status could be adversely affected by a more hands-off approach to capitalism.  I don't see capitalism as a bad economic model, just one that needs to be monitored carefully.

* **I totally agree with you on free speech.**  And I remember, when I was venomously critical of the Bush Administration, being told to move out of the country, kill myself, or suck a dick; as I was obviously a faggot.

* **Arrogance**  I love it when, as a 35 year old who's served in the military, been deployed to war 3 times, been married (currently getting divorced), endured economic hardship and joblessness, and is currently raising a child, being told that I just don't understand how the world works.

True,Kay_Elle,,first and last of her name,"I'm not past child-bearing age (but if I wanted kids, it would be getting urgent).

But let me offer a sightly different perspective. Life offers choices and some choices rule out other choices. There will always be things your regret.
I regret not having had the discipline to learn piano as a child, I regret not having spent more time with my grandmother when she was alive and mentally sound, I regret that I didn't manage to get the career I wanted.

The question is, is my life worse off for it? And what would have been the things you'd regret if you had achieved those things?

Had I been a child piano wonder, I might have regretted all the time I didn't spend playing outside. Had I spent more time with my grandmother, I'd have neglected other loved ones and missed out on some wonderful holidays. If I'd were a career woman I'd might regret my lack of time to pursue hobbies and volunteer work.

For some people it's a clear-cut choice, for other people it's more like a 60/40 sort of thing.

No one here can promise you you'll never regret not having kids - but that doesn't mean having kids is the right choice for you.
Alternatively, those who do have kids  - even though they might not admit it - will regret not having nights out or free time.

In our society, there's this ideal that we should be able to achieve anything and everything we want - but that's a lie.  Regret is a natural part of the human condition.

True,Sp0rx,,,"Ok, this is my moment baby. What was WRONG with unreal tournament 3 ? Lets shelve the fact that it was the entire set of nails and the coffin in the competitive scene. Thats aside. Unreal tournament 3 had significantly less maps then UT2k4. Unreal Tournament 3 had a fraction of the characters you could pick as your avatar. But not only that, the characters you could pick were completely unfamiliar. Barktooth - for example, is a CYBORG in UT2k4. In UT3 Barktooth is randomly a fat guy, how does that happen ? Fuck all if anyone knew or cared when they made this game.

The entire design philosophy for UT3 was "" GO BACK TO UT99 WITH BETTER GRAPHICS"" . Now fine you don't dodge jump because its too hard and you only play casual onslaught with friends or at lan. You don't strip a deathmatch shooter of its core movement scheme. You don't strip a deathmatch shooter of its core movement scheme and don't even bother to replace it with anything more or less intuitive. Jump boots ? WHY !? You pick up the jump boots on accident on shangrila because they put it right next to the mega health and spend 10 seconds slamming your head into the ceiling to make the jump boots go away. WHY ? Because they are practically USELESS and if you use them for anything other then getting the mega health you float in the air until someone shoots you until you die. 

The AI HOLY SHIT! I was an above average player ok, im not bragging this game is long dead thank you UT3. The godlike bots in ut2k4 were beatable in most situations if you implored basic competitive strategy. Yeah they had perfect aim with HITSCAN weapons * lightning gun or shock rifle * but it was still within reason for ""godlike"" . I remember trying to beat the  campaign * ill get to that piece of shit in a second * Co-op with buddies on godlike bots. We get to the CTF portion of the game and the bots are shooting us with a single bullet from the ENFORCER ACROSS THE ENTIRE MAP making us repeatedly drop the flag until the other bots would come by and run us the fuck over with the hellbender. it took us 4 hours to beat the ctf portion of the game. God forbid you try to use the HOVERBOARD in this instance. Heres how that fucking shit plays out. You get on the hoverboard, you take 2 damage from the weapon the computer spawned with from 600 miles away, your character proceeds to play the FALL OFF hoverboard animation then proceeds to play the GET BACK ON HOVERBOARD animation. YOU DONT HAVE A CHOICE, YOU ARE BACK ON THAT HOVERBOARD BABY! AFTER 15 SECONDS OF WATCHING THIS ASSHOLE CLIMB BACK ON THE HOVERBOARD YOU INSTANTLY FALL OFF ! ENFORCER BULLET FROM HEAVEN ! YAY! 

So, the characters are near completely unfaithful to the series. The map list if complete garbage save for deck 16 IF ONLY FOR NOSTALGIA SAKE DONT EVEN SAY THATS A GOOD MAP and is also completely unfaithful to the series. The weapons are exactly the fucking same save for the fact their damage and fire speed is completely unintuitively retweeked for no fucking reason. Theres no movement scheme/ the game plays slower and feels like a clunky ut99 with better graphics... hmmm.. oh right. 

THE CAMPAIGN. Holy fuck does the campaign make no sense. Say what you want about UT never being about the story, guess what the story isnt about ? THE TOURNAMENT. You don't even fight in the liandri tournment the game is named after. Not at all. Instead you follow the most shallow and ridiculously bro dude characters through a ""war"" with ""respawners"" and ""FLaG""'s in a story that tries to add logic to the idea of being able to die repeatedly over and over again while fighting some bitch whos the queen of a mysterious black ooze that does fuck all. Yeah you know what an epic foundational story premise for a game would be ... i don't know.. how about a FUTURISTIC GLADIATORIAL DEATHMATCH TOURNAMENT WHERE YOU DRAFT A TEAM FROM A POOL OF UNIQUE CHARACTERS !? NO !? WELL THEN FUCK YOU !

Gamespy servers! Do i need to explain this one? You went from dedicated servers with a consistent player base at 200,000+ players online at any given time in ut2k4 to gamespy servers with barely anyone playing because the net code was ATROCIOUS. I remember not being able to play outside of us east over 50 ping because of packet loss. If i tried to play CHICAGO i would have too much packet loss, I LIVE IN CONNECTICUT.
This game made me livid. Everything about it sucked. The graphics ? Everything looks like its spliced with a glazed fucking donut. Why is everything so shiny ? Oh right because UE3. Oh and the game scaled HORRIBLY at release on older systems. I had ABOVE minimum system specs and i was getting 10 fps in MOST parts of the game. What the fuck?

True,Yosoff,,,"* **The hatred.**  Far too many Liberals hate Conservatives as people.  Simply mention a Conservative position and they attack you personally.  Immigration, Voter ID, food stamps, taxes, DoMA, Israel, education, jobs = Racist, elderly-hating, poor-hating, rich loving, homophobic, islamaphobic, religious nutjob, corporate pawn.  In my opinion, when you accuse people of things like that without basis, you're not a good person.

* **The assumption that if you oppose the method of achieving a goal that you oppose the goal itself.**  If we say; ""Hey, I don't think this is the way to fix health care...""  The most common reply is; ""You just hate poor people and want them to die in the street!""  That's ridiculous, of course we want to help the poor, of course we want to improve health care, we share many of the same goals we simply have different approaches.

* **The complete misunderstanding of Conservative positions with no honest attempt to learn about the positions.**  95% of Liberals cannot accurately articulate any Conservative positions and the logic behind the position.  Guess what?  There are reasons we have the positions we have, you might even agree with them, and if you fully understood them it would at least make finding common ground a lot easier.  We generally know the Liberal positions and the reasons for the Liberal positions, they are unavoidable.

* **The spending.**  The country can't afford it, spending has to be stopped.  It's a ticking time-bomb that is going to make this recession look like the good ol' days.  It's not fair to our kids and grandkids, and yes, we actually *do* care about that.  We know that Bush also spent too much in his last two years, there's a reason his popularity fell to 25%, we hated it when he did it too.

* **The judging of laws by the intent of the law instead of the real world impact of the law.**  Banning ""assault weapons"" will do nothing to stop gun violence.  Banning large soda containers will not solve the obesity problem.  Making people dependent on Government will not help them move up into the middle class.  Throwing more money at existing programs will not solve the education problems in poor neighborhoods.  Attacking corporations will not create jobs.

Skeeball is hard to find where I live and the machines are often located in these family fun center type places. So there I am with a pile of quarters in front of me, in the zone, nailing those tricky 100 point shots over and over, the machine jettisoning its ticket stash like a pink waterfall of pure win. After I'm done robbing the skeeball machines, I gather up my winnings and scan the place. 

Sure enough, there seems to always a little kid in there with a single mom who's just trying to show him some inexpensive fun. I play some video games until he's playing a ticket-awarding game and drop my stash near the slot and say ""Oh wow, you're really good at this! Look how much you're winning!"" Mom gives a weary smile of thanks, the kid is super proud and I walk out of there feeling like a bad ass. As a guy without kids, this kind of stuff is great until I can have one of my own.

True,[deleted],,,"Eh, the reality is far different.  Keep in mind that was bought from Spain during the mid 90's East Asia boom, you know, when every East Asian country was spending money like idiots.  

The Thai's carrier is a Spanish designed aircraft carrier that is based around the Harrier jet and helicopters.  It cannot support traditional carrier based aircraft.  It is not a traditionally designed carrier, it was meant almost as  a hybrid in a way.  

Ends up VTOL aircraft are expensive and difficult to maintain, way more than what Thailand is willing to pay (there's a reason Spain sold it off in the first place).  So it's really just a helicopter carrier and is only used intermittently as a show of force or for disaster relief.

For all intents and purposes, they might as well not have one at all because it's about as effective as a destroyer with a helipad.  But, with a missile target the size of a mountain.  If push came to shove China would sink it in about 30 seconds.  

Not to mention aircraft carriers need a large support fleet which Thailand lacks.  AEGIS defense is what keeps a carrier group alive, without that you might as well have some PT boats.  Carriers are a powerful weapon, but only if they stay afloat.  If they don't have the support they need, they're just an expensive artificial reef.  

tl;dr Thailand signed Lebron or Jordan when they really needed Pippin or Rodman.  A team is a team, one man/machine/object cannot make up for a general lack of firepower and support.  The money could have been better spent on smaller more cost efficient littoral fleets, especially given that China has been going hard in the paint recently.  

Size Comparison of ""Normal"" sized supercarrier: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Chakri_Naruebet-Kitty_Hawk_size.JPEG

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTMS_Chakri_Naruebet

EDIT:

Okay for clarification, there's a few points that need clearing up.  Also thanks for Reddit gold, whomever you are.  

First off, the Thai navy did not buy the carrier to *directly* compete with China or larger littoral navies, because it's a hybrid carrier it's more for maritime defense and more domestic issues type of craft.  It's more in line with [amphibious assault ships](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasp_class_amphibious_assault_ship) or [Moskva class ships](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moskva_class_helicopter_carrier).

That being said, the inability to launch aircraft from it is still a big deal and it was a huge waste of money in hindsight.  My feelings are that the Thai navy bought it as a flagship of sorts, as a way to project force over internal insurgencies.  It's also a great example of how unrealistic East Asian fiscal policy was at that time, just a few years later the defense budget was cut by 50% and put it in port for quite awhile.  Also without the harriers it's just a glorified helicopter pad.  Nor does it have the support it needs in terms of AA (only 3 AA mount points..).  It was clearly designed to have large fleet support, which is not something Thailand is currently capable of, in my opinion.   

Secondly, the picture of comparison isn't even using the largest of US carriers, that's the decommissioned USS Kitty Hawk.  Not even nimitz class.  As carriers go, it's on the small side. 

Also as people point out, Michael Jordan was a basketball god.  This ship is not of similar calibre in its respective area(s).  Should have used a football analogy.

True,legilimens_,,,"I came to college a quarter late, so everyone that was there before me were already really good friends. So I started talking to some of them and we hit it off pretty well. Specifically, one particular girl and guy were always really nice to me, so I thought that we were on the fast-track to becoming friends. Eventually, I began to develop a crush on the guy and I asked my roommate, who was really good friends with all of them, if they could come hang out in our room because I wanted to spend some more time with the guy. She acted all funny and then said, ""I'll go ask,"" went downstairs to talk to them, and then came home alone four hours later.

Turns out, not only was the guy not interested in me, but none of the people I had been hanging out with were actually interested in being my friends. Apparently, there was a bet going on that I didn't know about. They had asked me if I was lesbian or bisexual in the beginning, and I said that I was straight but none of them believed me. So, they hatched a plan to make that one girl and one guy flirt with me until I showed interest in one or the other. 

The boy won. They stopped talking to me. And I'm still straight, thank you very much.

So many people, and so many men, seem to see me as a trophy. They only want to sleep with me or have people see them with me. It gets depressing to find out time and time again that people don't care for *you* but care for how you look. 

It's difficult to make real friends. Other girls are weirdly competitive or feel insecure around you. Guys are trying to get in your pants.

When you get to know someone who seems to actually care for you, you don't want to change that relationship at all because you're so grateful for the friendship. It takes a lot of time to develop a deep relationship (here meaning friendship) with someone. Dating people leads to breakups or arguments or at least some difficulties, and you could lose one of the only ""real"" friends you have. (I'd rather have a good friend forever than a good boyfriend for a couple of years.) 

When you're single and that real friend asks you out, your mind wanders to the thought that maybe they were only friends with you to bide their time until they could date you, even if it's not true. Maybe they're just like everyone else, looking for sex or arm candy. Maybe they were being the ""nice guy"", [collecting stamps on their kindness card until they have enough for sex](http://imgur.com/EZGGiEl). You don't want to talk to them anymore because they're just one more person who couldn't just let you be, one more person for whom friendship, real friendship built on mutual appreciation, trust, respect and silliness, wasn't enough.

I acknowledge this is flawed thinking, but it's how I felt in the same situation.

Edit: This was mostly an issue in my teens-early twenties. I've since learned how to be more straightforward and communicative, and problems only arise when the people in my life aren't also straightforward about their intentions. In no way do I intend to lead people on- I'm just writing this so OP (and others) can understand the mindset of girls who have reacted this way.

It's like witnessing a crime and ignoring it, you didn't pull the trigger but you didn't do anything to stop it either. I think that's what OP was originally talking about. 

As for the rest of it, rejecting someone because you do not want to be with them should never make you feel guilty.

True,flawofhumanity,,,"^ This, as a public relations specialist, this. 

Sales copy is huge -- there's a reason my sales copy starts at $500 (this would be like a call to action and maybe a blurb or two, not much at all) and goes up from there. It's because I can show case studies showing an increase of profit (not revenue) in the thousands or even the tens of thousands (not typical, very improbable, don't expect it, I don't know how, I got lucky and their sales copy sucked) in the first 30 to 60 days, depending on the study. 

A/B testing is important. I do a comprehensive market analysis and demographic study on each website before, during and after the case study. These are recorded and I use it to see which tactics work best for different audiences. 

The thing is you won't ever have two places with the same audience. Some may overlap about 90 percent, but you have to optimize for that exact audience. Plus, what works at one website may not work at others -- different things like color scheme, layout, product, time when they get the most traffic, search ranking, etc. all matter. Everything matters. Even if you think it doesn't, it does. 

/u/turnthismotherout said incentives were good, and I agree, but I want to state the obvious and say that your audience and the type of incentive is absolutely crucial; giving away free software with a knitting newsletter won't work, and neither will giving execs ""FREE!!!!!!"" stuff. Make your newsletter useful to your audience, and they will sign up. Also, you don't always have to do the advertising; don't advertise a useful piece, then release an article on something tangentially related a few days later. Your awesome and loyal customers will want to share their newly learned information (or at least discuss it) and they'll realize they missed out all on their own. 

Market research, market research, market research for your questions. Do it. Research your market, write down everything. Every. Single. Statistic. You don't know when you will need it. Analyze competitor's websites. Analyze free research. Buy other people's research. Analyze Facebook Like pages. Analyze Pinterest pages. Analyze Twitter hashtags. 

Use that to learn your demographic. Once you have a pretty good idea, go back to your research and see which audiences had the best things to say (I said everything) and the worst things to say (everything) Usually, it gets repetitive enough that I assign a number value for each one in a spreadsheet. Using a function, you should be able to deduce who within your target demographic will enjoy and promote your product and who might buy it but won't like it.

Now that you have that, to the Census bureau! Research your demographic to find how many of them there are. Map them out and see what they've got going on. Now,  start looking at financial statements of competitors and find out how many annual customers they have. Depending on the prevalence of brand loyalty, your product's qualities, messaging and prices, you should be able to come up with an idea of where your competitive advantage is. I have spreadsheets and functions that I use to assign a numerical value to each of those traits on the client's website, competitor's websites and in reviews/ratings/discussion from consumers. The numerical value is decided based on the visibility/importance of the feature on the competitors page and mine (1-5 for these) and how often it appears in good reviews/bad reviews by consumers (-1 for 1-2, neutral for 3 and 4-5 +1). 

So, now you've got the following: your entire demographic, your target audience within that demographic, what they like and what they don't like (and for those that pay me really well, what they want). Based on that, you do some more market analysis/research so you can forecast your market share. At this point, you know all of the above + a approximate guesstimate of how much you can gain through advertising and when to quit advertising and move on for maximum revenue. 

Sorry for any grammatical errors/rambling; I thought I'd get this out real quick so people can take what they want from it. I wouldn't try and do all of this out of the gates -- it's not that easy. Also, no I can't give much more information than that because that's how I make all my money!

EDIT: Thought I would get this out there before anyone said it -- yes, the methodology is not totally sound. In fact, it's far from it. I can't eliminate every variable and account for every possible human reaction for anyone, let alone all of my clients. It's close enough that it works for me.

True,diorromance,,,"You don't need to settle on a champion at all. Jungling is a role, not a champion.

While I don't know what specifically you could improve on, here are some general tips that all lower level junglers should keep in mind:

* Don't spend too much time forcing a gank. If there's nothing to be had in a few seconds, back out and farm your jungle or go elsewhere.
* Be creative with your ganks. There are multiple paths to gank every lane, so mix it up a bit to keep your opponents guessing.
* Understand what lanes have greater potential for ganks and which lanes may be a lose cause; does the lane have good cc? does it have good damage? how likely is the enemy to escape without burning a summoner?
* Camp a lane you have had success with. This demoralizes the opponent as well as boosts your own team's morale.
* Burning Flash already constitutes a successful gank. You have given your laner a significant advantage. Consider coming back to this lane within the next 5 minutes.
* Gank on your own terms, don't be compelled to gank for a losing lane if you don't think any good will come of it. That 0-4 Jax is whining top lane? Ignore him and focus on ganking mid or bot, counter jungling, and securing objectives. Chances are, you'll both die if you go gank for him.
* Purchase a ward upon every back and ward where necessary. This is typically around enemy wraiths or in top river.
* Don't attempt dragon without a pink ward or a significant team advantage.
* Be mindful of objective timers. Buffs spawn every 5 minutes, Dragon spawns every 6, Baron spawns every 7.

True,whatwouldscoobydo,,,"&gt;So, Reddit, is there any moving on from this? 

Yes. I was severely abused, trapped (what felt like trapped) living in a man's house and raped for many months in college. We're talking a sadistic narcissistic guy who physically and sexually harmed me under the guise of BDSM and brainwashed me to believe things I, to this day, still find difficult to wrap my head around. I used to not be able to have sex without having vicious panic attacks or dissociative spells that followed (and split personalities, but surprisingly, they were the easiest and even enjoyable to manage). It's been three years, and my fiance and I can have sex with nearly no problem now. My self-esteem and world view have healed with a lot of work and a good support system. There is always room and hope for healing from trauma, so please don't think it is out of your reach.

&gt;Every time we have sex, whatever position we're in, I start feeling used. It's nothing he's doing, he's gentle when I want him to be, rough when I don't, you know, whatever. It doesn't matter if I'm on top, or he is. If it's doggy, or missionary, I just start feeling like I'm being raped and I KNOW I'm not. I get to the point where I'm so emotional about it that I'm crying and can't breathe. He doesn't know what to do.

Alright. A few things. My fiance, if I start freaking out, will stop everything. He will stop, reassure me, and calm me down. When you start to feel used, *stop him*. It may not be anything he is doing, but continuing without dealing with your emotions will only reinforce your trauma. Have him stop, and be loving to you. Have him talk to you. If you are still upset, stop everything altogether. This sounds frustrating, but you have to let that go.

&gt; I get to the point where I'm so emotional about it that I'm crying and can't breathe. He doesn't know what to do.

Elaborating here. You're getting to the point of panic. What you can have him do is this: stop, sit next to you, and talk you down. My mate does a series of questions: ""Do you know where you are?"" (sometimes I would not) ""Who are you with?"" ""Do you know that I love you?"" ""What do you feel?"" etc. Generally, if I felt used or upset, we would just curl up and cuddle until I felt better. And generally, this act would make me comfortable enough to initiate sexy things again.


&gt;I was in therapy, but my insurance ran out and I can't afford $200 sessions.

There are places that are cheaper than this, but I understand your concerns. When I couldn't afford therapy, I did research, and it helped. I recommend this book called [Healing from Trauma](http://www.amazon.com/Healing-Trauma-Survivors-Understanding-Reclaiming/dp/1600940617/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1363120098&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=healing+from+trauma) - It's easy to understand and a very good book. If you'd like more, I'd be happy to list off a bunch.

&gt;Just really... confused. I don't know why this is just now resurfacing, and why it took so long for me to feel this way.

Trauma is an interesting thing- it's also my field of study. Sometimes things will stay latent until you are at a ""better"" time in your life- your brain thinks you're more able to handle the trauma, so it re-awakens. Alternately, something could have reminded you of the trauma, and it's just become circular thought in your mind- meaning it popped up and now it's a familiar thought again. And that is OKAY, it's the process of healing. I had amazing sex with my fiance before a LOT resurfaced, and we had to start all over. But it was ok, he held my hand the whole way, and we both put forth a lot of effort to make it work, and to make me feel loved.


&gt;We've talked about the rape, he's an amazing guy and has just done everything he possibly could for me. I really see myself marrying this guy, but lately... sex has just been next to impossible for me.

I really have been in this exact situation. But my fiance and I got through it. It was difficult at times, but do-able. We talked about it a lot (less so now that things are better, but it still comes up obviously, and I have bad days, still. haha.) You may just have to take a break from sex for a bit. One strategy that helped me- I was feeling used when I wasn't the one initiating. I felt pressure and expectation of sex even when there was none. So we made a no-sex pact. We simply wouldn't have sex unless I was sure I wanted it. And doing this actually increased my sex drive and the number of times we had sex, because that pressure and anxiety was removed. So that may be something to consider. Really sit down and talk with him about it, and try to be loving to yourself. None of this is your fault, it's a normal response from your mind/brain/body because of your trauma. 


If you have any other questions or what not, I'd be more than happy to help you out. /internet love.

Edit: Also, you're not damaged. The way my fiance puts it is this: ""sometimes when you break something, you just change it"". And I felt like I was broken by my abuser, but really, he just changed me. I'm still alive, and better yet, I've managed to be happier than I ever thought possible. And because of my ""changed"" perspective, I don't take for granted how amazing my fiance is to me, and I'm a much more self-aware and healthy human being. So in my many ways, we can change in very good ways because of our trauma. So try to look at it that way. :)

**Overview:**
One of the best support-tank junglers, great for any kind of aoe team comps (examples: orianna, mf etc). Good clear speed, decent ganking power, great level 6+ ganks, consistent damage and good late game.

**Pros:**

* Ulti utility is godlike.
* Very good ganks after 6 (his ganks before 6 are mostly skill reliant revolving around Q).
* Great tank with consistent damage.
* Can fit into most teams. 
* Great initiator.

**Cons:**

* Very blue reliant in the early game (red starts possible but you *need* the first blue).
* Susceptible to invades early (can't 1v1 most junglers early, lv 1-5).

___
[](/hecarim)Hecarim

**Overview:** One of the strongest s3 junglers. Strong tank, really strong damage. Fast clear, good ganking and snowballing potential.

**Pros:** 

* Fast clear with a strong level 3/4 gank.
* Very good scaling potential (both in damage and tankiness).
* High mobility allows him to cover great distances and countergank easier (not so significant in the grand scheme of things).
* Great snowballing, if you get ahead you become almost as strong if not stronger than solo laners.
* Can start either red or blue, blue significantly increases his clearing speed.

**Cons:**

* Not tanky in the early game (rephrase: needs item for both damage and tankiness).
* Requires some getting used to (especially ulti and learning not to drop his Q stacks between camps).
* Can be 1v1'd in the jungle early/can be ambushed at his 2nd buff.
* I feel he does better with more mid-late game focused teams (not so important). 

___
[](/jarvaniv)Jarvan IV

**Overview:** Good control jungler, can invade. Good clear times, good ganking power(skill reliant, landing combo). Team utility (armor aura/AS aura with E, utility ulti).

**Pros:**

* Passive armor is good vs AD heavy teams.
* His combo allows him to jump over walls, potentially allowing him to jump over wards unseen (not so important tbh).
* High cc, almost guaranteed kills if summoners (flash mainly) is down. Special case: Great vs Olaf (or at least the good olafs that go ghost/ignite).
* Can fit into most teams.

**Cons:**

* Can't really solo tank, someone else needs to assist in frontline.
* Mechanically intensive.
* Middle of the ground, not the strongest offensive junglers and not the one with the best scaling (other people gank better, other people scale better, he does half and half. This can be either good or terrible).

___
[](/leesin)Lee Sin

**Overview:** Very strong early game, can fight almost anyone in the jungle early, good clear speed, great buff control (dragon-baron-buffs due to QQSmite combo doing a huge amount of burst). Great ganks, very mobile. Not so good lategame, has to transition into a frontline/bruiser role.

**Pros:**

* In my opinion, the best champion to invade with.
* Highly mobile with a lot of damage = Great ganks.
* Good objective control/stealing potential.
* High base damages allow him to build tanky and still be a threat.
* Great pick for most teams.

**Cons:**

* Late game suffers (being melee he needs to build tanky or is very squishy, while building tankny his damage and utility are mediocre).
* If he falls behind in the early game catching back up is really hard.
* Not a very good tank, can't be the only tank in the team.
* Skillshot reliant, hard to play well in general.

___
[](/maokai)Maokai

**Overview:** Anti-aoe tank. Decent clear speeds, extremely good ganks if lanes have enough damage (his damage is mediocre but he has huge cc), amazing lategame tank.

**Pros:**

* Strong ganks.
* Strong lategame.


**Cons:**

* Very blue reliant.
* Jungle income not enough by itself to make him the great tank he can be (unless game drag on too long/he gets fed).
* His clearing speed is rather slow after the first clear mainly because his single target damage is lacking (he was favored in s2 because he has decent aoe).
* If he falls behind, he becomes a cc bot.
* Weak 1v1 duelist in the jungle, vulnerable early.

___
[](/nocturne)Nocturne

**Overview:** High snowball potential, strong if he gets ahead, borderline useless when he falls behind. High damage in the mid-late game. Good clear speed, good ganks (esp after 6). Good utility and teamfighting.

**Pros:**

* Good clear speed.
* Great ganks (even pre 6), offering both cc and damage (fear's randomness is slightly annoying sometimes).
* Great lategame potential.
* Can invade and duel almost anyone in the jungle.
* Ult can be very disruptive and gives him the ability to dive the backline.

**Cons:**

* Item reliant.
* If he falls behind he is almost completely useless.
* Almost all his damage is AD so team needs to have enough AP damage to prevent armor stacking.
* Jungle doesn't provide enough gold alone, needs to be successful in ganks to reach full potential.

___
[](/rengar)Rengar

**Overview:** Good clear, good damage, some tanking ability, can stealth gank (and lanegank like a boss). Strong lategame, teamfighting. Can fit almost any team.

**Pros:**

* Great ganks (good damage, cc and able to jump on people).
* Good clear times.
* Good lategame (either tank or damage).
* Can jump on backline easily.
* He can fight some people in the jungle.

**Cons:**

* Not particularly good in anything, does a bit of everything.
* If he builds tanky then his dmg is pretty low and vice versa.
* Requires some success in order to get going, item reliant.

___
[](/shaco)Shaco

**Overview:** Very very early game focused jungler, if unsuccessful he can only split push. Bad teamfighting, almost no utility. Godlike ganks, NEEDS to snowball early, not himself but the rest of the TEAM.

**Pros:**

* Amazing early ganks.
* Very fast double buff clear time, relatively safe (almost full hp)
* Godlike if mastered, his kit allows you to pull insane stuff. 
* Unique jungle path and style.

**Cons:**

* His first clear can be stopped by activating his boxes and running away.
* Not very strong duelist when he doesn't have double buffs.
* If he doesn't snowball his team enough to overcome his bad lategame he becomes a liability for the team.
* Hard to place him in a team, if he tries to tank he is not a threat and has no real cc.

___
[](/shen)Shen

**Overview:** Slow clear, picked for ulti utility, good lategame if allowed to split push (and farm up).

**Pros:** 

* Great ulti.
* Can scale great into lategame if he gets a bit of free farming/split pushing time.
* Global pressure with ulti.

**Cons:**

* Weak in the jungle (can't 1v1 almost anyone).
* Mediocre objective control.
* Needs a lot of time and cs to get into a position to tank/split successfully.
* Can fall behind easily and coming back from a bad early is almost impossible.

___
[](/vi)Vi

**Overview:** Fast clear, good ganks, good teamdfighting/lategame. Can fit into most teams. A lot of utility with supression ulti.

**Pros:** 

* High damage ganks with some cc (lots of cc after 6).
* Very fast clear time, safe (high hp).
* Can invade/duel very good in the jungle.
* Can build tanky and still be relevant.

**Cons:**

* Somewhat item reliant.
* Can't solo tank.
* Usually banned.

___
[](/xinzhao)Xin Zhao

**Overview:** Great ganks, fast/safe clear, fits most teams, bruiser lategame. Mediocre team utility, fits almost any team.

**Pros:**

* Amazing duelist in the jungle.
* Very strong and easy to execute ganks.
* Can fit almost any team, best with teams that compliment his great early game.
* Can initiate pretty well.
* Can invade very good.

**Cons:**

* Easy to play but hard to master the finer points of hit kit (example: maximize effectiveness with his ult's knockback part). This can be turned into a Pro with some experience.

True,ratedgforgenitals,,,"Thank you very much! I'm happy to help, really. I didn't tell anyone for two reasons. One, I didn't want anyone to hate him. I was still blindly in love with him even after what he did to me. Like I said, I was young. Secondly, he was a much older boyfriend. Everyone told me to break it off with him, but I was in love and stupidly thought I knew better. When my parents found out we were romantically involved, they banned me from seeing him. 

I was the one who invited him over while my parents were out. I just wanted to see him. That's when it happened. It was in my bed. I was too disgusted to sleep in it about a month afterward. I thought my parents would be angry with me. They told me to break it off and I didn't listen. I blamed myself because I was the one who stayed with him. I was the one to bring him into my home. That haunted me for so many years, and still does. For some perspective, I was 13, he was 18. It'll be five years since the rape on June 28th. Reminding myself that he was the one who betrayed me helps me cope. But I still do blame myself sometimes. Many rape victims blame themselves because the loss of control is terrifying. There's something comforting in knowing you can somehow prevent it - even though that's just not true. It's just scary to think that it can happen anywhere at any time.

True,MeganMonkies90,,,"Definitely! I have actually held on to a particular quote about this: 

""Maybe your first love is the one that sticks with you because it's the only person who will ever receive all of you. After that, you learn better. But, most of all, no matter what, a piece of you forever remains left behind in the heart of the one you loved-- a piece no future lover could ever get, no matter what. That piece holds innocence, the belief that love really can last forever. It holds friendship and pain, trial and error, that one kiss you'll never forget, and that night under the stars you can never get back. It holds youth and everything you thought love would be, everything that was proven wrong""

There's nothing wrong with loving someone from your past. I will always have a special place in my heart for my first ""love"" even though I'm in an amazing, happy relationship. What's dangerous, however, is too look back and think ""Well I wish my husband would have been more X like Johnny was"" or ""Johnny was always so X, why doesn't my husband do that""? Your exes and past lovers had specific roles to play in your life, they served their purpose. They prepared you for the relationship you're in now. 

If you are pining over someone in particular, why don't you give them a call! I'm sure they are married with children like you are, but that doesn't mean you have to lose touch forever. Catch up and talk about the good old days, and how young/stupid/funny/etc you were. Talk about your kids and your spouses and how your lives are now. I loved catching up with my exes because, like I said, they did have a special place in your life. They shouldn't be scrubbed out forever!

**Q1:** The popular explanation for the cause of rape is that rape is about power; rather than sex or attraction or anything else. In The Blank Slate you wrote:

&gt;I believe that the rape-is-not-about-sex doctrine will go down in history as an example of extraordinary popular delusions and the madness of crowds. It is preposterous on the face of it, does not deserve its sanctity, is contradicted by a mass of evidence, and is getting in the way of the only morally relevant goal surrounding rape, the effort to stamp it out.

From what I've read of behaviour studies - the causes of behaviour are very complex and there are zero  behaviours except for rape that are explained by one single cause. Why is rape pretty much the **only** behaviour out there for which academics will accept only **one** single explanation? How does a delusion spread among people who should be immune to them?

**Q2:** Some differences in IQ scores between males and females have been shown to exist; including in spatial ability and math ability. The differences appear 1) in the mean and 2) in the variance of the scores. Do you think this explains **part** of the difference between the proportions of men and women in STEM degrees and related occupations? If so, how much do you think it explains?

&gt;The proportions of girls and boys in each band were significantly different, 2(15) = 147.9, P &lt; .001.  this is not just a reflection of different numbers of boys and girls in the population: girls represent 49.6%, and boys 50.4%, of the participants providing these data. In the IQ bands that cover the range 90 to &lt; 115, girls are found in slight excess, a difference of about 2%. **At the extremes, boys are over-represented. In the IQ band from 50 to &lt; 60 boys make up 58.6% of the population, a gender gap of 17.2%. In the IQ band 130 to &lt; 140 boys make up 57.7% of the population, a gender gap of 15.4%.** The gradation between the extremes appears regular: as the population moves away from the extremes the sex difference in proportions steadily lessens with, eventually, a slight excess of girls in the average score range.

**Q3:** What do you think is the likelihood of in the future discovering intelligence differences between population groups using neurological comparisons and genetic comparisons rather than by just comparing IQ scores? Academics today seem to dismiss the idea as impossible. But is the idea that groups can evolve in very different environments and *not* end up with different intelligence levels realistic? I've read that more than half of genes are expressed in the brain.

----

**EDIT: (I put all these in after SP answered the questions) - Background &amp; sources:** Going back decades in the literature, many studies have shown that Jews of European descent (Ashkenazi Jews) have a higher than average IQ of 112-115 and higher than average scores on verbal and math tests. In 2005 Gregory Cochran, James Hardy and Henry Harpending published a paper which suggested that Jews of European descent have higher IQs due to them posessing genes that in homozygotes lead to diseases (that Jews have at a higher frequency than other groups like Tay-Sachs, Gaucher's and some others) but in heterozygotes lead to higher intelligence (maybe an example of [Heterozygote advantage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterozygote_advantage)). They hypothesize that these genes were selected for because Jews in Europe over the Middle Ages were limited to cognitively demanding jobs like trade and finance, and people successful in these jobs had more children. 


**Quote from The 10,000 Year Explosion by Gregory Cochran and Henry Harpending:**

&gt;Jewish intellectual prominence is striking. As we have said, Ashkenazi Jews are vastly overrepresented in science. Their numbers among prominent scientists are roughly ten times
greater than you’d expect from their share of the population in the United States and Europe. Over the past two generations  they have won more than a quarter of all Nobel science prizes, although they make up less than one-six-hundredth of the world’s population. Although they represent less than 3 percent of the U.S. population, they won 27 percent of the U.S. Nobel Prizes in science during that period and 25 percent of the A. M. Turing Awards (given annually by the Association for Computing Machinery). 

&gt;Ashkenazi Jews account for half of twentieth-century world chess champions. American Jews are also overrepresented in other areas, such as business (where they account for about a fifth of CEOs) and academia (where they make up about 22 percent of Ivy League students). Although these statistics show intelligence in a broad range of disciplines, we emphasize measures of scientific and mathematical achievement in our present argument because we believe they are more objective measures than the others. Everyone agrees about what constitutes important discoveries in science and mathematics, whereas there are no comparable objective criteria to evaluate accomplishments in art and literature.Was Freudian theory, for example, a landmark achievement in psychology or the equivalent of the pet rock, a silly passing fad? We don’t know (although we do have a strong suspicion), and we have no objective way of finding the answer.

This is just one possible example of a group intelligence difference. It can be further explored with more studies. This shouldn't be used for any racist or hateful purposes.

True,petemate,,Analog electronics,"Sorry, but it ts not completely correct. You need to look at the circuit for your converter. It is a boost converter. It works by connecting one side of an inductor to the input voltage(your battery), and the other side of the inductor to either ground or a capacitor(in practice, it is connected to a capacitor through a diode, but thats not that important in the principal operation). Look at figure 2 on the [wiki page for a boost converter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boost_converter) to see what im saying. you can see, that when the switch is closed, current run straight through the inductor and then back out. The important thing to see here, is that, due to the nature of the inductor, the current will increase as long as the switch is closed. The slope of the increasing current is related to the inductance of the inductor. The important thing about an inductor is that the current through it can't just stop, like if you turned off a switch. Thus, when you open the switch, the current starts decreasing again. This can be seen on the bottom plot in figure 3. That current must go through the diode and into the capacitor. In order for the inductor to keep the current flowing(its still flowing, its just decreasing), it must reverse the voltage drop across it, to prevent it from changing. This is the boost function, because it results in the voltage drop across the inductor being added to the input voltage. 

The current that then pushes through the diode, goes into the capacitor and into the load. Since the current charges the capacitor, its voltage increases a little bit. When the switch then closes again, current stops going through, and the charge deposited in the inductor, will have to supply the load. This results in the capacitor voltage decreases a little bit. Now, you can imagine that with a big capacitor, the voltage doesn't change that much, because it takes a lot of charge to change the voltage. But with a small capacitor, it takes only a little charge. You would like to use a capacitor that is as small as possible, because of price and so on, but also because of the bandwidth of the controller. I'll get to that.

This is essentially the filtering function of a capacitor in a boost converter. 

Now, if the load suddenly wants more current, the capacitor will have to supply more current, when the switch is on, and no current is being thrown into the capacitor. This means that the capacitor voltage drops more, because more charge is being removed, and that charge isn't put back into the capacitor, when the switch is open. The control system that measures the output voltage can then see that the voltage drops, and tells the switch to be closed more, so that the inductor charges more current, and is able to dump more current into the capacitor. But this can't be done instantaneously. It takes some time for the control system to react to the change in voltage, and that is why you see the voltage drop. You would of course like the voltage drop to be as small as possible, because you want a stable output voltage regardless of the load conditions. This means that you could use a very big capacitor, because, like i mentioned before, the voltage doesn't change much with big capacitors. But this also means that the converter is less able to put current into the capacitor, to fight any voltage changes, and the result is that it takes longer to charge a big capacitor than a small capacitor. So the converter is not able to control the output as well with a big capacitor, as it is with a small capacitor. This means that you need to carefully consider load conditions and converter specifications, when you have to select the output capacitor. 

Another fact is that a big capacitor on the output will reduce the speed of the control system. A bigger capacitor will result in a lower bandwidth of the control system, meaning that it is slower to deal with fast changes in the output voltage. This is sort of intuitive, considering the fact that a big capacitor takes longer to charge/discharge. But another issue is a bit more technical, and that is the fact that a big capacitor changes the phase-response of the control system. In a control system, you must never have a phase of 180 degrees, because, well that is bad(its a longer explanation). You measure the stability of a control system by its phase-margin, which is a number indicating how far from 180 degrees the phase is, at a certain point. By lowering the bandwidth/by adding a larger capacitor, you decrease the phase margin, making the system less stable. In practice, this means that the control system will measure the output voltage and see that it is not right, and then change the opening/closing time of the switch, in order to change the output voltage. If the system is very stable, the control system can just say ""change the on/off time to this"", and then the output voltage will be spot-on. But in a less stable system, which happens when you add more capacitance, the control system is unable to precisely say what to set the on/off time at. It will guess a little higher or a little lower each time, meaning that the output voltage will be a little higher or a little lower each time. This new output voltage is then picked up by the control system once again, and it sees that the voltage is still wrong, and it tries to change it again. The end-result is that the output voltage will not hit the right value, but wobble around the right value, which is called oscillation. Some oscilation is accepted because it is an necessary evil if you want a quick control-system, but too much oscillation will cause a long settling time, which means that it takes a long time to settle on the correct output voltage. Even more oscillation menas that you have an unstable system, which is dangerous and can result in wild and unpredictable changes to the output voltage. For obvious reaosns, this is bad. The control system then needs to be designed to match the selected output capacitance, which needs to be selected to match the load conditions. 

In your case, the control system is fixed, and you need to be careful when selecting your capacitance, due to the explanations above.

That was a long post, sorry about that. 

Also, maybe i should have written this at the beginning, but a transient is just a non-periodic change of a signal. Such as the change on the output voltage when a load-change appears.

True,jonahe,,,"First of all: great to see you here! 

In your book ""The Better Angels of Our Nature"" you mention Peter Singers idea of the ""expanding circle"" (of moral concern) and I've also seen you write somewhat positively about Singers view that we, ultimately, can't justify keeping non-human animals outside of this circle. 

When it comes to pets, we already include *them* to a large extent, but so called farm animals ([who greatly outnumber our pets](http://www.adaptt.org/killcounter.html)) are not given nearly the same status (legally or morally). 

So what I'm asking is this: 

* To what extent do you agree with Singers view that this is a serious problem?

* Does this perhaps even constitute an example of one area where we've actually become *more* violent? (Here I'm thinking of the massive scale of factory farms where billions of animals arguably are treated more like commodities than sentient beings.) 

* Do you (in principal, if not in action) support Singers way of combating said problem? (Changing our consumption to only eating vegetarian/vegan food?)

**Q1**:
&gt; The popular explanation for the cause of rape is that rape is about power; rather than sex or attraction or anything else. In The Blank Slate you wrote:

&gt; &gt;I believe that the rape-is-not-about-sex doctrine will go down in history as an example of extraordinary popular delusions and the madness of crowds. It is preposterous on the face of it, does not deserve its sanctity, is contradicted by a mass of evidence, and is getting in the way of the only morally relevant goal surrounding rape, the effort to stamp it out.

&gt; From what I've read of behaviour studies - the causes of behaviour are very complex and there are zero behaviours except for rape that are explained by one single cause. Why is rape pretty much the only behaviour out there for which academics will accept only one single explanation? How does a delusion spread among people who should be immune to them?

**SA**: It's the ""moralistic fallacy,"" the idea that we should shape the facts in such a way as to point to the most morally desirable consequences. 

In the case of rape, the fear was that if rape has a sexual motive, then it would be natural, hence good; and instinctive, hence unavoidable. Since rape is bad and ought to be stamped out, it cannot come from ""natural"" sexual motives. My own view is that these are non-sequiturs -- rape is horrific no matter what its motives are, and we know that rates of rape can be reduced (in Better Angels I assemble statistics that US rates of rape are down by almost 80% since their peak). 

One surprise that I experienced upon re-reading Susan Brownmiller's 1975 book ""Against Our Will,"" which originated the rape-is-about-power-not-sex doctrine, is that idea was a very tiny part of the book, thrown in almost as an afterthought (Brownmiller said she got the idea from one of her Marxist professors). Most of the book is a brilliant account of the history of rape, its treatment by the legal system, its depiction in literature and film, the experience of being raped and reporting it, and other topics. It's also written with great style, clarity, and erudition. Though I disagree with that one idea, I would recommend it as one of the best and most important books on violence I have read.

**Q2**: 
&gt; Some differences in IQ scores between males and females have been shown to exist; including in spatial ability and math ability. The differences appear 1) in the mean and 2) in the variance of the scores. Do you think this explains part of the difference between the proportions of men and women in STEM degrees and related occupations? If so, how much do you think it explains?

**SA**: There do appear to be some small sex differences in the tails of the distributions of spatial and abstract mathematical ability, though I think they play a far smaller role in observed sex imbalances in STEM occupations than differences in interests and life priorities (among male-female differences). There are also female-unfriendly STEM subcultures that have made talented women uncomfortable, compared to the alternatives available to them. I don't think we have any way to weight the relative influences of all these factors.

**Q3**: 
&gt; What do you think is the likelihood of in the future discovering intelligence differences between population groups using neurological comparisons and genetic comparisons rather than by just comparing IQ scores? Academics today seem to dismiss the idea as impossible. But is the idea that groups can evolve in very different environments and not end up with different intelligence levels realistic? I've read that more than half of genes are expressed in the brain.

**SA**: It's possible, but I don't think that evolutionary theory predicts that they should occur. It's hard to think of an environment in which the human hallmarks of intelligence, sociality, and language would NOT be adaptive, which is why, as Ambrose Bierce put it, our species has infested the whole habitable earth and Canada. Intelligence just isn't particularly dependent on geography. Combine that with gene flow and you can't predict a priori that there ought to be race differences.",0,1363127771,,0,False,1,c8uhjnf,t3_1a67x4,t1_c8uhjnf,t1_c8uhbwo,,1435568786,1426,False,IAmA,t5_2qzb6,1426

True,krn123,,,"Devil's advocate with a clearly unpopular opinion and who knows if it will see the light of day. I have some things to say about the ""fat acceptance movement"" and it not being my business: 

I'm not sure about the recent threads on the topic - I haven't seen the ones you're referring to. I will say that, in regards to your weight being none of my business, I would like to disagree. Those who are persist in purposely engaging in unhealthy behaviors can become the business of others when it comes to health insurance, use of medical facilities and government health aid.

I'm a teacher who is seeing more and more obese children coming in at the pre-school and kindergarten level every year. I believe that fat shaming is pretty terrible and that it's cruel - just as cruel as making fun of anyone else for having a disease or an addiction. But I will never be convinced that ""fat acceptance"" is a movement that we, as a nation or as a world, should be promoting. To me, it's the same thing as saying that we need ""heroin addict"" or ""alcoholic"" acceptance. One shouldn't make fun of a heroin addict or an alcoholic but to suggest that it should be something we turn a blind eye to and mind our own business about seems ridiculous to me.

Also, it shouldn't make my opinion more valid, but I was obese up until a few years ago. It sucked, people were assholes to me, and, yes, it's hard to lose weight when you feel ashamed. However, I still don't think that anyone should ""champion"" being unhealthy - if you appear curvy and are healthy and not at any risk for health problems that could be corrected by healthy diet and exercise, awesome! Once you become unhealthy and need medical care associated with your preventable medical issue, I don't believe you should assume that everyone in your community should be supportive of your choice. 

My feelings are not limited to fat people. In addition to having experienced being fat, I also come from a family of health professionals and I feel the same way when I hear about skinny people not taking care of their diabetes, or about people who risk their lives to do stupid things for a YouTube clip. In my opinion, if you eventually have a heart attack from being obese and you don't even attempt to eat healthier (including not eating excess calories), you'll be the reason why some kid in a car accident has to wait a few extra minutes for an ambulance to pick them up. On a global scale, I think it's ridiculous when people knowingly eat so many excess calories  and spend so much money on unnecessary food when there are so many people starving in this world. And that's something I feel like I have a right to comment about.

Basically, I feel like it's my business and society's business. I'm honestly sorry if you don't want to hear it, and this is the first time I'm even typing up this opinion, but it may be something that other people think but are afraid to say because they're so worried about fat shaming.",0,1363129032,,0,False,1,c8uhzrz,t3_1a5z83,t1_c8uhzrz,t3_1a5z83,,1431565626,441,False,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt,441
True,Gekokujo,,,"You say you ""fixed"" things, but I am not quite sure that is the case.  

I was married to a woman I was with for 9 years.  The last two years read just like your situation.  I was a hard man to love, so I cant fault her for falling out of love with me.

She and I have a child, and so we both agreed on a million things that were logical and with our daughter in mind.  Within a few months, she had moved my daughter in with a man I had never met...and was pregnant with the guy's baby a couple of months later.  

I have lost everything in that time....the woman I loved, my daughter, my home, and everything that wouldnt fit into my car.

Nothing fixes anything but FIXING IT.  You will know when it is fixed, because it wont feel like Hell anymore.  

Take time through this process to find out how it started.  I guarantee that you are not the only one to blame for how things have ended up, but find out where your fault does lie...with the most unbiased perspective you can.  It sounds like you realize some of your shortcomings and faults on this....it is much more important to gain that realization than it is to beat yourself up for it.  You have your info/lesson...time to let time do its thing and move on.

Know for a fact that there is a good chance you will continue to repeat that kind of behavior if you dont nip it in the bud here....how much more would you like to lose before you become the kind of person you feel good about being within a relationship?

Become that person (again?) before you worry about reconnecting with your lost love or with another woman in a serious manner.  You owe it to yourself and to the future-woman-you-love to get your mind/affairs in order before you try again.

There it was in the window

I could easily tell

And I was thinkin' to myself

'This could be heaven or this could be hell'

Then it gave me a search bar, and it showed me the way

I left comments and posts

I found a lot of pretty pretty links

I just had to upvote

How they show off on gonewild, sweet skin and sweat

Some fap to remember

Some fap to forget

So I messaged the admin

'Please let OC thrive'

He said 'that hasn't been on the front page since June 2005'

And still those blue links are calling from far away

Keep you up through the middle of the night

Just to have them say

Reposts on the front page

The downvotes cold as ice

As he said 'We are all just prisoners here

Of our own device'

And on the front page

They meet to paint it blue

They stab it with their downvotes

But they just can't stop the views

Last thing I remember

The back button was gone

I had to find a passage back

True,bandman614,,Standalone SysAdmin - LOPSA,"Okay, time for a history lesson. 

The word ""computer"" was also assigned to the role that it took over...computers. Literally, people (the vast majority of whom were women) who sat and computed things by hand. 

When electronic computers started to take over for people computers, the women who were the computers started running the computers. 

Now, as for ""actually creating solutions and engineering products"", lets have a look at what is, without a doubt, the longest-used programming language of all time, [COBOL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL). 

COBOL was written in 1959, and it came directly from [FLOW-MATIC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLOW-MATIC), the very first computer language that used actual english words, rather than only numerical machine code. It was written for the UNIVAC - one of the first commercially available computers. And it was written by [Admiral Grace Hopper](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper). 

Yes, the computer language at the root of every programming language you've likely ever used was written by a woman. 

If that's not enough, then you should know that the UNIVAC was inspired by ENIAC, which was the very first electronic computer. It was designed in a large part to electronically function like a mechanical adding machine. Adding machines were possible because [Charles Babbage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Babbage) designed the very first mechanical computers. His [difference engine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_engine) was designed so intricately that it couldn't be constructed for a century, but when it was, it worked perfectly. 

One of the many machines Babbage designed took inspiration from the Jacquard Loom, which used cards with holes punched in them to create patterns. Babbage used this technique to give his mechanical computer instructions. He had a friend who was a noted mathematician who developed the very first computer algorithm, which calculated a series of [Bernoulli numbers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_numbers). Her name was [Ada Lovelace](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace). 

So, to sum up...the very first computer programmer was a woman. The very first real programming language was written by a woman. The first commercial computers were operated largely by women. And for some reason, we have been telling little girls that computers are toys for a boy. Something has gone very off the rails lately, and it needs fixed.

True,1369ic,,,"My father was a football star and went to WW II and came back an alcoholic. He died at 51. One great uncle got shell shocked in India in WW II and lived the rest of his life on thorazine in a VA hospital. He made it into his '60s. One uncle came back from Korea, never really worked again and died in his early '40s. My brother went to Vietnam and is the only heavy drinker out of a large family. My grandfather on my mother's side couldn't be alone in a room after getting gassed in WW I. Growing up one of my best friends' fathers was an alcoholic and never held down a job after the war. Another friend's father lost most of his stomach and lived on pain medicine. He could only sleep a few hours a night because of the pain, but his son heard him tell someone it didn't matter anyway because he still had dreams from the war. 

I always assumed it had always been that way and always would. I did 28 years in the Army and work for the Army now. I haven't seen anything to change my opinion.

**Edit:** Wow, my highest post ever. For those who are curious and don't want to dig into the replies, I think the Army is a great organization and I joined because I didn't put all this stuff together until later in my life. And, I was a 17-year-old impatient dumbass. 

War sucks. Sending people off to war for stupid reasons really sucks. We will be caring for our Iraq and Afghanistan veterans for the next 50 or 60 years. Think about all this when it's time to vote again.

**Be very open to opportunity:** whenever someone offers something, even if you don't think it is worthwhile, do it. Being open-minded and not being predisposed to saying no helps here. Something unexpected and extraordinary may arise.

**Be spontaneous:** goes with the last one, worrying about planning will get in the way and give you a reason not to do it.

**Follow your passions:** those adventures will stem from things your passionate about, and will be more interesting to read about because of it. It will also be easier to find opportunities.

**Travel:** Interesting things will just happen if you travel. Being spontaneous is also key here, don't go in with too much of a schedule or it will limit you to a tourists' view. 

**Get out of your comfort zone:** This will also lead to unexpected happenings. It also has the added benefit of bringing you new and unusual things that other people will not have experienced, and thus will be more interested in.

**Get out there and do it:** It's not gonna just happen. You have to take action yourself. Now go on! Explore the vast, and beautiful world that's in front of you.

True,ajustend,,,"Ok, cool, that totally makes sense. Here's how I would accomplish what you're trying to do (in Ableton 9).

1. Record your free-form midi sequence. *Be sure to play the first note of the loop again at the end of the sequence, this will end up being used to define the exact ending point of your loop.
1. Play your clip back and count how long it is (bars and beats). Remember this (or write it down).
1. In the Clip View at the bottom, drag the Loop Start to the right until it snaps to the beginning of the first note in the midi sequence.
1. Right-click anywhere in the note area and select Crop Clip. This will put the down beat at the beginning of the first note.
1. Play the sequence again, and tap your finger along with the beat until you are certain that you have the beat. Then use the Tap Tempo button with your mouse to find that tempo. Your song tempo is now set. (This could be considered the ""hardest"" part, I guess, but you've been making music for a while, so I know you can handle tapping in a beat to find a tempo)
1. Back in the Clip View at the bottom of the screen select all of the notes (CTRL+A Win, CMND+A Mac, or drag a selection box across all of the notes). You will notice that there are now two Stretch Markers in the timeline below your Loop Brace. The 1st Stretch Marker is at the beginning of your 1st midi note, and the 2nd Stretch Marker is at the beginning of your last midi note (you'll remember that the last midi note is what you originally recorded to mark the end of your sequence, and this is why you did that).
1. Click and Drag the 2nd Stretch Marker to match the length that you counted in Step 2 above. (This step is time stretching the sequence to make it match the grid that you created when you Tapped the Tempo in Step 5) 
1. Drag the Loop End to the left until it snaps to the beginning of the last note in the sequence.

True,TheCodexx,,,"What they mean by ""It has an uneven power structure"" is ""Why don't you guys just ban anyone who dissents or disagrees or says anything that anyone might take issue with like we do over at Gawker?"".

The early users of this site joined because of the lack of central authority. We don't want to comment on shitty sites with shitty mods that are never questioned. We don't want to be on sites where one or two users in the right position can decide what's acceptable.

What they're saying, effectively, is that some users are willing to go online and say things that aren't politically correct (which is apparently stunning to them, as if they've never been on *most of the web* before) and they're also parading the tired old belief that ""if it hurts anyone's feelings, you need to not do it ever under any context"", which has been destroyed *time and time again*. If I want to make a joke about a fat man getting run over by a car, then I'm allowed to. On reddit, or on most sites. I can even do it in real life. There's nothing stopping me, except perhaps social pressure from prudish douchebags without a thick skin. If anyone is being legitimately insensitive, it's up to the general public to decide. Reddit gives people a place to expose the insensitive.

Here's the issue: They're pointing to the occasional joke that throws some group under a bus (like fat people, or blacks, or maybe gays or theists) and saying that joke is insensitive. Here's a dirty joke: ""I called that Rape Advice Line earlier today. Unfortunately, it's only for victims."" That's great, isn't it? Oh, wait, according to some people, I'm not supposed to say that, because I'm ""perpetuating rape culture"" and if I must say it I need to label my post with ""trigger warnings"". This site's ""dark side"" is dirty or off-color jokes that people normally only tell to friends they're hanging out with, not to the general public. And I think some people still aren't comfortable with the idea that people on the internet treat total strangers like pals.

**Ultimately, my core issue with people like this is that they want to bring real life social pressures onto the internet and expect every website to enforce them. Worse, their definition of social pressures is exactly the same as the the ones *they* approve of.** Imagine that. They feel a perfect world happens to line up with what they feel is or isn't appropriate, not what's effective, or right, or makes the most people happy.

I feel comfortable saying most of reddit isn't made up of bigots. I also feel comfortable saying that reddit loves dirty jokes. I even feel comfortable saying that redditors don't follow the accepted standard as easily. Reddit is basically the only place on the internet or anywhere else where a rapist will tell their story and receive genuine comments, concerns, and questions. They'll be upvoted, not in approval for their actions, but for coming forward and giving an insight into something that few people have a good understanding of. And I think in real life, these emotions end up repressed because there's nowhere you can discuss your incest fetish with, or your furry fetish, or your growing feelings of pedophilia you want to stay under control. You can't bring up that time you fucked a frog at summer camp in front of your mom, and you probably aren't okay mentioning all those crazy times you had with your High School friends, including the time you crashed your neighbor's car after a joy ride and blamed someone else for it. You can't ask for tips on how to come out to your family about your homosexuality, and most parents won't give you tips on how to finger your girlfriend. And yet, I'm pretty sure I've seen people ask about and discuss *all of these subjects* on reddit. It broadens horizens. And if people are going to say the occasional ""Hey guys does anyone get white guilt when they end up stuck on a bus with a black guy"", then fuck them. Because they're *not* the only white person to experience that, and it helps for others with a similar experience to stop them and say, ""Just chill out, you're less comfortable because you probably didn't grow up around them. There's a scientific reason why your have prejudice and as long as you're not discriminating it's okay"". And that's what they need to hear.

True,Frodork,,,"ok, you have a point for some things like that, but people do a lot of god related things in peoples faces as well, and i see no problem for responding to those.

for example, i was at a small event for people who were hosting foreign exchange students, and i had made a acquaintances with one of the people there. so, they had just brought a dish of friend chicken out and we decide as we were talking to go get some. the fried chicken smelled delicious and my acquaintance exclaimed something along the lines of, ""i don't know how anyone could be an atheist when something so delicious exists!"" now, i didn't start anything out of respect for the man hosting the event, who was a christian, but seriously, what the fuck? sure, he didn't know one way or the other my beliefs, or lack there of, but can't we just come together and enjoy some goddamned chicken without having to turn it into ""suck it athiests!"" moment? is that really to much to ask?

so yeah, there are plenty of atheist assholes out there, i won't deny that, but a lot of religious people do shit like i described all the time and just assume that they can get away with it because they think they are the only ones listening, and often times if we do announce our presence after one of these jabs, were the ones who get the shit end of the stick.

and don't act like we are the only ones who have vocal assholes in our group. sure, we do, i won't deny it, but just by the sheer numbers involved demographically, there are almost certainly more vocal asshole religious people. hell, it is basically part of the bylaws of most religions to go out and dispense unwanted religious advice, except when they do it it is **ok** because it is *evangelism*, it is, *""saving people.""*

does that make it ok for the assholes amongst our group? no, obviously not, but we should be going against all the assholes, not just the assholes we disagree with.

also, just as a note, i would never tell tell some one not to praise their god for something good happening to them, but i *might* tell them to thank their doctors *in addition* to that, because it would really piss me off if i found out my work was being attributed to someone else, especially someone who may or may not have had anything to do with my work in the first place, you know?

True,ICouldBeAsleep,,,"&gt;They also think the only way to get out of debt is to spend more

What liberals believe is that government spending puts money into the hands of individuals in the short run. Individuals will then respond by spending a portion of their increased in income, based on their marginal propensity to consume. This money will then get pushed back into the economy through consumption, further increasing GDP. As consumption increases, businesses will have to make the necessary investment to meet that demand. This includes hiring and further private investment. This in turn increases individual income and consumption creating a virtuous cycle of growth. 

Now once growth occurs, our debt will begin to shrink as a proportion of our economy which by the way is how we normally deal with debt, not paying it back. 

This is the argument. What you said obscures all of the nuance of the liberal argument, hence my claim that you are misrepresenting it. ",0,1363145936,,0,False,1,c8unqh2,t3_1a5ry0,t1_c8unqh2,t1_c8unj7t,,1431568429,1,False,politics,t5_2cneq,1
True,TheBedtimeStory,,,"The feedback I've provided ranges from: things you need to fix, to suggestions. I've only quoted the bits of the essay I have comments on. Overall, this essay isn't great - I'd recommend reading it slowly, and out loud to yourself. You're going to find places where it doesn't make much sense. I find it unlikely that your teacher will be counting the number of sentences per paragraph - if you can't find enough content to fill 7 sentences, then don't. A well written, but slightly short essay is a better choice than a terrible essay that meets the requirements.

Additionally, if you have time, you might want to consider revising your arguments about what the symbols represent. This is a very rich book, but your claims are weak.

On to the feedback:

&gt;Several themes could have been identified throughout the story, but one major theme that was largely used by Mark Twain was the theme of Freedom. 

This is a very long sentence for very short meaning. You're basically saying ""Freedom is a major theme in Mark Twain's The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn""

 &gt;Through the first chapter it gave a background, and described his troubles with the widow Douglas.  

Who's troubles with widow Douglas?

&gt;Although Huck did exemplify freedom, he was not the only one.  

If you're going to say this, you need some examples of Huck demonstrating freedom - this is the kind of sentence you'd use in a conclusion. Perhaps you mean: ""Although Huck's adventure was about freedom, his wasn't the only one."" This might be an issue with word choice and phrasing, I'm not sure what you mean.

&gt;Jim also sought after freedom, but from a different thing.  Last was the raft, and the freedom they felt on it.

What kind of freedom is Jim seek? Also.. the last sentence doesn't make sense. You don't seem to have a list at all, but you used 'last'.

&gt;In the first chapter of Huck Finn, Huck was forced to be “sivilized”.  He Just wanted his freedom from this. 

Perhaps something like: ""... Huck wanted freedom from the constraints of being ""sivilized"" "". This doesn't need to be two sentences.

&gt;For example, in the first chapter it points out his lack of care for the dinner rituals by ...  Huck says that there wasn’t anything wrong with the food, but he still listens and conforms.  

A chapter doesn't point out anything, but things happen in a chapter. Rephrase this to something like ""In the first chapter, Huck shows that he doesn't care for dinner rituals by..."". In the second sentence, you use ""but"", however you aren't refuting anything. Consider rephrasing this, I'm not entirely sure what you're trying to say.

&gt;These things and many others led to him wanting to be free from their control.  

Saying ""many others"" seems like you're too lazy to list them out. You might consider something like: ""Huck wanted to be free from the constraints imposed by ... ""

&gt;Later on when Huck landed under Pap, his freedom weakened.  Pap was even more restricting on his freedom.  

Can someone ""land"" under someone else? Pick a better word. Also, these two sentences say the exact same thing.

&gt;Pap wouldn’t allow Huck to near anything. 

Huh?


&gt;Jim also exemplified freedom when he escaped from Miss Watson.

You can't be an example that you're free if you have to escape. An example of freedom is the raft. Your word choice is poor here. I think the phrase you're looking for is: ""Jim demonstrated his desire to have freedom when...""

&gt;His freedom could have costed his life, but he would have rather risked death than stay as a slave.  

""could have *cost* his life""

&gt;After Jim and Huck started to travel more, the problems facing Jim grew.

""started to travel *further*""

&gt;Huck preserved Jim by telling the men that it was his father who was sick.

I don't think ""preserved"" is a good word to use here - conjures up images of body preservation.

&gt;The raft is a place where the two can act and talk how they would like.  They both feel free to talk about whatever like, and have enough trust in each other to act as they feel. 

These two sentences say the exact same thing.. eliminate/merge them.

&gt;The raft and the river both play into freedom, because they helped lead Huck and Jim to it.  

I'm confused, lead them to what?


&gt;Huckleberry Finn was a story for freedom.  It took examples from Huck’s life to describe freedom.  Jim also played into the freedom aspect.  

This needs to be one sentence, there is no reason to split this idea in to three - this whole phrase is part of one concluding idea.

&gt;He started out a slave, with no power.  At the end he had his freedom, and a want to live a free life with his family.  

""want to a free life""?

&gt;Mark Twain didn’t leave out the physical aspects to freedom either.  Mark used the raft to show freedom in how the two acted.  

In stories, these items that symbolize concepts are called symbols, consider using that word instead of 'physical aspects'.",0,1363146360,,0,False,1,c8unvjr,t3_1a6t78,t1_c8unvjr,t3_1a6t78,,1431568455,2,False,HomeworkHelp,t5_2r6f3,2
True,thisnameisawful,,,"I'm sorry. I just had a problem with this and didn't mean to let it develop into a big wall of text but it did. I don't mean to be nasty or anything, but I wouldn't put too much stock in that theory and I'd like to explain why. I was in Iraq from 06-07 and as a vet with tbi I'd like to share these thoughts.

Back when things were shitty (shittier?) maybe they went home as broken, wretched hulks of people for the rest of their lives and just worked in whatever capacities they could until they died? A magic, therapeutic walk home *didn't exist*. Shitloads died of disease and hunger and pointy objects on the ways to and from war campaigns in a lot of history. Everything about these people was brutal and nasty and liable to kill you without trouble.

For most of our history this kind of stuff just never had a chance to matter before because we were busy every other minute just staying alive and trying not to die horribly of the black death or whatever horrible thing was in fashion at the time.

Yeah, plenty probably went home and drowned babies in wells and did all sorts of fucked up barbaric shit when they went out of their minds, but most just had to deal with it and get right back to work on toiling and living in agony under regimes that gave absolutely zero shits about them for no other discernible reason than to squeeze out a new generation of workers and die once their usefulness was up. These people were so small in the scheme of things that the overwhelming breadth and depth of their collective personal tragedies are just completely beyond our reach. Their misery died with them and it hardly made a dent in the horrific meat grinder that is human history.

Its really hard to impart the savage, uncaring brutality of the world. They went home and lived and died ugly dysfunctional lives knee deep in shit and history just didn't care. One thing that probably helped a lot though was faith. Not exactly a lot of armies go into battle thinking god is on the other guys side, and in history when people were stupid and savage their faiths were probably a big part of getting them to do things and getting them to not lose their minds over them later on.

Well, I have only one account on Reddit, and that is HAGOODMANAUTHOR, so all my thoughts on everything from the North Korean nuke crisis, to answering any questions or conversing with readers on this ad go through this account. 

What you might be seeing on the net is two things: 1. Reddit links at various stages of this ad that somehow link up to Google searches and 2. My attempt at a PR release several months back. 

For some interesting reason, which I'm actually very pleased with, this Reddit ad is taking on a life of its own, on some alternate internet universe, through various incarnations. It's a bit bizarre, and I have no idea how the internet logarithms or whatever work, but pieces of this ad pop on various searches throughout the net. 

As for my PR release in January, that went everywhere, since I have reviews from different African and Asian countries, my book will now pop up if someone types in a combination of related words and Sri Lanka, or Nigerian newspaper, for example. The Reddit ad copy will also show, and since I've changed the ad copy several times in the past couple of months, different ad copies will show as well. 

My website, www.hagoodman.com is actually ranked pretty high in the U.S., all because of the exposure on Reddit. The thing with Reddit is that because of this exposure, my site and my Amazon page are the first things to pop up when searching for Breaking the Devil's Heart, in addition to reviews, my Reddit ad, and various places my press release pop up (and these could be on sites that sell pharmaceuticals, etc. so it's odd). In addition, have over 40 reviews from the novel, so those are listed as well when a search is done for the novel. 

I was also doing Google Ads a little while back, which didn't really help with sales since Google Ads is perfect for a business, but might not be the best thing for an author. With the Google Ads, my book also ended up popping up in unusual places.

So I'm at a loss for words in terms of how the net finds Breaking the Devil's Heart, but I'm out there on the internet, in some obvious searches and some pretty odd places as well. Even some of the characters of the novel are out there in one of those background search ads, which I find hilarious.

Thanks so much for the kind words, and I'm honored to have readers on Reddit who appreciate the crazy story in Breaking the Devil's Heart. Now, not only can I advertise to an amazing community of readers on Reddit, but I can also ad my two cents on world issues, as well as the viral pic of the Yorkie dressed like James Dean riding a Harley, which is also fun as heck.

As the torrent of cum begins to issue forth, the electricity surges towards both your heads. Your brain shuts down as the head of your cock becomes the center of your universe. It's the only thing you can sense. Time stops as her swallowing reflex pushes up on the bottom of your cock with her tongue and massages the top of your head with her soft palate. 

Every spurt of cum initiates another round of this delectable massage, starting another cycle of spasms, which in-turn starts another cycle of massage. For a few seconds you start to think that this is some sort of infinite recursion cycle, that maybe the key to free perpetual energy might lie between your dick and this woman's incredible lips. For a lot of guys this is a critical moment when they should push away before the sensations become too intense. 

You don't; you're like me. You grab the back of her head and hold her in place, groaning out to her not stop. As the cum stops spurting she's free to move away from reflexive movements. Her tongue swirls around your head and she swallows more of your softening erection. It's so sensitive that it feels like fire in a good way. It feels good in the way a cinnamon mint tastes good.

At this point your entire body is shuddering but you tell her to keep going. She resumes a bobbing motion. It's slow, torturous, and cruel in its gentleness. Her lips are barely grazing you, sliding ever so gently and effortlessly along your flesh. You can feel each nerve ending she triggers and her tongue occasionally grazes the top of your cock to savor the last trickling drops of cum.

At this point your body is spent. Your flaccid penis drops from her lips. You look down at her looking back at you with a wicked little grin. You try to tell her not to stop, but all that comes out is a defeated growl. As she slides her body up your supine form to cuddle she knows she's destroyed you. 

Her hands slide up your sides and chest before wrapping around  your neck. Her nose nuzzles in against your jawline. Every movement, every bit of her warmth against your flesh leads to a sense of completion. You've emptied every bit of your being inside of her, she milked out just a little bit more, and now she's wrapped herself around you. Rather than hitting an abrupt physical wall like when other girls pull off and finish you by hand, you feel fully attached for a fleeting moment. 

When your brain comes to again, as if through a clearing fog, you know you want to return the favor. You roll her over and start kissing your way down the curves of her breasts, her hips, her thighs. It begs the question of all the ladies; what does it feel like when his tongue drives you over the edge and stays there?

True,Dioscurus,,,"I appreciate the import of what you're saying, and agree with it to an extent.  HOWEVER (there's that word again...), I think there are some mischaracterizations here and in some of your responses.  Part of the problem stems from the fact that ""medieval times"" could conservatively signify anywhere in Europe, western Asia, and the Near East over a span of about 500 years (say 1000-1500). That's a lot of people living in a lot of different types of societies.  

At least in the Latin west there are reasons to think it was a comparatively good time to be a peasant.  Almost certainly much, much better than, say, Oliver Twist's London.  Peasants were not slaves and were generally (though not always) free to seek greener economic or social pastures wherever they saw fit, and we know for sure that many did so. At least by the 13th century the economic relationship between lords and peasants was a complicated and contractual affair, and landowners from the Baltic to the Mediterranean vied with one another to attract settlers by offering more economically favorable charters. Certainly it was bad for smallfolk to be caught between powerful aggressors, or subject to an unusually vicious lord--but how is that different than now? Re: total vs. limited war, it's worth remembering that we collectively decided to institute things like rules of engagement because of our experience in the 20th century, not the 12th.  No medieval could have imagined the killing fields of the Somme or the insane, filthy slaughter of Antietam, Gallipoli, or Stalingrad.  

On the other hand, it's basically impossible for moderns to imagine the scope of an epidemic like the Black Death, or assess the impact of universally higher infant mortality rates.  But I'm not sure it's enough to say that ""they went home and lived and died ugly dysfunctional lives knee deep in shit.""  @u/reddzed, it's simply untrue that ""daily life was an endless grind, there were no ""holidays"", the vast majority worked on farms where death and dismemberment of animals was a near daily occurrence...""  In fact there were shitloads of holidays--a damned sight more than you get, probably :)  Latins lived and worked according to the church calendar, and that meant lots of holy days, saints' days, and feast days in addition to the Sabbath.  Also, the rhythms of agricultural life in a temperate zone vary by season, with winter as the obvious low point.  As for the animals, I would guess (though I don't actually know) that large animals would have been butchered seasonally rather than daily.  I suppose hunting would have been a year-round activity for some medievals, but it doesn't seem like hunting and dressing animals for food necessarily make a person miserable, bloodthirsty, or unusually savage towards other people.  Vis à vis literally living in shit, blood, offal, mud, etc...  I can't think why that would be the case at all.  If there's water to drink, there's probably water to wash.  If there's a river there's water to carry away all manner of undesirable things, and if there's no river there's at least a shovel to dig a latrine pit.  No germ theory and not much soap, so not hygienic as we think of it, but also not squalid as it seems like we're imagining.  Cities would have been much worse in this regard.

@u/MeloJelo, you raise an interesting point regarding medieval criminal law that I'm not really knowledgeable enough to tease out, but if you ever decide to look into it you might report back.  I think you might be surprised... ;)

Again, I don't mean to discount anyone's perspective.  I'd never deny that moderns in the first world live impossibly shiny lives by comparison to even the most privileged folks in medieval societies.  Maybe it's just that I feel like this is a rare instance in which the truth is a little *more* hopeful than people seem to believe, and such instances are worth engaging.

Edit:  Was too tired to add sources last night, but here's at least a few.  Frances and Joseph Gies' ""Life in a Medieval Village"" is probably a good starting point--I actually can't remember if I've read it, but their ""Life in a Medieval Castle"" is robust and interesting :)  Peter Brown's ""The Rise of Western Xndom: 200-1000"" addresses trends in modern scholarship toward re-tooling our understanding of economic and intellectual conditions in the so-called Dark Ages.  AD 200-AD 1000 is earlier than the period I laid out above, but I think moderns carry around a lot of images of ""medieval"" life that were really invented as depictions of the Dark Ages.  Robert Bartlett's ""The Making of Europe"" offers a lot of primary evidence, mostly charters if I remember, that describe economic arrangements between landowners and the tenants they were trying to attract. There's also some good archaeological data if I recall.  Guibert de Nogent was an 11th century monk who wrote an autobiography sort of in the vein of Augustine, but also spoke a bit about the rise of communes, which offered an economic and social alternative to traditional village structure.  For anyone thinking of making a counter-argument I should mention that Guibert also describes some extraordinarily violent events; either way he's worth a look.  Umm...if you're interested in public perceptions of aristocratic violence in the 10th-11th centuries just google ""Peace/Truce of God movements.""  There's probably more there to undermine my premise, but I mention it because I'd rather you think about the evidence and disagree with me than believe something about history just because an asshole on reddit said so... But at least consider the clergy as an important third party in power relationships between lords and vassals, who often struggled mightily to curb and redirect violence and lawlessness between Christians.  So for any of you interested in sources...there's a start at least.

True,coeddotjpg,ns,,"There were once three siblings that lived in a warp gate on Auraxis. They all loved flying about in the tiny fighter jets their father had made for them. The father said that they all looked like little mosquitoes darting about. So that is what they came to call their crafts and their little gang: The Mosquitoes.

The eldest brother was bossy. He painted his little fighter jet red and demanded that the others do so as well. But the second brother was willful. He painted his blue, because ""that's the opposite of red!"", he boasted. The youngest, their sister, was a bookworm who took after their father. She painted hers purple ""so it is a little bit of both my brothers!"".

One day the bossy brother became angry and began using his fighter jet to flip over and hold down the other siblings' jets when they didn't play how he wanted. ""I'll build mine bigger and with bigger jets so I can get off the ground and rocket away!"" said the willful brother. And so he built his bigger and, for brief bursts, faster, and the two brothers fought day after day. The little sister said ""I'll make mine a funny shape so I can hold you both down until you stop fighting!"", and so she made her little jet into a funny shape that could hold the bigger, faster jets in place.

One day the little sister trapped her big brothers, pinning their little jets to the ground with hers. Their father came out and said ""now, now, kids, I built you these jets for fun, not for fighting"". The little sister suddenly turned upon her father brandishing a remarkable new toy gun. 

Or so her father thought.

""*Long has my genius suffocated within the borders of this warp gate and  the limits of your ambition, father. No longer. I take with your life my freedom and your name. I name my cause this name! The light, the heat! Universes dead, universes unborn, Vanu! Vanu!* **And all will know my will!**"". 

""You've been watching those violent holofilms from old Earth again, haven't you? Come on dear, lets get your brothers out....."" And with those words on his lips professor Jonathon Vanu, the high chancellor of Auraxis, died, lashed and flayed and scattered to the winds by his daughter's creation.

A storm gathered overhead. Quiet settled, broken at times by the sobs of two brothers, trapped, left on the sands of Indar within a once happy warp gate. All they owned now were their little fighter jets - one red, one blue - and a holotape left to them by their sister.

The brothers would grow up to be big and strong and go looking for their sister one day, their sister, the being known as Vanu. And one being bosy and the other willful, they would come to blows as well. But that is a different story, for a different time.

True,MikeSeth,,SAGE OF ALL FIELDS,"&gt; Despite not actually addressing the violent nature of the current occupation 

The ""violent nature"" of the current ""occupation"" is what, precisely? 

&gt; You see Jews are a racial group

No, I see Jews as a *national* group. Such groups have rights in public international law.

&gt; and here we see that this racial group seeks to dominate another group

Dominate in which specific sense? What characterizes the relationship between Israel (Jews) and Palestinians (Arabs) as ""an institutionalised regime of systematic oppression and domination by one racial group over any other racial group""?

&gt; and it does so by way of certain measures that are considered criminal

Since you do not actually understand the underlying legal matters, I will have to explain it, not for you, but for the benefit of others who will read this thread. A state that encompasses a certain territory has a duty to apply domestic law equally to all its citizens, and it has a duty to allow any persons within these boundaries to become citizens if they wish to do so. The crime of apartheid is the violation of these duties on grounds of race. West Bank in part or whole is not a part of Israeli territory. Refusal to adjoin West Bank summarily with all its population - the so called ""one so state solution"" - is not apartheid, neither is the rejection of any demands for Palestinian Arabs who do not live in Israel for rights and privileges that are awarded to Israeli nationals. For the Arabs of West Bank, entering Israel and working in Israel, or living in Israel, is a privilege and not a right, just as for the Israeli it is a privilege and not a right to visit Jordan, Egypt, Lebanon, Syria or any other Arab country.

&gt; You have also ignored Jewish violence against the Brits and the international community

Which was in response to British violation of their mandatory duties, and in particular their active work to prevent Jewish self-defense and suppress Jewish repatriation into Palestine, isn't that correct?

&gt; as well as the reality of Jewish violence towards arabs, either in the past or today

Which is, and always has been, response to worse acts of violence of Arabs towards the Jews.

&gt; So I instead will ask who determined that 'Jewish return' was lawful

All fifty state members of League of Nations in the San Remo Convention, which is binding and unabridged treaty law.

&gt; is it the same parties who say today that 'Jewish return' is unlawful?

Actually, *back then* it was understood by far, far more people than the zionists themselves. And it is not material whether the same parties today *opine* that it is unlawful. The law is still in the books. You don't get to revert it by simply not liking it.

True,ashleygee,bear-lifting,,"I want to agree with you. I really do. 

But speaking from my personal experience, nobody encouraged me to exercise when I was skinny. (Well, less fat, as I've never really been skinny.) The topic of exercise and healthy eating only ever came up in my health classes. 

No one ever felt the need to tell me I should exercise until I was over 200 pounds. This is strange to me, because I needed to exercise and eat good foods **BEFORE** I gained weight, as well as after. In fact, EVERYONE should be eating good foods and exercising, but people don't tend to get called out on these issues until they're fat. 

And I think that's a problem. Because getting told I needed to exercise at 240 pounds didn't suddenly make me see the light regarding health. It didn't make me suddenly motivated to hit the gym. 

It made me feel like shit. I made me feel judged. It made me feel less than. It made me hate myself. 

I'm sure the people that told me ""Have you tried [insert sport/diet/activity here]"" had good intentions *somewhere* in their hearts. But it didn't come off that way. 

Know what worked? Having a partner and friends that valued me regardless of how much I exercised. Feeling loved. Being told that I was enough just the way I was. Having value as a person first, and as a body last. 

Because only when I felt like enough was I able to change my behaviors. I'd crash dieted more times than I can count. Even knowing how bad that was for my body, I didn't care. I wanted to be small. But once I began loving myself--truly loving who I am, body and heart and mind and all--only then did I begin to see diet and exercise as an act of self-love instead of torture. 

And if the fat acceptance movement can get people to that place--get them to feeling like they have value despite whatever their flaws may be, than I'm okay with that. Sure, I would LOVE for everybody to desire health, but that's not going to happen. ESPECIALLY when people feel completely shamed and embarrassed by their size. 

I do everything I can to reframe the discussion to be about health and happiness. People constantly ask me if I'm in the gym all the time to lose weight. And for the first time in 30 years I can tell them, ""No, I'm there because it makes me happy. I like being strong."" When someone compliments how my body looks, I always try to turn it around on my body's abilities. Because that's what it SHOULD be about. Our abilities and how we feel about ourselves. Being healthy is a huge part of that, but I don't think we're going to get anywhere preaching at anyone.

1. Weather - Unless there's a large storm I wouldn't worry about the weather.  You may end up hiking in constant mist or light rain.  These are rainforests after all.  But there's generally so much biomass overhead that many of the droplets don't reach the ground.

2. Campsite - Due to the high cost of the campgrounds, most of the time I end up guerrilla camping, sleeping in the back of my Subaru.  Prairie Creek Redwoods campground, while expensive, puts you near many great trails that you can walk to from your campsite.  Most of the campgrounds in the area will be pretty quiet this time of the year.

3. Many seasonal bridges are removed during the winter when the rivers swell.  For individual trail closures, your best bet is to call the rangers before you go.

If you haven't done so already, check out [Redwood Hikes](http://redwoodhikes.com).  This guy has gone through a lot of effort to map the redwood parks, write trail descriptions and offers great photos.

I've done a lot of hiking in the area and here are my personal favorites:

Prairie Creek Redwoods SP - Some of the largest trees in the species can be found just off of the trails along the floodplain of Prairie Creek.  The area immediately north of the ranger station and east of Prairie Creek is particularly spectacular.  The Miner's Ridge/James Irvine loop is a bucket-list hike that will take you through several areas of the park including the famed Fern Canyon.  The old James Irvine Trail that begins hidden behind a bench at the start of the Westridge Trail is also incredible.

Jed Smith Redwoods SP - The Boy Scout Tree Trail is another bucket-list hike.  Of all of the redwood parks, this area has the most primordial feeling to me.  The Stout Grove and driving the entirety of Howland Hill Road shouldn't be missed.  There's also good hiking along the Mill Creek Trail.

Redwood National Park - I've not spent a ton of time in this park yet.  But some of the quick hikes that will be worth taking are the Trillium Falls Trail and the Lady Bird Johnson Grove.

Del Norte Coast SP - This park is right by the ocean and provides a nice opportunity to see old growth redwoods cloaked in fog.  The Damnation Creek Trail will take you down to the ocean.

2) The language is entirely too vague.  In fact, let's get this out there as it relates to ALL bills:  If the word 'appropriate' appears ANYWHERE in a piece of legislation, that legislation should be scrapped.

But the way you wrote, it appears to me, you´d think I would go in and play attackspeed Lulu with 5 phantomdancers and boots and bitch at my team everytime they won´t do something that pleases me thats certainly not what I intended with variety in opinions in meta.

Although this might be unbelievable but players might actually enter the championselect with the mindset of "" hey i want to try something completely new this game"" without it ending in a disastre. 

""Guys, if you don´t mind I would love to play XY champion against WZ champion because I think it might work (note XY would never be picked against WZ in the ""current meta"") If I do poorly, I´ll change the gameplan and will try my best."" 

This is something that *could* happen. 

2 Options for that game -&gt;

You win: awesome, you played something super unconventional and still won and people might even try to adapt that gamestyle and play it in different games (a new meta?)

You lose: well that sucks, it sucks a lot, you played with an unconventional champion because you thought you could win but it didn´t work out in the end, heck you might say if you would´ve played the current meta you would´ve won. You stayed polite and maybe apologized to your team who suffured from your plays. Well it certainly wasn´t the most enjoyable game every but it could´ve gone worse.

Long story short, you *can* play something super weird without compromising your teams experience. I guess you could say proper communication is key.

Btw, I just remembered a change of meta that occured in soloq. (note: feel absolutely free to correct me as the info I have is based on reddit, and we all know where this ends sometimes)

Think about AP Tryndamere, holy crap. Could you imagine someone playing him a few months ago without getting a heck of a lot of insults thrown at your face? I certainly couldn´t. But still, some guy thought about how possibly strong he could be and just said, fuck it, let´s play it. And apparently it worked, it worked so well that it was even picked up in the NA - LCS. A meta change that happened in *soloqueue* .

No idea.  However, if it isn't a perfect match it won't use theirs.  I have never had a problem with it, but I only use it for bulk storage.  My organized storage is on my server.  It notifies you if it has upgraded a song, when it does I download and replace the original.  Like I said, this is my bulk storage, it is unorganized and has every compatible file on my system, including system sounds, podcast, you name it.  Since it's unlimited storage I just do a search of all my systems and upload everything.

&gt; When it thinks it's found a match, does it just grab the first one it finds, or does it differentiate between remixes, live/studio, etc?

It will be the exact same song, just the higher bit rate.  Not sure if there is a checksum system or not.

&gt; Do you have to use iTunes? I've managed to avoid it for years, and use MediaMonkey (I'm not unwilling to use other music players, necessarily, I just really don't like iTunes, and FTR I vastly prefer portable music players).

No.  I don't have iTunes either, You just tell it to search whatever system or folder you want it to.

I think I mentioned it earlier, I save all my music and photos in at least three places.  My primary is my home server.  Secondary is zip files burned to disc.  Third is Amazon cloud, that one is my last resort.  I also use Google play (to stream my music on my Android); but I only sync the music I want, not my wife's country...

I thought it was a really bad influenza, but my family decided to call an ambulance - I passed out in the ambulance and woke up a hospital room, after having spent a couple of days in the intensive care ward.

I spent the next half year being deadly tired - falling asleep mid-conversation, having to take a nap after taking out the garbage and such. I have almost no long-term problems. A bit shoddier memory, and maybe a few points knocked off my IQ-score, but nothing you'd notice.

I felt kind of bad about it afterwards, because, well, I'd gone with the guy in the ambulance, and had woken up in the hospital, and afterwards, I found out, all of my family and a lot of my friends had been to see me, but, well, I'd just slept through it all.

Oh, hey - one thing:

After I woke up, the doctor explained to me that something-something-the immune system-white blood cells-something-something-""thinner blood""-something, and I'd have little red marks where the skin was thinnest. I checked my armpits, and sure - small red marks.

And then when I went to pee the first time (crawling on the floor, needing to lean on the IV-holder), my dick was covered in red bloody spots that looked like chicken pox!

True,party_boy,,,"If you want to know why the U.S. invaded Iraq, all you need to do is read some books.  If you are particularly lazy, you can watch a video.  This hasn't been particularly mysterious, and it was plainly laid out very early on.  How early?  I'll lay out some very credible sources that are from 2003-2005 in web page, video, and book forms.  All of this information has been available for a decade. 

The Neoconservatives were furious over **H** W Bush's failure to overthrow Saddam.  Neoconservatives, such as Wolfowitz and Perle argued against **H** W advisers, like [Cheney](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YENbElb5-xY), on [preemptive strikes](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/iraq/etc/cron.html), arguing on [removing Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq — an important Israeli strategic objective in its own right](http://www.iasps.org/strat1.htm), and on [pressuring Clinton](http://web.archive.org/web/20070118090439/http://www.newamericancentury.org/iraqclintonletter.htm) to act on Saddam and to preemptively remove him from power.    

Clinton didn't want any part of it. However, He was facing the Lewisnsky nonsense, elections and impeachment. It was a political loser for him to veto this congressional act. In October 1998, [under intense lobbying pressure from the neocons](http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2004/05/04/chalabi/print.html), Congress passed, and President Clinton signed, the ""Iraqi Liberation Act."" Clinton famously did, as Sen Brownback lamented, nothing with this law.  

Prominent neo-conservatives occupied important positions in the Bush administration, and in the aftermath of 9/11, they played a major role in persuading Bush and Cheney to back a war against Iraq, which they had been advocating since the [early 1990s](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/iraq/etc/cron.html).

The neocons surprised [many](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/1476758/Powell-began-to-lose-favour-in-fallout-of-September-11.html) [and](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/1390870/Sharon-teaches-Powell-a-lesson-over-breakfast.html) [beat](http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2002/04/28/colin-powell-s-humiliation.html) out Powell, and, again, implemented a disasterous foreign policy over Powell, over Scowcroft, over Baker, and over the oil companies.

True,GeneSperling,,,"On ""The West Wing"" -- I always have answered that it is pretty realistic, except that we are not as funny, don't walk as fast and most of us are not as good looking. The West Wing show aimed for reality, except that they often have to condense a 9 month process to 60 minutes. When President Obama asked me how life in the first six months of his administration during the financial crisis compared to normal times -- I gave the same reply: that we were being forced to do 9 months of policy work in what seemed like 60 minutes.

What I liked most about The West Wing -- and what was most realistic to me -- was that instead of portraying people in Washington as either cynical or naive, our boss, Aaron Sorkin did a great job at portraying serious and deeply committed and well-intentioned people trying to do good things in what is a very difficult, complex and political environment. That is how I think most of us -- on both sides of the aisle -- see our efforts. The West Wing captured that and I think it has inspired many young people to go into public service.

Finally, for me the best thing about 4 years of consulting and part-time writing for the West Wing is that it is how I met my wife Allison Abner. She was a writer on the show, and I met her the first day in my interview.

True,flignir,,,"Can you point out any instances of this meme that actually hinge on **obedience**?    I think they usually center around thoughtfulness, helpfulness, sexiness, nymphomania, hyper-accomodation, clear communication, and voluntary generosity (often in bed)...and in all those ways embody a kind of fantasy girlfriend.  But I can't think of any one of them that is an example of a girl just taking instructions.  Even though this is  kind of a runaway male fantasy, it doesn't seem like anyone is fantasizing about direct control.

Take away the sexual component, and you can say the exact same things about Greg. He's thoughtful, helpful, straight-forward, generous, etc.  He embodies a fantasy neighbor/roommate/brother/friend, and as such, pretty much always does what we want of his own volition.  

Neither meme is commanded to act good; they choose to.  The only reason this meme is receiving criticism for sexism is because it involves a female; not because that female is treated differently.   **Actually, it's the critic who is sexist, because in their eyes, a guy can be great and that's great, but a woman who seems great must be oppressed.**

This learning curve may take a while, but I hope it leads to a really diverse style meta where the top teams either know how to play different styles.

True,tockenboom,,,"IANAL, what follows is simply my opinion based on my lay reading of a couple of law papers on related subjects. In any event, it would appear, on closer examination, that non-cooperation laws like this fall into somewhat of a gray area.

The closest analogy I could find comes from the post 9/11 expansion of immigration enforcement. Basically, after 9/11 the federal government adopted new policies which were designed to encourage and/or impel state authorities to take on a greater role in enforcing immigration laws. Some states welcomed this new sovereignty while others resisted, passing several non-cooperation laws at the local level. The nature of these laws vary greatly but are basically designed so as to limit the states authority in enforcing immigration law. AFAIK none has withstood any rigorous test in the courts. It is also important to note that these non-cooperation laws were not a response to the passage of new federal legislation (as in the NDAA), rather just a new direction in policy by the DOJ. I believe federal law already exists that bars States from prohibiting their employee's willing cooperation with the federal government in enforcing these laws (by reporting undocumented workers and the like) but whether the States can withhold resources in such cases is another matter.

In general it looks like current law would tend to favor the federal government if it came to a showdown. But based on the makeup on the current SCOTUS it would be a very close call. And there are compelling reasons as to why the federal government should *not* prevail. If States are compelled to aid the federal government in enforcing immigration law or NDAA it seriously undermines democratic rule by interfering with State's rights to exercise police powers in ways that they deem most appropriate to protect citizen's safety, health and welfare. There is also the question of the added cost of making local government prosecute and enforce federal law, particularly in a time of high deficits. Finally, if non-cooperation laws were to be struck down it would result, de facto, in a huge expansion of federal power and potentially remove an essential check in our current system of government. 

tl;dr: Non-cooperation laws fall into a gray area that has not been fully tested in the courts as yet so the effect of this law remains to be seen.",0,1363209096,,0,False,1,c8v2wri,t3_1a7vpb,t1_c8v2wri,t1_c8v161j,,1431575728,2,False,Michigan,t5_2qhtl,2

Google's business model depends on us thinking we can depend on them. Why the hell do they want to take a giant dump on some of their most dedicated customers?

I'm a big open-source guy already, but this makes me MUCH more so. If there was some simple service I could run on a home server that could collate all this for me and was constantly being improved by the community, I am now way more likely to use that in the future as opposed to Google.

If the near future entails most homes having an always on home computer of some kind, which is very likely with the wave of ""smart"" home products coming down the line, the market for ""distributed"" services like this is likely going to be big.

I'm an anatomist, I dissect cadavers for a living for education and research purposes.

These cadavers were obviously dissected by medical students. 

There is no attempt to preserve any of the more fragile facial nerves and vessels. This is understandable as the head and neck is some of the most difficult dissection work there is. Most med students are under too much of a strain to spend an extra nine hours teasing out the fine details.

The Chinese have a saying, ""To become a master calligrapher, one must waste a great deal of paper. To become a master physician, one must waste many bodies."" 

This is clearly on display here.

Anatomical dissection when done well it an art form that shapes the future face of medicine.

Being a guy is easy mode when it comes to clothing. It sucks not being able to talk about your feelings and being in ""The Guy Box"". (society telling men how to act) Girls are hot and they like it when you're funny and charming. Growing a beard = more easy mode because HEY you know how to grow a beard? Don't shave! Easy. Oh, also, you wanna eat anything you want? Go ahead! Dudes can get away with a bit more weight than girls (typically). 

Being a girl is FUCKING AWESOME. I get to be **me** and I'm free of anything that society says I *should* do because you know what? I'm a strong independent grown ass woman who can do whatever the hell she wants, I don't give a damn. Being hair free is the shit, but tedious. I still have to deal with a bit of torso hair (goddamn spiro needs to work faster). I love having long hair and having a nail polish addiction (Julep! Holla!) and being into makeup and perfume is the shit I love smelling like flowers and whatnot. I get compliments on how I smell from both guys and girls. Heels, 'nuff said. EMOTIONS. **FEMALE SEXUALITY**. Omg when a guy just kinda starts putting the moves on ya and you start getting the butterflies in your stomach and your body just kinda starts wanting to get closer to his and you squirm and he breathes on your neck when he goes to kiss you there and omg I'm horny now.

I love seeing the person in the mirror now. I didn't back when I was a guy. Though, looking at old pics... I think he was kinda cute. Could be the E talking, I dunno.

Being a guy has allowed me to experience certain things and see the world in a different way that I honestly feel it's enabled me to be a stronger, more experienced and open minded woman than I would've been had I been born cis.

True,willbefitsoon,,,"The way I think about it is like imagine a rumour, except on a global scale. For example, have you been accused of doing something horrible that is not even true, but it just won't die down? At first you're like ""yeah, whatever"" and you ignore it. But after it's been going on for years and years, even though you ignore it, it starts to creep up on you. You make small attempts to prove to people that the rumours are wrong; you start wondering if that person who didn't call you back heard about that bad rumour; etc, etc. Suddenly you start spending your life thinking about it. 

For being a girl, and being exposed to the idea that ""girls = weak, girly things = wrong"" it's just like that. At first, when you're younger, it doesn't quite bother you. As you get older, it does start to affect you. You start to doubt your skills, abilities, etc. You start to sell yourself short, and when you are successful, you always see/hear the nattering online/etc in women in similar situations who ""totally only got there because they were sleeping with someone/got help"", and so on.

It's never just ""Great work!"" or ""You're very talented!"" -- it's always usually followed up with ""Did anyone help you on that? Did you do it by yourself?"" or ""You're very talented... for a girl!""

And I could go on and on and on... lol. 

&gt;Many girls are very proud that they ""aren't typical girls"" or are ""more like guys."" 

This is, actually, a product of what happens. I used to be like that. I was like that because I wanted to fit in, and was constantly surrounded by guys who complained and used ""girls"" as an insult.

In my own mind, I legitimately thought that's what people believed. The reality is: most guys don't actually start out believing this, but over time they become conditioned and accustomed to it, that it sort of creeps in to their line of thinking. It's almost like a habit, rather than something they actively think about but it can influence their decisions especially as they get older and the mentality isn't corrected. Look how many people are under the impression that women would be less productive workers, or fuck up the work place in trades jobs for examples, [despite studies showing the complete opposite](http://www.womenbuildingfutures.com/Portals/49/pdf/reports/Final%20WBF%20SROI%20Report.pdf). 

There's other guys that are completely oblivious and just say it because ""that's what they've always said"" even if they don't really mean it -- they don't really think of the implications... but we're not mind readers, so I think most women are going to take it for what it is.

The worst part is, you don't even really realize what's going on. At first you don't really think about it, but after a while you begin reacting to it. I felt the more I ""disowned"" being a girl, the more I was vocally opposed to it, the less it would mean they were talking about me. I would reject talking about ""girly things"", and possibly missed out on the opportunity of great friendships because ""I don't get along with girls"". I would deliberately stop myself from being interested in things that could be perceived as ""girly"", even though deep down I had an interest in it. I would force myself in to hobbies that I wasn't particularly interested in, but because it made me seem more ""cool"".

So I have a huge skill set in fields I am completely not interested in, and have zero passion/motivation to pursue. 

And the worst part is... all the while you are trying to fit in, and not be ""girly"", you're actually being laughed at behind your back or told you're ""trying too hard""... and even still: they are still looking at you as ""a girl"". You're not exempt from the line of thinking. 

You can't act like a girl, because being ""a girl"" = model of inferiority... but no matter what you can't escape being ""a girl"". 

I find this kind of mentality sets everyone up for failure. It's lazy to simply ""do what's always been done"" rather than making simple, minor adjustments that would be beneficial and inclusive to everybody.

True,AzzerUK,,,"So with a little bit of package editing within SimCity thanks to the modding guide posted to Reddit earlier, and a little playing about in the code, it's possible to enable debug mode. I linked the activation to the ""Help Center"" button in the main menu for ease. Most developer debug features are disabled without having an actual developer's build (they have terraforming tools etc. available in the full developer build!), but a few things do still work - including editing the main highways.

Not only that - but you can edit the highways ANYWHERE - even outside of your city boundary... and even if you quit the game and log back in later, it's all saved safely on the server.

This shows that highway editing will be easily possible, AND that editing outside of the artificially small city boundaries should be very viable too, potentially (since you can place roads and rails that snap anywhere on-screen).

**Edit:** And yes I also modded out the disconnect timer (can now play ""offline"" indefinitely - but no saves/syncs or region related stuff, not yet anyway... but the simulation can carry on with no connection indefinitely). And I modded out the ""fluffed population count"", just shows the real population count now. Both very minor/easy tweaks.

A man is going to build a birdhouse. He has a hammer, wood and nails. He uses the hammer for an afternoon, the nails are gone, and the birdhouse is there. It's a beautiful birdhouse by the way. 

A man is going to build a manhouse. The man may buy a nail gun, lots of wood, thousands of nails and has he and his friends all have a good ole fashioned barn raising just like the Amish, but with nail guns. This takes three weeks and the nail gun paid for itself a while ago. 

A man wants to build a city. Instead of buying tons and tons of trees and nailguns and nails and making way too many friends than is practical he stops. He invents pre fabricated homes. To do this he has to invent vinyl siding. He invents machines to manufacture the homes in parts that can be shipped and deployed to new neighborhoods. He also has to invent neighborhoods but that's a new thing so it's going to be weird at first and we'll probably have to live with the initial design for a while. 

Now he and his few friends, who spent a great deal of time up front, can easily go out and build many houses easily. Not because they are lazy, but because the scale of the project justified putting the heavy lifting up front so that they could do more as they go on.

The next version of neighborhoods is going to be so much better. Police! We have to invent police. Shit... didn't we start with bird houses?

Now the man and his friends decide to build a country of houses. They invent robot slaves that can man the prefabrication process while the friends who are now experts on building neighborhoods can start focusing on building communities and trade agreements and oil pipelines and lots of other things.

Some of the friends just need hammers, but now slave robots are required for lots of people because the friends productivity with them has become the expectation, not the exception. 

At one time a hammer was fine because it was going to take a day to build a birdhouse. Now though, it's expected that in a day you can build 100 man houses. You can't do that with a hammer if you wanted to. 

Nobody has been lazy, people have just been learning how to become more and more efficient. If you want something hand crafted every time that's fine but it's pointless for some things. 

I don't need an artisan, hand crafted packed of ketchup. I need fifty thousand of them every week on Sunday starting in two months. If I try and hand knit all of those ketchup packets myself it will not only be insane, but if we start first by building the infrastructure to make the machine to make the packets you only have to worry about making the machine.

Then you patent it and sell it to Hunts or something. 

I lied. I never described it to anyone like that. I was just riffing. 

In the end though, you end up becoming more of an architect of new worlds, and the ""social"" structures of them, as well as the resource manager, the ambassador, the visionary, the plumber, the electrician, the contractor, the mayor and on and on and on. You'll hire some people to do other things but as the scale of your project goes you must make new tools and invent new ways for people to do less trivial things and more important things. At one time hammering was important, now slave robot automation operators are important. Some of them don't even know what a hammer is. 

This makes a programmer as lazy as it makes humans ""lazy"" for inventing the wheel. I don't drag wood on my back to the new build site not because I am lazy. I invented  tools, the wheel drawn carriage and animal husbandry because we can just get more stuff to a to z that way and clearly having more tools like that is more efficient than having people who can solve real problems drag wood. 


In the end though I think a lot of the times the building tools to build tools that do things perfectly thing is done because it just feels good. 

It's like being a kid again and building the coolest thing out of Legos and it turned out perfectly. Not everybody gets that, but the ones that do love it. You guys get to talk about it, learn how it was done, then build another one and make it even cooler. 

It's a lot of fun to nail it out of the park though and one of the unfortunately less appreciated aspects in software engineering is the person who can see the world building when everyone's talking about building bird nests.

You know what's coming. You know what you need. You hammer nails for a couple of years until duh. That presentation you did finally clicks and people get it. Then you get to be ""lazy"" by building slave robot manufacturing plants at home in your spare time because... That's the cool part.

The US media will bend over backwards editing out US support for the Argentine dictatorship.  This is the American whitewashing of the widespread past and current support for dictators, and widespread mass murder of political opponents.

[Washington, D.C., March 23, 2006 - On the eve of the 30th anniversary of the military coup in Argentina, the National Security Archive posted a series of declassified U.S. documents and, for the first time, secret documents from Southern Cone intelligence agencies recording detailed evidence of massive atrocities committed by the military junta in Argentina. The documents include a formerly secret transcript of Henry Kissinger's staff meeting during which he ordered immediate U.S. support for the new military regime, and Defense and State Department reports on the ensuing repression. The Archive has also obtained internal memoranda and cables from the infamous Argentina intelligence unit, Battalion 601, as well as the Chilean secret police agency, known as DINA, which was secretly collaborating with the military in Buenos Aires.](http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB185/index.htm)

True,Twisted_Charles,,,"First, good luck on your funding!

We decided to ask for about 50% of the production costs as our starting point.   We had already gotten quotes for the full production, from studio costs, to post production, to mastering, to actually printing and distributing the album.

Our Kickstarter page, while no longer active, is still visible.   We did the basics:  Thank you mentions on the page, copies of the album in both CD and Download formats, prints of the artwork, etc...   

We also did a few things that were sort of above and beyond: Offering jewelry that we had worn onstage, and offering the drums that we actually used in the recording of the album.

The top end rewards, where we would do a private party, bring the dancers, or even let someone sit in as the producer for one track and tell us what to do, went unclaimed.   Probably because of the money factor.

The ""average"" donation level for online crowd-funding is $35.00.   You get five or six that donate $5.00 or less, and one or two that give $200.00 or more...   The other 25 in that sample sized are right at the $25.00 to $40.00 range.

The most important reward levels are $20.00, $40.00, and $50.00.   If those are cool rewards, thoughtful and actually worth having, then your project has a real chance.

Our $20.00 reward was a Thanks, a CD of the album, and a download of the album.  (Got 18 backers)

We had two $50.00 rewards.  One was for a signed print of the cover, CD and download of the album, Thanks, a patch, and a button.   The other was for a VIP invitation to the release party, CD and download of the album, Thanks, a patch, and a button.  (Combined for 27 backers)

Reaching the goal, which we did in the first 5 days, was AMAZING!   Then the entire goal of the project was to make sure that everyone knew that this album WAS happening, and that every donation simply made it a better album in terms of production.   Basically, ""You are going to buy it anyway, right?  Why not sort of 'pre-buy' it, and make sure that it is great all the way around?""   And, that worked wonderfully, and we nearly doubled our initial funding goal.",0,1363244824,,0,False,1,c8vdiw1,t3_1a8cv8,t1_c8vdiw1,t1_c8vd9mo,,1431580908,2,False,IAmA,t5_2qzb6,2

True,unindel,,,"Even if Factory 1 sends out its' work wanted agent before Factory 2, all that agent did was it found a sink (a house) that had workers and told them to run the rule to create a worker agent and go find work. If those houses it ""knocked"" on happened to be closer to Factory 2 (or 3 or Shop 1) they'd go there to work first til it filled up and then move on (a sink COULD be turned off though if it was closed, as you say).

They purposely have ~1/3 of the businesses send out the ""work wanted"" ads at the same time to CAUSE the rush hour problem (it's essentially a game mechanic you're supposed to try to fix; it just might be too hard right now so they're tweaking it).

Also the idea of doing things with invisible agents first and then having ""real"" agents go through afterward isn't really possible. By definition a set of type of agents/their associated transport handler has to be the same. Trying to tie an agent to a specific sink doesn't seem to be doable because there isn't individualized logic for each agent, they're all running the same rules.

That's part of why the Firetruck/police/mass transit service problem is probably hard (the easiest tweak is to try to have the unit rule that generates them from the station push out fewer agents at a time to encourage them to spread out, which is likely how the busses start out but once they end up in a similar area they'll tend to follow the same rules and end up in their little swarms). Maybe they can change the logic for those specific agents since there's comparatively fewer of them but it'll probably be a harder change and not really something that can be used in the same way for something as ubiquitous as workers/shoppers.",0,1363251356,,0,False,1,c8vecqb,t3_1a9fz6,t1_c8vecqb,t1_c8vds06,,1431581314,4,False,SimCity,t5_2ryr3,4

Now let me point some key factors here. Even when a shitty team wins a shitty obscure competition like ""X team wins Russian League 35"" they get a top post saying ""Congradulations to X team for winning the  Russian League 35"".

Chelsea's congradulations post was downvoted, it was then argumentated on, on how they deserved fuck all. After that the top post for the day wasn't about how Chelsea won the Champions League etcetera but it was this one :

[""Breaking News: Chelsea fans have signed a 1-year extension to remain at the club after being strongly linked to Man City""] (http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/tw04t/breaking_news_chelsea_fans_have_signed_a_1year/) this post not only made /r/Soccer's front page but it also made Reddit's front page because of the votes it had at that time. How would you feel if your team won the biggest club competition and the post was ""X team's plastic fans are going to remain for one more season"". I see how every club is hated equally here, this post about any other club would never be appreciated this much and their fans would flip shit but us Chelsea fans had to bare this too.

Other posts weren't any better. Petr Cech had dived correctly for every single penalty taken against him in the final. Even saved one keeping Chelsea in the match (of Robben) [yet the posts were all praising Neuer](http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/tvekq/neuer_what_a_badass/) when Cech was the one who won his team the title, saved more penalties. Neuer was being praised for his different personality, the same personality he is being ridiculed for today. I love how the Reddit hivemind shifts when something happens to Arsenal.

Other posts which got more attention and praise were people calling Chelsea anti-football on Wiki etcetera, basically fuck Chelsea and lets bury their achievement.

I have seen some Bayern and Barcelona fans actually acknowledge our win even though they were the ones we played against but because of the general dislike for Chelsea everyone else just downplays this win.

The thing is that if you were to write a movie with this plot, all of the people hating on Chelsea right now would be crying at the end of the movie because of the underdog winning against all odds. 

""A team that was struggling in all competitions, gets its manager fired as the ex-legend of the club who had retired due to an injury after winning them the FA cup takes over to manage them and just to seek out the season. The team is already out of the Champions league but against all odds they still beat Napoli in an incredible turn of events. Then they go on to beat better team after better team with the players who were being told to leave the club and were too old became influential and finally led the team to its first Champions League trophy as one legend created most of the goals in the semis and the other legend won it for them with his last kick for the club. On the way beating two of the best clubs in the world, outscoring one with 10 men and their captain sent off."" 

This plot almost seems too good to be true and too feel good looking from a writers perspective and if it was some other small team everyone would still be singing anthems about it to this day but it was those fucker Chelski again wasn't it. Seriously fuck them!

The best part is that fans I've met after games rarely show this type of stupid butt hurt behavior. In fact I've had Tottenham fans tell me that even though they suffered because of us, we deserved to win the champions league just because of that ability to fuck everyones tactics over. There was a thread here some days ago with some idiot saying his controversial opinion was that Chelsea didn't deserve this trophy. That post belonged very well in /r/Soccercirclejerk if you've been here long enough.

________

Now some supposive level minded god sent is going to reply below me ""Every team's fans feel like they are opressed on /r/Soccer"". You really have no idea what you are talking about. It has been so bad for Chelsea that a majority of us fans have had to remove our crests and have noticed an immediate appreciation of our posts that were downvoted for no reason when they were posted before. I challenged a couple of Chelsea fans to remove their crests on /r/Soccer, Guess what? Not one of them has changed their crest back to Chelsea after that. It is that bad and for that you should be shameful.  If you doubt me then whenever there is a Chelsea crest, just notice it's unwarranted downvotes to the side regardless of the point it makes. You will be surprised at how even valuable contributions are ridiculed for thier crest here when Chelsea supporters make some of the highest number of discussion posts/match threads here.

We get it! Hating on Chelsea and blaming them for everything really does give you a huge Internet peen boost but this shit is getting seriously old. Especially when 

1) You ridicule and mock us when we win

2) You bring up us winning, put it into every other situation where some fuck uppery happens and in the end mock us/who ever you are trying to argue against

3) Say that no one mocked/mocks us for what happened and that Cheslea gets praise for what they did which I have no idea what you are basing on. A few search results will show just obviously wrong most of you are but it is hilarious seeing most of you think everyone bowed to Chelsea when they won.



I read this thread during class and it annoyed me to great extent as to what Bayern and other fans were basing this on. Obviously the only Chelsea fan who wasn't burned to the ground for speaking out that this wasn't the case was the one who had removed her crest.

True,anothergaijin,,,"I don't care about the launch issues, there are bigger problems with the game which I strongly believe will never be fixed.

We have been blatantly lied to as to why certain restrictions and conditions have been used, and the game contains an incredible list of gameplay bugs which either require ridiculous strategies to overcome, or simply have to be endured.

That a game could be released with so much of its core gameplay features broken or hidden is incredible - was this even play tested?

Here is an example:

- Water Tables not replenishing from rain fall 
- Service AI not being very efficient (Ex. 10 Firetrucks fighting a single fire) 
- Trade Depot paying double the price for half the load (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grvH2u2PPtg) 
- Recycling plant doesn't produce (alloy, plastic, metal) either fast enough or at all. 
- Over-exaggerated profits from Processor plant. 
- Gifting credits to another city sometimes doesn't make it and the funds are lost. 
- Water &amp; power sometimes take forever to fully saturate a city. 
- Trade centers won't always export - end up with full depots. 
- Street car tracks ""Not Connected"" when they are. (http://forum.ea.com/eaforum/posts/list/9351958.page) 
- Hazmat Fire Trucks do not respond to hazmat fires. 
- Sending resources to great works is highly unreliable. 
- Closing Simcity while loading a city (through the X button while in windowed mode) will cause Simcity and Origin to crash 
- Unable to claim a second city in private region. 
- Infinite demand for medium wealth residence 
- More sims move in, don't work then run out of money even though jobs are available. 
- Fire Helicopter &amp; MaxisMan not being able to extinguish fires. They sometimes ""bounce"" on the intended target without extinguishing the fire. This tends to happen on larger buildings 
- Buildings will sometimes blink. (http://forum.ea.com/eaforum/posts/list/9353612.page) 
- Not possible to place City Hall upgrades after disaster. (http://forum.ea.com/eaforum/posts/list/9353454.page) 
- Airports: Building an Air port, then building a Firestation Helipad, then closing (Not destroying), Helipads will still function normally with the Air Port closed. Note: Helipads are not able to be constructed while the Air Port has been closed. 
- Highway: Cars coming into and out-of the city prefer a single lane. 
- Radiation does not disappear, but may increase with intensity. 
- Instant High-Density: Destroying [Avenues] will cause the area to become instantly prone to high-density. 
- Profit from casinos not applying to treasury funds. (http://forum.ea.com/eaforum/posts/list/9354105.page) 
- Industry that bypasses medium value doesn't count towards unlocking things like the Processor Factory. 
- City stuck on ""Currently Processing. Come back soon to play or visit."" 
- Screen goes black when in the bulldoze menu. 
- Population/worker ratio incorrect. (Intended?) (http://forum.ea.com/eaforum/posts/list/9347991.page) 
- Buses, when full, will stop at a station that is full, unload, load, move forward slightly, then repeat. 
- All service vehicles will not cross bridges/ramps. 
- Buses/streetcars do not disappear when the corresponding building is set to ""Off"" 
- Eventually students will stop going to school. 
- High traffic on roads possibly causing sewage backup? 
- Selling of services (Water, Sewage, Power) not correctly being available to other cities. 
- Ferries sometimes cannot dock and will float around in circles. 
- Trade HQ sign not ploppable - removed when placed. 
- Electronics Dept.'s description states that it unlocks the Plastic Storage requirement at Trade Docks, but the Trade Dock does not list it as a requirement. 
- Advanced Coal Mine Shafts have a large amount of open area not originally a part of the space requirement. 
- Able to place parks and some other buildings while visiting another city. (That is not owned by yourself) 
- If a city hall upgrade section is destroyed by a disaster, a new section cannot be placed until reaching the next upgrade level. (http://forum.ea.com/eaforum/posts/list/9353454.page) 
- Sometimes a School bus will get stuck at a school and appear to be bouncing slightly and will also not allow other buses to enter. 
- Buildings sometimes are constructed on top of each other. 
- Vehicles sometimes get stuck completely, requiring you to demolish the section of road and replace it. 
- Freight and passenger ships sometimes ""dock"" in weird places such as land, or nowhere near the dock. 
- Water is completely black if not watching from the right angle? 
- Regular firetrucks put out HazMat fires. 
- Buildings providing faulty tips. (Ex. A home complaining of no shops when literally next to a shop.) 
- 'Dumb' Traffic AI. 
- Shops/industrial complaining about no workers while residential complains about no work. 
- People can still enter a private Region without being invited. 
- Even with a power deficit of -350 MW, power to buildings remain active. 
- SimCity launcher crashes if Mumble is open in the background. 
- Having more than one recycling facility causes both to not work correctly or even at all. 
- Bulldozing Mayor Mansion after upgrades resets the requirements allowing you to get more upgrades with lower approval rating. 
- Smelting plant, Electronics Factory, etc still available if you bulldoze the required headquarters. 
- Random Origin crashes in background causing SimCity to close down as it is required to play. 
- Estimated amount of resources usually way off. 
- If heavy rail crosses an avenue with a streetcar track, trains will not use the railroad or visit the train station(s) 
- Recycling in some buildings will be ignored indefinitely (occurred with more than 1 recycling so possibly related to the listed bug?) 
- No garbage appears on the garbage overlay, yet the statistic shows that not all garbage was picked up. (same with recycling) 
- ""Build an Arcology""Quest lists wrong resources needed (Processors and Crude Oil) 
- Ambulances sometimes won't leave the clinic to pick up sims. 
- Sims sometimes jump to the clinic from their homes. 
- Parks report too many undesirables or homeless, but stats show homeless at 0. 
- Getting rolled back causes Town Hall upgrades to not share between other cirty's in the region. 
- Some buildings/items disappear once plopped in a plop-able spot. No money lost, but must plop elsewhere for building to actually exist. 
- Crashing when loading several different cities per session. 
- Smog clouds appearing from non-existent cities. 
- Commercial buildings don't need industrial for freight. 
- Mission speech bubbles sometimes have programming language instead of text. (Ex: ""You have ~current_time:number~^choose:~current_time~:Hour:Hours^ Left!"" 
-Skilled and High educated workers won't commute to create High tech industries in another city. (http://answers.ea.com/t5/Miscellaneous-Issues/Bug-.../738404/highlight/false#M36309) 
- City that needs 110L of water, another one can sell 150L. First city will only buy 100L. 
- Lizard fire remains even though the lizard disappeared. (http://answers.ea.com/t5/Miscellaneous-Issues/Gian.../741128/highlight/false#M36855) 
- Track doesn't connect to anything when it should. (http://answers.ea.com/t5/Miscellaneous-Issues/Trai.../713310/highlight/false#M30881) 
- If you bulldoze cheap or nice rooms at the lowest Casino, the Casino keeps ""room"" for as many people who were in the rooms when you bulldozed them. 
- Game sometimes only handles one direction of flowing traffic at a time. 
- If the lizard disaster destroys your Department of Tourism and you build it back then landmarks and casinos no longer add revenue to the treasury.

True,themoore,,,"At first I thought OO was black magic voodoo...the kind you hear about in the Bayous of Louisiana...Anyway....

When I bought a book about it, as soon as I opened it and saw the cover it all clicked. As stupid as this sounds, think of waffles and a wafflemaker. 

All waffles are related in some way (ingredients). You can make a waffle with blueberries (waffle.content = blueberries), one with strawberries (waffle.content = strawberries). If you want to get creative you can make them into shapes (waffle.shape = square). The concept of a class is you are defining a group of objects that have common attributes. 

You can also use People as a class example. People have eye color, hair color, height, weight, skin color, education level, etc. in common. Instead of reinventing the wheel for every person you need in your program, you can define a class named Person:


    public class Person {
        private String eyeColor;
        private String hairColor;
        private int height;
    }

So far, at the time of this post, there are three people in here:

    themoore = new Person();

    KernalM = new Person();

    bitchOFH = new Person();

From here, I would imagine we all have different eye colors and hair colors, etc. I can now define those attributes to myself, and the both of you. The alternative non-OO method would look like this:

    themooreHairColor = 'this';

    themooreEyeColor = 'that';

    themooreHeight = 1000000000;

    KernalMEyeColor = 'someThingElse';


I can go on, but the OO method just makes your life easier. The syntax I was using above is Java based (very similar to PHP). So depending on the language you are using, the syntax will be different. 

Another benefit to this is consistency. You can add/remove attributes from a class as the program evolves. The consistency you get is that all objects of this class have the same types of attributes. You can even go as far as to compare different objects of the same class together to find differences, etc. 

I hope this has helped.

True,mathbaker,,,"I'll give it a try, but I'm not sure what your asking, and my understanding of symbolic interactionism is shaky

Individuals interact with and react to symbols in unique ways. There are societal norms for interpreting symbols, but they are probably not as rigid and common as many would like to believe. So, reality is socially constructed by individuals (there is no true, one reality).

So, are you trying to look at how others in your photos construct reality based on what you see them doing in the photos, or are you thinking about how you construct reality based on what you see and how you react to the photos? Or, are you comparing your reality to their reality?

Maybe what you are trying to get at is your community is your unique community made up from your perceptions and interactions. It does not really exist, but is just one reality (your reality) and others in your ""community"" may see a different reality?

Or perhaps the reality of your community can be interpreted differently if you use different photos, or use the same photos in a different order, or crop the photos differently (what if you had framed it differently, and could now see the garbage dump next to the mansion)?


If these are photos you took, it might be interesting to send someone else out to take photos in the same locations and compare how they frame the photos, and how the different perspective leads to a completely different version of reality.

Start: ..

* 5 Coal Mines - Export All
* Get smelting plant (delete metal addon, max on alloy), import Ore from trade two trade depot, export alloy
* Get Recycling Station, start stocking Plastics, keep exporting Alloy
* Upgrade to Trade Port, still exporting coal and alloy.
* Plop Processor plant, retain all previous coal and smelting plants. Importing Ore from Trade Port, Plastic from Trade Depot (storage fills at 8,000 plastic). Export Processor.
* Plop additional processor plant, keep all previous. Still importing Ore and Plastic from same locations. Still exporting Processors. Ensure that roads from trade depot/ports are clear so mats can flow between all.
* Plop first CE plant - again, every plant is still active so I'm still just importing Ore and Plastic for my trade flow.
* Plop additional Smelting Plant for the alloy, destroy 1 Coal mine. (I don't think I really needed this one, it was kind of a stopgate measure until I fully committed to removing all my coal mines.). Plot additional processor and CE, plastic now imported from Trade Port
 
And then just kept the cycle going as the mats required. Currently I've removed all my coal mines except for one, I'm importing a small amount of alloy (via trade depot) to keep the mats in flow - without this, there's an hour or so where the trucks are stuck in traffic trying to deliver mats. I have 4 processor plants, and 3 CE plants. I think currently per day I make ~3.0 mil.

While initially I kept the smelting up to get the alloy, I'm not sure I'll keep more than the one plant. Seems like just importing/exporting gets you more, though I'm not sure right now.

You do not know if she still wants to have sex with you. You are not a mind reader.

True,[deleted],,,"Yeah no problem about it, I have all night.

I love his stuff - I love the Japanese and their culture too, I even had a Japanese girlfriend. Very cute. And this song is fucking awesome. I find it quite emotional too, probably from the use of awesome chords and melody.

Thoughts on the stuff? I can't really fault him. I wouldn't know what you want me do say though, you need a tutorial on his stuff? Or do you just want to SOUND like him?

He is very structured in his songs. When you listen to a song like that, it sounds incredibly complex. But it really isn't. The vocals mask his simple performance. However, he uses straight BASSLINES that SYNC WITH THE MELODY. Synth SOUNDS take a huge part of that too. 

I will make something similar to his track so I can give an example.

[Here it is](https://soundcloud.com/ubida/perfume-fake-it-reddit/s-7rkU4).

I had trouble recreating the melody, due to given time and circumstance. He uses pitch envelopes to create the lead sound you're hearing.

I've noticed on melodies - you don't even have to change the notes when you hit a different chord. The chord itself changes the sound of the melody. That's the effect he is giving in his song.

Hope this helps. Any sounds I've made, I can give tuts on them if you need me to!

True,neerajman,,,"The thing is, the lazy college senior, 10 guy, and racist Randall memes could be replaced with female versions of those tropes without significantly changing the memes themselves (i.e., lazy college senior could be an angry female student sitting at the bar and not doing her paper, and that would not drastically change the interpretation or applicability of the text).

Try replacing Good Girl Gina with a guy, however, and you'll immediately see that the meme falls apart. This is because the meme is sexist. Sexism isn't as black and white as captioning a GGGina meme with ""Likes You, Makes a Sandwich"" (though you won't have to work hard to find such captions on GGGina). GGGina, SSM, and most other female specific memes not only get at that the trope's personality but parts of that person's personality/behavior that are determined by the gender of the meme trope. Most male-centric-tropes on memes don't actually get at that trope for being a guy (except perhaps Scumbag Steve).

For example, GGGina's supposed to the be perfect ""woman"" while GGGreg is the perfect ""person."" Browse GGGina for a while and you'll see very little that isn't specific to a woman's socially-constructed POV. The overall themes on GGGina are blowjobs, dating, lack-of-friend-zoning, sexual favors, etc. For GGGreg, however, the themes have very little to do with male-specific behaviors/traits (muscles, manliness, cunnilingus, or whatever the hell you want) and instead focus upon human decency (being charitable, a good friend). 

***TL;DR***: GGGina is sexist because the meme's text/character only looks at ""Gina"" as a sexualized woman, while GGGreg just makes Greg the embodiment of Jesus without tying it specifically to his manhood. 

EDIT: Remember, my point here is not that the makers of the memes themselves are inherently-sexist woman beaters; I can't judge someone by the memes they post for karma. What I'm trying to get across is that the memes are sexist because (most) female specific memes limit the character within the meme to being a woman, and often play upon aspects of being a woman in unflattering manners but the male characters (mostly) exist independent of the aspects of one's character that comes with a penis and testosterone. GGGreg makes the idea that a good person can be someone who smokes me up, gives me rides, helps me in times of needs, has my back, feeds me, etc. (a multitude of ways in which someone can be good to me). Once GGGreg becomes GGGina, however, the fact that person in the picture is female changes the meme to an example of how Reddit collectively envisions a perfect person once that person is female (blowjobs, sandwiches, and doesn't talk back, amirite?). Think about the fact that the top-voted GGGregs span a variety of topics and actions that revolve around being a good person, but (virtually all) top rated GGGina's involve her acting without her own sense of agency and providing a sexual favor. You can probably picture a GGGreg with 1000+ Karma with the lines ""You're too high to pick up your Grandma, He does it for you."" Now someone COULD captionate a GGGina with the same text, but which of the two do you think is more likely to get that 1000+ Karma around here? Now imagine a GGGreg with ""Walks in on you  jerking it, takes off top to sustain your boner"" and a GGGina with the same text; which is going to get the 1000+ Karma? And at this point, if you can't see why people consider the meme to be sexist, I can't help you.

I love her by doing the dishes every night, making my son's lunch for school and taking out the trash without being asked.  I love her by telling her she's beautiful even when she feels like she isn't.  

I love her by choosing to put aside what I want to do for something she wants to do when appropriate and by actually listening to her when she talks about how hard her day was, even if I feel like my day was harder.  

**Love is not a feeling**.  Infatuation and lust are feelings.

Long story short: when you reset the game while saving, the game incorrectly thinks that you have 255 pokemon.  When you attempt to arrange those pokemon, you're actually fudging parts of the game's memory.  A little fudge here and there lets you do something similar with your items.  
By strategically arranging garbage pokemon and rearranging/dropping garbage items, you can trick the game into running any bit of machine code you want.

In this case, the machine code allowed the author to inject gameboy code using the buttons, resulting in a fun visual experience.

Send forth the best ye breed

Go bind your sons to exile

To serve your captives' need;

To wait in heavy harness,

On fluttered folk and wild

Your new-caught, sullen peoples,

Half-devil and half-child.




Take up the White Man's burden

In patience to abide,

To veil the threat of terror

And check the show of pride;

By open speech and simple,

An hundred times made plain

To seek another's profit,

And work another's gain.



Take up the White Man's burden

The savage wars of peace

Fill full the mouth of Famine

And bid the sickness cease;

And when your goal is nearest

The end for others sought,

Watch sloth and heathen Folly

Bring all your hopes to nought.



Take up the White Man's burden

No tawdry rule of kings,

But toil of serf and sweeper

The tale of common things.

The ports ye shall not enter,

The roads ye shall not tread,

Go mark them with your living,

And mark them with your dead.



Take up the White Man's burden

And reap his old reward:

The blame of those ye better,

The hate of those ye guard

The cry of hosts ye humour

(Ah, slowly!) toward the light:

""Why brought he us from bondage,

Our loved Egyptian night?""



Take up the White Man's burden

Ye dare not stoop to less

Nor call too loud on Freedom

To cloke your weariness;

By all ye cry or whisper,

By all ye leave or do,

The silent, sullen peoples

Shall weigh your gods and you.



Take up the White Man's burden

Have done with childish days

The lightly proferred laurel,

The easy, ungrudged praise.

Comes now, to search your manhood

Through all the thankless years

Cold, edged with dear-bought wisdom,

The judgment of your peers!

True,wraith985,,,"If this is true (and the response from Jason Lake seems to imply that it is), this is just straight up stupid. This kind of shit is exactly why in basically every other competitive endeavor, tournament organizers are not allowed to participate in their own tournaments, or at least are not given administrative decisionmaking power over it. Biased garbage like this almost inevitably results. 

Jason ~~Lake~~ Bass tells Bye Team they have to reschedule because fans want to see games, not forfeits. The punishment for not agreeing to a forced reschedule is...uh, getting forfeited out of the tournament. Fucking hilarious.

There is literally no excuse for this. The match was scheduled well in advance for a specific date and time. It's not like there was incorrect information supplied to Riser. It was simply a fuck-up by a complexity member, plain and simple. Riser not showing up has nothing to do with Bye Team, and they are under no obligation to shuffle their schedules around to accommodate his mistake. At the very least, coL should have been forced to play without him. If LeBron James shows up an hour late for a game, the Heat don't get to whine and bitch and tell their opponents to ""just reschedule"" because it's ""just an hour"". Yes, the fans want to see LeBron. No, that doesn't actually mean anything as far as the RULES are concerned. Bottom line is Complexity wrote shitty rules for their tournament. Maybe next time they should specify that forfeit rules are for prelims only, instead of changing the rules mid-tournament in a way that coincidentally benefits the team sponsored by the organization running the tournament. 

Complexity broke a rule and then, rather than accept the penalty stated in the rules, called their sugar daddies to make it go away. Bye Team had no obligation to accommodate complexity, but were railroaded into it under duress from the CEO of the sponsoring team. That's all there is to it. It doesn't matter that they're the worse team, or that they got stomped when the match got played, or that they got their money anyway, or if you find it personally distasteful for an end-of-tournament match to be resolved on a forfeit. Complexity broke a rule and they should have had to accept the penalty, but they didn't because they were in tight with the organizers. That's as shady as it gets and no esports fan should stand for that kind of nonsense.

True,SoWhatComesNext,,,"You know it won't last. It's just a matter of time... which sucks to say, but it's true. Before you know it, you'll find yourself laughing at their relationship waiting for the moment it blows up in their faces. Then, as you laugh to yourself about how you're actually better off while they sit on a time bomb, you start to forget to care about whether they're still together or not. Given enough time, you think only of a couple of good memories from when things were good and you actually start hoping they're doing better for themselves. There will still be a part of you that despises him, that knows you could never trust him again and probably wouldn't go out of your way to speak to him (if you aren't on speaking terms) and I think it's important to remember those lessons. Is there a chance of remorse? Always, but it sounds like he's in over his head. It'll be a long while before you get your apology.

It'll feel good to not be alone, but it doesn't take long before some of these people show their true colors. You'll see it this time around. You'll end it quickly and clearly if you follow your instincts. Hopefully you'll spend some time single, out of serious relationships for a while and make some new friends.

He gives 4 explanations as to why violence has declined

&gt; The first is, maybe Thomas Hobbes got it right. He was the one who said that life in a state of nature was ""solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short."" Not because, he argued, humans have some primordial thirst for blood or aggressive instinct or territorial imperative, but because of the logic of anarchy. In a state of anarchy, there's a constant temptation to invade your neighbors preemptively, before they invade you. 

Globally many governments now work together. 

#

&gt; The second explanation is that in many times and places, there is a widespread sentiment that life is cheap. In earlier times, when suffering and early death were common in one's own life, one has fewer compunctions about inflicting them on others. And as technology and economic efficiency make life longer and more pleasant, one puts a higher value on life in general. 

Life is better for us so it is valued more.
#

&gt; A third explanation invokes the concept of a nonzero-sum game, and was worked out in the book ""Nonzero"" by the journalist Robert Wright. Wright points out that in certain circumstances, cooperation or non-violence can benefit both parties in an interaction, such as gains in trade when two parties trade their surpluses and both come out ahead, or when two parties lay down their arms and split the so-called peace dividend that results in them not having to fight the whole time.

Ties in with the first. 
#

&gt; The fourth explanation is captured in the title of a book called ""The Expanding Circle,"" by the philosopher Peter Singer, who argues that evolution bequeathed humans with a sense of empathy, an ability to treat other peoples' interests as comparable to one's own. Unfortunately, by default we apply it only to a very narrow circle of friends and family. People outside that circle are treated as sub-human, and can be exploited with impunity. But, over history, the circle has expanded. One can see, in historical record, it expanding from the village, to the clan, to the tribe, to the nation, to other races, to both sexes, and, in Singer's own arguments, something that we should extend to other sentient species. The question is, if this has happened, what has powered that expansion? 

I think this is the most valuable explanation. More and  more we are treating people as equals and include them in our circle of valued people.

True,Wulibo,,,"I'm gonna butt in here.

You seem to fall into the most harmful and scary popular fallacy (in my opinion) regarding law and the government. Once somebody is a criminal, they do not stop being a human being. Maybe someone who has killed deserves death, maybe someone who has committed theft deserves some of their time stolen away, among every other thing society has decided is criminal. These people lose specific rights of the innocent when they cease to uphold the standard given unto them as members of society. However, no matter how horrifying, evil, or icky someone's actions have been, they never cease to be a thinking, feeling human being. I don't care about deserve. Maybe criminals deserve to be punished, fine. But that's not what the justice system is about. Criminals *need* to be punished, and the legal system has very specific reasons why.

Sentencing is based on the following: Denunciation, Deterrence, Separation of offenders, Rehabilitation, Reparation, and Promotion of responsibility. Nowhere in there is Punishment. Never do we *ever* do something to our fellow man to cause them pain. We put dangerous people in jail so that they cannot harm the innocent. We place punishment on people who act out of line so that others will understand it is out of line. We put deviants through systems so that they will come out better, more productive people.

There are huge chunks of law made specifically for people who have earned the label of ""criminal."" Throughout history, many societies have been cruel to their prisoners, and unanimously this behaviour is perceived as evil. So, we have certain rules around how criminals can be treated. Remember that ""criminal"" includes anybody who has smoked weed once, who has struck another human being, who has written something untrue and inflammatory about someone. Do we throw these people in the pit with multiple-murder-rapists? No! Why not? Because there are rules regarding what can be done to these people!

I know you're thinking that this doesn't apply to rapists, they've done something horrendous. In a lot of cases this is true, yeah, some of these people have committed an act so vile and abhorrent that they should be thrown in a hole with no hope of redemption. However, there is no clear line between petty criminal and aberration against humanity, so who gets to draw it? The answer is nobody. These people, again, are still people, and we will treat them with the same standard that is deserved by any human. I don't care what appalling thing you managed to commit that I could not possibly conceive of, you are still of the same build as me, and I will accept you as such.

As for it being the public's job/right to determine the guilt of another person, again, that's the very reason we have law. If we left it to the mob, we'd be following a system known as Anarchy. Vigilantism is rampant towards those accused of the truly monstrous crimes like rape and murder, and until a court, be it by a jury of peers or a judge alone, decides definitively that, beyond a reasonable doubt, they deserve protection from such extremists by any means necessary, the *very least* of which includes not displaying their identity in flashing lights.

This isn't even just about ""think of the people who are innocent,"" it's about ""if people are capable of what this person did, imagine what other people are capable of doing to *them*.""

Ok, Here's what you do: Exfoliate, then rub the area with baby oil before you shave to soften the hair and skin. Shave using a men's razor (one with four blades) and men's moisturizing shaving cream. Since they are made for faces, they are extra gentle. Dab some rubbing alcohol on the skin after you shave to kill bacteria and close your pores. Then apply deodorant (an unscented Dove stick works best) liberally. This will keep you dry down there so you won't chafe and prevents razor bumps. You will have the smoothest giney ever.

True,indpndnt,,Math - Engineering - Stats,"&gt; We started with just the forces on the forearm and had to find center of mass of the upper arm and transfer everything else down through the elbow and to the shoulder.

Now it makes more sense. I was wondering how you got that diagram! If the forces/moments on the upper part have just been transferred to the lower part, then you only have to worry about that moment at base (assuming that the X and Y forces will be reacted by the socket). 

Although that's not technically correct procedure (which is why you are getting a wall of text :P). In your diagram, you have an equilibrium of X and Y forces that didn't take into account the deltoid force! As soon as you balance the moment with the deltoid force, you'll end up giving the system a net x and y force. I'm not a biomech person, but here's how I would approach this kind of problem using basic statics.

First, I would assume that the shoulder socket is unable to resist moments, but can resist all shear forces (this is called a pin joint, hinge joint, or a revolute joint in statics textbooks). With that assumption, you only have to balance the moments about the pin joint to put the system in equilibrium. You'd get the moment by finding the contribution of the forces on the forearm to the moment, the moments of the forearm itself, and the contribution of the weight forces at the cg to the moment. (At this point I wouldn't have even calculated the X and Y forces at the shoulder). [I uploaded a picture of this procedure, which is so very fuzzy and probably illegible](http://i.imgur.com/0dUsctz.jpg) so you could have something to reference against. I left the quantities that I didn't know as variables that I hope are obvious :P

The note that I made to the right side is ""Every force &lt;is&gt; drawn in the positive direction. The moment at B is drawn &lt;in the&gt; negative &lt;direction&gt;, which isn't good form"". This is basically just a reminder to be consistent with direction and signs. My sign conventions for rotating the forces into the frame of the arm is also sloppy, because I just eyeballed the directions of the components of each force and put in minus signs so it would end up correct. 

Once you had that moment, you could solve for the deltoid force like you have done. Once you did that, you could find the resulting shear forces at the shoulder that properly takes into account all the x and y forces in that section of the arm. Doing it any other way would put the system into disequilibrium, which would violate the assumption of the problem (which is to find the force that stabilizes the system). 

This is probably why your value is so close to the correct one, because the shoulder forces don't matter for the moment around the shoulder that the deltoid is cancelling out. 

&gt; We summed the net x and y forces at the shoulder to 0, which is how we got those values.

That's not correct to do, unless those sums take into account the x and y forces of the deltoid. I really can't stress that enough.

Each spider's individual temperament can vary like with any animal, and some species are considered to be more aggressive than others usually (like a Chilean Rosehair, one of the most common starter tarantulas, is usually quite calm and easy to handle, as compared to a Cobalt Blue which can be pretty feisty and mean).

They make nice pets though, even the ones that aren't really nice enough to hold are really interesting to watch, and a lot of species have very striking coloring or produce masses of webs in their terrariums. And a lot are relatively low maintenance as well.

True,tomdarch,,,"&gt;  But he came to power **not by using threats**, but by using promises. Not by **scaring his people into obeying him**, but by making his followers believe in him.

That is actually false, and it's an important thing to understand about the rise of Fascism.  By the 1930s, the Nazis had organized thugs who used violence and terrorism against their political opponents.  The violence was probably less of a factor than the rhetoric and promises, but it was an inherent part of the political movement across Europe.  Yes, the promises and imagery were appealing to some, but by a certain point, resisting the Fascists meant that thugs were going to vandalize your business, home or office, and you were going to be beaten or worse.  It's easier to win elections when you have put your opponents candidates and organizers in the hospital and torn up their campaign headquarters.

edit: First, thanks for the Reddit gold (although, I have no idea what it does!?!)  It's kinda sad that it was necessary to state that the Nazis, like the other European Fascist movements used violence and threats to gain power.

Second, I was thinking about the period leading up to the ""Night of the Long Knives"" in 1934.  Obviously, when you murder 85 prominent people (both rivals within the Nazi party and prominent political opponents) and arrest hundreds (or thousands?) of people, it's pretty damn obvious that you are using violence to take and keep power.  It's the several years leading up to 1934, where the Nazi party used thugs and attacks to gain power.  Yes, on one level ""the Nazis and Hitler came to power through democratic elections"" but we need to not forget about the violence that paralleled the rest of the political process.  Also, I like to point out that for Americans, the rise and actions of the Nazis in Germany is so extreme that it is difficult to learn from in comparison to our politics today.  Rather we should all look at and learn from the rise of Mussolini and the Italian Fascists - I see many more terrifying parallels between their history and some of our politics today.",0,1363329917,,0,1363369116,1,c8w02m3,t3_1abohh,t1_c8w02m3,t1_c8vz7sh,,1431591746,353,False,videos,t5_2qh1e,353

True,ae3nn,intermediate,[Large Band Large Bust],"From what I understand, trans women sometimes have different fitting issues than cis women, in that the breasts often sit differently on the chest (far apart is one of the commonly mentioned differences).  

You might want to look at [Chrysalis](http://www.lingerietalk.com/2012/03/26/lingerie-news/were-done-hiding-a-first-lingerie-line-for-transgendered-women.html).

If you're looking for shallow with a broad base, Venusian Glow has a blog post listing some models which are good for this.  You could look up some of these on Bratabase to see how wide the center gore is, and try some with wider center gores.

Because you don't have a lot of padding, you might find 28 a bit uncomfortable.  Muscular or bony women often want to size up in the band to get a more comfortable fit.  You will probably also find it a bit easier to find a 30D than a 28DD.

There isn't really much you can do to stop your bra fit from changing if your body is fluctuating a lot.  Sometimes rixie clips or bra extenders can help if it is the underbust size that changes, but when the cup size is changing, my best advice is to buy cheap (scour Brastop/eBay.co.uk/Amazon/Nordstrom Rack for good deals), buy a minimum number and wear them more often until your size settles, and resell your gently used bras on /r/braswap or Bratabase.   Try the Busty Resources wiki in the sidebar for more shopping suggestions. 

Note that when you're talking about bras no longer fitting in a few months that bras generally have to be replaced every 6 months (maybe after a year if you have many bras in rotation) because they lose elasticity and stop supporting.  So if you get 4 months of use out of a bra before it stops fitting, the lifespan isn't being drastically shortened.

Unmolded bras are generally better for finding your correct fit because they don't disguise the shape of your breast.  I'd start with unpadded and lightly padded bras when you're not sure of your exact size.

Also, if your ribcage measures 28 it isn't wider than average.  There are more 28s out there than most people think, but I don't believe that the most common band size is smaller than 28.",0,1363341392,,0,1363341763,1,c8w1lw5,t3_1acbrd,t1_c8w1lw5,t3_1acbrd,,1431592469,57,False,ABraThatFits,t5_2s8kf,57

True,morganshoal,,,"Honeybees are fascinating, and there are still mysteries about why/how they do some things. Like start swarming. We just don't know how they make that decision, and it does look like it's related to the size if the colony relative to the nesting space, but there's more to it.


The workers seem to initiate the process, by making new queens—maybe a dozen or so. They take normal eggs from the queen (who is more accurately called a mother, laying 1500 eggs a day), and put them in a specially constructed honeycomb cells that they built, then feed them a special diet to raise those eggs as a fertile queens instead of sterile workers. Before the new queens hatch from their cocoons, the workers—thousands of them—start to shake the old queen.


Just a little at first, they walk up to her, put their front legs on her shoulders, and shake her. Every time she turns around, these workers who normally care for her and help her and feed her are shaking her. More and more, until she's being harassed by shaking. The vibe in the hive is tense now, things are unsettled, and everyone is on edge. But the queen is starting to get in really good shape, exercised by the workers until she's ready to fly with them to go find a new home.


Just before the new queens hatch, about 60% of the workers and the old queen leave. It is sudden and irreversible. They take off, leaving the hive and leaving the remaining bees to create a new colony. They'll never go back.


This is, I've always thought, an elegant gesture by nature: imagine your parents saying, ""Hey, look, you're grown now, and you can start your own family. We've lived much longer and have more experience and money, and stable jobs, I mean, we've figured things out. So, instead of sending you out into the world, inexperienced and ill-equipped, we'll go. Finding a new home and a new neighborhood is difficult and makes you vulnerable; we've got a better shot at doing it right. We are leaving you the house, which we know is a good one, and which we've furnished. So you've got a real head start here, and we think this is the best way to assure that you will survive and thrive. Goodbye, this house is yours. Please do the same for your kids.""


That's what honeybees do. The *old* queen leaves. 


The moment they are gone, those 10,000-20,000 bees will no longer protect the old hive, no longer gather food for the brood there; they'll never return. They fly away in a spectacular buzzing cloud, then alight on a branch nearby to reconnoiter. OP's bee-ball is a swarm at this stage. Then the coolest thing happens. A small number of bees head out to find a new hive.


These scout bees head out in all directions, looking for a good home. They check out spaces, taking note of entrance size and direction, volume of the inside space, height off the ground, and all sorts of other characteristics of the spaces they find. They measure the place. They consider the light. They check out the neighborhood. Just like we do. When a bee finds a decent place, she heads back to the bee-ball, and reports. She grades the space on a scale of hipster-headnod to lost-in-the-music: a little bit of dancing is an ok place, lots of dancing is 'you gotta see this place, seriously you guys it's perfect'. They tell the other bees where it is (in dance!) and the others go check it out, a few at a time. Then *they* come back and they're all like ""nah, don't bother, I've seen better"" or ""she was totally right, you gotta check this place out"" and so more go, and meanwhile there might be a dozen places being checked out, and everyone is leaving and coming back and talking about all the possible new homes, and making arguments about which one is best, and basically *voting*. Until they reach a consensus. They've made their arguments and listened to everyone else's, and then they agree on one. Then, they go.


The moment they've agreed on the best place, the bee-ball comes apart and they fly—in a bee-line—straight to their new home. Honeybees do not fuck around. They go straight there and start making comb, so the queen can start laying eggs, and the foragers can start bringing in nectar to make honey. 


Meanwhile, back in the old hive, remember that when we left them, they didn't have a queen. The old queen left, and the new ones hadn't been born. Very shortly after the swarm leaves, the new queens start to hatch. They are inside cocoons inside their special queen cells, which are capped. They hatch out of the cocoon, then bust through the cap. Which isn't easy. They may be queens, but they are babies, and it takes a lot of strength to break through the cap. But honeybees do not, remember, fuck around, and queens are very badass: they are born strong and ready to fight.  And they do not tolerate competition. Two queens meeting will fight to the death. But the first queen out won't even wait for that: she methodically goes and finds all the other queen cells, and kills her competition before it hatches. With her stinger, which isn't barbed, and which she can use again and again in a bloody slaughter-murder-sorocide fest to establish her dominance. If, while she's busy killing their sisters in their sleep, one of the other queens uses the distraction to get out of her cell, then it's a battle royal. 


It's a kind of magic. There can be only one. And this rage that seems to last a thousand years will soon be gone. 


One queen, one mother. The strongest queen and mother. The best queen and mother. The colony is whole, new, and gets to work.


Where once there was one, now there are two colonies. The evolutionary reason for the split is propagation of the species and genetic diversity. Honeybees are like human cells: each one is meaningful only as part of the whole, and cannot survive on its own. The organism is the colony, as the organism is the human. Sure, the queen lays eggs and replenishes lost bees and grows the colony all the time, just like our bodies do with cells. But real reproduction—genetic reproduction—is making new colonies like we make new humans. I'm not going to tell you how we make new humans because you might be too young. But I will tell you that swarming is nature's way of propagating the honeybee species and of assuring genetic diversity and, ultimately, adaptation and survival of the species. 


That new ass-kicker queen in the old hive celebrates her bloody victory by going out, for the first time, to a singles ~~bar~~ zone—where all the male bees are cruising—and getting laid. Repeatedly. With as many male bees as she can find. She fucks while flying, on the wing about a mile up. Without protection.


When she's done, she brings home a sack full of about 6,000,000 sperms, a mixed bag from lots of different drones from lots of different colonies, and starts to lay 1500 genetically diverse eggs every frickin day.


Source: **Honeybee Democracy**, by Thomas Seeley. Buy it, read it! (Plus, have pulled many hundreds of thousands of bees out of people's houses and carefully put them in new hives. Love 'em.)


PS: Commercial beekeeping management techniques typically suppress swarming in favor of artificial breeding, cloning, and introduction of foreign queens. They prevent the queens from fighting, so they can keep all of the queens and sell each of them. This is one of the reasons the honeybees are suffering so profoundly as a species.",0,1363347976,,0,False,3,c8w2c2t,t3_1abw47,t1_c8w2c2t,t1_c8vy4ly,,1431592822,2466,False,WTF,t5_2qh61,2466
True,djabor,,,"EDIT: wow, my first comment and got gold :) thank you whoever you are!
 
I strongly disagree with the apartheid label.
The gaza strip and west bank used to have a far more open border with israel. Palestinians could work in israel, could travel there for medical care and other important stuff.
Then came terrorism, where Arafat decided that violence would be the only way to force a palestinian state. In the mean time the situation just got worse and Arafat got richer.
Israel had no choice but to restrict movement as there would have been no justification whatsoever to just let them abuse these basic freedoms for the sake of these freedoms. Abuse that cost lives, may i remind you.
 
In the meantime, many palestinians are living inside israel, enjoying the exact same rights as other israelis, vote, work, own businesses and even join the army (if they wish to do so). There is no racism at play, the situation has developed gradually from reasonable to bad with terror (from israels point of view) being the main catalyst.

The palestinian terrorists/freedom fighters, however, being such an unconventional enemy, have made it nearly impossible to defend israel in a way that some person living in a war-free western country to deem acceptable.
 
Children as young as 8 being strapped with explosives and sent to checkpoints (checkpoint that would not have existed if it wasn't for this form of terrorism in the first place).So yes, innocent children are needlessly being interrogated and held. But on the flipside, the method saves both israeli lives and the lives of palestinian children who were sent with a belt of TNT to blow up. You may not agree with the tactic, but what alternative have they been given? The innocent palestinians suffer from the choices made by the terrorist factions.
 
Additionally i want to correct some misconceptions you raise here as being factual:
1) since 2013 israel has been producing fresh water at a surplus becoming an exporter of water. They actually provide water to gaza and the west bank, where there would have been a shortage.
2) construction is actually limited in the same way in israel, everyone needs approval, where palestinians get their approvals in most cases, just not where potentially dangerous materials come into play. This is a situation that, once again, has been a result of abuse of aid and liberties. At some point you will stop getting you neighbor matches if he keeps burning down your house.
3) The humanitarian tragedy does not exist in the west bank and is a point of dispute in gaza. If you would walk around in gaza you would quickly understand that they have it better than 90% of the arab world and even better than some first world countries.
4) gaza borders not only to israel but also to egypt, who have an almost identical policy towards them. Why does nobody raise questions there?

I do agree that the palestinians are victims, i just think people are pointing their finger at the wrong bad guy. Their leaders are corrupt and cause more and more harm to their innocent population by their actions.

What i do not understand is why people seem to preoccupied with the palestians in gaza, while palestian refugees in lebanon, syria, egypt and jordan have it far worse. There they don't have basic human rights, no rights to posessions, jobs and travel. That is the true apartheid palestinians suffer.

If people really want to improve the lives of palestinians, they should start with preventing their abusive leaders from stealing away billions of international aid for weapons. Weapons, which in turn are used to attack israel which results in more sanctions. Until this stops, there will be no end to the cycle of putting the palestinian people in the sandwich between their terrorist leaders and israeli defence forces.",0,1363350456,,0,1363354674,1,c8w2p72,t3_1abnyi,t1_c8w2p72,t1_c8vytop,,1431592991,17,False,worldnews,t5_2qh13,17
True,Humdrum_Throne,,,"It's essentially because the character dynamic was developed poorly. Anyone feel free to correct me if I'm wrong on anything, it's early in the morning where I am. This is the sort of thing you can write quite a bit on, but I'm going to try to keep it short.

 Think about the relationship the Doctor has always had with his companions. It's a very playful, ""close friend"" sort of situation, but there's always this element of authority and distance. He knows more than they ever will, he's seen more than they ever will, he's done more than they ever will, and he's not completely proud of a lot of it. He's generally right about things, not necessarily always and he is also consistently willing to accept new ideas, but for the most part he'll be the one who knows what's happening. In that sort of way it becomes similar to a parental relationship, and that aspect is an important element in the character of 'The Doctor'. 

When Moffat took over the show, he made a few mistakes in the initial development of Eleven's character. One of the tricky things about writing the Doctor is the need to balance his overt compassion, excitement, and determination with his bitterness, self-doubt, and the somewhat jaded nature of his wisdom (He's seen and done *quite* a bit) without it getting all muddled up. Those are the two things primarily that weren't done well in this situation. Eleven is much more prone to small, petty outbursts and snapping (Remember in [The Beast Below](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beast_Below) when he gets frustrated and confused and caught up in his dilemma and begins to chastise Amy, who ultimately solves the problem?). With Eleven there's, for some reason, a fair portion of integral knowledge that's missing (Like in [The Lodger](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lodger_%28Doctor_Who%29) when he doesn't *know what the fuck football is* even though he has a rather intimate knowledge of human culture). It sort of brings down his ability to legitimately bear respect from the viewer, and turns him more into a novel oddity than a more intriguing, serious one.

 Because of these characteristics, he doesn't conduct the same air of authority, mystery, and respect like previous Doctors have, which skews the character dynamic. Moffat ends up having him rely on constant espousal of his gimmicks and catchphrase (bow tie, hats, ""I'm very clever"", etc.) It also doesn't help the situation when you have a companion openly, overtly try to go at it with the Doctor on literally the night before her wedding.

True,skycake,,,"On March 15, 2009, during launch preparations for STS-119, a free-tailed bat, injured and frightened, latched on to the foam insulation of Space Shuttle Discovery's external propellant tank. His wing was broken and thus his life would soon end. But in a moment of bravery and ambition, his little claws buried deep into his foamy vessel, he became master of his own fate. He would not succumb to starvation or predation. No, he would soar into bat legend. He would touch the stars.

As Discovery's rockets roared to life, he held his ground, although he was certainly afraid. In his adrenaline-soaked brain he may have thought, ""Can a bat still be brave if he's afraid?"" I imagine he heard the answer echo, as though off the walls of his dark, cavernous home:

""That is the only time a bat can be brave.""

Once the shuttle's rockets began pushing its massive frame toward the heavens, he turned his little eyes skyward. The shuttle gained speed, terrifying speed, and he knew he would soon slip the surly bonds of the Earth. His grip would eventually fail as Discovery sped faster than a bullet toward the inky, Stygian blackness of space. Although his small body was incinerated by the bright hellfire of the shuttle's exhaust, his legend will burn brighter.

Genuinely fun nights getting drunk and making obscene jokes with people you will never meet in real life, but at the same time are really close friends with. The sense of accomplishment when 25 of you finally take down a new boss you've been working on for a couple of weeks, and everyone worked together seamlessly.

About a year ago I found out my old raid leader, a really sweet and kind woman named Roksi, passed away. She had been fighting MS for years, and it finally took her. Although it had been years since I had played, I felt a sadness that took me completely by surprise. She was one of the nicest and most genuine people I have ever had the pleasure of knowing, even if I never got to meet her in real life. Just because it was under the guise of a video game, doesn't mean she was any less of a friend to me or I mourn her any less. I hate how people marginalize the game like that. Yes, there are people who play too much and throw away their lives to it. Yes, there are socially awkward people who find sanctuary in the game. But there are also a bunch of normal people who play in a healthy manner and have a great time, make genuine friends, and get amazing amounts of joy out of it.

Although I don't play anymore and haven't in years, I loved World of Warcraft. It was a great game, and I had some great times with some awesome people because of it.

True,Almafeta,gilded quality l-24c0x0 c-ch66voi,IMMA TILT THAT SHIT,"Oh, boy.  I shouldn' have let *that* slip.  Well, as long as I've let the biggest news slip, I might as well explain.  The reason we aren't on the Moon or Mars yet is...  well, we got distracted by even *better* things.  And what could be better?  Computers and robots!

First, start with computers.  They're not like the computers of today.  Have you seen a TV, Jimmy?  Oh, your friend Tommy has one?  They're cool, aren't they?  Now, imagine a TV that showed whatever you wanted, whenever you wanted.  That's keen, right?  But it's even *better* than being able to see Howdy Doody any time of the day.  Computers let you do more than one thing at a time.  Every program can do some things, and you can run dozens of programs at once if you want.  So, you could be talking with your friend after school, while you do your homework, while you play your music.  Headphones get cheaper, too, so nobody has to know you're listening to rock and roll.  And all these computers are networked together.  It's as much fun as having a pen pal, but as fast and simple as talking to them face to face!

And because everyone wants one, everyone wants to make them, and they get cheap.  For example... this is kind of *verboten* for me to show you, but take a look at this, Jimmy.  This little doohickey here *literally* has more computing power than every other computer on Earth, combined, and multiplied by a thousand.  It's called a ""cell phone,"" and they're about as expensive as a record.  Almost everyone has one.  No, they don't use the kind of cells they use in biology...  don't distract me, Jimmy, I don't have *that* much time here.  Now, even with this computer that can do everything every computer on Earth can do, most of us still go for a bigger one, these computers called 'desktops'.  Because they fit on top of your desk.  They're about as expensive as a record player.  They let you play games, and not simple games like Clue or Monopoly, but *beautiful* games.  Games that are complex as chess, and as beautiful as a night as the movies.  Stories of adventure, horror, comedy, joy, romance, war, fantasy, science fiction.  Computer games are the art form that will define our generations.

Oh...  buy stocks in Apple and Microsoft, Jimmy.  Time Force is already going to write me up, so that one's free.

Bet of all, *we still don't know how far we can make them go.*  It takes a lot of work to keep up with all the new innovations in games, and in programming, and in technology, and everything is getting cheaper and simpler and easier to use.  Every science is growing faster and faster because they make models simpler, and they make international collaboration simpler and in fact the normal way research is done.  It's pretty awesome living in the New Renaissance.  *Every* science is going better, and *every* science has had major advancements in the last fifty years.  Most have had major advancements in the last *five* years.  And computers, whether for their ability to do math or their ability to network us together, are largely responsible for this.

Now, I mentioned robots.  You've seen robots before, right?  Well, we'll use robots a lot more.  We're still working on the general purpose robot, but in the meantime, we've got a lot of single purpose robots out there.  Factories use them, nuclear reactors use them - yes, we use nuclear power, there's some huge advances still waiting for you - and firefighters and police use them.  Most fire stations have at least a few robots per district that can scout out dangerous homes without risking any human life.  Robot parts are cheap enough that anyone who feels like making one can experiment - LEGO sells robot sets now, about as expensive as a bike, and making a robot from scrratch is...  about as expensive as two bikes.  And these robots are designed and controlled by computers, which means they're growing even faster.

And you know what?  Our robots are on the moon!  We've got lots of robot landers.  On the moon, on Venus, on Mars, on comets and asteroids.  We've had some fly by Jupiter lately, and one just made it out of the solar system.  As a species, humanity isn't limited to this solar system anymore.  Completely by accident, she wasn't designed to make it past Neptune, but good ol' American ingenuity and dumb luck counts for a lot.

And we do have space stations.  We get Skylab up, the Russians get Mir up, and some private companies in California are just starting to put their own up.  There's even the International Space Station, which has Americans and Europeans and Africans and Asians and Arabs and Russians - Okay.  I can't spoil everything about the next sixty years for you, Jimmy, but all wars end and our war ends peacefully.

But we have the International Space Station, and all these other space stations, which are like *practice*.  They can stay in Earth orbit for refueling and in case something goes wrong, but we have people that have lived in space for *years*.  We know a lot about the effects of microgravity and cosmic radiation on the human body, and it turns out they're easily addressed.  And our robots are doing science on the moon and - yes, Jimmy, we start to say 'doing science' or even just 'sciencing' in the future, don't distract me - and they're discovering just how we can cope.  They're discovering things about the Martian atmosphere and Martian soil, and the Venusian atmosphere, and Lunar seismology.  Planetary geology is now one of the most exciting sciences to be in.  And slowly, piece by piece, we're making a plan to live there.  Not visit there, not just drop some astronauts into a space tent and do experiments for a while.  We plan to have human colonists there, growing food, raising families, having jobs, and building new cities.  One day soon, Jimmy, we're going to have the first human born off Earth.  We spent so much time looking for spacemen, but before long, we're going to look up at the moon or Mars, see cities on her surface, and realize we *are* the spacemen.

We haven't given up on the Moon or Mars yet, Jimmy.  We're being careful, because our plans have become a lot more ambitious.  In your decade, you were planning on doing science on the moon.

True,B0und,,,"When Death met the philosopher, the philosopher said, rather excitedly: ""At this point, you realise, I'm both dead and not dead.""

There was a sigh from Death. Oh dear, one of those, he thought. This is going to be about quantum again. He hated dealing with philosophers. They always tried to wriggle out of it.

""You see,"" said the philosopher, while Death, motionless, watched the sands of his life drain through the hourglass, ""everything is made of tiny particles, which have the strange property of being in many places at one time. But things made of tiny particles tend to stay in one place at one time, which does not seem right according to quantum theory. May I continue?""

YES, BUT NOT INDEFINITELY, said Death, EVERYTHING IS TRANSIENT. He did not take his gaze away from the tumbling sand.

""Well, then, if we agreed that there are an infinite number of universes, then the problem is solved! If there are an unlimited number of universes, this bed can be in millions of them, all at the same time!""

DOES IT MOVE?

""What?

Death nodded at the bed. CAN YOU FEEL IT MOVING? he said.

""No, because there are a million versions of me, too, And...here is the good bit ...in some of them I am not about to pass away! Anything is possible!""

Death tapped the handle of his scythe as he considered this.

AND YOUR POINT IS...?

""Well, I'm not exactly dying, correct? You are no longer such a certainty.""

There was a sigh from Death. Space he thought. That was the trouble. It was never like this on worlds with everlastingly cloudy skies. But once humans saw all that space, their brains expanded to try and fill it up.

""No answer, eh?"" said the dying philosopher. ""Feel a bit old-fashioned, do we?""

THIS IS A CONUNDRUM CERTAINLY, said Death. Once they prayed, he thought. Mind you, he'd never been sure that prayer worked, either. He thought for a while. AND I SHALL ANSWER IT IN THIS MANNER, he added. YOU LOVE YOUR WIFE?

""What?""

THE LADY WHO HAS BEEN LOOKING AFTER YOU. YOU LOVE HER?

""Yes. Of course.""

CAN YOU THINK OF ANY CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE, WITHOUT YOUR PERSONAL HISTORY CHANGING IN ANY WAY YOU WOULD AT THIS MOMENT PICK UP A KNIFE AND STAB HER? said Death. FOR EXAMPLE?

""Certainly not!""

BUT YOUR THEORY SAYS THAT YOU MUST. IT IS EASILY POSSIBLE WITHIN THE PHYSICAL LAWS OF THE UNIVERSE, AND THEREFORE MUST HAPPEN, AND HAPPEN MANY TIMES. EVERY MOMENT IS A BILLION, BILLION MOMENTS, AND IN THOSE MOMENTS ALL THINGS THAT ARE POSSIBLE ARE INEVITABLE. ALL TIME SOONER OR LATER, BOILS DOWN TO A MOMENT.

""But of course we can make choices between-""

ARE THERE CHOICES? EVERYTHING THAT CAN HAPPEN, MUST HAPPEN. YOUR THEORY SAYS THAT FOR EVERY UNIVERSE THAT'S FORMED TO ACCOMMODATE YOUR 'NO', THERE MUST BE ONE TO ACCOMMODATE YOUR 'YES'. BUT YOU SAID YOU WOULD NEVER COMMIT MURDER. THE FABRIC OF THE COSMOS TREMBLES BEFORE YOUR TERRIBLE CERTAINTY. YOUR MORALITY BECOMES A FORCE AS STRONG AS GRAVITY. And, thought Death, space certainly has a lot to answer for.

""Was that sarcasm?""

ACTUALLY, NO. I AM IMPRESSED AND INTRIGUED, said Death. THE CONCEPT YOU PUT BEFORE ME PROVES THE EXISTENCE OF TWO HITHERTO MYTHICAL PLACES. SOMEWHERE, THERE IS A WORLD WHERE EVERYONE MADE THE RIGHT CHOICE, THE MORAL CHOICE, THE CHOICE THAT MAXIMISED THE HAPPINESS OF THEIR FELLOW CREATURES, OF COURSE, THAT ALSO MEANS THAT SOMEWHERE ELSE IS THE SMOKING REMNANT OF THE WORLD WHERE THEY DID NOT ...

""Oh, come on! I know what you're implying, and I've never believed in any of that Heaven and Hell nonsense!""

The room was growing darker. The blue gleam along the edge of the reaper's scythe was becoming more obvious.

ASTONISHING, said Death. REALLY ASTONISHING. LET ME PUT FORWARD ANOTHER SUGGESTION: THAT YOU ARE NOTHING MORE THAN A LUCKY SPECIES OF APE THAT IS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE COMPLEXITIES OF CREATION VIA A LANGUAGE THAT EVOLVED IN ORDER TO TELL ONE ANOTHER WHERE THE RIPE FRUIT WAS?

Fighting for breath, the philosopher managed to say: ""Don't be silly.""

THE REMARK WAS NOT INTENDED AS DEROGATORY, said Death. UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, YOU HAVE ACHIEVED A GREAT DEAL.

""We've certainly escaped from outmoded superstitions!""

WELL DONE, said Death. THAT'S THE SPIRIT. I JUST WANTED TO CHECK.

He leaned forward.

AND ARE YOU AWARE OF THE THEORY THAT THE STATE OF SOME TINY PARTICLES IS INDETERMINATE UNTIL THE MOMENT THEY ARE OBSERVED? A CAT IN A BOX IS OFTEN MENTIONED.

True,psychicsword,,,"You said a lack of empathy. Republicans have plenty of empathy but they value some things more than acting on empathy right off the bat. 

&gt;Conservatives see the world as a challenging place in which there is always someone else who is ready to steal your lunch.

That is probably the worst description of what a conservative is I have ever seen. I am actually ashamed for that publication for allowing something that biased to go through. The author clearly used an analogy that painted conservatives in the light that they are paranoid that people are out to get them. 

&gt;This has led to assaults on gay rights, wrapped in a frame of ""Defense of Marriage"" (the DOMA act). Even though it impacts conservatives in no way at all- nobody is going to force a gay marriage shotgun wedding! They felt threatened enough to go to the government and demand a law.

I agree that there are many Republicans that would support that(about 20-30% of them) but there are many more that have little to no opinion or feel the opposite. Personally I am a republican that would love for Gay marriage to be legal. I think it is the right thing to do. In fact the Libertarian stance on the mater is that anyone should be able to marry and the government shouldn't be deciding who does and does not get married.(I suggest looking into the differences between the two different groups before lumping them in together). Ignoring the 20-30% of Republicans that are religiously based voters most Republicans value fiscal constructiveness and have less strong beliefs on the social issues. 

&gt; For additional research on conservative lack of empathy: http://journals.chapman.edu/ojs/index.php/e-Research/article/view/91/311

This study tested the lack of empathy with a single group(gays) which was already self selecting. That study used a lot of data from their voting patterns on things like Proposition 8 which had entirely to do with the empathy towards the single group rather than empathy as a whole. It is very possible and likely that conservatives can feel empathy towards other subjects and groups more than liberals feel. For instance conservatives may feel more empathy towards a business owner trying to make ends meet whereas the liberal is more empathetic towards the workers in the same situation. Both of which we can see in their voting results. So who has more empathy using that data? I would say neither has more empathy than the other. They are both people who care about others but they have different priorities and methods of trying to help them out. Liberals tend to go with regulating how much workers should be paid in an effort to help them out and conservatives tend to look at ways of improving the life of the business owner hoping that it will make it possible to hire more people and improve their lives as well.

True,DiabloConQueso,,,"I agree, but these are the people that are running our cities, our states, our nation.

If the only good decisions that come out of their positions are because something affected them personally, then I believe they are not fit to be making decisions for the rest of us.

We need open-minded, intelligent people leading us forward -- not close-minded simpletons who can only ""see the light"" once it comes up and slaps them in the face.  We need people who can step outside of their own, stupid, biased heads and make decisions based upon the wide range of people living in the melting pot of America, see things from an objective standpoint, and do things for the good of the nation.  If this senator could only make an informed, intelligent, empathetic decision on an issue once that issue walked through his front door and into his home and family, then this is NOT the guy we need as one of our ""leaders.""

This guy made a complete turn-around based upon a subjective, personal experience, and his reasoning wasn't objective in the slightest.  That's fucking scary.  ""I support gay marriage now because my son's gay"" -- no, fuck you, you should have supported gay marriage because of logic and reason, not because gay walked into your family.

I agree that it's a good thing that he came around, but if this is what it takes, then they've got no business being in the position they're in.

You gotta really wonder -- if one of our fearless ""leaders"" *slightly* changes or modifies their position based upon personal experience, then I'm ok with that.  We all adjust our beliefs ever so slightly every day.  If they, instead, do a complete 180 and go from one end of the spectrum to the other just because whatever it was affected them personally, then it makes me wonder about how empathetic, intelligent, and informed they *really* are.

Sorry, this just pissed me off more than it makes me happy.  +1 to the gay community, sure, but if we have to inject a homosexual relative into each senator's immediate family to get the point across, then fuck those guys.

*Edit: To expand on that and address the example you brought up -- yes, I may not have experience with mental illness (I do indirectly, but let's suspend disbelief for a moment), but I am intelligent enough and open-minded enough to say that I'm not going to support legislation that de-funds mental illness research or support legislation that hampers the forward momentum of mental illness research -- which is exactly what this guy did.  He may not have direct experience with homosexuality, nor really understand everything behind why the gay community wants to be able to take advantage of the same benefits afforded to heterosexual couples, but he actively campaigned against it, did not support it, did not understand it, and basically came out as an opponent of it.  That's just wrong.  Just because you don't understand something does not mean you need to actively do things to quash or repress the forward momentum.  It's like saying I don't support dog ownership, because I don't own a dog, so I'm going to support legislation and actively campaign against those that want to own dogs with the hopes of preventing people from owning dogs.  It's ridiculous.  Just because you don't believe in it, or are not actively affected by it doesn't mean you need to exert energy into stopping it.*

True,NRG1975,,,"Owner of an imaging center here(florida). MR scans do not cost 1080. In fact, Medicare pays $380, private insurers pay sometimes a little less, or a little more. They may charge more on the billing statement, but that is because PIP(Personal Injury Claims) may be involved, and they pay more, they may deny claim. Also, on the PIP side of things, we sometimes work with LOP([Letter of Protection](http://www.labovick.com/physician-resources.html)), which is on a sliding scale, depending on the settlement that is done between the attorneys and insurance companies. I am typically happy if I can walk with twice medicare rate. However, sometimes, these scans are done and are never paid, and may drag on for two years. The point of the charge rate being high is so the centers can claim ""[customary charges](http://floridianquote.com/2012/04/16/what-are-reasonable-and-customary-charges-for-florida-healthcare/)"" when time for settlement comes. Centers offer a ""cash rate"", which is much lower than Medicare rates. The point of this that we can get paid at time of service. In otherwords, we don't have to use resources to bill out, fight blank [EOB(Explanation of Benefits](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explanation_of_benefits_(insurance)), and hassle that goes into waiting to get paid, or the risk involved(total denial).

If the US Government was serious about lowering the costs of imaging on Medicare, Medicaid, and the health sector in general, they would out right outlaw Physician ownership, investment in imaging centers. It is proven [over](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21427334), [over](http://www.diagnosticimaging.com/articles/medpac-study-reveals-high-utilization-rates-office-self-referred-imaging), and over again(http://www.jacr.org/article/S1546-1440(09)00346-9/abstract) that when docs own an imaging center utilization rates go up. However, the AMA is too large of a lobbying force. Instead, of addressing the root of the problem, the Government has taken the tact of lowering pay outs for the scans done. this has done nothing to curb the utilization rates. It has gotten so bad for IDTF centers, that they are closing, and the imaging is being hustled back into Hospitals, where the HOPPS rates are much higher, and usually more extensive(their claims that they treat the poor that don't pay(when in fact it makes up only 1%).

ProTip: If you need to pay cash for your MR, call around to centers, independent centers, not hospital affiliated centers. The proper term for these centers are called IDTF(Independent Diagnostic Testing Facilities) Imaging Centers. the question you need to ask, is ""what is your cash price?"". Never, never get any diagnostic procedure done at your docs office, as the test may not be needed, and he/she, may just be fattening their practices bottom line. Stay away from hospital based scans, as they have no real incentive to work with you on price.

True,zaftig,,,"I disagree. I speculate the reasons of feeling ""regret"" and ""disgust"" post-sex stem much more from societal expectations about sex rather than something innately harmful about hooking up with someone.

That said, I think the number of sexual partners should be neither a source of pride nor shame--everyone has their own sexual mores. What's much more important is that they are open about their intentions with their sexual/romantic partners, and that everyone has the best possible information to give or not give consent to an act as they choose.

However, it is good to stop and reflect once in a while *why* we do what we do. If you're having sex with a ton of people to fulfill some deep-seated psychological need for approval that may not be the healthiest thing. But for many, having multiple sexual partners is a decision made in sound mind, and they shouldn't be demonized for it. I wouldn't be embarrassed in the slightest if my partner told me they'd had a lot of sexual partners in the past, so don't speak for everyone on that. What's more important to me is that we have an open line of communication and a commitment to each other.

This is also not to mention the many happy and well-adjusted open/polyamorous/otherwise nontraditional relationships. The spectrum of human sexuality is pretty damn big, so trying to shoehorn everyone in to the same box doesn't make a whole lot of sense. There's nothing wrong with thinking as you do, but please don't impose that view upon other people.

However, I agree it is important that the expectations for an interaction are well-established; you don't want one person to think that something is more than a hook-up while the other was just looking for a quickie.

The criticism is often that it came out of nowhere or didn't fit, but to me that ""monster"" turn followed a major theme of the film. While not an anti-religion message, Sunshine certainly had a sort of atheist and pro shared-humanity theme going on.

The character responsible for the end events is the embodiment of God/faith/fate gone overboard. He is both thematically and physically the antagonist to the crew and their message/mission as a whole. While everyone else selflessly lays down their lives for their fellow crew members and all of humanity, **without ever mentioning or taking comfort in an afterlife** or god, the antagonist seeks to make them fail out of his own selfish (and insane) beliefs in his importance in the eyes of god.

The entrance of the antagonist to me made the most sense in regards to the theme of that film as a whole. What else could have acted as a major, last conflict? Some external problem with the ship/bomb/space? That would have missed the whole point.

True,pajmahal,,,"I sew. I have to get up-close and personal with my actual measurements, and it kinda sucks sometimes, but here's the thing I keep in mind: Ready-to-wear clothing is fuckin' bonkers, size-wise. Vanity sizing *is* a real thing, but a lot of RTW clothing is also shittily sewn and the patterns are poorly drafted, so it's not worth getting hung up about. I think people like to point out things like, ""In 1955, a size 12 was the same as a modern size 8."" Well, that's almost true, except a woman in 1955 was also, on average, about two inches shorter than a woman now. This rather dramatically skews how a garment fits. Women in the fifties also wore incredibly restrictive foundation garments that are not only out of fashion today, but unavailable in the mass market. So a smaller waist size was taken for granted not because people were so much better and more disciplined than they are now (yeah, we're fatter, but that's a different conversation), but because women just constricted themselves like that as a matter of daily routine.

So when I sew, I look at the pattern envelope and match up my measurements to a number that is depressingly larger than my RTW size. And then I still have to do a lot of shit to make a garment fit - most garments are manufactured/patterns drafted for a 5'4"" woman with a B-cup, for example, and I'm 5'11"" with a DD-cup. I am not built like their dress forms. There's a good chance that you aren't, either. So while any of us can get hung up on a number, remember that the number is not an accurate descriptor of your body or your proportions. 

I also know/hear about a lot of women who mention that Marilyn Monroe was a size 12 or 16 or whatever. I assume they say this to connect themselves to Marilyn Monroe/feel better about not being a size 2. Two things about that: A 1956 size 12 was, again, smaller in proportion than a current US size 12, and also relied on a completely different silhouette. Secondly, Marilyn Monroe wasn't famed for her everywoman qualities. People didn't look like her. She looked better than everyone else. 

**Tl;dr: Clothing size is fucked-up. You are more than just a number. You don't have much in common with Marilyn Monroe.**",0,1363375966,,0,False,1,c8wamns,t3_1acoxg,t1_c8wamns,t3_1acoxg,,1431596866,94,False,todayilearned,t5_2qqjc,94
True,onairhandyman,,,"I am a contract FM engineer. In 2003 I was doing some work on a tower. The job was to change the direction that a microwave antenna was pointing. I was 250 FT in the air, had both palms on the antenna, and shifted my weight to turn the damn thing. Then it happened, I heard a ping, looked down, and saw a d-ring falling. It took my breath at about the same time I started falling. What had happened was the worst thing possible. I always wear a hip belt that has large hoops on either side. These hoops are made of metal, and you attach a short piece of rope (around 5 feet) to one side, run the rope around the tower, and then attach it to the other side. This way you can lean back and kind of make a seat out of the harness. When I shifted my weight it was too much for the d-ring on my right hip. Down I went. I instantly tried to grab the microwave antenna that I was working with, but it was already out of reach. I tried to wrap my feet into the tower, but I only got enough traction to make myself fall head down. I was moving, and moving very fast. I knew I was going to die.
As I fell I instinctively flung my arms as if I were a baby bird falling from a nest. I caught myself by mere accident at about the 150 FT mark. My right arm had gotten caught in a rung of the tower, my arm went inside the tower, and that pulled my body closer to the tower. This happened in such a way that the rung of the tower that saved me, hit me in the top of the right shoulder. This was a bad injury. I clung there crying for a few minutes. I made my way down the tower using one arm. My injuries were pretty massive. I was alone, and I had to make it to the hospital to survive.  Mind you I was around 8 miles from my truck, riding an ATV.  The throttle is on the right side of the ATV handle bars, so I had to throttle and steer with only my left arm by reaching across.  I had tied my right arm to my torso with some rope that I cut between my feet.  I made it to the truck, loaded the ATV in the bed and secured it.  (I would have left it, but it was borrowed)  I am now 20 or so miles from the nearest hospital.  When I sat down in the truck I could feel the adrenaline wearing off.  I still had a real chore ahead of me as the truck was a manual shift.  I remember getting to the edge of town and being in severe pain, I started coughing up blood and was trying really hard not to panic.  The blood was foamy so I knew it was lung blood.  

I arrived at the hospital and pulled into the ambulance entrance.  I stumbled into the sliding doors and went unconscious.  I had broken my Humurus, fractured my wrist, broke all of the ribs on my right side, punctured a lung and drove my right shoulder down around my right nipple. My femur had a hair line break, as well as my pelvis.  I did not have insurance, so the hospital only did enough to save my life.  I had stiff splints and slings all over my right side supporting my shoulder.  My collar bone was also broke on that side and my shoulder blade was a mess.  They had to inflate my right lung with a tube down my throat.  The muscles connecting my neck to my shoulder were all torn.

My current stature sags to the right about 2 inches or so.  My shoulder and upper back really cause me alot of pain, but I have learned to deal with it. 

Also, the hospital sent me home that night.  
TL;DR Survived a fall, made it to hospital.

True,audiohound46,,,"You're welcome.

The hum might be due to a grounding issue.  Is the turntable ground attached to the ""SIGNAL GND"" post that I see in the mixer's manual?  If not, try attaching it.  If so, try leaving it unattached.  It's also possible that the mixer needs to be grounded to your PC or laptop's case (or a metal part of the case of your sound card, if it's an external unit) to eliminate the hum; in that case, bind both the turntable ground and whatever wire you run to the PC case to the signal ground post on the mixer.  Try different combinations to see what gives the least amount of hum.  Good luck!

One way to see how much noise is coming from the sound card is to not attach anything to its input ports and then set your recording software to record as usual.  Some cards might not permit that if the software driver determines that nothing is plugged in, so in that case you could just plug a short cable by itself into the input jack(s) to trick the card into working.

The lack of useful I/O ports on the Apogee Duet is definitely one of its shortcomings.  And sadly Apogee doesn't have much in between that and the 8 and 16-port monsters that would be overkill for my needs.  The nice thing about the Apogee Duet is that its mic inputs are very quiet (much quieter than the noise floor of the last phono preamp I used, the Cambridge Audio 640P -- which sells for a price within your range and is great for live listening) and have high enough gain to replicate the sort of output level that a phono preamp is capable of.  Off the top of my head I believe that I have the levels set to +52dB, which by chance is the same gain that my old phono preamp claimed to apply.

At least a couple software applications are out there that can apply inverse RIAA EQ (and many others for 78RPM discs).  One of them is [Audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/), which is free, and another one is Channel D's [Pure Vinyl](http://www.channld.com/purevinyl/), which costs $279 USD.  Audacity works pretty well, but I like Pure Vinyl's ability to detect whether or not the ""raw"" audio's gain has to be adjusted prior to applying the inverse RIAA EQ in order to avoid clipping.  Of course Channel D touts that much more care has gone into the creation of their EQ process but I'm not sure that alone is worth the expense.  I've chosen their software because their [instructions on getting the hardware side of things set up](http://www.channld.com/purevinyl/pure-vinyl-faq.html) was what inspired me to go down this path in the first place.

Martini Ranch - Scottsdale, AZ (Approx. 10 years ago)

Pre-partied with Flaming Dr. Pepper shots. Maybe had 2 (or 6 or 12), but who's counting, right?

Desginated driver buddy took all of us to the bar. Continued to drink straight gin martinis. Maybe had 4 (or 8 or 16), but who's counting, right?

Forgot to eat all that day.

Start dancing, continue to drink said martinis while dancing. ~~Dance with girl that likes my skillful Travolta dance moves.~~ Dance with girl that wants to help keep me from falling onto the dance floor.

Feel shitfaced; sit down at table. Girl I was dancing with offers me red sucker to eat because she thought 'I was starting to get a little tipsy'.

Eat sucker, stumble up, return to dance floor. Attempt drunken white boy disco moves. Fail. Suddenly transform from shitty dancer to weaponized high-pressure gin dispenser. Hit approximately 5 -6 other people according to friends. Bouncers frown on my attempt at projectile vomiting for distance world record. (Bonus: Red sucker made the expelled gin a lovely shade of crimson.)

Transform from weaponized high-pressure gin dispenser to training dummy for angry bouncers. Smashed into every post and hard object while bouncers perfect their version of the classic drunk asshole Caber Toss.

Picture taken, told never to return. ~~Bouncers 'help' me get to stairs.~~ Bouncers help me accidentally fall down stairs.

Friend goes to get car. Tells me not to move. Have to pee. Decide it would be funny to take a leak on pedicab. Pedicab driver frowns on my urination situation. Run with remaining friends to find friend with car. I trip, paint sidewalk and curb with face. My best work. Picasso would be proud.

Start heading home in the car. Hang head out of friend's car window. Puke on traffic on Northbound 101. Friend disapproves of my barf salvo on freeway traffic. Rolls up my window to prevent live-fire operations from continuing. Bad move - cease-fire ends quickly. Puke all over inside of friend's Expedition. Replace new-car smell with drunk hobo urination gin smell.

Wake up next morning with clothes on, bruises everywhere, and a garbage bag tied around head. Just in case, check for dead hooker(s). Find none.

I'll focus my reply on Britain in the 18th C, and I'll try to focus it on activities that could be done ""when you ran out of conversation"" and not amusements that required more set-up, like seeing public executions or going on a coach tour of famous houses. 

* Drinking!  In the early 1800s England was swept by a craze for gin.  Per capita consumption just for gin was literally in the *gallons* per year.  

* Reading:  Literacy rates reached 60%+ in this century, and reading was a popular way to pass the time.  Novels really hit their stride in this century (think Daniel Defoe), religious and political pamphlets were common, daily general papers were published (Tatler and The Spectator had their first incarnations) and many people kept up a personal correspondence of letters with relatives and friends.

* Games: card games like whist or quadrille, board games like backgammon and chess, dice games, lawn games like ninepins or battledore and shuttlecock, and for kids toy-based games like spinning tops or catching a ball in a cup.  Gambling was also quite popular, but I'm not sure this is specific to the time period :)

* Debate: obviously people enjoyed regular conversation, but in this period Debate Societies cropped up where people would meet at a pub and have a semiformal debate on some topic of the day.

* Music: Especially in richer families, women were responsible for providing entertainment through singing and playing instruments.  

* Physical activity: People would engage in physical activity, not only out of a belief that ""if the body be feeble, the mind will not be strong"" as Jefferson put it, but also to pass the time.  Walking was most common for both men and women, but people also took part in sport (there were even boxing academies for gentlemen).  Sex was also used for amusement as well as procreation.  I don't think this is new, but there are those (e.g. Dabhoiwala at Oxford) who argue this view of sex in England was part of the broader cultural development in the century.  In any case, by the end of the 18th century there were literally tens of thousands of prostitutes in London.

True,[deleted],,,"I lived in Korea for several years. For those of you unfamiliar with the culture they have these bathhouses called Jim-Jeel-Bbangs which are (usually) segregated by sex as everyone walks around completely naked.

It's quite a bit to get used to, but they're wonderful and very cheap. Sort of like spas in the US... various different pools, some hot, some cold... some have little fish that will eat the dead skin of your toes. You can get a massage, or a haircut. Most of them are quite upscale and there's no hanky panky, other than the awkwardness of having little children (some of whom might be your students) staring at, pointing, and laughing at your genitals for being so big. No really, that's what happens.

Anyway, I used to go a few times a week and every so often I'd go with a few other western colleagues. Go to the spa, then down to the beach for some drinks and dinner before heading to the bars kind of a thing. We're all in the locker room starting to get undressed when one of the Korean men started to get a little aggressive with us, in English, about whether we should be allowed to use the facilities. 

One of my closer friends was a judo instructor (edit: he was older than the man who confronted him... I don't think this would have been tolerated if he was younger) who spoke Korean fluently. Apparently the man turned around and said to the rest of the locker room something to the effect that this establishment is a shit hole because they let gorillas in... referring to our hairy bodies.

Anyway my buddy starts to hoot and pretend like he's a gorilla. Hunching over he ambled around in a semi-circle to get in front of this guy and then... like he was a gorilla, started to pound his chest and back the guy into a locker. The rest of us *kind* of understood what was going on, and instead of laughing we started to hoot like gorillas, too.

I tried to spend the day wearing myself out and keeping myself busy, dragging supplies up three flights of stairs, but it just wasn’t enough.  Wouldn’t matter anyhow, every time I so much as rolled over, that little dog next-door started in with its incessant barking.  Eventually I couldn’t take and did what I had to do, kicked the goddamn door down, liberating the little fucker.  He looked like shit and his apt matched him in smell.  4 days of dog shit and piss had left its mark.  Luckily there was dog food so now he sits on my couch in an awkward stand-off with my two cats.  They provide a much needed distraction as I’m drinking down a bottle of scotch, the name of which I can’t pronounce, taken from my neighbors as payment for saving their wiry-haired loud mouth from a slow death by starvation.  I guess he’s a terrier?  Wish I had google to check, either way I’m calling him Terry.  Getting a buzz on and all I can think about is where….  I wonder where they are, where my wife is, my friends, my family, my co-workers.  Are they dead?  Where’s the bodies.  Where the fuck are the 1.3 million Manhattanites?  There has to be others.  Time to drink myself to sleep.

**Day 5 Evening:**   Spent the day scouting, and still no one to be found, no sign, no corpses.  Plenty of rats though, holy shit the rats. The supermarket I’d been going to is overrun.  I’d made the mistake of smashing the front door, and they’ve taken over the meat and produce isles.  The dried goods are only a matter of time.  Most of them scurry when I get close, I imagine once the power is out I’m not going to want to be in there day or night.  Can’t imagine the outer boroughs are any better.   At least there are a dozen other supermarkets within a short walk or scooter ride.  The presence of so many canned food items and products gives me a sense of comfort, which unfortunately is very quickly replaced with dread when surrounded by this dead, lifeless city.  The empty windows seem stare down at me, asking me why I’m still here.

I know what I’m doing tomorrow though.  Found a swat truck, and grabbed one of those door opening battering ram things, as seen on COPS.

True,blindingpain,europe,Chechnya | Russia | Terrorism,"One reason is certainly the vastness of the whole conflict. The 'Vietnam' or 'Korean' Wars can largely be said to confine within the geographical limits of those two countries. Obviously they involved the US, China, Soviet Union and extended geographically into other areas, but you get the point. WORLD WAR, however, carries a much more epic connotation. 

So if we lay out a few things, I think it'll make it clearer. Let's discuss scope, including beligerents, the origins, and the ramifications or long-term results.

1. Scope: The enormity of the war defies logic, and it really should be classified as 'The World Wars of 1937-1954' if you ask me. When an American student is asked to assess WWII, s/he will often begin with Pearl Harbor, some 8 years after the start of the Asian Theatre. The Wars transformed the 'dynamic of destruction' begun in WWI into a truly catastrophic and epoch-defining conflict in which Race, Ethnicity and Combatant-Status were given entirely new meanings. The Wars involved nearly everyone on the globe (not literally) fighting nearly everyone else, and in seemingly any single theatre of fighting, the complexities are mind-boggling enough to almost defy explanation. In looking at the scope of destruction in Warsaw in 1939, it's difficult to imagine that War could be more brutal, until you look at the 'Rape of Nanking' or the fratricidal and very confusing wars fought in the Balkans. The scope of the war also involved ideologies on a scale not really seen before. The clash of western liberalism, national socialism and marxist inspired communism really dealt a sense of seriousness and existentialism to the conflicts. By that I mean there was a real sense of an apocalyptic showdown: each saw the 'other' as not only the enemy, but barbaric and even 'evil.' Barbarism is present in all wars, but again, the scope, the severity of the death and destruction of both individuals and of groups of people, is staggering.

2. Origins: What caused the War(s)? The answer to many is even more disturbing than the actual war, because it appears to many that the origins of this brutal war lie in a decision by the victors of WWI to impose a settlement upon Germany that would end all wars. What does this really mean? It means that even without Hitler, the suffering of the Germans prior to the outbreak of hostilities was incredible. The moral and physical landscape of Europe had been ravaged by WWI to such an extent that it would seem no war could ever take place again. The Great Terror and Holodomor in the USSR had already hit their peaks by 1939 (the traditional start of WWII) and that was only the beginning. The origins of the war lie in nefariousness, in cunning, in duplicity, in deceit and in imperialism. Which means it basically started like any other war - except this time ideologies were the driving force, rather than economics. Hitler didn't invade Poland to secure minerals, to acquire natural forests or to take advantage of their industry. He essentially invaded to secure 'living room' for his Germanic peoples, his 'Volk'. In his moral landscape there was no room for the Jew, the Slav or the undesirables. At the same time, Stalin invaded to secure the territory of the Ukraine and the Baltic countries in a bid to continue his centralization of Soviet power into a country denied to him in 1921. Russia had all the natural resources in the world with the open tundra of Siberia, so he was not after resources either, his was an ideological mission to spread Communism.

3. Ramifications: We are in the year 2013 and the United States is the lone super-power. Yet in 1938 the US was far from a global super-power in today's sense of the word. The War(s) dramatically impacted the United States' meteoric rise to the top of the world. The US was spared the civilian bloodshed and infrastructural damage of the European/Asian wars, yet reaped the physical and moral benefits by defeating Nazism, culturally colonizing Western Europe, and catapulting her economy into superstardom through the tremendous industrial capabilities gained through the War's result. The USSR and USA came out of the conflicts much better off, and to cut this answer a little short - the Korean War and Vietnam Wars don't exist without the USA's triumph in WWII. Neither does our current predicament in Afghanistan. The Soviets continued expanding and went into Afghanistan in 1980, a place even the Tsars at the height of their empire couldn't do very well. The US's interventions in Asia and Latin America and the Soviet Union's interventions and expansions into Central Asia, the Balkans and the Caucasus were direct results of the situation in Europe after 1945.

In a nutshell, that is why people are still fascinated with the Wars of 1937-1954. That and the well-publicized and relatively unprecedented genocide of Europe's jewry which spawned our idea of, and our word for, Genocide.

&gt; 4.) To these people, doing meaningful work every day,[no comma] and seeing how it makes a difference in the lives of others far outweighs the other benefits of nursing.

.

The reason the comma probably ought to not be there is that you are basically separating part of the subject from the predicator (er, ""verb"") of that sentence. In today's standard English, that type of punctuation is not acceptable.

E.g.

* [They] far **outweigh** [the other benefits of nursing] [to these people].

So, ""They"" is the subject, and, ~~""outweighs""~~, er, ""outweigh"" is the verb.

And so:

* [Doing A and seeing B] far **outweigh** [the other benefits of nursing] [to these people].

And then, we get your, er, new edited version:

* 4B.) [To these people], [doing meaningful work every day and seeing how it makes a difference in the lives of others] far outweigh [the other benefits of nursing].

One overall perhaps awkwardness with your sentence is that it has a top-heavy subject, which can often make the parsing a wee bit more difficult for your reader.

Er, I gotta disagree with their editor on this one. Your version is fully acceptable, and it seems to me to actually be much more preferable to that from their editor.

* A. Your version is fully acceptable -- the sentence has two independent clauses. Their editor's version is usually acceptable in most places, because the 2nd independent clause is very short and is related in meaning to the first independent clause.

* B. Your version uses a comma which helps the reader to parse the two clauses and to provide some extra emphasis to that second clause. Their editor's version weakens the effect of that second clause -- which is not a good thing.

* C. Your version doesn't have ambiguity, which the editor's version does.

Edit: But you gotta follow their ""AP style"", ...

Edit: The editor's version also produces a possible ambiguity. The second meaning could be parsed in this way:

* 3b.) [The worst that can happen] **is** [that they say no and you move on].

The sap used for Maple syrup can only be collected for about 2 weeks, usually around February. This is due to maple trees ""waking up"" after winter and using stored sugar and water to jump start growth for spring.

In the winter in Canada there is fucking nothing to eat, everything dies or goes to sleep. Early settlers had to save up their food and try to make it last all winter. By the end of winter they were often hungry, so hungry in fact, that they would eat wood. Well, some lucky settlers ate maple trees during these two weeks and went, ""Well gosh dere Steve! Dese are the best darn trees I ever tasted doncha know. We should get that tastey flavour oot, eh?"" And through they made maple syrup!

Maple syrup would be, to the people, the first good-tasting calorie-rich food they had for months. And there was tons of it. They put in on everything, meat, bread, grains, cheese, dried fruits, vegetables, everything.

So, the Canadians who liked maple syrup were more likely to survive, and those that didn't like it starved to death and were removed from the population.

And by ""interested"", I mean that I bought shot glasses with gold Greek gods and goddesses on them at a rummage sale, hid them in my dresser, stole wine from the kitchen that I also hid in the dresser, and woke up in the middle of the night to drink libations to the goddesses by moonlight. 


Anyway, I went to a Lutheran school, but thought the Holy Trinity was kind of boring compared to Zeus and company. So I brought in Greek mythology books and passionately attempted to convert my classmates. ""They have goddesses!"", says I. ""Look, this god is all about drinking and dancing and debauchery!"" Once I explained what debauchery was, more and more kids started to get on board. My teacher was not equipped to handle the tide of questions about why Jesus was real and Apollo was not and why sex in Christianity was only for married people when Greek gods nailed whoever they wanted whenever they wanted, and I was asked in no uncertain terms to leave my books at home and keep my ""hobby"" to myself.


At this point I became a crusader for truth, the open sharing of ideas, and debauchery, and vowed to hold true and get the word of the much more awesome pantheon out there. I continued to bring the books to class, but only brought them out to a trusted group of classmates in a secluded area of the playground at recess. Eventually the teacher caught on when he caught us passing notes in Greek cipher to each other, and he notified my parents, who found the whole thing kind of hilarious. He also began searching my backpack, so bringing the books was out of the question. After I continued to pass Greek notes glorifying the goddesses, I was isolated from the rest of the class in the far corner of the room.


But they couldn't stop my schoolyard preaching, and eventually word got out about it because some of the parents started complaining that their kids were being exposed to ""heretical thinking."" One kid even got into his dad's special stash and his parents found him plastered when they went to wake him up for class one morning. At this point my parents found and confiscated my holy implements of worship and told me to stop talking about the Greek gods at school.


But I did not! I had several disciplinary interviews with the principal which eventually led to threats of being spanked with the big wooden paddle that the 1st grade teacher had displayed on the wall in her classroom to scare us. I wound up telling the principal that my gods were better than his gods and that I would martyr myself for them if I had to. At this point my parents were called into school, informed that my ""heresy was out of control"" and asked to not enroll me next school year. I was not spanked, but was kept separated from the other students for the last few months of the school year, banned from the school library, and banned from school property for life.


I call it a win.

True,DoctorWhoToYou,,,"My best friend is gay.

When we were growing up the LGBT community was just getting it's foothold when it came to acceptance. It was the early 80's.

He was always around the house, my parents basically just accepted the fact that this kid was always going to be around. He ate dinner with us all the time and it wasn't uncommon for him to spend the night on non-school nights.

In the mid-90's he finally came out of the closet. We were about 18 at the time. Since we had so many discussions when we spent time around one another, I already knew. When he did come out he told his parents and they disowned him. He said they knew he was gay, but they still disowned him just because he publicly admitted it.

Since my parents were always so kind to him, he decided to sit down and have a conversation with them about it too. He basically said ""I'm gay"" and my Dad's reaction was ""no shit"". My mom hushed my Dad and said she was proud of him for being true to himself. He lived with us for about two months, found his own place and moved out. He just needed some time to get money together. My parents helped him financially as much as they could. Nothing ever changed, my parents still, to this day, treat him like he is part of the family. 

History is repeating itself.

My daughter's best friend is gay. They're about to enter high school. He is a popular kid, everyone likes him, no one cares that he is gay. Except his parents.

His parents pulled him out of school, home schooled him, because they thought public school was ""making him gay"". They sent him to something along the lines of pray away the gay. He stayed true to himself though, nothing has changed who he is. He is still openly gay.

His parents basically gave him to his ultra conservative grandparents who tried more church, more praying and arranged activities to ""make him more manly"".  After all those failed and he rebelled, they basically just gave up on him. He lives in their house, but goes relatively ignored, they've given up on him. They give him the very basics of care.

So he spends a lot of time at our house. Me, my daughter and him play video games a lot, we've been getting in shape for track, and when my daughter and I plan things, we include him. I've just kind of unofficially adopted the kid.

He's slept over on school nights, sometimes staying up to five or six days at a time. His grandparents just don't care. He was running low on clothes one day and I realized they were getting ratty when I was doing the wash. I called his grandparents and mentioned it and they told me ""The clothes he has are fine, he doesn't need anything new.""

My daughter asked if we could get him new clothes. She had also asked to upgrade her phone before this. I told her that I couldn't afford to get him new clothes *and* a phone upgrade. So she gave up her phone upgrade and we took him shopping. I spent probably about $300 on clothes and shoes for this kid and he was just about in tears. If he thanked me one more time I was going to strangle him.

I upgraded my kid's phone and I just went without some simple things. In my opinion her behavior deserved reward. She was willing to go without so that someone else could get something they needed. Kind of made me proud that my kid could look at a situation and see that. I know that sounds silly. But the idea that she was willing to go without an accessory so that someone could get a necessity really impressed me.

I think he's eventually going to ask to move in, so I've started preparing a room for him. I figure he's here so much anyway, that sleeping on the floor is probably getting old. So even if he doesn't ask to move in, he'll still have a place to sleep on the nights he stays over.

Since I live with my parents, I asked if it was okay. We have a five bedroom house and the spare room kind of became a catch all for all my adopted computers. My parents are living on their retirement and anything I make gets added to the pot. It's an added expense that my parents and I weren't expecting, but we'll be alright. I just don't like the idea of this kid going through life thinking he isn't accepted anywhere and has nowhere to go.

When I tried to talk to his grandparents and his parents about things, I basically get shunned because I've accepted who he is. I just keep being polite and letting them know what their kid is doing, how well he is doing in school, how many friends he has and everything else. It's like I am a telemarketer bothering them. Their responses are curt and the conversation is usually cut short.

My Dad now jokes that we're like the underground railroad for gay people. My best friend stops over on major holidays to spend time with us. He usually has his significant other with him. Then we usually have my daughter's best friend over too, because his grandparents leave him at home on holidays.

True,paradox1123,,,"Do you know what made Metroid Prime so sublime?  The storytelling.  It took what was a fairly underdeveloped setting and made a grand lore and universe; and filled every world with stories and histories too long to ever be told on screen.  It's interactive storytelling at its finest, to allow the player to explore the environment at their own pace and have their imaginations piqued with hints of the huge universe beyond this tiny story.  The Space Pirates are even upgraded to a fully-fleshed-out civilization with a culture that *isn't* ""generic space warriors"".  They have scientists, joksters, zealots, insubordinates, engineers, soldiers, and so on.  They are antagonists, but not one-dimensional.  And that's just one example.  The Prime universe has *depth*, and it's all told through level design and gameplay.

Metroid Other M is a sappy melodrama that uses the Metroid universe to deliver some hackneyed ""the Military is doing evil things"" message.  The Chozo are never mentioned once, The Galactic Federation is run by corrupt morons when Prime said that it was run by [Culture Minds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_series) (the Aurora Units), and the Space Pirates are basically mindless zombies, and their development as a culture and civilization in Prime is retconed out of existence by saying that they are controlled psychically or something (psychic powers are also retconed into existence in this game because it's a rule of hack scifi settings to have psychic powers in there somewhere).  Everything remotely interesting and unique has been sucked out of Metroid and replaced with some sexist space marines (why do you need to be a man to pilot power armor?  That's idiotic, you just halved your potential army size for no reason) who ""kill all the evil non-humans"".

In the end, who cares about this story?  This universe is so generic and boring, and the Scooby Doo plot so predictable and stupid that what is their to be invested in?  Samus and her abusive relationship with her former commanding officer?  Even if this story wasn't shit (which it is), it seems somewhat antithetical to have the primary motivation to play a game about exploration and loneliness to be for some character drama.  You're playing cutscene to cutscene; and that's a greatly outdated motivator for players, when scan data encourages going *off* the beaten path and exploring for exploration's sake.  There's nothing interesting in the Other M universe, just mindless callbacks to the series' nostalgia and character assassination for Samus.  

Other M is unsalvageable, it adds nothing and destroys so much.

What it's really showing is the relationship between the frequencies of two different notes using some form of [Just Intonation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_intonation). 

For example, from the VT (C) to SOL (G), which is a perfect fifth, you see the ratio ""3:2"" written along the line in one direction, and you also see ""4:3"" along the line for the other direction (G to C is a perfect fourth).

*Edit:*

The listed intervals I see, in order, starting from A and going A to Bb (written as B), then A to B, then A to C, A to C#, A to D, etc...:

Only thing is that I can't exactly figure out what ""like a lover in an empty bed"" means.  At first it sounds like yea, he's sleeping... but then I thought about it again and maybe it doesn't?  The wording is potentially misleading, probably on purpose (Rothfuss you sonofabitch!).

Also, earlier in the book... possibly chapter 1.  Where it is talking about the chest in his room.

***Part 1: Strange Beginnings***

-----

**Jeff:** ""Great, another Christmas episode where we play as characters in a video game, and where abed will of COURSE know everything about it. So Abed, which blocky game are we in this time?""

**Abed:** ""We appear to be in the game of Minecraft, a voxel survival game, where the player can craft tools and weapons, in order to be able to survive the night.""

**Shirley:** ""Why, what comes out at night?""

**Abed:** ""At night, a variety of mobs such as skeletons, zombies, creepers, spiders and endermen will spawn.

We should start collecting materials to build a shelter, and look for a good place to set up base.""

**Jeff:** ""And how do you suggest we collect materials? We've got blocks for arms, with no fingers!""

**Abed:** ""Dropped items will automatically gravitate towards the player when they are close enough.""

*Abed punches the ground, and collects the dirt block*

**Abed:** ""Here, catch.""

*-Jeff extends his arms out.*

*-Dirt block launches from Abed's chest and lands on the ground at Jeff's feet.*

*-Jeff lowers his arms and bends down to pick block up.*

*-block gravitates towards Jeff and disappears, knocking Jeff back slightly*


**Jeff:** ""Okay, that felt so weird""

**Abed:** ""The block's now in your inventory, press E to view your inventory, and scroll to select items on your hot-bar.""

**Jeff:** ""Uh, we're in a game, how are we suppose to 'press' E?""

**Abed:** ""Just think about the letter E.""

**Jeff:** ""Okay..""

*Jeff has an expression of thought on his face*

*Each of the other characters each has an expression if thought on their faces*

*A holographic display appears in front of Jeff*

**Jeff:** ""I can see myself in a little window, can you see that?""

**Abed:** ""No, a player can only see their own inventory.""

**Jeff:** ""How do I get rid of this, just..""

**Abed:** ""Think about E again.""

*Holographic display disappears*

**Abed:** ""Okay, the sun's starting to set, we should start gathering wood.""

*Troy walks over to a tree and punches it, a block of wood drops, leaving the rest of the tree suspended.*

**Troy:** ""Uh, I feel like something should be happening now. You know, something like a tree comically falling on me.""

**Abed:** ""Not all blocks are affected by gravity, so wood will stay floating. Sand and gravel, however, will drop and stack.""

*Troy walks off, beginning to build the base*

**Jeff:** ""Yep, that's really realistic.""

**Abed:** ""Since when were games realistic?""

**Jeff:** ""Oh I dunno, since we got transported into one?""

**Abed:** ""Such an occurrence is physically impossible, what we are experiencing now is probably a dream-like state collectively being experienced by all of us, likely after passing out after drinking many glasses of egg-nog. Our beta waves being carried through the highly alchohol-ized air.""

**Jeff:** ""Except I don't drink egg-nog.""

**Abed:** ""No, but you probably fell asleep listening to Pierce's stories""

**Pierce:** ""My stories aren't boring!""

**Jeff:** ""Hmm, so how do you suggest we get out of here?""

**Abed:** ""We need to get the end, and defeat the enderdragon.""

**Troy:** ""Hey, house is done.""

*We see a small shack, 5x5 in external size*

**Annie:** ""It's so tiny!""

**Troy:** ""Hey, I only had a few trees!""

**Abed:** ""Hmm, it'll have to do, it's getting dark.""

**Troy:** ""AARGH, DAMNIT!""

**Jeff:** ""What's the matter?""

**Troy:** ""I got hit by an arrow.""

*Camera turns to see a skeleton in distance*

**Abed:** ""Okay, everyone inside!""

*All characters quickly move into the shack. Abed blocks the entrance with wooden plank blocks.*

**Jeff:** ""So what do we do now, stay in this shack and starve to death?""

**Abed:** ""No, skeletons will burn alive in sunlight, we just have to spend the night in here.""

**Jeff:** ""Yep, that's totally much better.""

**Abed:** ""Just try to get some sleep.""

**Jeff:** ""*Sigh*""

*camera cuts to outside shack*

**Pierce:** ""Move over Troy!""

True,[deleted],,,"People think it's the alone of being forever alone that hurts the most, but that's not true. Everybody's alone sometimes, whether for periods when they're not dating anyone or just for a weekend while their spouse is at a conference. Alone is part of the human condition. It's the forever that pulls down the corners of your mouth just a little bit when you give someone a smile meant to indicate that everything's okay with you even though you want to scream that nothing's okay and never will be. It's the forever that tastes bitter in the back of your throat when you see a happy couple walking in the park or laughing in a restaurant. It's the forever that has you wide awake staring at your ceiling into the wee hours of the morning.Forever alone.

There's an ongoing half-serious claim in our culture that men think about sex all the time. Every 17 seconds or so. That may be true for some guys but not a forever alone. After awhile you stop being able to think about sex, at least the way other people do. You can think about it abstractly, or when watching other people perform a stylized version of it alone in your room while you use your hand to joylessly complete a sad shadow of the biological imperative, but you stop being able to imagine sex as something you could be a part of. You see a woman in the springtime, her midriff peeking out from between the soft cotton of a shirt and the rougher waist of a pair of jeans. You start to imagine her naked, constructing a fantasy in detail, the way her breasts would sit against her chest, the soft down or absence thereof on her pubic area, and then you try to insert yourself into her presence and the fantasy crumbles to dust under the weight of its own absurdity. You know there's no chain of events, no course of actions, that could lead to that ill defined imaginary room where the two of you would meet in an act of carnal congress. There's no way to there from where you are, it's not even an alternate universe, it's an inconceivable one. It's like trying to imagine a world where everything else is the same except elephants float around like helium balloons and have to be anchored by their trunks or they'll float away. An inherently absurd thought. That's the idea of you and her being intimate. So you look away from that tiny sliver of skin, trying to keep your face from contorting in pain and bitterness. Where other men might smile at her you don't, because your smile sucks, and you suck. Forever alone.

Eventually you don't even bother to build the image only to have it blow it away like a sand painting in a tornado. You imagine lesser things. The brush of a cool, soft, feminine hand against yours. Mundane couple bullshit like eating pancakes on a Sunday morning or watching a movie or just sharing your day with someone who gives a fuck and is not your mother. The other party in these pathetic little domestic tableaus is ill defined in your mind, because if you imagined her clearly enough to make her realistic then you know she wouldn't want you. And even with this feminine blur, this placeholder, this blurry silhouette of nothingness you project your emotions onto, the person she's with isn't really you. It's a better version of you, a thinner less obnoxious version who will control his temper before saying something cutting, who doesn't geek out and talk too much, who is free from the flaws who make you who you are and assure that nobody else will ever want to share their life with that person. Then you realize that you're fantasizing about an Archie Comics version of yourself making tomato soup for an undefined feminine projection blob, and you realize that even the part of you that creates these images doesn't want to be with you and can't imagine anyone who might. Forever alone.

Around you the world stays mostly the same. People fall in love, hit milestones, get married, have kids. You're even jealous of the divorcees because you know that this is just a bump in the road for them, part of their journey. You're still at the starting line watching them recede, wanting to chase them and catch up, knowing you never will. But while the world is almost static, you are aging. Moving through your life alone. You start to get bitter at the milestones you've missed and the chances you'll never have. You see the graying of your hair and the years piling on like rust eating at the hull of a decommissioned ship and you realize that your opportunity for young love is already past. Even if you got it together and got in the game you'd just have a shot at middle aged love. It doesn't matter if you think women age like a fine wine, what wine connoisseur wants to live his life without ever tasting the shocking astringency of the harsh tanins of youth. Even if that's not your thing you don't want to cut it off forever. But you have. You won't even have memories of those very good years, as the song says, to keep you warm as you slide towards your dotage. All you have is your bursting store room of regrets and bitterness, and you can always cram in more. And you know that that rusty battleship will some day have a hole in its hull and be unfixable, good for nothing more than salvage scrap. You add up the time it would take to lose the weight, get your teeth fixed, figure out your professional career, the time until you can smile at that woman in the coffee shop with confidence rather than the stomach sickness of self hate, and you realize it all adds up to a very big number. Everyone thinks of themselves as eternally 22 but at some point you are forced to admit that you are 37 and half your life is over and the back nine of the remaining half is not a time when people finally get that whole dating thing right. If the window is not closed its halfway there and sliding fast. Forever alone.

All this breeds desperation and depression so you shove it back because you need to function, you need to keep eating and staying warm, you can't just stop and feel. But your dam is fragile and it leaks. And when you see that girl whose hand you want to brush against, who could sit with you looking into your eyes through the steam coming off her coffee cup and just be, who could understand you (she probably couldn't, but this is something men like to project on to women) you feel the dam start to buckle and the river behind it start to surge and you don't want to break down crying in the coffee shop because that's not what people do and if you can't have love at least you can have dignity, or the appearance of dignity, or the delusion of the appearance of dignity, so you turn your face to the side, you hope and pray she doesn't try to draw your attention (generally safe on that count, old chum) and you put one fucking foot in front of the other and continue down your sad and barren blighted path.

Good news, its Florida, you would have a damn hard time getting lost in this state. When in doubt, point the plane east or west. If you haven't hit an ocean after two hours then you've been flying north. 

File a flight plan, fly that flight plan. I know they're not required for VFR but if something did happen, search and rescue would at least have an idea of what route to start looking for you on. Otherwise it could be anyone's guess where you ended up.

KPGD tower has no radar facilities so until the controllers have you visually, they can only go on what you tell them. Be vigilant and know where you are as well as anyone else up there. Too many times I've had some interesting close calls with other pilots in that area because they told the tower they were at one location and actually at the exact opposite. Stay sharp.

Use flight following if you can get it. You may need to climb above 3k to reach Miami center.

Lake Okeechobee is a lot larger than most realize. If you're going direct over it from PGD I'd recommend a high altitude or carry a life vest just in case something goes south and you're outside of glide distance.

Florida weather this time of year is fairly predictable, we're not in pop up storm season just yet. Keep an eye on the winds as this is the breezy time of year.

Close the afore mentioned flight plan.

Have a fun flight.

True,PingTiao,,,"On Nov 17 2011, the ""Day of Action"" in the Wall Street area, reporters were ""recommended"" by law enforcement to stay put in a ""special"" press area behind barricades.  Because of this, MSNBC and Fox did not have a crew there at all (though they talked about it all day), and CNN sent a crew to the ""protected press area"" (not sure what to call the place you can't win a Pulitzer from because of police orders).

CNN's live morning coverage from ""the scene"" was pretty much ""the park is quiet this morning, not many people showed up"" while just a few blocks away, as announced online the day before, thousands of protestors were surrounding the very Wall Street the occupiers were protesting. [Then the occupiers came back from Wall Street, and you can see the one CNN reporter in her ""protected press area"" switch to the arial camera because she can't leave her press area RIGHT NEXT TO THE PARK.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG0xPfi5nSs)

Russia Today (foreign news network), and many independent and citizen journalists did not obey orders and recorded or live streamed all the good footage that day, as you can see in [this collection of videos](http://www.reddit.com/r/occupywallstreet/comments/mgw7k/news_networks_are_lying_about_the_day_of_action/)

Any footage from outside the barricaded press area that was used by mainstream networks was not filmed by themselves.  Except the helicopter footage.  

[Here is what happened to a journalist who did not obey police warnings to stay away from the protest action](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00CLssMbc-k&amp;feature=share)  I have no idea what she did to warrant that.

There's also another video of an RT crew getting knocked over by police outside the ""protected press area"", but I'm not going to hunt for it in a buried comment.  Trust me when I say I looked through a huge amount of footage of that day (I assembled that large video collection I linked to above).  

There is a large volume of footage from various events so far during the ""occupy movement"" which show journalists apparently being targeted.  Lawrence O'Donnell did one of his ""re-write"" segments on this very topic.  NYPD also targeted the occupy media center several times.  [Equipment was destroyed](http://gothamist.com/2011/11/19/did_the_nypd_purposefully_destroy_o.php).

I'm not comparing this to Chinese secret police and I don't think CNN would have been arrested for leaving the press area, but you said ""Explain to me a scenario where a foreign journalist would be unable to simply videotape an area without ""special"" permission."" and Nov 17 2011 stands out to me as fitting that perfectly.

True,cinemachick,,,"Hey, if you're concussion has been recent, let me offer some advice as a former concussion patient. Basically, your brain has been super-jiggled and needs some rest to get some much-needed repairs underway. Here's what you should know:  
* You're going to need more sleep than usual, and more periods of inactivity. If you're tired, sleep. Expect a lot more naps and earlier bedtimes. Give your brain time to recharge.  
* Avoid large amounts of reading or thinking. Which probably sounds silly, but I'm serious. It's hard to do while in school- I know from experience- but try to keep deep thought to a minimum. And maybe spend more time on YouTube and less on reddit. *shrug*  
* You will probably have trouble concentrating for a while. Try not to stress out too much about it and accept that some things are going to take a bit longer to process/complete.  
* Avoid any unnecessary exercise. Specifically, no movement that really shakes up the head. NO JUMPING, SPINNING, OR EXCESSIVE RUNNING. M'kay?  
  
And finally, if you're really in trouble and need to see a doctor, PM me. I don't have much myself, but I'd be happy to give you what I can to get you well. Best of luck, friend. *hug*  
(And don't let what I've said scare you. I had a pretty bad concussion to get these symptoms. I was all better in two months, and I've only had slight lingering side effects.

True,[deleted],,,"Sure thing!  Hopefully it didn't come off as combative :)

Regarding the ""flow"" comment /u/failuer101 made, your punctuation creates too many full stops and half stops (periods and commas, respectively).  Read your work out loud if you are ever unsure.  Your passage reads like this:

""The tent was still [HALF STOP] and all eyes were directed towards the middle of the tent landing on Hamilton [FULL STOP]  He was staring into the floor [HALF STOP] not searching [HALF STOP] as if he were drilling into the earth with his gaze [FULL STOP] He wasn't speaking to anyone in particular [HALF STOP] it was just his thoughts forming on his lips [HALF STOP] but his voice was heard all around [FULL STOP]""

If you imagine a written passage as having a rhythm, like a song would, your prose is a little herky jerky.  While herky jerky can be used to great effect in some instances (action scenes, cliffhangers, and major plot twists, for example), you would usually avoid it in a descriptive passage.  Not a hard and fast rule, of course, but that's how it is generally done.

Add to this the fact that you've bulked up the word count significantly (from 39 words to 60 words), but haven't really expanded on the actions taking place.  The tent is still silent, Hamilton is still staring and is lost in thought.  Then he speaks.  Same as the OP but almost twice the space.  Magnify that by a book's worth and it is the difference of dozens of pages.

Sorry to get super nitpicky, but you could endlessly analyze this and come out with many, many variations.  And all of this is subjective: what works for me, might not work for someone else.  That's just how I would look at this passage as an editor.

You realize that your parents, teachers, grandparents, neighbors, and basically every adult in your life didn't know shit either. They were fucking winging it and now you have to wing it as well. 

But there's also freedom there. Sometimes I'm sitting at home and I think ""Damn I'd really like to go to the mall and just wander around and look at shit and maybe eat a pretzel."" Then I realize I can. I can do whatever the fuck I want and no one is stopping me. There are consequences to what I do but I can do it. I can run up all sorts of debt. I can buy new shoes that I want. I can go to my friend's house at 3 am because she needs me and no one is fucking stopping me or asking where I'm going or telling me it's too late to go out. I can get a cat. I can get 10 cats. I can reddit for 5 hours with no bedtime. I can be an awful person who does terrible things. I can be a kind person. I can be weird or hipster or crazy or average or bland. It's glorious and scary all at once.

True,11oh5,,,"&gt; start small 

Can't emphasize this enough. A digital shutoff is a kneejerk reaction that will not make you a better human being. Extremes can't be fought with other extremes. Flooding your house because your oven is on fire will surely turn off the oven: and destroy your house. 

Simmer down. Relax. Love yourself. 

Then think about what you want to change. And start small. Make habits, build on small habits. 
Every night before you hit the sack? Designate 1 hour before sleep time to read a book. Designate 10 minutes to read a book if 1 hour is too much. 

You are not going to make meaningful longterm constructive changes in your life by throwing a hissy fit and suddenly deciding ""FROM THIS DAY FORTH I AM A NEW MAN"". You cannot adapt to such radical changes. You *will* adapt for a day, a week, or a month. Not for a lifetime. 

Simmer down. Relax. Love yourself. Start making small changes in the form of ritual habits. 
When I go to bed, I will always read a book for 10 minutes. I am going to set an alarm clock and read a book for 10 minutes. 

You know what the hardest thing to do is? Continue existing as a person you hate while all you're doing is these small, determined habits. 

Well, what do you expect? You are who you are as a direct consequence of your mental landscape for the last X number of years. 

Relax. 

You have all your life to live. Throwing a hissyfit and attempting to change everything about yourself to BE THE MAN I KNOW I CAN BE is only going to lead to failure. 

Great people aren't built by deciding they'll be great one day. They start with small habitual changes that are constructive and positive, and then they build up on them over time. Start small, be consistent, and always improve. 

If you are in a hole now, you have two options: 
Jump out of your hole by exerting a metric crapton of effort. 
Or
Build a staircase. 

The first method makes sure you can exert effort for a short period of time, and then when the motivation is gone, you'll be back where you started: in the hole. 
Building the staircase takes a really long effing time. But what it allows you to do is to continue improving even when you're out of the hole. 

One thing I can tell you for sure: no matter how frustrated you are with yourself, the first lesson is to continue existing while you are continually frustrated with yourself. This works whether you are fat, whether you are lazy, unfocused, or have any other negative quality. 

That quality exists because YOU MADE IT SO. You didn't wake up one day and decide on a whim ""hey, let's be a fat lazy slob."" No one does that. You got to where you are through small gradual changes. And that's the only thing that will reverse it: small, constructive, habitual changes accumulated over a long period of time. 

Be well friend. ",0,1363446525,,0,False,3,c8wqi93,t3_1aeozy,t1_c8wqi93,t1_c8wpqfl,,1431604487,2532,False,self,t5_2qh96,2532

True,KoshiaCaron,,,"This is coming from a female history teacher who loves classic and modern literature.

Crazy thought (though based on another teacher's anecdotal evidence): boys like to read and write when they are young, but the elementary curriculum doesn't stress or value the subjects or mediums boys like.  I read a lengthy teacher's reflection on trying to reach one of the boys in her class who was struggling both academically and socially-emotionally.  He loved to talk about violence, as many young boys do.  Traditionally, the elementary curriculum has focused on journal-writing and short stories, both of which are heavily based on social and emotional topics or events.  Therefore, this young boy was completely disengaged during English/Language Arts time.  He did not want to talk about feelings, and avoided tasks or assignments that required him to do so.  His teacher theorized, then, that if she adapted the curriculum to appeal to young boys just as much as it did girls, she would see an improvement in his academic performance, and as a result, in his behavior and self-confidence.  She did a unit on comic books, including reading and producing, and this boy was completely enthralled.  By engaging him in the material, she was able to develop his understanding of language, stress the value of reading, and the foster the skills necessary for verbal and written communication.  I don't mean to suggest this is a panacea, but I think 1) acknowledging that there TENDS to be gender differences, and 2) balancing the curriculum accordingly would be to the benefit of all students.

It doesn't stop at elementary school.  I wrote above that I adore classic literature.  Until the 16th or 17th century, almost none of that literature was intended for both sexes or solely for women.  Most of what has been passed down to us was intended for moderately educated men.  An obvious exception is Shakespeare, and of course there are others.  But ""A Separate Peace?""  I know many of my peers liked that book, but I dragged ass through it.  It was awful.  Completely devoid of action and tangible conflict.  The only part I liked was when Finny fell out of the tree--Good, I said, at least something happens.  Jane Austen?  Kill me.  But ""Native Son?""  ""1984?"" ""Things Fall Apart?""  ""The Odyssey?""  I was riveted.  You can't tell me that middle school aged boys reading ""Treasure Island"" wouldn't be riveted, too.  Maybe you lose the girls for that unit, though I'm sure there is a way to differential the curriculum to appeal to them.  But I don't feel as though middle school and even high school English courses have enough dystopian, science fiction, and action-based literature (that's not an absolute list, by the way).  By ignoring those genres, what we're in essence saying to boys is that what they like is not of value in ELA education.  If that's the message they get, then of course there's a gap.      

It is also not the sole responsibility of English teachers or ELA class to teach reading and writing.  The cornerstone of the new Common Core curriculum is pushing teachers to realize that we are all language teachers.  I am a high school history teacher.  My students and I cannot ""do history"" without reading and writing skills.  If I need to teach those skills so we can actually DO history, then that's what I do.  

Also my side is that fact that boys tend to like history more than girls (depending on the focus, obviously).  I would bet this is just as true in high school as it is in elementary school.  Now, I have plenty of criticisms of elementary school social studies curriculum and content, but in the lens of this gender distinction, I would say the same lesson applies as the lesson above about ELA.  Boys LIKE history--don't squander that by avoiding talking about things boys like, such as violence and war.  It doesn't need to be in a manner that is damaging, and its actually an incredible teachable moment about justice, kindness, and empathy.  You can talk about boy-things, like violence, through an essential question, like, Is violence ever the right answer?  What happens when humans resort to violence?  What are better ways to resolve conflicts?  You'll engage all your students in the material (even the girls, who struggle in their own way with conflict resolution), tap into their background knowledge, help them understand the world and their place in it, and hopefully open the door for more civil discourse.  Lofty goal?  Maybe.  Worth a try?  I would say so.    

TL;DR Though the gap in math and reading achievement may be due in part to neurological differences, we should also address how imbalanced ELA curriculum is in elementary and secondary education.

True,[deleted],,,"There was one time I had to pull - It is a situation I often replay in my head and remember like it was yesterday.  I didn't have beef with anyone or any rivals - I just believe I was in the wrong place at the wrong time.  I was driving my van home as I usually do each night, in my lane, following the speed limit.  Then a car screams up to the side of me, and matches me speed.  I look over to see these two kids (probably around 18-21) in a car with sunroof.  One kid pops out of the sun roof with a backpack on his chest, and reaches in.  At this point I floor my van as fast as a van can go, and they match my speed. I hit the brakes to see if they'd keep going, and they did the same.  I did a quick check to catch the plate, but the car didn't have any pates.  I checked traffic and made a quick U-Turn in my van.   As they get next to me again, I hear my side window break, and see the kid reach into his backpack again, pulling out a rock the size of a grapefruit, and throw it again, slamming the rock into my van.  The kids were laughing.  Since my window was now broken, I heard the driver yell, ""use the gun, use the gun!""

Now stop just for a second - put yourself in my shoes.  All of this is happening within seconds.  My van is being smashed by rocks, I can't outrun (nor would that be safe) in residential area, these kids aren't letting up, and I hear ""use the gun, use the gun"".  Could it be paintball?  There was a rash of drive-by paintballing going on in my city.  There were also plenty of shootings and drive-by shootings.  Could these kids really be trying to kill me?

I remember all my CCW classes telling me that, ""You can always play it safe and wait it out if someone else has a gun or weapon - but sometimes if you wait too long, you will end up being the victim""  I remember doing the video training with the laser gun and video screen they use to test police, and a guy was slowly coming out from behind a door with a revolver hanging off his pinky.  He kept saying, ""I'm comin' out!  I'm comin' out!  Don't shoot me!  Don't shoot me!""  I had the shot lined up, but chose to wait.  He put the gun down, and I didn't have to shoot.  A few more students do different scenarios, and this one came up again.  The ending was different this time.  As the suspect came out from behind the door with his hands up and the revolver hanging off his pinky, in a split second he spun his hand and was able to fire before the student even was able to get a shot off.  

So remember, these thoughts are flying through my brain in a matter of milliseconds.  They weren't even thoughts really, they were more of pre-programmed instincts from playing the ""what-if"" game constantly.  One of those thoughts/ instincts were ""If I choose to shoot and miss, this bullet could go right past them and into a house on the other side of the street.  Also, this isn't some movie.  All my training never prepared me for car to car shoot-out.  Shit like this - It was just something I never thought would happen.

So the moment came where I had to make a choice, and I swear to god I can TASTE this moment still like it was just minutes ago.  Once glance to the kid in the sunroof - he was reaching in another compartment in his backpack.  One glance to the driver who was looking ahead on the road, and looked over at me, laughing.  

I'm left handed, so with my left hand on the wheel, I cross draw with my right hand, swinging my firearm across the passenger seat and point straight at his head.  From thousands and thousands of practice pulls both left and right handed, the pull was instant.  Right hand grab, thumb unlatches concealed holster tab, as I'm pulling the safety is turned off, trigger finger remains on the side of the gun - but the moment you can't practice is the moment a human being becomes your target.

In a split second, the driver who went from laughing, turned to the biggest ""OH SHIT"" face, and slammed on the brakes, screeching the tires.  I even remember hearing the anti-lock brakes on his car chirping.  

So to this day, I still don't know if I was justified in pulling.  As many others have said here, only pull if you intend on shooting.  I pulled because I heard them say, ""use the gun, use the gun"" and I wasn't able to remove myself from the situation.  However, the moment I pulled, THEY choose to break off, so I'm still not sure.  Even if I was right for drawing, I am extremely thankful that I didn't have to take some kids life.  Even if they were intending on shooting up my van for whatever reason, I am just grateful no life was taken that night.

EDIT: Thanks for the gold.  I’ve been rolling around laughing because I work in the rail industry and my greatest reddit contribution is summarizing our profession with ascii art. 

To help OP out, here is some rerailing info:

Generally OP’s company will only rerail freight cars if they are still up right.  If they are on their side, they’ll often consider them “totaled” and drag them off to the side for scrap.   They will do their best to rerail locomotives because they are much more expensive. 

The best tools for the job are side booms.  They are commonly used in the pipeline industry, but they work well for picking up a freight car and moving it.   [Here are side booms in action.](http://imgur.com/3A2275s)  [More Pics](http://goo.gl/K2ERp)  You will notice in the pic that the side booms have rubber pads on their track treads.  This is so they can drive over the rails and not damage them.

[Excavators]( http://goo.gl/0dwvG) are also commonly used.  They will have a jaw on the bucket for grabbing and tearing railcars.  And of course they will use sometimes use cranes to pick the whole vehicle up. 

Sometimes a rail vehicle will only have a few wheels derailed.  In this case you use a rerailer, which is just a [ramp for the wheel to climb up on]( http://www.nolancompany.com/main/Pictures/Photos-for-web-091603/Lg-SWA-In.jpg), or [hydraulics to pick-up-and-move-over one end of the rail vehicle](http://www.railquip.com/Pages/rerail002.htm).

You won't see launchd in spotlight - it isn't an application.  If you open up Activity monitor, you will see launchd listed a bunch of times.  It is kinda the scheduler and tells various things when to run.  


I haven't tested this, as I don't have Devon Think - but this should do it for you.  There are two parts to this - the bash script which does the work, which is pretty much just a wrapper around your applescript, and a launchd plist.  The plist tells the computer what to do and when.

The Launchd plist:

    &lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?&gt;
    &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC ""-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN"" ""http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd""&gt;
    &lt;plist version=""1.0""&gt;
    &lt;dict&gt;
    	&lt;key&gt;AbandonProcessGroup&lt;/key&gt;
    	&lt;true/&gt;       
    	&lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;
    	&lt;string&gt;com.devon-move&lt;/string&gt;
    	&lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt;
    	&lt;array&gt;
    		&lt;string&gt;/Users/--Put_your_home_directory_here--/Documents/devon-move.sh&lt;/string&gt;
    	&lt;/array&gt;
    	&lt;key&gt;StartCalendarInterval&lt;/key&gt;
    	&lt;dict&gt;
    		&lt;key&gt;Hour&lt;/key&gt;
    		&lt;integer&gt;02&lt;/integer&gt;
    		&lt;key&gt;Minute&lt;/key&gt;
    		&lt;integer&gt;30&lt;/integer&gt;
    	&lt;/dict&gt;
    &lt;/dict&gt;
    &lt;/plist&gt;

I would name this com.devon-move.plist.  I would put it in your your home directory's Library folder, in the LaunchAgents folder.

What this is doing is telling the computer - at Hour 2, minute 30, run the script  /Users/--Put_your_home_directory_here--/Documents/devon-move.sh (You need to put in the name of your home directory there - and put the actual script in your Documents folder).  Now I am labeling the ""job"" ""com.devon-move"".

Now onto the bash script:


    #!/bin/bash
    # DevonTHINK manipulation script

    # Perform the AppleScript 
    /usr/bin/osascript &gt; /dev/null &lt;&lt;EOT

    property FOLDERS_MONTHS : {""01 January"", ""02 February"", ""03 March"", ""04 April"", ""05 May"", ""06 June"", ""07 July"", ""08 August"", ""09 September"", ""10 October"", ""11 November"", ""12 December""}
    property FOLDERS_DAYS : {""01"", ""02"", ""03"", ""04"", ""05"", ""06"", ""07"", ""08"", ""09"", ""10"", ""11"", ""12"", ""13"", ""14"", ""15"", ""16"", ""17"", ""18"", ""19"", ""20"", ""21"", ""22"", ""23"", ""24"", ""25"", ""26"", ""27"", ""28"", ""29"", ""30"", ""31""}

    tell application ""DEVONthink Pro""
    activate

    set inboxFolder to create location ""/* Next Actions""
    set ticklerFolder to ""/** Tickler""
    set currentMonth to item (month of (current date)) of FOLDERS_MONTHS
    set currentDay to item (day of (current date)) of FOLDERS_DAYS
    set currentFolder to create location (ticklerFolder &amp; ""/"" &amp; currentMonth &amp; ""/"" &amp; currentDay)
    set theChildren to the children of currentFolder
    repeat with theRecord in theChildren
        move record theRecord to inboxFolder
    end repeat

    end tell
    EOT
    exit 0

As you can see, I didn't add much - just added a header and plopped your AppleScript in it.  Save this in your documents folder and call it devon-move.sh.  Capitalization is important - the name of the script in the plist has to match the actual name of the script in the Documents folder.

You can use Text Edit, or any other basic text editor to make the files.  I haven't tried word, but text edit should be fine.  

Now that you have your two files saved where they should be, we need to do two more things - 1. Make the script executable and then load the launchd.  Let's presume that your home directory is in /Users/toronto_gosh.  This means the devon-move.sh's full name is ""/Users/toronto_gosh/Documents/devon-move.sh"", and the launchd plist's full name is: ""/Users/toronto_gosh/Library/LaunchAgents/com.devon-move.plist""

Now - to make the script executable, we need to open up the Terminal.  Type this in:


    chmod +x /Users/toronto_gosh/Documents/devon-move.sh


If everything went right, you should get no feedback from the terminal.  now type in 


    ls -lan /Users/toronto_gosh/Documents/devon-move.sh


You should see a listing of the files in your Documents folder.  At the beginning of the line for the devon-move.sh you should see a bunch of letters - the should be 


        -rwxr-xr-x 


The x's mean it is executable - meaning it can be run like a program.  


Now that the file can be run, we need to tell launchd to actually run the job.  This is where the plist comes in.  
Type this in the terminal -  


        launchctl load /Users/toronto_gosh/Library/LaunchAgents/com.devon-move.plist


If everything went right, you should get no feedback from the terminal.  To check that it loaded - we need to ask launchd what is loaded.  


      launchctl list | grep devon


This says - hey Lauchd, what do you have running, that also has the word devon in it?  Since we named it devon-move, you should see a line that has a few numbers, and then the ""com.devon-move"" label we put in waay up there.  And that is your crash course on launchd and bash scripting.

When I couldn't figure out what they were saying I put [...] or ...

Also: I am not familiar with any of the people involved in this discussion, so I described them as best as I could.

**Here we go:**

**Long blond hair guy:** How does the presence of an audience affect your music? 

**Long brown hair and beard guy:** And do you even care if there's people watching you or not?

**Sunglasses guy:** […] if you are standing up there and you realize that the people get what you are doing and they are feeling it, it turns you on and you get better. 

**Long brown hair and beard guy:** So it's important to you that there are people there...

**Sunglasses guy:** […] if there are only ten wimps sitting there you'll perform [worse] accordingly. 

**Long brown hair and beard guy:** If you didn't get paid for it, would you still get up there and play?

**Sunglasses guy:** Yes.

**Someone:** We already did that.. we do that quite often...

**Long brown hair and beard guy:** Yes? Now? Well, I was just wondering..

**White shirt guy:** But I mean you've got to be able to make a living from that somehow.

**Long brown hair and beard guy:** Of course, I realize that. I'm not forgetting about that aspect...

**White shirt guy:** I'm just addressing what he said earlier. I assume he thought that the first couple of tracks were too entertaining. I mean they were going into the direction of entertainment rather than deep music. Making deep music does not always work, you know. You can't always achieve Goethe-esque depth, even Goethe himself could not do that. He had those times as well when he would get a little more shallow and times when he got deeper. I mean, you can't run around your everyday life with 360000 revolutions per minute all the time, it would wear you out.

**Bowl cut guy:** If you are producing a record, you can't have an audience around to react to your music, you don't have anybody to respond to while playing. 

**White shirt guy:** That's a completely different thing. If you are making a record, or doing televison, or a live gig. Entirely different things. In a studio you can repeat certain things indefinitely, for example. If that [music] would still be good is a different question. It's just a completely different way of working. The same as if you were to compare driving a Goggomobil to driving a 38-tonner  with a trailer. And that's different again from driving a horse carriage. You are driving in all cases, but HOW you are driving, that's the crucial difference. And I mean, you are lacking the practical experience, to experience something like that you'd probably have to be involved in the production of a record from step one. It's very hard to explain that with words. Practically it's just a huge difference to the music you are making. If you were to go to a studio and make the music you were just playing here, the first thing you'd have to figure out was how to start. That alone would take you multiple hours, probably days. On tape you can hear everything. Each mistake, each hick-up, it's unforgiving really. And that's where you can see who is capable of adapting to that and who isn't, and you can only do that with lots of experience. You can't learn that overnight.  

**Beret guy:** That's raising the question for me if you are only able to produce good music by using that technical equipment or if the music only creates a good feeling for you if you are using that equipment.

**White shirt guy:** Well, that technical equipment is just a necessity for us. It's the opposite of what you guys are doing. You take a metal bucket, a broomstick, a string, a guitar, a bottle and a comb, or a harmonica and a funnel and make music with that. Of course you can make music by using that stuff. I can drum on suitcases or trash cans, that's possible. But eventually you'll want to get away from the trash cans and the suitcases, purchase a drum set and refine what you are working with.

**Someone:** Follow-up question: why are we supposed to do that? Why is that step desirable in the first place?

[…]

**Passive aggressive shiny jacket beret guy:** For the same reasons why people decided to fabricate clothes when they used to be cold. And why they moved out of their caves and started building houses. That's why some people purchase a drum set. 

**Some guys:** Doesn't make much sense to me...

**White shirt guy:** That dialectical discrepancy is there, but you just cannot smooth it out.

**Long brown hair and beard guy:** You are forgetting that with approaching technological perfection you are losing more and more of what was giving you the feeling that got you started on making music in the first place. What are your reasons for making music? I didn't get an answer to that question.

**White shirt guy:** Because it is fun.

[…]

**Sunglasses guy:** ...because the reasons change daily. You make new experiences every day, especially while working with the media...

**Fedora guy:** I'd compare it to a bullfighter who tells himself  'now is the moment of truth'. And each live gig is somehow a moment of truth. And each record.

**Long brown hair and beard guy:** Well, great. Then let me get back to what he said. He said there are different reasons every day. I am wondering: why does it have to be music every day then? 

**Fedora guy:** Well, why does the bull fighter fight bulls everytime? He could as well be fighting mice or whatever. 

**Long brown hair and beard guy:** … but you just said it yourself, you are not a robot. You could do whatever to have fun. You could start eating apples, that's just as much fun.

**Fedora guy:** Yeah, but I am a versatile personality, same thing holds for our band. Each individual is versatile and has different talents, be it in technology, music, rhetorics or whatever. The only common denominator we have is that we make music together. I think it's the same for your band, although the difference between us might seem huge to you. You have the same intuition.

**Long brown hair and beard guy:** I would answer that with 'no', plain and simple.

[...]

**Passive aggressive shiny jacket beret guy:** Why do you guys make music at all?

**Long brown hair and beard guy:** We only play music when it is fun for us.

**Someone:** Why?

**Long brown hair and beard guy:** For multiple reasons that differ from individual to individual. There is a certain feeling …if there are certain reasons, which can be different each day (just like he said), they'll drive you to play music. On another day those reasons will drive you to eat apples and it'll be equally fulfilling.

It also fits since the UA723 is an adjustable voltage linear regulator and is 14 pins.   There may be a couple other possibilities, I'll let you know if I find another one.

I suggest you try and see what components are connected and see if it makes sense with the datasheet.  If it does, chances are thats your part.

True,runningandguitars,,,"Here are my diet and exercise tips:
Here are some of my tips. 1-Plan ahead of time. Only buy healthy food so that if you get hungry, you have no choice but to eat that food and you won't willingly let your will power go and grab a bag of chips or candies. 2- Eat in smaller portions. Have a certain bowl and plate that are smaller. That way, if you're still hungry after the initial serving, you won't feel as guilty going for a second portion due to it being a normal portion of what you would have eaten the first time around. 3- Separate your plate into groups of food. If this helps, use a permanent marker and draw a line across your plate to represent 50% of your plate. This should be filled with greens and veggies, such as salad or steamed vegetables. Secondly, draw another line that connects to to first one in the middle of the plate to represent the other side being 25% each. The first 25% should be your whole grain. This could be bread, rice, potatoes. The last 25% is your protein. This includes poultry, fish, eggs, nuts. Here is a diagram to help out: http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_makohruZkL1qmhwmo.jpg 4- All snacks should be fruit based. Some good examples are: Sliced apples with a tbsp of peanut butter. A banana mixed in greek yogurt. Fruit smoothies. 5- Change everything you eat to it's best version. Milk should now be skim or try soy, almond or coconut milk. Bread is now whole grain. Coffee is now with milk rather than cream and no sugar. I actually drink mine black now. Yogurt is better as greek yogurt due to protein being very high. I recommend fish for protein due to having healthy fats as well. Nuts are amazing but only in moderation. So I would say buy them prepackaged in 100 calorie packets. The best thing you can eat for breakfast is oatmeal as I have learned over the years. Try to eat as much organic food as you can, but this is not necessary. Here's a list of my favorite diet foods: greek yogurt, cottage cheese, almonds, tuna, salmon, avocados, egg whites, plain oatmeal, shrimp, tofu, quinoa and hummus. 6- Keep a food diary. If you see what you've eaten then you're less likely to eat more because you are conscious of your goal. 7- Do NOT weigh yourself daily. Your weight changes throughout the day and if you do this you will get discouraged quickly. Weigh yourself roughly once every 2 weeks. If you're too anxious to wait, then once a week. 8- Diet is only 70% of weight loss. 30% is still through exercise. Therefore, I encourage that you make an effort to go to the gym at least 3 times a week. If you can't make it to the gym, you can still do body weight exercises at home. Look them up online. 9- Drink tons of water and try to cut out alcohol. No more juice. Juice has A LOT of sugar in it and so does soda. Try to drink as much water as possible. I drink about 8 glasses a day. As for alcohol, I know it's hard, but if you drink less you're more likely to see results. Most alcohol is jam packed with sugar and will slow your weight loss down. You can still drink in moderation, meaning once or twice a month, but try to stick to hard alcohol such as vodka with water instead of soda or juice. 10- Set a goal weight. I started at 265lbs and my goal was to be under 200lbs. I didn't stop until I reached my goal and once I was there, I already knew how to lose the weight so I kept going and I'm now 145lbs. It's incredible what you can set your mind to. Reward yourself if you've accomplished something. For example: I used to not be able to run around the block without getting winded. Now I'm entered in a half marathon for the summer. Throughout the way, when I would be able to run an extra mile, I would reward myself with a piece of clothing or going to the movies.

True,Thehealeroftri,,,"When I was in my first year of teaching I was pretty young and only a few years older than my students.  I heard most of the drama but there is one student that I will always be reminded of when people ask this question.  

There was a student named Kathy who loooooved to gossip.  She thought she was being sneaky when she gossiped with her friends but she really wasn't.  Everyone could hear her, including me.  Kathy was one of the popular girls so she had a lot to gossip about.  She gossiped most days but one day was different.  

I heard her talking to her friend when the class was quiet and she said that she wanted to have sex with someone in the classroom.  I listened more closely (I know, I shouldn't have) out of curiosity because, why not?  It could be fun.  

Anyways, she ended up saying the name of who she wanted to engage in sexual intercourse with.  

Mr. Thehealeroftri..

I was shocked when I heard this.  

But stupid, stupid me decided I'd act on it because I was young and she was young.  She was pretty attractive too and I'm decent looking I guess.  If you saw us in public it really wouldn't be weird at all since the age difference wasn't big, but I digress.

After class I called her up to my desk and started talking to her about her work.  It was kind of awkward the entire conversation because I knew what she wanted to do and I couldn't get the image out of my head.

As soon as we were done talking about her schoolwork I said, ""Hey Kathy.  I heard you talking about me in class...""  she face turned pale white and before I could tell her I wanted to have sex with her she interrupted me and said, ""Oh my god!  You heard me say that?  I'm so sorry! And-"" before she could finish her sentence I said loudly, ""I want to have sex with you too.""

She stopped her sentence and smiled.  Then she said, ""Do you know what my rates are?""

Confused, I asked her about it and she explained to me awkwardly that she was actually a prostitute and was continuing her conversation from the last class she was in.  It turns out she mentioned that she *would* have sex with me... if I paid that is.  

I decided that since I was already in it this far I might as well pay her. ""Alright,"" I told her.  ""What do you mean?""  

""I'll do it, but I need some money of course.  That's just how it works."" she said.  I replied, ""Okay, what do you need?""

""I need about tree fiddy.""

It was around this time I realized that Kathy was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era.  That goddamned monster had tricked me again!  ""GODDAMNIT MONSTAH, I AIN'T GIVIN' YOU NO TREE FIDDY!"" I said to her as she swam away.

Class was really weird after that with Kathy gone.  I never told any of the students about our encounter but I sure as hell would never mention it to anyway.  Ever.  Of course I'm telling Reddit, but isn't that what the internet is for?  To tell strangers your deepest, darkest secrets?

The year ended without being... too weird.

True,Nutcup,,,"I'm going to add on to this, as I have suffered several down periods in my life.  I went through years where I hated life with a passion, but kept going.  Not sure how or why, but it was definitely a combination of friends, family and my own determination to not give up.  Then, I became a father - and that changes everything.  Now I CANNOT make a selfish decision like that, even if I had the balls to carry through on it.  You can't make selfish decisions as a parent and I could not imagine doing that to my daughter.   

So...what have I learned in the years I have been here?  Life is good if you want it to be.  A simple attitude change did it for me.  I think positive now and look for the good in life, instead of focusing on the bad  - which was my mainstay for years.  Life will surprise you.  You'll find good when you don't think there is any left in life - if you keep going.  I learn something new everyday.  If I would have ended my life, I would have missed out on so much.    

You have two options:  Live or Die.  The latter has only one outcome - you're dead.  The other has endless possibilities and outcomes.  It won't always be a bed of roses, but it's all about how you handle it.  Handle it with a smile (even when it's fucking hard) and you will bask in life's rewards.  Try it.

True,sammy1857,,,"Yeah, and the Palestinians are? This article can ignore all these [efforts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_process_in_the_Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#Attempts_to_make_peace) (with a special blind eye towards Camp David and the more recent [withdrawl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel%27s_unilateral_disengagement_plan) and evacuation of ~9,000 Israelis from Gaza) and just say they have been meandering around for 50 years making no efforts that were repeatedly shot down- doesn't make it true.

Where was Abbas, whose primary excuse for avoiding the negotiating table has been settlement construction, purposefully hiding for **9 months** in 2009 when Netanyahu installed a **10 month** settlement freeze (which would have been extended and negotiations resumed had the Palestinian Authority been willing to recognize Israel as a Jewish State)?

Where was the PA in [**February 2011**](http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4024177,00.html), when Israel offered to ease economic/security restrictions against the PA, to allow additional Arab construction in East Jerusalem, give the PA security control in seven West Bank cities, and discuss a proposed PA gas field alongside an Israeli one off the coast of Gaza, **on condition that the Palestinian Authority resume direct talks**?

There are [numerous issues](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_process_in_the_Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#Major_current_issues_between_the_two_sides) to resolve before a lasting peace can be reached, including:

* Borders and division of the land;
* Strong emotions relating to the conflict on both sides;
* Palestinian concerns over Israeli settlements in the West Bank;
* Status of Jerusalem;
* Israeli security concerns over terrorism, safe borders, incitements, violence;
* Right of return of Palestinian refugees [&amp; descendents] living in the Palestinian diaspora.

These are real issues on *both* sides, and when certain parties refuse to come to the negotiating table until their demands are met (and will thus refuse to concede, as with Abbas and the ""right of return"", a demand which will import over 5 mil Palestinians, most of whom have never stepped on Israeli land, into Israel proper), the situation can become rather hopeless- it's not only the Israelis that are throwing wrenches here.

This article talks about Israel not being interested in a solution, but purposefully fails to mention the Palestinians' role in perpetuating the current situation.

Did you know a majority of Palestinians see a two state solution as a [precursor](http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/poll-most-palestinians-see-two-state-solution-as-precursor-to-single-state-1.325793) to a single Palestinian state (the original goal in 1948, and the [reason](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncppNE7G5tU) 5 armies invaded Israel the day after it was declared)? Interestingly relevant polls-

&gt;Almost two-thirds of Palestinians (59 percent in the West Bank and 63 percent in Gaza‏) support the two-state solution ‏(Israel and Palestine‏) **but eventually hope that one state − Palestine − will prevail**, according to a survey by pollster Stanley Greenberg for The Israel Project.

&gt;**Only 23 percent said they believed in Israel’s right to exist as the national homeland of the Jews**. However, 50 percent supported recognizing Israel as a Jewish state in order to reach the two-state solution.

From a [different](http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=229493) poll:

&gt;When given a quote from the Hamas Charter about the need for battalions from the Arab and Islamic world **to defeat the Jews, 80% agreed**. 73% agreed with a quote from the charter (and a hadith, or tradition ascribed to the prophet Muhammad) about **the need to kill Jews hiding behind stones and trees.**

This is a two way street.

**Edit**:

[Relevant speech](http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2012/11/201343.htm) on this subject by Hillary Clinton this past November-

&gt;Well, look, I think Israelis have good grounds to be suspicious. And I would never be one who tries to rewrite or dismiss history. **The Palestinians could have had a state as old as I am if they had made the right decision in 1947. They could have had a state if they had worked with my husband and then-Prime Minister Barak at Camp David. They could have had a state if they’d worked with Prime Minister Olmert and Foreign Minister Livni.**

&gt;Now, would it have been a perfectly acceptable outcome for every Israeli and every Palestinian? No. No compromise ever is. But there were moments of opportunity. And I will also say this. When Prime Minister Netanyahu agreed to a 10-month settlement freeze I flew to Jerusalem. We’d been working on this. George Mitchell had been taking the lead on it. And when Prime Minister Netanyahu agreed to a 10-month settlement freeze, it wasn’t perfect. It didn’t cover East Jerusalem, but it covered much of the contested area in the West Bank.

&gt;And I stood on a stage with him at 11 o’clock – Israelis always meet late at night, I don’t understand it – (laughter) – but 11 o’clock at night, midnight, and I said it was unprecedented for any Israeli prime minister to have done that. I got so criticized. I got criticized from the right, the left, the center, Israeli, Jewish, Arab, Christian, you name it. Everybody criticized me. But the fact was it was a 10-month settlement freeze. And he was good to his word. **And we couldn’t get the Palestinians into the conversation until the tenth month.**

&gt;So, look, I’m not making excuses for the missed opportunities of the Israelis, or the lack of generosity, the lack of empathy that I think goes hand-in-hand with the suspicion. So, yes, there is more that the Israelis need to do to really demonstrate that they do understand the pain of an oppressed people in their minds, and they want to figure out, within the bounds of security and a Jewish democratic state, what can be accomplished.

&gt;And I think that, unfortunately, there are more and more Israelis and Palestinians who just reject that idea out of hand: Why bother? Why try? We’ll never be able to reach an agreement with the other. **But in the last 20 years, I’ve seen Israeli leaders make an honest, good-faith effort and not be reciprocated in the way that was needed.**

**TL;DR**- to say Israel is the only one supposedly ""not interested in peace"" is disingenuous *at best*. Not saying Obama even made such a remark, as I don't trust any article which doesn't even have an identifiable source, much less one from Haaretz (who has been caught straight up lying so many times it's a wonder they're still accepted on this site).

These definitions are only relevant if `getStatus` is actually called; therefore, they belong inside the function.

    while 1 == 1:

This is canonically spelled `while True:`.

You need to `r.getcode()` in every case, and that's the value you're actually interested in, not the opened URL itself. So store the status code in a variable, not the opened URL. Similarly, consider converting `elapsed_time` to `int` in-place.

    def elapsed_time(_since=time()):

You seem to be aware that the default value will be evaluated once, when the module is loaded. This is a tricky thing to be relying on. You also have to measure elapsed time in another file. Consider making a Timer class which you can initialize with a start time (defaulting to the current time) and which tells you elapsed time on demand.

----

Actually, don't. You don't need a class for that. Here's all you need:

    from time import time

    def timer(start = None):
        if start is None: start = time()
        return lambda: time - start

Now you can do

    elapsed = timer()
    # later on
    elapsed() # number of seconds since creation

AFAIK, you're intended to use `httpd.server_close()` for this.

True,sidecarfour,,,"I teach a high school level childcare and development course in which myself and another teacher run a pre-school program that is operated out of our high school.  My story has nothing to do with high school students, actually, but has to do with some of the pre-schoolers we work with this year.  Bit of background info, first:  Sophomores-Seniors can take the course (up to 20 high school students in a class) and assist in creating small lessons for and generally entertaining the pre-schoolers (we have 20 this semester) while also studying child development.  The little ones are there Monday-Wednesday, so our ""big kids"" (as we call the high school students when the little ones are around) are able to further focus on their childcare studies Thursday and Friday.

Anyway, we have one especially interesting group of pre-schoolers this year.  Three little ones in particular developed a strange love-triangle half way through the semester.  Two adorable blonde girls, Emily (3) and Sarah (3) were best friends, played together all the time, ate snack together, everything.  (**Subbing out names of students to protect identities, obviously**).  Half way through the semester, both of them developed a crush on a little boy named Tyrone (4) who referred to himself as a ""Little Gangsta"".  Suddenly Emily and Sarah were fighting to sit next to Tyrone, arguing over who could play house with him and be his ""wife"", mostly adorable squabbles.

Well one day Emily had enough of Sarah getting too close to Tyrone, so she walked over to Sarah and slapped her in the face.  Rather than come and tell myself or my co-teacher, or tell one of the ""big kids"" who take the class, Sarah (obviously upset that she got slapped) went and told Tyrone what happened.  Well, Tyrone decided to solve the situation himself and proceeded to confront Emily about what had happened and, as Emily told me running over hysterical and crying, Tyrone ""pulled a knife on her"".  Tyrone was known for having foul language and being overall mischievous, so here I am thinking that Tyrone has just pulled a knife on Emily and we are going to have to have a serious and probably awkward conversation with his parents.  First, though, I had to assess the situation.

I walk over to where Tyrone and Sarah are sitting together, and I ask Tyrone what happened and if he pulled a ""knife"" on Emily.  Tyrone stands up, puts on his tough guy appearance, and reaches a hand into his pocket.  ""Emily hit my boo Sarah"", he began, pulling out the object that was in his pocket, ""So I told the bitch I would cut her if she didn't back off.""  He made a little jabbing motion with the ""knife"" he had pulled out. What Tyrone really had was a plastic, clearly fake red and blue Little Tykes butter knife from our play kitchen that I didn't even know we had.  There were no other kitchen utensils in the play area, so it must have been a toy from a student's home that got left at school.  Needless to say we had to have a serious conversation about appropriateness of language and address the ""use of the knife"" with his parents, but I have to admit it was hard not to smile at his justification/ explanation.  I will never forget those three.

We then invade Iraq based on extremely flimsy, and possibly made up, evidence.  And it killed us in Afghanistan because we diverted our attention and resources in a big way.

And once we did win the initial invasion in Iraq it turned out we had literally zero postwar plans.  So rather than stabilizing things we allowed multiple resistance movements, many of them foreign, to consolidate power.

Bush then went out and proclaimed several countries as belonging to an ""Axis of Evil"" and completely abandoned agreements we had with them.  North Korea began producing weapons grade uranium again... and then Iran joined in.   And after Bush's arrogant proclamations of unilateral action and American(and British) superiority even our allies started to get sick of us.  So we'd wasted all the sympathy we got from 9/11.

He also managed to reverse what was the largest government surplus in decades and turn it into the largest yearly deficit in history by the time he was out of office.  The Bush tax breaks were supposedly there to help our economy, but ultimately it just gave massive tax breaks to the wealthy.  Obviously it failed to work because we found ourselves in the biggest American recession in nearly a century at the end of his term.   So not only did he bungle two wars and assist in the wrecking of the economy...  but he also did massive harm to American prestige and left future Presidents and citizens to foot the bill for his unpaid wars and tax breaks.

""It turns out procrastination is not typically a function of laziness, apathy or work ethic as it is often regarded to be. It’s a neurotic self-defense behavior that develops to protect a person’s sense of self-worth.

You see, procrastinators tend to be people who have, for whatever reason, developed to perceive an unusually strong association between their performance and their value as a person. This makes failure or criticism disproportionately painful, which leads naturally to hesitancy when it comes to the prospect of doing anything that reflects their ability — which is pretty much everything.""

A true sense of your self-worth. A true and lasting motivation will not come from within yourself. It will come from your relationships with your family, friends, and, if you are religious, with God. Further focusing on yourself, beating yourself up for your flaws, trying to pump yourself up because of your potential and past accomplishments, and other inward facing tactics will, in my experience, only dig the hole deeper. Forget yourself. Think of your family. Now start working. Think of their unconditional acceptance of you and the immense worth they find in you. Now think of their needs and how your work helps fulfill them. Now start working. Think of all the ways you can be there for them and then just start moving. Don't beat yourself up over your flaws, they do not define you. You should also probably seek professional help, don't let pride stop you. Good luck.

When the ""fiscally conservative"" bitch about welfare, the recipients aren't White. When they bitch about immigrants, it's not Europeans. School vouchers aren't so Black parents can get their kids out of suburban White schools.

""Our America"" is a White, straight, Protestant male America, and they need to ""Take It Back"" from those who aren't. It should be no surprise when the persistent dog whistle racism allows the mainstreaming of blatant White Supremacist rhetoric.

The dismantling of civil protections and economic regulation codifies racial, classist, and gender power disparity. It is inherently White Supremacist. It protects the unearned racial privilege of White males over others in an inherently patriarchal, racist system. It is the advancement of the ""freedom"" of unfettered White male power of oppression couched in flowery rhetorical terms that allow otherwise well-meaning people to embrace xenophobic policy. 

So there is a horrible, inexorable logic that this patronizing view would eventually embrace the language of ancient pro-slavery advocates, many of whom truly believed that the patriarchal racism of slavery ""provided the Negro's best opportunity"". White men know best what is good for the obviously inferior mud races - ""we don't hate them, we love them and want to take care of them!"" Because clearly, women nor people of color can take care if themselves, right?

This elaborate rhetorical dance tries to avoid the shame of blatant racism, and tries to shift the blame to ""Liberals always resorting to name calling"", while so-called ""good Republicans"" decry the words that show the truth of the patriarchal racism inherent in their agenda. THIS is the real issue.

None of this White Supremacist language or rhetoric directly conflicts with stated mainstream GOP policy, no matter how many tokens they advance (and then abandon, as Michael Steele and Herman Cain will tell you). 

Fact is that without accepting one's racial and gender privilege, as the mainstream GOP loves to deny even exists despite reams and reams of data showing otherwise, any agenda that removes protections without correcting unearned racial and gender advantages is going to be inherently unequal.

True,puss_parkerswidow,,,"It may have something to do with the transition from silent films to ""talkies"". 

Many actors were afraid for their careers when talkies came to be. Sound guys were sent to special classes/ seminars to learn how to record. They became more important than directors for a time. The sound guys had casting approval and final say on what takes would become part of the film. 

Many of the biggest silent film stars were out of work based on their voices. Stage trained actors flocked to Hollywood. Clara Bow- the original ""it girl"" was a gifted actor who could cry on cue, and a master of pantomime. She naturally did things that conveyed emotion in a way audiences could relate to. She was better than the films she acted in. She was a product, subjected to 4 times yearly repetition of the winning formula that made the studio (Paramount, once B.P. Schulberg and Clara came aboard) lots of money. Seriously- she was the biggest grossing  actor of her day for a while- and adjusting the profits for today's money- well, she'd be richer than a lot of actors now- were she better suited to managing her own cash.

She was beautiful and gifted, but audiences did not want to see her in dramas. They liked her in formula comedy. 

In her day, actors were terrified of the sound man manipulating their voices if he happened to not like them (though this was largely an overblown fear, as the technology was in its infancy.) She was absolutely horrified when she heard her voice recorded for the first time. She was a New York girl from the tenements - speaking English properly with the correct diction wasn't her thing.

For  a while, movies lost all the imagery and angles of the great camera work developed in years past. Cameras were now 800lb behemoths that were stationery. Microphones were suspended above a set. Actors spoke in weird stage voices and played to a single, immobile camera and a mic that was hanging above the other actor's head. 

Sets went from bustling and noisy places with, carpentry happening and actual orchestras hired to play mood music that was based upon the emotions of the scene being filmed to quiet, museum like environments. I imagine that an actor would have been petrified by this too, since it was not what they were accustomed to. 

The early talkies are pretty unbearable for this reason. The weird accents were meant to be international and sophisticated. They just seemed weird and unnatural.

Gloria Swanson's famous famous quip regarding this transition was something to the effect of ""in my day, we had faces"" - meaning that everything was conveyed through action and facial expression before the talkies. 

Change was hard. Movie stars were supposed to be so glamorous - this affected accent seems a reflection of that.

EDIT: Text wall...sorry - source: I read so much about this shit.

EDIT #2: The Jazz Singer was considered a novelty at first, but sound was a permanent part of film by 1931 - this was a lot of change in the span of one year.

True,a_photo_guy,,,"Definitely don't do it without some form of compensation or by getting something of value out of it. Basically, either you get paid, or, if you are interested in really learning to shoot weddings/events, then then you get something different than money but of value to you. 

By just second shooting, then handing over photos to the photographer, you just gave him free work that he got paid for, but, if he's a reputable and skilled photographer, you might want to consider having him schedule an hour or so after the wedding shots are edited to sit down and go over how you did. There's a ton of value in having a photographer who cares about you improving sit down and take the time to critique your work and put in the effort of teaching you how to do it better. That's what apprentices do, and there's nothing wrong with going that route with photography.

Yes, it's nice to get paid, but many times I have a suspicion that many of the ""photographers"" online that are adamant that you never (EVER!) do any type of photography work for free aren't really making their income from photography. Personally, I've been assisting with a few photographers for about two years now. Some jobs are paid, some aren't, but are worth my time because I make sure to learn something new. I don't worry about this because almost every real photographer that I've met that makes close to 100% of their income from their photography does trade work and pro-bono work. People who are going to be successful in any business are able to recognize when there is a non-monetary benefit to them that makes a job worth doing out of pocket.

That said, you have to be careful taking jobs that promise ""exposure"". In fact, the high amount of these bullshit postings on craigslist and other sites is more than likely the reason for the militant attitudes of the guys that refuse to do unpaid work. You also have to worry about establishing yourself as the ""free"" or ""cheap"" photographer, but the thing is that people who would label you as that are more than likely not the ones who have something valuable in it for you anyway. 

Like I said, take a job if you can get something valuable out of it. Doesn't have to be money every time. ",0,1363501404,,0,False,1,c8x4vuh,t3_1ag8sk,t1_c8x4vuh,t3_1ag8sk,,1431611344,42,False,photography,t5_2qh2a,42

True,Captain_InsaneO,,,"Well, my advice would to start at a tire shop or oil change place until you can afford/collect a basic set of tools, then after a while, once you're confident enough with your hand tools, and you have good knowledge of the trade and where you want to go, apply at the place you would like to work. Let them know you're in this for an apprenticeship and want to remain dedicated to the company after you have your ticket(even if you don't). Then treat every journeyman you have with complete respect and squeeze every ounce of knowledge out of them you can. I had about 5 different journeymen and they all have there little things they're anal about( building wiring harnesses/electrical, being extremely organized/clean, diagnosing engine issues, some guys just go by types of cars). Never take their knowledge for granted. There is so much to know and they're taking time and effort to pass it on to you. Put in extra effort, let them know you care, and show up on time. When you borrow their tools(you will for a few years until you can afford a full set for yourself), CLEAN them, if you break them, tell them and buy new ones. There is no shame in asking for help, vehicles are complicated and until you're in the trade for ten years, you're still new.
You can learn the coolest stuff in the trade if you want to. Stuff that will help in all parts of your life. It's also the most expensive trade to get into. I know guys with $100K+ of tools, so be prepared to spend.

In the video you are watching a blimp that is carrying a [MX-15 sensor](http://www.wescam.com/products/products_services_1g.asp).  The blimps are stationed above FOBs (Forward operating bases) and COPs (combat outpost).  [Approximately at this location](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=31.514459,65.307798&amp;hl=en&amp;sll=31.512776,65.308399&amp;sspn=0.062124,0.068064&amp;t=h&amp;z=13),  the device was flying, according to the 5.3km, 137 degrees in the video.  They are directly tethered to a tactical operating center (TOC) where a sensor operator, and others, are watching the video, recording the video and disseminating that video to the necessary people.

The video itself is recorded on 03NOV2010 around 1345 when the IED is planted at [this location](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=31.5554272%C2%B0,+065.2678153%C2%B0&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;sll=30.398228,-86.456498&amp;sspn=0.062853,0.068064&amp;t=h&amp;z=15).  Approximately 04NOV 1205, two [MRAPs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRAP) come into the video.  The lead of those vehicles being a counter IED MRAP, similar to [this](http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4134/4801405286_5656cfb81c.jpg).  You can see on the front of the truck what looks to be a long trailer type device.  That device is detecting IEDs buried in the ground, as well as equipment on the back of the MRAP jamming any signals to set off the IED.  The second vehicle holds back, while the lead vehicles clears the path.  On the clear call, the second vehicle is called forward and the IED is activated.

More to the point, this is NOT a drone.  It is obvious on analysis of the video, with KNOWLEDGE of military tactics that someone OBVIOUSLY observed ""suspicious activity"" at that location and [EOD](http://www.goarmy.com/careers-and-jobs/browse-career-and-job-categories/intelligence-and-combat-support/explosive-ordnance-disposal-specialist.html) should be sent to investigate.  Upon investigation, by the first vehicle, nothing was detected through the onboard device and no device was set off.  Various reasons can be deduced as to why, but I will not elaborate.  The second vehicle was then cleared to enter, and detonated the IED.

TL;DR Blimp, not at drone. EOD MRAPs sent to investigate. The narrator of the video is incorrect.

True,t__mhjr,,26/m/chicago*/galeanthropism ~ ask me to write a song about you,"So I've been on OKCupid for a while. I move around a lot for reasons that I won't really get into (they aren't really relevant, and as I type this, I get the feeling it's going to be wayyy TL;DR anyway), and it's proven wonderful for meeting new people in cities all over. As it turns out, after a few years of semi-heavy, mostly national activity on OKCupid, it starts stretching the boundaries by which it finds it appropriate for you to meet people. I'm currently living in a small suburb just outside of Baltimore and I can't tell you the last time I've seen a new Baltimore face pop up on my feed. Everything is New Jersey, Virginia, Philly, DC (I'm not fickle, but seriously i495 is the devil.) and New York. 

So I'm sitting at work, ""working"" and I see someone pop up on my feed that I hadn't before. She just uploaded a picture of her in an ugly Christmas sweater holding her cat with an elementary school style yearbook picture background. NATURALLY, I clicked. Her profile is wonderfully esoteric, minimal but in a very concise, this-is-exactly-what-you-should-know-about-me way, and she's super fucking cute. One of her message me if caveats was being FUNNY. I messaged: 

&gt; ""i'm FUNNY. i like your cat. let's get married or something.

Her reply was quick, flirty and in retrospect, alluded to exactly what we have going on now. At any rate, it was on. We exchanged a couple dozen messages or so and things started getting wild. She was vivid in the way she wrote, she communicated thoughts very effectively. I fucking love that preemptive banter, that seamless switch between, ""I'm making fun of you because I don't know you and I have nothing to lose"" to ""I'm making fun of you because I want to know you can take it, because I want to have everything to lose with you."" Things got overwrought, we fantasized about a cat family and a home together with walls lined with vintage guitars, precious nicknacks and cat jungle gyms that spired to the ceiling. We got deep too quick for our own good. 

We started texting, then Facebook IMing. It wasn't really until I was in New Jersey on the way to her Manhattan apartment that I realized I had never even heard her voice. We never talked on the phone or video chatted. It never came up. Which, in retrospect was probably really dumb and unsafe for lots of reasons, but I'm sure there's some Nietzsche quote about madness that justifies it for me. I obviously made it back alive, and as far as I know, I still have all of my vital organs. 

I drove 4 hours to meet and spend a weekend with a girl from the Internet. I can't properly articulate how many times the gravity of that hit me in the face like a brick. As I was leaving my house with my weekend bag, I stood on my porch for a second wondering if I was crazy, but 4 hours, half a tank of gas, nearly $50 in tolls and half a dozen much larger existential crises later, and I was in Manhattan texting her that I was outside her building. It was cold and I really had to pee, but when I saw her walk outside I stood there in complete awe. I don't know if it was the overromanticism of driving that far to meet someone that I had otherwise, never spoken to, or the fact that she looked (just like every other girl looks, so I don't know why I'm surprised anymore) WAY cuter than her pictures, but I kissed her before we had the chance to say hi. 

We got on the elevator and I could feel her shaking next to me. Which, at the forefront of my mind was the whole ""HOLY SHIT, AM I ACTUALLY UGLY? IS SHE ALL OF A SUDDEN REGRETTING INVITING ME UP? IS SHE GOING TO KICK ME OUT? WHERE AM I GOING TO SLEEP?"" thing (Luckily, I have friends in NY that I told I might need as a plan B [backup girlfriends, as it were, though, all of them were male, that's beside the point]) but I later found out that these were good shakes, and I would be relieved. 

There's lots of really boring, gross, sexual, weird, cute, amazing details in between, but I won't bore you. We did some touristy stuff. We ate sandwiches in Central Park. While people watching in Times Square, she fell asleep on my shoulder. Taking a cat nap outside was a first for me, but she seemed comfortable enough, and I was too. She showed me her favorite bookstore, we ate at her favorite pizza place. She was so ready to share herself with me, and given the extremely short period of time we've known each other, it seemed incredibly strange. Normally, I would've been freaking out about how blazing fast we were moving emotionally and physically, but I was more freaking out at myself at how natural and comfortable I was with it all. 

We spent most of Sunday morning rolling around in bed. As I was getting dressed to leave she started crying. I didn't really want to leave either, (ironically for reasons that I really wasn't sure of until the drive home.) but I had to. My dad is few and far between with his gems of wisdom for me, (or maybe I just don't have the life experience to understand most of them) but he told me once that one of the hardest things I'd ever have to do is to do what I have to do while a woman I care about cries and tells me not to. He was right. 

I should mention, I hate driving in cities. I used to be absolutely terrified of it until I was forced to DD while stomping in San Francisco with some friends. I'm still never comfortable doing it, but for whatever reason, I never felt more at peace than when I left her apartment, lit a cigarette and weaved my way through complex traffic patterns with a bravado that felt very rare for me. As I merged onto 95, the sun was setting and the beauty of it all amplified the cataclysmic cocktail of emotions swirling around in my mind.

I kinda always believed that I was incapable of love. Not because I don't have a heart or compassion, but because I love everything, so I feared that nothing would ever really feel distinct. This felt distinct. I felt physical responses in my body to things she said to me. I knew she wasn't perfect, and I never once tried to convince myself that she was, or that things will get better as we go, and all of the other things infatuation tries to convince us. I knew I'd never understand what she felt for me in the moments that we've shared and she'd never know what I felt for her, because love, like everything else, is improbable and impossible to communicate, but I could feel us trying to genuinely understand each other, and that was honestly the first time I've ever felt like that. I'm not really sure what's going to happen next, but we're both currently planning baby steps to ensure that we don't lose hold of this feeling.

When I got home, I met a friend for a drink because my elusive, ambiguous status updates on Facebook had his interest piqued. He asked me why I did it and the only answer I could think of was because asking myself ""What if?"" anywhere down the line would feel really, really stupid.

""If you press the button in the middle of the room you will be sent 10 years back in time. Your body will be 10 years younger, but your mind will remain the same."" The voice seems to come from all around me, from the very walls of the room. 

""You have 10 minutes to decide."" At these words a large, red 10:00 appears on one of the walls and begin counting down. 

""Is this some kind of joke? You can't just abduct people off the streets and lock them up!"" It doesn't seem like I'll be getting any answers by just asking, so I start to search the room for a way out. The room is small with a low ceiling, barely high enough to stand straight in. The walls are smooth and grey, the only furniture in the room is a table in the middle with a round, red button in the middle. There's no windows and only one door, the one I just came through. Frantically I tug at the door handle trying to get it open, but it is locked tight. After twisting and pulling for a minute I give up. I glance at the clock. 9 minutes left. 

""Alright, I'll play along if you let me go in 9 minutes."" I tell the room at large. ""Would I like to go back 10 years in time, with the mind I have now? That's a tough one. I'd be 13, back to high school for me. I guess I could really up my grades, maybe get in to a nice college instead of dropping out first year... I could ask Alice out before she started going out with Dan... Maybe invest some money and get rich with no effort. Yeah, I think I would go back.""

After spending a few more minutes dwelling on past mistakes I glance at the clock. One minute left. I walk over to the button in the middle of the table. It looks like an ordinary button. I look under the table; there are no wires or anything connecting to the button. It probably doesn't even do anything. 

""Alright, I'm pressing it; just send me right on back!"" I exclaim with a grin and press the button. The clock, showing 23 seconds, goes blank with a click. 

""Nothing happened. What a surprise. Can I go now?"" Still no answer, but I make my way to the door anyway. To my surprise, it's no longer locked. I twist the handle and step through. I'm blinded by the sudden light. What is going on? There was just another dark hallway outside the room when I came here. When my eyes adjust to the light I look behind me and see the front door to my old high school. ""What the FUCK?!"" I fall over backwards in panic as I hear my own high pitched voice, sounding nothing like my own voice. 

""The hell, man? What are you doing?"" I look behind me and see Dan standing there. No way. I open my mouth to answer him, but I realize I have no idea what to say. 

""It's good to see you, man. It's been a while."" I have to resist the urge to face palm as I realize my mistake. 

""What are you talking about? We hang out like, every day. You okay? You're freaking me out here."" He looks at me with concern. I can't believe it's Dan, we haven’t talked since our fight after he started dating Alice. God, I missed him.

~

""So, you wanna do something?"" I try to break the awkward silence as we're walking home from school. 

""Nah, man, it's Tuesday. I got practice, you know that."" Oh, right, football. 

""Right. Well I'll see you tomorrow then."" I say as we reach my house. ""See ya."" Just as I reach out for the handle of my front door I freeze, hand midair. Shit. Shit. Shit, shit, shit. Mom. Mom is alive, how the hell did it take me this long to realize mom was still alive 10 years ago? I start back in to motion, open the door and rush inside. She's sitting right there on the couch watching TV, like nothing happened. 

""Hi, honey. How was school?"" I sprint and jump her with a tackle hug. ""You're okay, mom."" I sob into her shoulder. 

""Of course, I'm okay, baby. Hey, look at me. I'm not going anywhere. I love you."" I hug her tighter 

""I love you too, mom. Will you do one thing for me? Stop with the cigarettes, I'll do anything if you just stop.""

~

I wake up, but keep my eyes closed, trying to savor the dream. Dan and mom... my old school... 

""Honey, you up yet? You're gonna be late for school!"" I feel like I'm about to throw up my heart at the sound of my mom’s voice. I jerk up and hit my head on the shelf above my bed. ""Fuck!"" I rub my head, feeling a little lump where it hit the shelf. 

""What happened up there? And watch your language, young man; we don't say that word in this house!"" I grab some clothes from the closet while I shout down the stairs. 

""I'm fine, I just hit my head. Sorry about the swearing, won't happen again."" God, I can't believe I used to wear this, I think, looking at the too large t-shirts with band names I'd never even heard of on them and the heap of hoodies next to them. Black, black, dark blue, black. I can't believe this is my entire wardrobe. I throw on the most neutral looking, black t-shirt I can find and glance out the small window above my bed. It looks pretty warm; I can probably skip the hoodie. They make me look like I'm a 13-year-old living with my mom anyway.

I head downstairs to the kitchen and grab a bowl of milk and cereal. 

""Hey mom, do you think we could go clothes shopping this weekend? I kinda want to get some new clothes."" She looks at me with concern 

""Why, what's wrong with the clothes you have?"" I shrug. 

""Nothing, I guess. I just want to change style, I guess. The clothes I have are kind of... immature."" She gives me a sad smile. 

""That's nice, dear, but I don't think we can afford it right now."" Right, I forgot how tight our money used to be before the inheritance when grandma passed away. 

""Oh, right. I might be late tonight then, I'm gonna head in to town after school, see if I can find a job."" Mom lets out a laugh. 

""You're a funny guy. A job."" It hurts a little bit, that she doesn't take me seriously, but I let it go. To her, I'm just a 13-year-old kid who's never done a responsible thing in his life, after all. 

""I wasn't kidding you know, I'm gonna try to find a job."" She looks a little taken a back. 

""Really, that's great! I mean I just wasn't expecting...""

~

""Hey, man!"" Dan’s voice snaps me out of my thoughts as he runs up next to me. 

""Hi."" We start walking toward school. 

""So, last night after practice I went home to Andrews’s house, the grade 9 kid. He showed me some mad tricks in Super Smash Bros. You wanna play some after school? I'll teach you!"" For a moment I'm tempted, just hanging out with Dan and playing video games all day... But I already told mom I'd look for a job. 

""Sorry, I'm gonna look for a job after school."" Dan scoffs. 

""Yeah, right. What'd you want a job for?"" I shrug. 

""My mom’s a little short on money right now. I'm just trying to help her out."" Dan scowls. 

""Fine, don't tell me then."" He thinks I lied. He actually thinks I lied, for what? So I could spend the money on sweets without having to share with him? It takes all my self-control not to punch him in the face right there on the spot. He's just 13, I tell myself.

~

It's been a week now and I'm thinking more and more about how it was before. Before I went back. Sometimes I feel like it was just a dream. Maybe I just dreamed ten years of my life, then, when I woke up, I thought it was real. I guess it doesn't matter. I'm trying to do better now, and that's what matters. Not just trying either, I *am* doing better. My grades are up already, I'm sure the paper I handed in yesterday was way beyond what any 13 year old would write on the topic of global warming. I got a job bagging groceries as well. It's not much and it's almost as dull as my old desk job, but at least I get paid. 

I entered the school on autopilot, still lost in thought. 

""Hey."" Brad, a big kid wearing the same stupid grin he always does, calls me over. 

""What's up?"" I ask, walking over to him. He punches me hard in the stomach and I fall to my knees, gasping for air. 

""What happened to you? I used to think you were cool, now all of a sudden you're the teacher’s pet? You dress like some rich kid and you look at everyone like you're better than them. You think you're better than me, huh?"" He grabs me by the shirt and raises his fist. Half the school is watching now, whispers spreading like wildfire through the crowd. 

""Of course I think I'm better then you, that's not really much of a challenge, is it?"" I brace myself for the incoming assault as I hear an ""Ooooh!"" rippling through the crowd.

~

""Mom, I'm home!"" I poke my head into the kitchen. ""Mom?"" Not here. I drop my backpack and go in to the living room. My heart sinks and my hands grow icy cold when I see her on the porch outside. ""I thought I told you to stay away from those!"" I say, ripping the cigarette out of her grip and stomping it. 

""What the hell do you think you're doing? I just needed one cig to calm the nerves, that's all. Oh my god, baby, what happened to your face?"" She looks at the bruises on my face with a horrified expression. 

""DON'T! Change the subject!"" I yell at her, furious. ""This isn't just about you, you know! Have you ever thought of what might happen to me if you get cancer and die?"" She starts to sob and hugs me. 

""I'm sorry, I'll stop, I promise. I'll always be here for you."" My voice beings to crack and my eyes are feeling wet. 

""Don't say that. You don't know that.""

~

I jump out of bed the moment my alarm rings. I glance over at the calendar just to make sure. May 8th. Today is the day. I can barely contain my excitement as I shower and put on my new jeans and plaid shirt I bought with the money I'd earned. Gotta look my best. 

""What are you so excited about?"" I grab a bowl of cereal and start digging in. 

""Oh, I don't know, mom. I just have a feeling today is going to be a great day."" I say with a wink.

""Today, a new student will be joining your class. Please welcome Alice. Alice, you can take a seat over there, next to Daniel."" I can't help but grin at her like an idiot as she walks over and sits down next to Dan and me. She looks so much younger, more innocent then I remember her. 

""Hi. I'm Alice."" She gives me a small wave, showing off her flowery bracelet. I almost forgot about that bracelet. 

""Uhm, hi... I'm Eric."" Seriously. You had ten years to prepare for this moment and you did even worse the second time around then the first. ""You can call me Dan."" Dan says and winks at her. He leans in close and whispers something in her ear that makes her giggle.

As the bell rings I realize I haven’t heard a word of what the teacher said, I've just been staring at the back of Alice's head, wondering what I should say to her. I thought about telling her about the future and what happened to me, but that'd be stupid. She would think I was nuts. Maybe I could tell her it was a dream, and I just knew I was meant to be with her? Nope. Definitely not. Way too creepy. 

I guess I'll just have to woo her the old fashioned way, I dare say I've picked up a few tricks over the past decade. I grab my books and my bag and head out the door when Dan pokes me on the shoulder. ""Hey, my parents are out of town this weekend. I was thinking we could watch some bad movies. My parents think I don't know where they hide the liquor."" He smirks. ""Oh and the new girl, Alice is coming."" I freeze, my mouth working soundlessly trying to come up with something to say. This never happened. Dan’s parents never went out of town, did they? I'm sure I wouldn't have forgotten if we got drunk with Alice only days after she got here. I frantically try to work out all the butterfly effects this change could make in my relationship with Dan and Alice. I give up, it's too complicated, too many things could happen, but I'm sure as hell not gonna leave Dan and Alice alone on a Friday night with a bunch of cheap liquor. 

""Yeah, I'm in, sounds like fun.""

~

""Hey, dude."" Dan swings the door open with a mischievous grin. ""Welcome to the party!"" He waves his arms extravagantly, bottle in one hand. Looks like they've started without me. I follow Dan inside. Alice is already waiting on the couch and greets me with a warm smile. 

""Hi, Eric."" Her low cut tank top make my thoughts wander. Is it wrong for me to be attracted to a thirteen year old? I hope not, because I can't help myself. 

""Hi."" I reply and smile back at her. I slouch down on the couch next to her while Dan grabs a DVD and waves it in front of us excitedly. 

""*I Know What You Did Last Summer*... this just screams shitty horror movie, am I right?""

~

Dan whoops and laughs as some guy gets a large metal hook through his neck. 

""Pass me the bottle, eh."" He's already quite drunk. 

""Don't you think you should take it a little easy on the booze, Dan?"" Dan is staring daggers at me. ""Shut up, you got the girl, I get the booze."" He always gets a bit grumpy when he drinks, but I hand him the bottle anyway. I go back to half watching the movie while trying to work up the courage to place my arm around Alice. Come on, she's right there. Don't be a pussy. Before I can do anything, however, she places her head on my shoulder sleepily and yawns. The smooth touch of her short, blonde hair sends a shiver coursing through my body. 

I'm wiping my sweaty palms on my jeans trying to think of what to say to her, how to let her know how I feel. You know she likes you. She even told you she was going to ask you out, but then your mom died and you spiraled into depression. When I finally snapped out of it, she was with Dan. I had missed my chance. Except, now I had another chance. I hear a clank as the bottle slides out of Dan’s hand and rolls over towards me. He's out cold. I guess his tolerance isn't very high yet. I grab the bottle and take a swig, trying to muster up some courage. 

""I really like you, you know."" My heart is pounding while I wait for her to respond, the seconds crawl by slower than I thought possible. 

""I know."" Every muscle in my body relaxes and I lean my head against hers. What's the word for the feeling in your heart when everything is right in the world?

~

Ring, ring, ring. ""Mooooom, the phone is ringing!"" The sound of Dan’s voice wakes me. I feel a jolt in my stomach when I realize Alice is still asleep, head on my shoulder. Dan doesn't look like he's in any condition to answer the phone, so I carefully move Alice's head over to a cushion, get up and answer it. 

""This is Dan speaking."" I grin at my own poor impression of his voice. 

""Hello. My name is Officer Anna Reed. Are you the son of Thomas and Skyler Hawkins?"" I hesitate for a moment, but I already told her I was Dan, so I decide to keep playing the part.

""Uh... yeah, that's me.""

""I regret to inform you there's been an accident. Your parents were in a car crash late last night. They both died before the paramedics could get to them. I'm very sorry for your loss."" I drop the phone and the curt, impersonal voice informing me of what I should be doing next turns into a distant murmur. I feel like the walls come crashing down around me, the house of cards that is my fragile existence. 

""FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK!"" I cry out falling to my knees. 

""What the hell, what's wrong man?"" My scream woke up the others and they're both staring at me with a mixture of fear and curiosity.

~

It's been two weeks since the accident and I'm sitting in class. The teachers words are flowing in one ear and out the other, nothing really sticks. I squeeze Alice's hand tight in mine, but all I can think about is Dan. He hasn't left the house since the accident, he won't answer the phone and he won't talk to me. Am I responsible for this? If I hadn't pressed the button, Dan would be on his way to marrying his high school sweetheart, Alice, right now. He'd have a nice job and both his parents would still be alive. Fate is cruel, isn't it? 

If I could change my mind now, would I? Would I give up Alice and my mom for Dan? Probably not... Luckily that's not a choice I have to make. It hits me that Dan must be in the same place that I was when my mom died. Shit. I have to help him, but I don't know how. The bell rings and I turn to Alice. 

""Hey, I'm gonna go see Dan, you wanna come?"" She sighs a little. ""Sure, but he's not gonna talk to you, you know."" Probably not. 

""I have to try though, don't I?""

A few minutes later I'm at his door, knocking rapidly. 

""Come on man, I know you're in there. Open up, it's just Alice and me."" I hear something stirring inside. 

""Go away. I don't want to talk to you."" At least he's talking to me now. 

""You can't stay locked up in there forever you know. I... went through something similar once and sooner or later you just have to grit your teeth and start living again."" The door burst open and almost knocks me over. Dan’s tear-streaked and furious face is inches from mine. 

""What the hell do you know about what I'm going through?! You still have your mom don't you? You and your little skank can fuck off. I don't need your pity."" He slams the door behind him and I'm left behind in stunned silence. Alice pulls me by the hand. 

""Come on, let's go.""

~

""Happy Birthday, Eric! I can't believe you're 15 already, you've grown so much these last few years!"" My mom hugs me and kisses me on the cheek. Alice gives me a big warm smile and squeezes my hand. 

""Go on, make a wish and blow out the candles."" I take a moment to think and my gaze falls on Dan. After four weeks of solitude he finally came back to school. We're friends again, but he's different now. He's started to dress almost exclusively in black and he's quiet. Much more quiet than he ever was before. I just want everything to turn out alright for the four of us. Me, my mom, Alice and Dan. If I just knew everything would be alright for the four of us, nothing else would matter. I blow out the candles in one big gust. Alice leans in close and kisses me on the cheek as she whispers in my ear. 

""Happy birthday, you might want to open this one in private."" She slips me a small, square present under the table and I tuck it away in my pocket. It's all I can think about while we eat the cake. First chance I get, I slip away up the stairs with Alice.

""Alright, open it."" Alice urges on, unable to hide her excitement. I rip off the wrapping and a box of condoms fall out on to the bed. Alice is grinning at me. ""I think we're ready."" I don't know what to say, so I just lean in and kiss her. 

""I love you, you know.""

Later that night, I'm out on the roof with Dan. He sits down, his feet dangling over the edge. He hands me a cigarette and looks up at the sky. 

""You know, there's something I've been meaning to show you, just promise me you won't freak out, okay?"" I try to read his expression, but I don't know what to make of it. 

""Sure, I promise."" He pulls up his left arm sleeve and reveals and series of half-healed cuts across his wrist. 

""When my parents died I just didn't know what to do with myself. I felt like I couldn't feel anything anymore, so I started to cut myself, just to see if I was still alive. The only thing that kept me going was you. You never gave up on me, and I never thanked you for that. You saved my life."" I stare at the scars in shock. 

""I didn't know... you would have done the same thing for me."" He gives me a long look as he takes the cigarette again. 

""I'm not sure I would, that's why I wanted to thank you."" I can't help but laugh at the absurdity of the situation. 

""Don't worry, I KNOW you would do the same for me.""

~

""And now, our valedictorian, Eric Dunn, will give a speech."" Alice gives me a peck on the cheek and I nervously make my way towards the podium to scattered applause. 

""Over these last few years I feel like we have all learned so much. I'm not talking about Physics, Geography or Math, what we've really learned is something about each other, something about life and human interaction. We've been through hardships and good times together. It hasn't always been easy, but we are all here today because we stick together and we help those in need."" My eyes fall on Dan who's sitting next to Alice and my mother in the front row. He gives me a sad smile. 

""Everyone needs help sometimes and you should never be afraid to ask for it. A great man is not one who can overcome the odds alone, but one who is not afraid to ask for help when he needs it, or offer it when those around him need it. Thank you."" I bow and wait for the applause to die down. Most people just look eager to get out of here, but give a few halfhearted claps out of cutesy. The trio in the front row, however, are standing up, cheering and screaming by now. I can't help but laugh as I make my way towards them. Alice hugs me. 

""That was great."" Next comes Dan, he stretches out his hand for a handshake, but I pull him in for a tight hug. 

""We made it."" As I pull away I see a few tears dripping down his face silently. 

""I'll miss you."" I give him a sad smile. 

""I'll still visit you, you know, our colleges won't be that far apart. Besides, you can spend every holiday at my place, I'm sure mom won't mind cooking for one more."" Mom is bawling as she pulls me in for a hug. 

""Look at you, you're all grown up! I'll miss you! You're going to be a great writer someday, I just know it!""

~

I fumble with my keys, barely able to keep my eyes open after the long day of studying the intricacies of writing and the English language. I stumble in and collapse on the bed, face down. I hear running footsteps and groan as I feel somebody jump on top of me and start kissing my neck. 

""Wake up, sleepy head! I've got a surprise for you!"" Alice whispers playfully in my ear. I turn around and kiss her, before turning my attention to the small wrapped present in her hand. 

""Happy 19th, Eric!"" I rip the wrapping off enthusiastically. Inside is a gold engraved pen. Looking closer, I see my mom's, Alice's, Dan's and my own name written in gold across the grip. ""So you won't forget us when you write!"" She gives me a big smile. 

""I love it.""

""Oh and by the way... this came in the mail today."" Alice smiles playfully and hands me an envelope. I rip it open and quickly scan the letter inside.

""Good news?"" Alice asks tentatively.

""I don't know, they just wanted to see me.""

The next day I take the bus into town, and enter a small office building. A stocky man in a suit greets me, shaking my hand.

""Thank you for coming on such short notice. I wanted to talk to you personally about this."" He says, taking a seat.

""Publishing a book isn't cheap, Mr. Dunn. Everyone here at the office loved your novel ""Ten years"", but I'm afraid we can't afford to print the book. You're a previously unpublished author, you're young and nobody has heard of you, it's simply too much of a financial risk for us."" My heart sinks a little, I had been hoping for good news.

""However, if you are willing to make a down payment for the printing of the first edition, we are willing to lend our name to it and help spread the word. If you can manage that, we would love to publish it for you."" I give him a curt nod and a smile.

""Thank you, I've been saving up for almost a year, so that won't be a problem. I'm glad you liked the novel, it's a very... personal topic for me.""

""Really? I never took you for a time traveler."" The editor laughed.

~

As I'm sitting on the bus home I can't help but feel like for the second time in my life, everything is as it should be. For the second time, however, a phone call is about to shatter everything I thought I knew about my life. I look at the display of my phone as it's vibrating in my hand. It's mom. 

""Hi mom. How's everything?"" There's a long pause before she answers. 

""Not so good actually. I'm in a hospital... the doctors say I have lung cancer."" NO, NO, NO, NO. 

""This wasn't supposed to happen. This wasn't supposed to FUCKING happen! You stopped smoking years ago! This wasn't supposed to happen!"" I'm starting to get strange looks from the people around me on the bus. 

""Actually... when you left for college I started smoking again. I guess I just missed you so much I needed something to distract me."" Her voice is small and timid, as if she's waiting for me to start yelling at her. My heart sinks, lower and lower and lower. I hang up the phone without a word. 

""Stop the bus!"" The bus driver glances back at me. 

""This isn't a stop. You'll have to wait for the next stop, buddy."" I rise from my seat, feeling calmer and surer about what I had to do then I ever had before. I walk up to the driver and ram my closed fist through the glass pane meant to shield him from attacks. 

""Stop the FUCKING bus!"" The driver slams the breaks with a look of terror on his face; cars zoom past honking angrily at us. I get out and jump in a taxi. 

""This taxi is occupied! Get out of here, young man!"" A suited man in his fifties shouts. 

""Take me to the hospital, fast!""

~

When I enter the cool, grey hospital room Dan and Alice are already there. Alice tries to get up and comfort me, but I shrug her off. Dan just gives me a nod. 

""Hi, Eric."" Mom smiles at me. ""I'm sorry..."" She coughs a little. 

""It's not your fault, you have nothing to be sorry for."" But it is her fault; I can't stop myself thinking, tears streaming down my face. She wasn't supposed to smoke. I told her not to smoke. 

""The doctors say my chances don't look so good. The tumor is too large to be operate on, all they can do is give me chemotherapy, and even that... it's expensive, Eric. I don't think I can afford it."" My heart sinks all over again. 

""Don't worry, something will come up. I'll use the money for my book, and then we'll figure something out for the rest. We'll figure it out."" She smiles at me. 

""Your book is more important, son. Maybe it's time you let me go."" She says with silent tears running down her cheeks.

""Nothing is more important than family.""

I spend the new few days at the hospital, but eventually I have to get back to school. A few days later, I call my mom as I'm sharing a bowl of cereal with Alice. 

""Hi, honey."" Her voice is raspy and I barely recognize it. 

""Hi, mom. Listen, I just wanted you to know, I have a really good feeling about today. Alice and I will come down to the hospital after school, I just thought you should know. I gotta go now. Love you."" Alice is waving and pointing at herself. ""Oh and Alice says hi. I'll be late for class, gotta go, bye!"" I give Alice a peck on the cheek as I reach past her for my bag. 

""I'll see you later then, love you!""

I'm already a few minutes late when I burst into the classroom.

""Excuse me, professor. I'm expecting an important call, do you mind if I keep my cell on in class?"" He raises an eyebrow at me. 

""Very well, if it's important."" I take my seat and drift off in though, glancing at my phone every other minute. Finally, half way through the lecture, it rings. 

""Excuse me."" I rush out in to the corridor outside and answer it. 

""Hello?"" An official sounding man greets me. ""Hello. Is this Eric Dunn?"" I'm barely able to contain my excitement. 

""Yes sir."" He continues in a matter-of-factly manner. 

""I regret to inform you that your grandmother Elinor Dunn has passed away. She had a massive cardiac arrest last night and died immediately. I'm calling you about her last will. You and your mother have both inherited a considerable amount of money."" I end the call let out a whoop, jumping in joy. 

""WOOOOOHOOOO!"" I guess I should feel bad about grandma dying, but to me, she's been dead for ten years, mom on the other hand can still be saved. She can still be saved.

~

""Forasmuch as it hath pleased Almighty God of his great mercy to take unto himself the soul of our dear sister here departed, we therefore commit her body to the ground; earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust; in sure and certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life through our Lord Jesus Christ."" Alice wails and I hold her tight. 

""She didn't deserve this, she was always so good."" She sobs in to my chest. I try to press out some tears of my own, but it seems they are all dried up. I pat her gently on the back. 

""No, she didn't deserve this."" I agree, watching as they lower my mothers coffin in the same grave where they buried grandma two weeks earlier. Despite spending much of our inheritance on treatment, she did not last long. It was hard to imagine what life would be like without her. Even though I'd lived for years without her before, somehow I did not think I would ever lose her again. I wonder if I can ever be happy again. Last time she died it was as if I turned numb, unable to do anything but go through the motions anymore.

But this time was different. This time I had Alice. Four months later, we stood at the altar.

""Do you Alice Carter, take Eric Dunn to be your lawfully wedded husband, promising to love and cherish, through joy and sorrow, sickness and health, and whatever challenges you may face, for as long as you both shall live?"" She gives me a wide smile that makes me feel as if my heart is melting, even after seeing it for the thousandth time. 

""I do."" The priest nods. 

""Do you Eric Dunn, take Alice Carter to be your lawfully wedded wife, promising to love and cherish, through joy and sorrow, sickness and health, and whatever challenges you may face, for as long as you both shall live?"" I exhale trying to calm my nerves. 

""I do."" Alice's smile grows even wider. 

""You may now kiss the bride."" I've kissed her a million times before, yet every time I feel like I could just die right here and now, happy.

~

I sit pouring over a half written novel titled '*The moment of decision*' while sipping on a cup of coffee and idly spinning my gold engraved pen between my fingers. 

""Happy birthday, you stud."" Alice leans in for a kiss. ""You're not thinking of writing on your birthday, are you? I'm taking you out; you don't turn 23 every day you know!"" 

23. I was 23 once before, but by now it feels like a half forgotten dream, like a memory told by someone else. I snap out of my thought and leave the pen on the table. 

""Alright, where are we going?"" Alice gives me a mischievous grin. ""It's a surprise."" I get up and pull her in to a tight hug. ""I love you, you know that right?"" She laughs a little. ""Well, I would hope so, we're married aren't we?"" My phone starts to vibrate in my pocket. 

""Hold on, it's Dan, he probably wants to congratulate me."" The moment I answer I know something is wrong. ""Hey, man... I just wanted to let you know that it's not your fault. You were the best friend anyone could ever have and I love you. I wish you and Alice all the best."" He hangs up before I get a chance to respond, I try calling him back, but he doesn't pick up. Alice looks at me with concern. 

""What's wrong? Is everything alright?"" The lump in my throat is making it hard to speak. ""No. We need to go see Dan. Right now.""

The car skids to a halt in front of the old looking apartment building an hour later. I make my way up to Dan’s apartment as fast as I can and knock hard on the door, Alice close behind me. No response. I take a few steps back and tackle the door with all my might. Tears start streaming down my face from the pain in my shoulder and the pain from the persisting lump in my throat. Again I slam into the door. And again, and again. Finally the door gives way and we stumble inside. 

Silhouetted against the light of the window is the shape of a man, a rope stretching from his neck to the ceiling. I rush up to him and lift him up by the legs. 

""Hold on, Dan! Breath! Breath!"" Alice manages to cut him down and we place him on the ground. His face is a shade of deep purple that almost makes me vomit. 

""Wake up! You've got to wake up!"" I hammer on his chest trying to resuscitate him, tears streaming down my face.

A couple of hours later I'm standing at the hospital, panting as if I had just ran a marathon. ""It was too late."" I tune out the rest of the nurse's tries to comfort me. It wasn't too late. *I* was too late. I hug Alice and just hold her for minutes on end. There's nothing left to say. 

""Let's go home."" She eventually lets out and I nod silently. The moment we step outside the hospital door I feel a sharp blow to the back of my head, the world grows dim and the last thing I hear is Alice screaming my name.

~

I come to and open my eyes. Above me is a grey, plain ceiling, barely high enough to stand under. I stand up, prodding at the wound on the back of my head. Plain grey walls surround me and icy coldness spread throughout my body as I recognize the room. I spin around. There it is. In the middle of the small room is a table with a round, red button. 

I let out a sound half way between a sob and a laugh. Fate really is cruel, isn't it? A voice that I recognize, despite only having heard it once before, ten years ago seems to come from the very walls of the room. 

""You have been offered a chance that many would kill for. The chance to relive ten years of your life with knowledge of what is to come. Now, you will be offered another, equally unique chance. If you press the button in the middle of the room your life will be what it was the last time you were Twenty three years old. If you don't press it, nothing will happen; you will be free to go."" The voice pauses for a minute. 

""You have ten minutes."" A large red 10:00 appears on the wall and begins counting down. I can't help but laugh. Whatever I choose is the wrong choice. No matter what, I will live in mourning for the rest of my life. Either mourning my dead friend, or mourning my life that could have been, and the love lost. Faced with an impossible choice my mind is racing trying to find a way. Trying to find an answer. I bunch my hand into a fist and drive it into the hard wall with all my might. 

""Why are you doing this?! Why me?! It's not fair! It's not FUCKING FAIR!"" I scream as I furious beat the wall over and over, as if trying to beat an answer out of it. 

""Fifteen seconds remaining."" The voice snaps me out of it and I lunge for the button, but I stop myself just in time, hand hovering inches above the button. Why isn't there ever a right choice?

After the events of today I have started to seriously consider studying writing at a university in the fall (Instead of game design as I had originally planned.) I have gladly brought you this story for free, but if you wish to make my life a little easier and help my future writing career I would very much appreciate donations, since I am a poor student with no job. Please don't feel obligated to donate if you don't want to or can't afford to, as I said I wrote this for my own and others enjoyment. I'm not sure if I'm allowed to post a paypal adress or similar on here, so I'll refrain from doing so for now. If anyone could tell me if I'm allowed to do that, or if it counts as advertising or something, please let me know. I don't want to get this post removed for breaking any rules. Thank you all again, you beautiful people, have a good day and enjoy the story!]

[Regarding donations: I've spoken to a moderator and as I suspected I'm not allowed to post a paypal adress on here, however if anyone still wants to donate, you can pm me and I will send you the adress via pm, thank you all for your support and interest!]

True,pie5135,,,"Our portions in terms of weight would be about 1:1:2, vegetables:tofu:rice.  All vegetables are extremely fresh, picked in the morning by us.  We usually have egg, tofu (sometimes made by us, sometimes by the cooks), and some kind of broth (usually corn-based).

The cooks value simplicity above all else.  Taste comes from the plants themselves rather than additives (absolutely no bottled oil added to the dishes above).  Because I'm taking the vegetarian route, my source of protein would be an additional egg white and extra tofu.  Carbs are almost always rice, but sometimes noodles and bread are available as replacement (the bread is crazy good, and again, made from scratch).

They also advocate drinking water.  They basically make you drink a glass (it's small, about 1/3 of a cup) before you eat, and everyone takes turns walking through their row with a pitcher to pour.  On average we'll go through maybe 3-4 of these glasses by the end of the meal, some drink way more.  It's interesting that they have larger glasses, but prefer frequently drinking smaller portions of water, rather than gulping at once.

True,[deleted],,,"Downvotes ahoy for me, but anyway...

I'm kinky. I have kinky friends. I go to kinky events. I meet all sorts. I mean aaall sorts. Stuff that just makes you go ""Wut?"". But I like sex with a hefty helping of theatricality and whimsy, myself, so I know things I get up to make my fellow perverts go ""wut?"", too. 

There's a phrase in the bdsm community. It's "" Your Kink Is Not My Kink And That's OK"", or YKINMKATO. It's a necessary operating principle for hanging around in a group where the only real commonality is that they like getting up to things most people don't, and damn, human sexuality is varied and weird.

I'm not into the adult baby thing, or Littles (people who age play) of any kind, and when I first got on the scene it was the thing that squicked me out the most. Now, I have friends into age play and I understand the mindset considerably better. It's absolutely NOT about paedophillia or incest. Not even a little bit. It IS about getting into a certain mindset; on the part of the little, it's about relinquishing adult responsibilities and on the part of the ""Daddy"" or ""Mommy"", it's about being nurturing and protective and possibly authoritative - a paternalistic/maternalistic position. NOT LITERALLY a father or mother.

If you've ever been sick with the flu, where you're just in bed watching cartoons or something, and you're at the point where you're almost starting to enjoy the excuse to loll about and be helpless, and your girlfriend or boyfriend has looked after you and soothed you and brought you a juice box or a silly gift to cheer you up or something... well, you're about halfway to understanding the mindset of age players. It's just they don't need the excuse of being ill to get into that headspace and they can really enjoy it. Plus there's sex because they're grown, consenting adults, with adult desires and sex is awesome.

TL;DR: It's about playing a role and enjoying certain aspects of childhood. Not paedophillia. Not incest.

True,Kakkz00ka,,,"My story goes back to the days of yore; to the golden age of arcade games. One of my first obsessions as a lad, and one of the first games to forever seal my lifelong addiction/passion for animate pixels: 

PAC-MAN. 

I played this game religiously as a child. I would beg my father to bring me to the arcade every weekend to play. I was fortunate enough to own the Atari 2600 at the time, and I couldn't wait for the day PAC-MAN would be released - to play at **home!**

Now, a twelve year-old's vision about how the proper cabinet arcade version of a game should translate to an eight-bit home console can be a bit grandiose. At least this former twelve year-old's vision was that of a carbon copy translation. I couldn't see how the wholly graphically superior Atari 2600 (remember, home gaming had just taken its first evolutionary step from the monochromatic and static PONG to games like ""Adventure!"" and ""Night Driver"") wouldn't be able to reproduce the glorious excitement and colors of PAC-MAN. 

I remember anxiously awaiting the release of the game. I remember reading magazine articles about the development of the game. Even back in the early 1980s, in the infancy of video gaming, the hype surrounding the console release was huge as this was **the most** played arcade game ever at that time. 

I remember my father bringing me to Toys R Us to pick up the game. When we arrived home, I ripped open the packaging and slammed the cart home into the 2600. My mind's eye was prepared for:

[this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_OjztdQ8iw), 

but instead, I was presented with: 

[this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HL2p2ANFlQ4).

To say the least, I was disheartened. And thus began my blossoming cynicism with marketing and hype, which I hypocritically fed by becoming a marketing major in college. 

Thinking back now, I shouldn't have been so surprised. I also loved the game ""Asteroids,"" which predated ""PAC-MAN"" by a year. The console release of that game also looked nothing like the original. But, for some odd reason, I didn't initially sense that the original version should look the same on the 2600. Perhaps I subconsciously understood that vector graphics couldn't be reproduced on our televisions at the time. 

Anyway, it was fun sharing. Now get off my lawn.

True,TwoHands,tftsflair,knows what stupid lurks in the hearts of men.,"The Man in the Gap.

--------

Some time ago, before Google Glass, before Vista, before people were ""downgrading"" to XP, there was a man.  A rather unremarkable man.  His levels of nondescription were so high that they made him a singular point that others couldn't help but miss.

He was hired, among others, to work a large project, among others, and was meant to be fired, among others as well.  But there is a gap between the hiring and firing, or rather the firing and his hiring wherein the layoff paperwork had been put in and the man's hiring hadn't yet been completed.  This wasn't a very large gap, but as a singular point of nondescription... he fell in.  

He was in the pay system, so they let him in.  He had a workspace, so they let him use it.  Then they just failed to notice him.  It was surreal.  He would ask about work and immediately after asking, he'd be forgotten about.  He had no boss, he had no task, he had no purpose, he just occupied some space that nobody was using.

At first, he reveled in his non-job employment.  He could do as he pleased.  Show up, do nothing, go home, get paid.  Show up, do nothing, go home, get paid.... do nothing, get paid, do nothing, do nothing...

Men are defined by the work they do.  This man had no work. This man was undefined.  He had fallen into the gap and never gotten out.  He had grown comfortable in that little gap.  So much so that the prospect of leaving it terrified him.

He had grown so accustomed to being beyond notice that when a person actually spoke to him, he nearly drowned in terror and with a gap as small as his, terror can fill it in an instant.  He choked on fear and could barely bring himself to ask what the people wanted.

""IT support,"" that's just what they might say if they were trying to pull him out of his gap.  They can't be telling the truth... but they are looking at his computer, so they just might be.

They're still here...  Maybe if I don't talk to them, they'll go away.

He keeps seeing them around; each sighting brings a new wave of terror that feels like it takes minutes off his life.

He goes to relax with a cigarette AND THERE THEY ARE.  In his panic he almost runs back inside with his cigarette lit, but has the sense to try to act like nothing happened.

He tries to crawl into a bottle to hide for a while, but they even find him there.  The jig is up, the news is out, they finally found him. The renegade who had it made, retrieved for a bounty. The lyrics pounded through his head as they blared on the radio.  In his alcoholic haze, he figured they had given up on harassing him and were there to collect him to end his career - So he told his story; one last burden to unload.  A story of quiet desperation in a small hole where bureaucracy and apathy collide and leave a small hole the size of a man.

And then he was forgotten.

The ""IT support"" people had just left him in his hole.  No one was sent to retrieve him or escort him from the building.  The first few weeks he went to work with slightly more terror than usual about being found out, but no one did.  

Somewhere, there is still a man in a gap.",0,1363540548,,0,1363560899,1,c8xb3v1,t3_1agon8,t1_c8xb3v1,t3_1agon8,,1431614400,766,False,talesfromtechsupport,t5_2sfg5,766

Lets look at BadGuy again, and extend him a bit.

    class BadGuy {
         private:
             int health;
             Gun gun;
         public:
             void kill();
             bool isdead();
             int currentHP();
             void damage(int hp);
             void heal(int hp);
             void shoot();
    };

But maybe we have a good guy, and he uses a sword:

    class GoodGuy {
         private:
             int health;
             Sword sword;
         public:
             void kill();
             bool isdead();
             int currentHP();
             void damage(int hp);
             void heal(int hp);
             void cut();
     };


There is quite a bit there that we are reusing, isn't there? What if we want to change how we implement our health or death system? We would have to change BOTH the GoodGuy and BadGuy classes, and test the changes to both, etc. Think about GoodGuy and BadGuy again. They both are Guys, right?

So lets implement a Guy class:

    class Guy {
         private:
             int health;
         public:
             void kill();
             bool isdead();
             int currentHP();
             void damage(int hp);
             void heal(int hp);
    };

And then implement GoodGuy and BadGuy using the code from Guy:

    class GoodGuy : public Guy {
             private:
             Sword sword;
             public:
             void cut();
    };
    class BadGuy : public Guy{
             private:
             Gun gun;
             public:
             void shoot();
    };

GoodGuy and BadGuy will now have all the features of a Guy, and we only have to change the Guy code in one place.


Think again about how easily this relationship can be spoken aloud and thought of:

A BadGuy **is a** Guy.
A GoodGuy **is a** Guy.

A BadGuy **has a** Gun, but a GoodGuy **has a** Sword.

But if we think for a bit:

A Gun **is a** Weapon, and a Sword **is a** Weapon. A Weapon **is an** Item.

This means we could probably implement Guns and Swords as subtypes of a Weapon class, which could be a subtype of an Item class. Then, if we change the code for how items drop in the future, we only have to change the Item class, and every type of item is automatically updated!",0,1363548577,,0,False,1,c8xdid1,t3_1agtae,t1_c8xdid1,t1_c8xcnsp,,1431615596,12,False,explainlikeimfive,t5_2sokd,12

Well, the good news is it's a small country. So everything is fairly accessible. Some of my favorite Israeli foods are:

Falafel (obviously). You can buy this pretty much anywhere, and I'd buy it on the street before I got it in a restaurant. Jerusalem has the good stuff, but it's more or less the same everywhere. My favorite falafel place is called Moshiko, and it's located on Ben Yehuda street (Jerusalem's largest tourist trap, seriously don't buy anything but falafel there)

Halva: a dense sweet confection. buy it anywhere

challah bread: if you havent had it, i'd try it for sure. a simple braided loaf enjoyed on friday nights 

Schawarma. It's like falafel but with meat instead. Lamb, chicken, and beef are popular options. My favorite Schawarma that isn't from a random street vendor is at a chain called Shipudei Tziporah (hard to transliterate, but I'm assuming you speak no Hebrew). It's essentially chipotle but for schawarma. Get a lafa instead of a pita.

Sabich. This is a slightly more obscure dish. Eggplant+Hardboiled egg+salad in a pita. Delicious. I know a good place in Rishon LeTziyon, but couldn't tell you how to get there. Again, street vendors are your friend.

Goulash: it's like a beef stew type deal. This is a polish dish. 

Magnum ice cream. just buy it on the beach. seriously amazing.

If you ever make it to the north, I'd HIGHLY recommend stopping by a Druzi restaurant. Their food is delicious. If you can find some, I'd also buy apples grown in the region. The high altitude makes for huge, crispy apples. 

I also like Pargiyot (baby chicken kebab) and just kebab in general. 

If you really like spicy food, you're going to be more than fine. Tunisian and Moroccan food is insanely hot. Ask for marmuma if they have it. Almost everything comes in a ""spicy"" option.

Israel also has a lot of trendy hamburger type places. BBB and Burgers Bar are good, and catered to americans and foreigners. 

Schnitzel is also amazing and came over with all of the european immigrants. 

Israeli salad might be new to you as well. It's cucumbers, tomatoes, onions and lemon juice all mixed together. It's plentiful and you'll be eating a lot of it.

Dairy and chocolate are famous in Israel. There's a bazillion types of cheese. One day for breakfast make some toast and sit down with 5 or 6 cheeses and just try them all. SKI cheese is particularly delicious, as is Labna (yogurt based dairy product)


Culture wise: Israeli's are impatient, stubborn people. They will cut in front of you in line and violate your personal space. Just kind of fight back. Don't know how to explain it. Bargaining is a thing and will happen. If you want a primer on that I can write something quick up. Security is everywhere, not because it's dangerous necessarily, but because it's the norm. Don't pick up shit you see on the side of the road. Or something you find on the ground. Once you get to know your hosts or some friends, you'll find Israeli's and middle eastern people in general are just loud, argumentative, and like to have a good time. 

Enjoy your trip!!

Edit: because a good amount of the country is observant and many restaurants serve kosher food there won't be TONS of places serving insane stuff you've never had before. Also added more food.

True,TheDuskDragon,,,"* **Acknowledge the officer by turning on flashers.** To let the officer know that you’ve seen his lights and that you plan on pulling over, turn on your emergency flashers. Phil recommends you do this if you think you’ll need to drive a distance before you can find a safe place to pull over.

* **Pull over to a safe area.** Typically, you want to pull over to the right side of the road. When looking for a spot to pull over to, think “safety first” for both you and the officer. Phil recommends looking for an area with a wide shoulder so passing traffic isn’t a hazard. If it’s nighttime, look for place that’s well lit if possible. That will help put the officer at ease. Parking lots and well-lit side streets are other safe places to pull over to. “If you need to travel a short distance to pull over, do so at a slower pace than you normally drive,” Phil recommends. You don’t want the officer to think you’re trying to make a getaway. Also, if you need to cross multiple lanes to pull over to the right-hand side of the road, do so safely.

* **Stay in the car.** If you get out of the car as soon as you stop, it may give the impression to the officer that you’re going to be aggressive or you have something to hide in the car. Just keep your bum in your seat.

* **Turn off engine, roll down window, and turn on your dome lights.** As soon as you come to a stop, turn off your engine and roll down your window. If it’s dark out, turn on your dome light so the officer can see what’s going on inside the vehicle as he approaches.

* **Stay calm.** It’s common to get amped up whenever you get pulled over. Take some deep breaths and relax. Unless you’ve done something outright criminal (i.e. driving intoxicated, possessing illegal drugs, etc.) there’s nothing to be nervous about. The worst that can happen during a routine traffic stop is that you’ll have to pay a fine. Oh, and your insurance will probably go up. Pretty sucky, but not the end of the world.  If it helps, it’s good to remind yourself that the officer is probably nervous too.

* **Stay still and keep your hands on the steering wheel.** Keep your hands resting on the wheel and remain still as the officer approaches your vehicle. You don’t want to give him or her any reason to believe you’re a threat.

* **If you plan on fighting your ticket, keep answers short and don’t directly admit wrongdoing.** Everything you say to an officer is admissible in court, so if you plan on fighting your ticket, Andy suggests not saying anything that indicates you are guilty. Officers will typically ask questions to get some sort of admission out of you when they first walk up to your window. For example, “Do you know why I pulled you over?” Don’t say, “I was speeding, sir.” Simply say, “No” or, “I don’t know.”

* **But sometimes, saying “I’m sorry” works.** However, Andy states that sometimes it doesn’t pay to be coy like this with the officer, and that it’s better to just fess up and apologize. “If you accidentally roll through a stop sign and immediately apologize, they may let you off with a warning.” If you don’t plan on fighting your ticket, just say, “I’m sorry, officer. I was imagining Teddy Roosevelt with Sasquatch in a headlock. I’ll pay more attention next time.” I’ve gotten off with just a warning a few times by saying those words, showing the officer some courtesies, and being polite.

* **Wait for the officer to ask for your documents.** Don’t try to expedite the process by getting your license and registration ready while the officer approaches your car. For all he knows you could be reaching for a gun or trying to hide some sort of incriminating evidence. Wait until he or she gets to the window and asks for your documents.

* **Move deliberately.** When you do reach to get your license and registration, do so deliberately. “A quick reach into the glove compartment for your insurance paperwork looks the same as a quick reach into your glove compartment for a weapon,” says Phil. If your wallet is in a gym bag in your backseat, let the officer know before you turn around and rummage for it. Quick Tip: Try to keep your glove compartment relatively organized, and your documents together, so that when you pull the box open, you don’t have to frantically sort through 20-year-old maps and wads of receipts to find your registration.

* **If you’re carrying a gun, let the officer know.** Some states have laws that require concealed carry owners to inform officers that they’re carrying a gun anytime they get pulled over. These are called “must inform” states. Officers are allowed to ask for and hold the weapon for the duration of the stop. Even if you don’t live in a “must inform” state, as a courtesy to the officer, you might want to disclose the fact that you’re carrying. Nothing puts an officer on red alert like seeing a “print” of a gun through a motorist’s clothes.

* **Return hands to the steering wheel.** After you’ve handed the officer your paperwork, return your hands to the steering wheel. “It keeps them visible to the officer,” says Phil.

* **Be civil.** Be polite and respectful in your communications with the officer. Yes, it sucks to get a ticket, but calling the officer names, threatening him, and being rude won’t get you anywhere. In fact, it could make things worse. If the officer happens to be a woman, refer to her as “officer” or “ma’am,” not “sweetheart” or “honey.” She’s an officer of the law, show some respect.

* **You don’t have to consent to a search.** In order to search your vehicle without your consent, an officer needs probable cause – maybe he smells something in the car or sees a bottle on your seat. If he doesn’t have probable cause but wants to search your car anyway, he’ll need your consent and may ask you something like, “You don’t mind me taking a look in your car, do you?” Even if you haven’t done anything illegal, it’s usually a good idea to exercise your Fourth Amendment right in this situation and decline the search. “While you may believe you have nothing to hide, you never know what could come up.  Maybe a friend left an empty beer can in your back seat during a tailgate party, and the officer will charge you with an open container violation,” Andy explains. Politely decline the search by saying, “I don’t consent to a search, officer,” loud enough so it gets on the police recorder. That’s it.

* **Don’t argue.** “The side of the road is not the place to argue a charge,” says Phil. If you want to contest the ticket, you can do so in court and in front of a judge.

* **Sign the citation.** If the officer decides to issue a citation, he’ll ask you to sign it. Sign it. It’s not an admission of guilt, it’s just recognition that you’ve received the citation and that you promise to either 1) pay the fine or 2) show up to court on the designated date. “A signature on a citation in most jurisdictions is in lieu of you posting a cash bond. Posting a cash bond generally consists of a trip to the nearest jail or judge and may include a booking process and fingerprinting. It is always easier to sign the ticket,” says Phil.

* **Be safe when merging back into traffic.** Phil recommends taking your time to store your belongings before you re-enter traffic. “If you’re upset, collect yourself before driving away.” When you’re ready, turn on your signal and merge back into traffic. This time, avoid any mental fight simulations involving Teddy Roosevelt and Sasquatch until you get home and are safely ensconced in your man chair. Stay safe out there.

It will make things even more awkward because then when you do see each other, she won't be able to pretend like everything is normal and fine. It will be weird and uncomfortable. It will not bring you closer together - she has a boyfriend, the only acceptable response for her is to tell you that she doesn't feel the same and she's sorry if she led you on.

Why I do I think this was unwarranted?  It's unwarranted because her music video looked like it was made for about 2000$ by a youtube publishing cut-rate music factory as the 16th birthday gift for a peppy Southern California teenager.  

And that's exactly what it was.  

She wasn't pretending to be The Next coming of Joni Mitchell, she didn't sell herself as profound, the video was posted for free on youtube for pete's sake, YOUTUBE!

True,SEEMYHINEYNICENSHINY,,,"My family has the best love story I've ever heard. I apologize for this being long, I'm summarizing an entire life in this post... :)

My grandmother's older sister, which... I don't know what that makes her to me? For some reason I call her ""aunt"" Noriko, despite that being probably an incorrect familial label. Anyway... My family is from Japan. They were Samurai class when my grandmother, her sister and their other siblings were children. They grew up in an agricultural area, but they really weren't supposed to get too friendly with people who were lower class. My grandma Tomiko and her sister Noriko were very spirited children. I've heard so many stories, I wish I could tell them all, because they're all fantastic. They had many brothers, maybe their boyish ways rubbed off on Tomiko and Noriko because they acted like little boys, playing in the dirt and running off when they shouldn't, getting in trouble a lot. 

Noriko, in her adventures, made friends with a field boy named Kokichi. Kokichi's family worked on their land. They were best friends and played whenever they had the opportunity. They grew up together, and when they were old enough to have the right feelings for it, they fell in love. 

When Noriko's parents discovered that she had feelings for a low class boy, they seperated them. I believe Kokichi's entire family was moved away from their land. Noriko told her parents that he was the only one she could love. They told her she'd be happier marrying in Samurai class, and that she had no choice. She told me she cried for years. She never loved anyone else. 

Some time later, the war started. My family was moved, their land was lost. Life was now just about surviving. By the time it was over, some of them had survived, but not all. One thing that did not survive the war was the class system. The girls were older now. My grandmother Tomiko met an American soldier who was stationed in Japan, and they married. (That's where my mother and I come from.) Noriko moved back to northern Japan, she wanted to be where she had grown up. After spending quite some time there, she went to the market to buy some produce. She looks up and sees a man watching her. She told me at first it was creepy, she tried to avoid him. Eventually she looked up to figure out what kind of weirdo was hiding around corners looking at her, and then their eyes met. She told me she just began to cry, she suddenly realized the man before her was her childhood love Kokichi. He had waited for her for almost 20 years.

They never seperated again. They went literally everywhere together. They were married as soon as they could manage, and lived together in a cute little home across from a rice field in Akita. I spent time with them after high school and they were the happiest couple I've ever met. They loved each other so much, and they stayed together until they were very old. 

There is an end to their story. Kokichi passed away a few years ago from liver cancer. Noriko stayed in their home until the tsunami. They never had children together, but Kokichi's brother had a son, and Noriko lives with him and his family now. They love her like she's their own grandmother. Noriko said once that she felt like every moment she had with him was a gift, because the world had seperated them so far there was no way they should have met again. Noriko said that however horrible the war was, it broke the class system, and it let her be together with the only man she would ever love. She said if it takes a war to make people equal, then sometimes it's okay.

True,BishopOfThe90s,,,"EDIT: **TL;DR in bold** And thanks for the Reddit Gold, whoever you are!

I think a lot about kids and my own process of realization about the world. **I'm a big proponent of not sugar-coating the world for kids.** Letting them know that monsters exist, and that they can be defeated, and that sometimes they can only be dealt with and that they won't ever go away.

However, I think there is good reason for shielding kids from this kind of thing, or the kind of things regularly posted to /r/MorbidReality and /r/WTF .

There's simply no good reason to expose kids to such atrocious material so early. It is something that can scar people, and that does not happen regularly, and so there is no reason to allow children to see these things.

This is not to say that I think children should be shielded from the concept of death. **I think it's vitally important that children ARE exposed to death, and that they learn effective ways of coming to terms with it. However, it doesn't have to be and SHOULDN'T be from such horrible ways as witnessing suicide, or ogling a car crash or a watching a building burn down.**  

However, we also want to make sure that kids do not associate witnessing atrocity with seeming more adult (so in that line of thought, it might almost be beneficial to not make a big deal about not looking at an accident). I remember when we were 12, my friends first came across the site, rotten.com. They would spend a fair amount of time becoming desensitized to the real-life blood and gore, and feel better about themselves when I would go over and I would wince at the pictures they had already seen. 

**I think on some level we tell kids not to look because we don't trust that they would respect the gravity of the situation if they did**. They might go around bragging ""Oh yeah! I saw the mangled body under the train"" thinking that it makes them sound SO much more mature, when in reality it makes them sound callous and stupid. 

This is the same vibe a get when people tell me they don't even flinch anymore at pictures on the internet in a bragging sense. I can't help but think less of them, because they truly don't think about the images they see anymore. That's what makes it easy for them. It doesn't make me impressed, it makes me sad that they are too narrow-minded to understand the greater impact of those pictures they're looking at. The remains of the utterly damaged lives in the scenes of mangled bodies. The families which will never have that person in their lives again--won't even be able to see their face again, because it is too destroyed to have an open casket. The Post Traumatic Stress Disorder of the investigators taking the photos. The utter desperation which can crop up in life, causing a man to jump onto those tracks. The parents who won't see their children again, which makes them want to find company on the tracks with the impossibly sad stranger.

My 12 year old friends couldn't grasp any of that. Of course, neither could I, but I understood why it felt weird looking at those pictures. So I stayed away from gore and such, until I understood the true impact behind the images. I come to these places on the internet now to show me how easy I have it right now in comparison to these strangers, and to give my empathy a good jump start.

In short: perhaps we try to keep children from witnessing such terrible things because we want to wait until they are mature enough to understand empathy. To understand what the images they see, whether in real life or on rotten.com or /r/MorbidReality, or right here in /r/WTF actually mean. That sometimes there are blackholes of meaning in people lives. Bad things happen to both good and bad people, and some can't take it anymore. **These situations are to be respected as the logical conclusion of this Godless universe in which we live, and not to be gawked at as challenges to test our fortitude.**",0,1363574026,,0,1363578664,1,c8xl84u,t3_1ahg7s,t1_c8xl84u,t1_c8xic1z,,1431619312,270,False,WTF,t5_2qh61,270

True,micktravis,,,"Here's my somewhat unusual 9/11 story.  Cut and pasted from another post of mine.

I worked as a freelance television editor in London from 2000 to 2002. My specialty was commercial finishing - basically using a (then) very expensive digital editing suite to conform commercials, drop in the graphics, fix any visual flaws, and basically get a spot ready to air. It was kind of boring work but lucrative because back then the only way to do such work quickly was to use one of a few very expensive proprietary machines, and I was lucky enough to have gotten pretty good using one of them known as a Henry. They were ridiculously expensive at the time (over a million bucks each) so only post production houses owned any, for the most part. And doing freelance work I bounced around from shop to shop, usually working in 3 to 6 hour shifts. Until I got a call from my agent telling me to report to MBC, The Middle Eastern Broadcasting Corporation.

This was kind of a sister channel to Al Jazeera, or at least they shared the same giant building in south London. While AJ served up news MBC would air lifestyle shows, movies, and TV shows, all in Arabic and carried via satellite all over the middle East. I turned up, surprised they would own a Henry, but there it was, sitting in a rather ordinary looking room, nothing like the swank suites in Soho with video games and booze fridges for the clients. This was a dusty, smoked in dump with a Henry kind of plonked in the corner.

I had a sit down with the PM and he told me that the owner of the station (an important gent, possibly a King somewhere - I'm sure it's on Wiki or something if anyone's interested) had recently spent some time in the US and fallen in love with The Sopranos. He'd bought the rights to air season 1 on MBC but the show needed some ""fine tuning."" An assistant poked his head in and nodded and suddenly I was on speakerphone with the station owner.

He very competently told me in technical terms what he needed me to do. If I thought I could handle the job he would book me 8 hours a day for as long as it took for me to complete the job - my rate was somewhere around 60 pounds an hour so this was a lot of money for me. He explained that although he felt that only the brief nudity in the season was problematic from a broadcasting standpoint he had another obligation which involved bringing certain materials into Mecca itself. Since the footprint of the satellite carrying MBC covered all of the middle East including Mecca, he felt an obligation to ensure that nothing on his channel contained images of anything which would be forbidden, for real, in Mecca. And he brought up one of the main locations in the show: Satriale's butcher shop (I think I've got the name right.) There's a giant pig on the sign and pork hanging everywhere inside the shop and he felt this stuff needed to disappear in order for the show to be broadcast (if not received) into Mecca. Could I get rid of any nudity and deal with all the pig? Sure, I said.

It ended up taking over 2 weeks of solid work. About 16 days, I think, although there was an interruption towards the end. If you've seen the Sopranos you'll know how many times they sit out in front of that shop and chatter, how many scenes take place inside, and how often these scenes include moving camera shots (which complicate things tremendously.) Not to mention all the shots at the Bada Bing with a bunch of naked girls in the deep background. Far more nudity than I remembered. But I started from Episode 101 and began work, painting stuff out with static mattes when possible, darkening areas of the club, and motion tracking blurs and shadows in when the camera moved. The Henry was perfect for the job, and fast, but the work dragged on. I got to know a lot of the staff while I was there, people from all over the Middle East: Iran, Iraq, and a bunch of smaller states I hadn't even heard of. They all spoke flawless English but worked in Arabic.

As I said, it was long work. I would take breaks and go downstairs to the little smoking room and drink tea with whoever was in there at the time. They were constantly having political or religious arguments - animated ones, but not agressive in any way. And they always switched to English the moment I arrived. I rarely took part but I listened a lot, and plenty of what they had to say was very funny and very dark.

Mid day one Tuesday I was in the middle of something tricky and my wife called my mobile. She was working at a law firm in the city and, both being busy, we often ended up in each others' voicemail knowing we'd get a reply as soon as possible. I hit the ignore button and got back to work but she immediately phoned again. I picked up wondering what was so important and she told me that a plane had just hit one of the towers in New York. Or a bomb, but people were pretty sure it was a plane. At the same time I could hear a commotion outside my suite. My wife and I talked for a second about how awful this was and I said I'd call her in a bit. And I went out to the main area that connected MBC and AJ.
I wouldn't say it was mayhem, but if you've ever seen a news organization go into emergency mode you'll understand what I saw. Mobiles were vibrating off every table, people held landlines to both ears, and over at the end past the big glass doors each of the twenty or thirty monitors in master control switched from a football match or formula one to shots of the first tower, smoking.

So I watched the rest of it all play out, the only white person in a room of dark, concerned faces, listening to the international CNN audio mixed with the BBC and 7 or 8 raw satellite feeds up on the wall, each from a different angle, all pointing at the same thing.

The speculation about Islamic terrorism was being talked up almost from the very beginning. FOX first, but most of the others pretty soon thereafter. When the second plane hit the room went silent and the anchor stopped, at a loss for words live on the air. One of the guys I knew quite well came to stand next to me and offered me a cigarette - this is the only time I've ever smoked in a master control room but everybody was, suddenly, the room filling with smoke and staff, all mainly silent now.

I went outside to talk to my wife again. We agreed that we were both going to leave work and meet up at home quickly. As I walked back into MC the first tower went down. A woman screamed and several men started yelling things in Arabic, similar sounding things, but I have no idea what they were. Although I know some time passed before the second tower fell I recall it taking only a minute or so. Almost everyone, men and women, myself included, were crying and mainly silent. My friend, who had been kind of translating what the anchor was saying, told me that there was speculation everywhere including the middle East that this could be some kind of terrorist plot by any number of people. Bin Laden was named, but so were a lot of others. And McVeigh was brought up once in a while, almost hopefully. I now understand why there were people who hoped that whoever was responsible was American, but I was too stunned to understand why immediately, during such quiet chaos.
My friend, tears in his eyes, explained it to me. ""If the people who did this are Muslims, or even if they look like me, then as far as America is concerned I might as well have done this.""

I nodded my head to indicate I understood but I don't really think I did until some time had passed. And I tell this story to anyone I meet who sees every brown person as a threat. I stood in Al Jazeera, the epicenter of evil propaganda according to Cheney, the only white face in a crowded smokey room. I stood there and we all watched as the towers fell and as they did we all cried quietly, together.

I cannot be passive. I cannot show too much interest, because I may come off as creepy.

Give me a break.  Stop whining about bullshit that isn't even a real issue and grow the hell up.  You don't want women to automatically fear men?  Learn about the terrifyingly real rape statistics.  Get used to the fact that 1 in FIVE women have been raped already.  Tell your male friends/family that making rape jokes is completely unacceptable and stand up for women who are fighting against the tidal wave of rape apologia all over the world.  You don't want men to be viewed as sexist or shallow?  Stop yourself or your male friends/family next time you/they go to comment on a woman's appearance or link her ability to do something to her gender.

How many times have you ever held another dude responsible for the shit he's said or done to women?  How often do you blame *women* for what's wrong with *you*? (re-read your post for the answer to that)  Ever told a sexist joke?  Ever laughed at one?  Ever called a woman ""fat""?  Ever called Justin Bieber a girl?  Ever called Lady Gaga ugly or a tranny?  Ever judged Rihanna's decision regarding Chris?  Ever judge a woman who has had plastic surgery?  Worn heavy makeup?  Slept with lots of men?  Ever used the words ""pussy"" or ""c*nt"" in a negative manner?  Ever told someone ""it's just a joke, calm down""?  Ever based your opinion of *all* women on the actions of a few? (re-read your post again!) 

Congrats, you're part of the problem!

I've met your type a million times, it's always someone else, isn't it?  You have SO MUCH weighing on you as a *man*, don't you?  No, you **don't**.  Get used to it and get over it.  I had to once, I had to wrap my mind around white privilege and holy shit was I ignorant before I knew about it.  All those people I had unintentionally offended and never understood *why*...

[Read this before you respond](http://www.amptoons.com/blog/the-male-privilege-checklist/)

You need some serious perspective.  Women don't (possibly) think you're ""creepy"" because you're a straight/white/cis/male.   Please tell me about all the times someone has said ""You know, I don't think I can hang around a white person anymore...my family won't approve and tbh I think white culture is such a bad influence in general, especially all that violent rock music..."", or ""Listen, about the whole 'identifying with the biological anatomy you were born with' thing...can you like, not mention that around my friends?  They might be threatened or grossed out..."" or ""I know you're straight but I just don't think it's right if you and a woman got married...I mean, what next, pedophiles??""

The point is things that are difficult for you will never be difficult BECAUSE of the things you are (sex/race/gender identity/sexual orientation).  Similarly, things will never be difficult for me as a white woman, as opposed to a black woman.  Privilege exists in many, many forms and a man complaining to women about the ""problems"" they face as a man is unfair.  Not saying men don't have major, major issues regarding gender, just saying they will almost *never* be to the extent or the degree that women face.

If a parent actually has a glancing familiarity with what a real healthy sexual relationship might hypothetically looks like it shouldn't be harder to impart that bit of knowledge/worldview to a kid than it is for parents to pass on any of the variously useful and worthless shit they dump into their kids minds.

But what they actually need to have is conversations, where they talk to their kids like human beings, in the course of which they occasionally drop their views that fuckin' is something people do but that pornography hates the shit out of women, the way that people having conversations will do.

True,wintertash,website,http://www.winterwindphoto.com,"There are some elements of this shot that I quite like. The hand with its reflection on the surface of the mouse for instance is really appealing. Where you run into truble is that giant hotspot in the center of the image from your light source. If there was just few inches more clearance between it and the fingertips, I'd say crop it out, but that doesn't look feasible here. 

I'm not sure as is that the shot is saveable from a composition standpoint, but I think it's worth revisiting. 

That said, let's give it a shot:

* See what you've got in terms of data in those blown out highlights. If it's feasible, drop them down, maybe with a spot-correction tool. 

* Lighten up the shadows a bit. I like the dark hand, but it looks a bit clipped. See if there's data to recover at all. 

* Up your clarity. The backlit hand and reflection are where this picture has interest, work with that. 

* Now lower the clarity back down on the table grain, using a spot-correction tool (this is just a hunch, but it's worth playing with)

* Crop down until the picture frame intersects where the shadow ends on the table

* Crop up so the *centerline* of the picture lines up almost with the bottom edge of the hand. 

* Keep the full width, maybe a 16x9 aspect ratio will do you, I'm not sure

I'm not saying this will magically make this an awesome picture, it has some structural problems. But try working with it this way and see what you get. If nothing else, it'll help you recompose for another try. But personally, I enjoy the concept and how you're approaching it.

True,CervantesX,,,"From my viewing, it looked like he jumped down and put his neck on the far track. Pretty painless, relatively, and definitely quick.

The problem with pills and other suicide methods is that bodies want to live. Your brain might be done, but the human body has a strong survival instinct. So, you're good with your decision, right up until it becomes final, and then your body takes over and tries to nope the fuck out of there. Now, with a train coming at you, there's not a lot of time to regret your decision or fight it. But pills? Ain't nobody got time for that shit. They take time to kick in, time to work, and that's a whole lot of damn time where you're sitting around, realizing that you just killed yourself, waiting for shit to happen, and your body is going to freak the fuck out and try and make you puke or save yourself or just run in circles. That's a horrible way to spend your last ten minutes, freaking out and crying and hyperventilating. 

Even something that has a shorter window, for instance hanging yourself, has a five to eight minute window, and self asphyxiators are often found with claw marks around their neck, as their body desperately tries to get out of the noose. Pill poppers often have bile on them, even from pills that wouldn't normally cause it, because your survival instinct knows you just fucked yourself, and it's trying to save you. There was a guy who handcuffed himself around a tree in the forest to die, he was found with bite marks on his arm as he tried to chew it off to get away.

In short, your survival instinct will try to trump your suicidal tendencies every time. Frequently it will succeed, that's why jumpers often spend a long time standing there, or cutters only get partial cuts and just pass out from no fatal blood loss. Quick, decisive action is the only sure fire path to successful suicide. Jump in front of a train. Blow your head off. Maybe, if you've got the nerve, you can do lethal IV injection. Everything else is just a recipe for failure, or aborted attempt, or most frighteningly, sending your last moments on earth freaked out of your fucking mind, cursing your stupidity, feeling utterly powerless and alone and scared and helpless. There's a lot of things that can be happening when you die, but for me that has to be the absolute worst idea. No thank you. A few seconds of an oncoming train, or a deep breath and a trigger pull you will never hear, is a lot better. 

Yes, this guy didn't do any favors to people around him, and I'm sure if he had the option he'd have picked a better way... but when it comes to how you spend your final moments, I think you're allowed to be a bit selfish. He took a deep breath, jumped down, laid his head down, closed his eyes, and tried to shut out the world and think a happy thought as the loudest noise of the rest of his life filled his head, and then ... silence, and it's over.

2. When out in public, no public displays of affection. No hand holding, no kissing, no arm around her, hugging. We had to walk beside each other like we were brother and sister.

3. We worked in the mall, at different stores, and during times when our shifts matched up, we had 15 minutes or prearranged time together. No less, no more, and it was to be at whatever time she visited. Under no circumstances was I to visit her at work earlier, later, or otherwise not prearranged.

4. During sexytimes, it was missionary, her on bottom, me on top. No thrusting, just ""put it in and lay there"". No fingers anywhere on her body, no foreplay on her at all. She didn't shave, or trim, or anything, so it was like a forest down there (dodged a bullet there..)

5. Also during sexytimes, and this ""rule"" is the one that surprises people the most because of how ridiculous it is, when SHE thought it was time for me to cum, SHE would roll over on her side and say ""go finish up in the bathroom"".

The one downside to Slidify is it's a viper's nest of strange code. It's a mysterious concoction of R and mustache.

True,GriefAE,orzhov,,"&gt;Dear Doug Beyer,
Is there a possible answer for the flavor of how Manaless Dredge (in Legacy) and Manaless Ichorid (in Vintage) work?


&gt;Ordinarily, a Planeswalker such as you or I would form manabonds with various tracts of land and use those bonds to extract the precious mana we use to fuel our powerful incantations and summons. But, what kind of mage uses the madness and insanity of forgetting a spell (see discarding first turn instead if playing a spell) then uses that lost memory and tenuous grasp on reality to fuel more forgetfulness/insanity (discard) and eventually power out Narcomoebas, Dread Returns, etc.?

&gt;Thanks in advance,
&gt;Nic M.

True,MefiezVousLecteur,,,"Marry a woman you love, and then *love her*.  Love is not a feeling, love is a decision you make every day.  Love is not something you fall into, love is something you grow.

Don't have kids unless you really *want* to be a parent; you have to *want* to hold them on your lap and read to them, and run along side a bike, and sit at the dinner table and explain homework, and sit in the passenger seat while they try to parallel park.  If you don't *want* to do all those things and a thousand more, your kids will understand that you don't really want them, and no kid should ever have to live with that.

I love my kids.  When my kids were little and got upset I tried to soothe them; partly because I didn't want them to upset other people, partly because my wife shouldn't be alone - or feel alone - in dealing with the troubles of the children, but mostly because I don't want my *kids* to feel alone when they are upset.  They should know that Daddy is there, and Daddy will always take care of them.  Being alone and upset and afraid is one of the worst feelings in the world.

So that's my tip: make the decision every day, every hour, every minute to love the people in your family who depend on you, and to take care of them as best you can.

when you willingly, voluntarily and legally bindingly buy a known set of rights and limitations, contractually agreeing to a set of terms, why in the world should you be able to go back on that without any repercussions?

It's a terrible argument that proves way too much: let's say you buy land. you agree to terms of use there too, but let's throw all those obligations out the window, in the spirit of this article. you declare your land its own country because you bought it right?

it's absurd anyone takes this type of thing seriously. I expect more from /r/technology than mindless circle-jerking: don't buy the product if you don't agree with the terms of use. don't post a circle-jerking, shitty article that ignores the obvious: we've been buying complex products for centuries: land, indulgences, books containing intellectual property, patented objects -- the list goes on and on.

now in the spirit of circlejerk, people will upvote this post based on the editorialized title of the shitty blog post, a title that screams for online attention on content conglomeration sites. they won't read it. this sub desperately needs a rule to un-editorialize original titles that have been editorialized before initial publication.

True,xalgorafan,,,"A few years ago I was on the outs with a very dependent girlfriend. What started out as just casual dating turned into her practically living at my house, needing to constantly be in contact with me, and always trying to spy on my social media accounts. She was extremely depressed and used my sympathy as a weapon to keep pulling me back whenever one of her crazy actions would push me away. It took my stupid younger self a long time to see the pattern. When I finally did and she realized that she was losing me, SHE RAN OVER MY DOG thinking that the grieving process would bring us back together. The worst part is, it kind of did. The pain of having to drive my dog to the vet and put him down was too much for me to handle on my own and for once, she was there for me instead of the other way around... until a few weeks later when she drunkenly admitted what she had done. I have NEVER been so mad about anything. I was raised never to raise my hand to women, but my morals were seriously tested at that point. I couldn't get the trip to the vet to put the little guy down out of my head. How could this person that I loved have done something so psychopathic? I threw all her shit out and had to physically remove her from my house. I filed a restraining order, but before it went through, I had to threaten to press charges just to keep her away. I haven't talked to her since. I feel bad for anyone that gets caught up in her psycho shit.

True,gir_loves_thecupcake,,,"My crazy ex-boyfriend told me one day while we were still dating that I loved my 10 week old kitten more than him. He asked me that night if he could take him home with him to keep him awake during the drive. I said no, but he took him anyways. The next morning he called to tell me that he woke up late, jumped out of bed, and ""accidentally crushed him with both feet"" in his exact words. He was all kinds of crazy, and this may even be the least terrible thing he did in our short time together. I really hate that guy.

EDIT: For those of you who are asking, here is a response I made to someone with more of the story. 

Ok, see, I have some concerns that he may also be a redditor, but I've already put the story out there so if he see's this than I guess he sees this. I won't go into much detail at all because it is still really hard for me, but lets just say he was also a sexual predator and I don't believe I was the only victim during the time of our relationship and the short time after. I believe the other was a child. I had no solid proof, but I did finally get the courage to report him. Unfortunately it was too long after it had occurred and nothing was done in my case and he was not charged in the other. I was able to break off contact shortly thereafter so I'm not really sure what happened. But he had confronted my brother about it and tried to contact my mother, who managed to scare him away from me, only after I got a threatening phone call from an unidentified person. The detective I was working with stopped contacting me and the whole thing just kind of dropped. I never got any real closure on the situation, and the whole thing still haunts me.

and for those of you who have taken to criticizing me for not ""seeing the red flags"" all I can say to you is this. You are welcome to go back and take a walk in my 18 year old shoes and see how you deal with a charming sociopath/psychopath who has everyone you know on his side. It was a very bad time in my life. I only hope that you never encounter someone like that and if you do, maybe you can do it better than I did. I will say that I learned a lot from my experience and will never ignore my gut instinct ever again. I hope that this story will help others learn that too. Its incredibly important, and even if you feel silly, or mean, listen to what your gut tells you and don't look back. 

EDIT 2: Thank you guys for all of the supportive comments. They really mean a lot to me. And thanks to whoever gave me the gold! I wish it could have been for something more positive, but either way, it brightened my day. 

Final Edit: For those concerned about my well being, thank you. This all happened a very long time ago, and I have since married a wonderful man and have a lovely little family of healthy, happy, safe pets.

The reason we get fucked with cell phones, cable, internet, etc. is because there is no effective way to organize a mass exodus, or even effectively threaten one.  It's possible in theory - which is why everyone says 'don't buy it if you don't like the conditions', but in practice this is unrealistic.

What if there were a 'cellular consumer union' you could join?  You link your contract/plan in some way to the union, pay some nominal dues, and agree to boycott en-masse if necessary.  I guess it would be pretty difficult to setup, and you might actually have to be willing to call the cellular industry's bluff and give up your phone for a while in a boycott.  But imagine how quickly issues like this could be resolved in favor of the consumer if the CCU could make a credible threat: hey every single union member is going to dump you unless you agree to allow us to unlock our phones.  Unless you agree to provide reasonable data plans.  Unless you agree that the 'unlimited plan' really means unlimited.

Edit: Since I'm being downvoted I'll elaborate. Harvard recently came out with a new ""food plate"" to counter the one produced by the FDA. Harvard said that the FDA is too heavily influenced by the food industry and cannot be trusted to provide accurate information on food. If the regulatory body cannot be trusted then what makes you think the industry can be? 

Furthermore, the average child sees 5000 junk food ads on television every year. Ask yourself, how would you feel about drugs being advertised to your children that way? These ads use psychological ploys (playing on your emotions for instance) that children and uneducated adults are simply unequipped to deal with. 

The food industry also carefully creates foods that appeal to people on a very basic evolutionary level. The dominant flavours in our favourite processed foods are flavours that are scarce in nature (sweet and salty in particular) so we're hardwired to crave them.

Because food is a commodity, anything flies, including potentially carcinogenic additives and stuff that the industry knows causes health problems. Their prerogative is not your health.

True,vertigolady,,,"My mom kicked me out of the house when I turned 18 and dropped out of high school.  I was homeless for a few months, and then I met a guy at the library.  His name was Jason, and he was 26 and in the military.  He let me crash at his apartment, and he was really handsome, so we started hooking up.  A few months later, he had orders to Edwards Air Force Base, and I moved with him.

I did not have a job, so he asked me to keep the apartment clean.  At first it was just general stuff, like the dishes and laundry, but over the next year started to become more and more detailed and demanding.  He started finding things wrong with how I cleaned.

I was also a smoker.  He always got me cigarettes, but started to make comments about how he wouldn't ever have kids with a girl that smoked.  I wanted to be a serious girlfriend, so we came up with a system.  For every cigarette I smoked, I owed him 1 hour of doing whatever he wanted me to do.  I figured that it would just be some extra sex, which I was perfectly okay with.  I smoked probably 10 or so packs of cigarettes before he cashed in his first ""cigarette time"".

One day, after he came home from work, he drove us to Ralph's so we could pick up our weekly groceries.  I thought it was odd, because he usually signed me onto the base to use the commissary, but this was 2 years in and he had me conditioned to never question him.

He said that he wanted to use his first ""cigarette time"".  He wanted me to take off all my clothes fold them neatly, and place them in his backpack.  I was hesitant, and absolutely terrified that someone would see me, but I did what he wanted.  After I was completely naked in his car, and my clothes were folded in his backpack, he left me in the car and did the grocery shopping.  I laid on my stomach on the floor of the back seat and waited, terrified, until he came back.  It felt like 2 hours had gone by, but he had only been inside the store for 25 minutes.

These requests started happening more and more frequently.  All his requests involved public nudity and humiliation.

Sometimes I thought about telling him no, but I had no idea of how much time I ""owed"" him, and I had no friends or family I could turn to in the state.  I knew that if i told him no to anything, he would kick me out of his apartment.  I had already experienced being homeless firsthand, and I was determined to do anything to never be that hungry again.

By the third year of the relationship, I was naked pretty much all the time.  I cleaned naked, I cooked naked, I ate naked, I drove him around naked, I waited in the car naked.  I complained a few times, but he pointed out that because I was still smoking, that I was bringing the ""cigarette time"" on myself.

Then he started taking pictures of me and recording me.  He put up security cameras in every room of the house.  He also bought a really nice digital camera and took pictures of me in various humiliating poses.  And I stupidly went along with it all.

He had me create a Myspace page.  At first I was ecstatic because I had no friends or family in California, and Myspace let me catch up with everyone I had known from back home in Indiana.  But after 2 months of me adding friends and family, my account was suddenly disabled.  I had no idea why, but I wasn't allowed to use the computer for anything other than Myspace.  I didn't know it at the time, but after the first month, he had uploaded hundreds of naked pictures of me and made them viewable by everyone I had added as a friend.  He had also started posting them as comments to pages of people I had went to school with, and he posted the pictures in Myspace groups.  But since nobody could contact me except through Myspace, I had no idea.

He got orders to go to Korea, and had Spain as his follow-on.  He didn't tell me.  He lied to me and said that we were moving to a nicer apartment.  He hired professional movers to pack all our things.  Everything except for a few boxes got loaded onto a truck.  The few boxes that remained were things that were being donated to a local charity.  So while he was at work, I answered the door naked and signed the paperwork.

Two days later, he said that he was taking a day of leave so that we could play a new game.  We drove to the bus station and he parked in the park and ride parking lot.  He had me get out of the car, naked as usual.  He told me to do jumping jacks, and if I got tired, I was to rest standing up, with my feet 14 inches apart, with my fingers laced together on the back of my head, elbows out.  Then he drove away.  I stayed there alternating between doing jumping jacks and resting until the police showed up about an hour and a half later.

I was arrested for public nudity.  I tried to call Jason, but the phone had been disconnected.  

I was released wearing a pair of sweatpants, a tshirt that was 5 sizes too big, and hospital slippers from the jail clinic.  I had no idea where to go.  I couldn't contact Jason, the landlord told me that we had officially moved out, and Jason's first shirt told me that Jason had out processed the base and had already arrived in Korea.

I also found out that all I owned in the world was a pair of sweatpants, a tshirt that was 5 sizes too big, and a pair of hospital slippers from the jail clinic.  The boxes I had signed away to charity were the boxes that had all my stuff in them.  I slept under some bushes at a gas station that night.

Thankfully I was found the next day by a security guard.  I don't know her name, but she gave me a ride to a women's shelter.",1,1363623352,,0,False,2,c8xuw3i,t3_1air31,t1_c8xuw3i,t3_1air31,,1431624025,509,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,509

Alright, kiddo. Say you're watching TV and trying not to wake mommy. And the commercials are really loud. Way louder than your cartoons. So you grab the remote and turn down the commercials. Now things are at a good volume. 

But now your cartoons are too quiet! So you turn the volume up when it's quiet back to where you like it. And then the commercials come on, and they're loud again! So you turn the volume down to normal, and when your cartoon comes on, you turn it back up. Commercials down, cartoons up. Again and again.

Now your arm is tired from all this up and down! If only you had a magic box that turned the volume up and down for you? But how would it work?

Well, you'd have to tell it that the loud commercials are too loud. There's an invisible line it can't cross. Adults call that the **threshold**. 

And you may have noticed that sometimes you weren't fast enough with the remote to turn the volume down! But you don't want to be too fast with it either, or it'll sound funny. Adults call this the **attack**.

And when things get quiet, you need to turn them back up, fast, or you'll miss hearing something important! But not too fast, or it'll sound weird. So you need to control how fast the volume turns up. Adults call this the **release**.

Now listen, sport: the real question is, how much quieter do you want the loud things made? Do you want to cut off all sound that's too loud? Put a limit on how loud it can be? (So you don't wake mommy and daddy on an early saturday morning, of course) We adults call this a **limiter**.

So, champ, let's say you're not worried about waking up anybody and you just want the commercials to not be so loud. How much should you turn it down? A little? A lot? Twice as quiet? TEN TIMES AS QUIET??? Maybe your magic box could adjust this. We adults call this the **ratio**.

So you've got a box that turns down loud commercials automatically. Well that's great, kiddo. Everything's nice and evenly quiet. But now mommy's got the vaccum running. And you can't hear a thing! At least it's even though, and now you can turn the whole thing up over the vaccum and hear it all loud and clear. We adults call this **makeup gain**.

So there you go, sport. You can enjoy your cartoons at a nice, even, loud volume. Now go play outside, you little scamp, and give me back my TV!

“This sentence has five words. Here are five more words. Five-word sentences are fine. But several together become monotonous. Listen to what is happening. The writing is getting boring. The sound of it drones. It’s like a stuck record. The ear demands some variety. Now listen. I vary the sentence length, and I create music. Music. The writing sings. It has a pleasant rhythm, a lilt, a harmony. I use short sentences. And I use sentences of medium length.

In 2008, I was in a car wreck that paralyzed me.  When I got out of the hospital, every night trying to go to sleep was the worst time I have ever, and will ever have in my life.  It was complete hell, and I never want to experience it again.  Filled with tears every night, contemplating suicide, and just wishing it would go away, and maybe the next morning, I might be able to wiggle a toe, twist my ankle, anything to keep my hopes up.  But it never came.  I was browsing the internet one night when I came upon your episodes of Survivorman.  I will never forget watching that first episode.  It felt like you were suffering with me.  You were in hell while I was in hell.  I could relate to you.  I felt like I was out there with you, struggling though this condition as you was struggling with surviving.  I would even not eat dinner, and bring myself a small snack or two, and try to ration the snack down throughout a couple of episodes like you were rationing your food.  I wanted to be like you.  The willpower you had was everything I wanted to get me through this.

I just want to say thank you.  You kept me sane through months and months of nights filled with tears and terrible thoughts.

True,Manny_Kant,,,"&gt;unconsensual pain is viewed by most schools of thought as morally wrong

That is because nonconsensual pain implies that consent is possible, and moral theories typically address moral agents.  

&gt;Now I'm not sure how you would be able to prove that anything can feel distress without having confirmation from the subject.

It's a key issue, definitely.  

&gt;But we know that fish feel pain (http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/2983045.stm ) and the literary definition of distress is 1.) Great pain, anxiety, or sorrow; acute physical or mental suffering; affliction; trouble.

The problem is that ""pain"" in fish is functionally indistinguishable from pain in invertebrates - it is merely a tiered conduit for stimuli response.  It is not a conscious experience, and we do not have reason to believe that fish have a theory of mind that would allow them to perceive themselves as suffering.  

&gt;So by causing pain i guess you could say that we are literally causing distress.


The problem with using dictionary definitions in this instance is that we are typically talking in terms of human perception.  Coming up with a rigorous definition of pain that doesn't ascribe human apperception is a difficult task.  

&gt;I haven't heard even the most hedonistic viewpoint say that causing unconsensual pain is morally ok. Could you enlighten me on any moral philosophy that does?

Well, Kantianism is cool with killing animals and even causing pain intensionally as long as you can do it without harming the moral disposition of the actor.  Virtue ethics is presumably cool with it as long as it promotes eudaemonia (don't know how it would, other than this guy actualizing a fantasy that helps develop his sexuality).  Even a consequentialist ethic would have no issue with it, so long as the guy's orgasm is good enough to outweigh the fish's ""pain"".  

Can you describe any formal ethic under which this *isn't* morally permissible?

True,rick_deckard1,,,"A few years ago I was a kitchen manager at a place in Charlotte, NC. I don't know if it is common knowledge or not, but drug use in kitchens is very common, and most of the time accepted. That being said, I had a line cook who had come in tweeked out on cocaine. He came to me explained the situation, apologized, asked if he could run somewhere and come in a little later in ""better shape."" It was slow, and most of the prep was done so I said he could have an extra hour. 

He comes back 45 minutes later and is calmed down, stopped shaking and had a grin on his face. He was one of my better line cooks, so I was glad to see that I didn't have to reprimand him. We begin the dinner service and every thing is running smoothly when I look across the line and he begins to look as if he's falling asleep while working the grill. He assured me that he was fine. Fifteen minutes goes by and I see him collapse, landing with his face and arm on the grill, HE DIDNT EVEN WAKE UP. I run across the kitchen and push him off, skin literally melted to the grill. As he hits the ground, he wakes up and simply says ""aw shit, chef may I go to the hospital?"" 

The smell was horrific. At seven pm on a Friday night we closed the restaurant, opened all the doors and windows and cleaned up the mess. (We bought new plates for the grill, don't worry). As I'm doing my order for the next day around ten pm, he comes back in, bandaged up and says ""chef, can I help with anything?"" Astonished, I couldn't reply. And he continued to explain that he went to his dealers house and got a""shit ton of oxycontin"" snorted it so he could calm down and he just nodded out. ""But its okay they gave me morphine so I can still work, and I'm a dumbass so don't worry about workers comp, I just want to still have a job."" 

Two weeks later he returned to work, sober and hasn't touched a drug or had a drink since. I arranged so that his hospital bills were paid, but he had no paid time off. One of the best employees and craziest mother fuckers I will ever meet.

EDIT: after seeing how much you guys liked this story, I contacted him (its been about 3 years) he met his now fiance at an NA meeting, expecting a daughter in a few months and was just called about becoming the sous chef at a restaurant opening in Atlanta. He moved there because he said that. Charlotte was too dangerous for him and there were too many haunting memories.

True,Locrin,,,"Dead Space 1 was scary because of the atmosphere and the excellent use of audio and visual effects. Sometimes you would hear stuff crawling above or under you and something MIGHT happen in the next room but not always. This kept you on your toes. At one part you take a long fast ride in a sort of traincart and you expect something horrible to come out of the foggy darkness at any moment. But the only thing that happens is that you bump into a corpse. Then as you step of the cart with your nerves still wound thight you open a door to a well lit room and start to relax and THEN LBSLJRJHSKGHSKFF monster. 

Dead Space 3 is all like: HEY LOOK AT ALL THESE MONSTERS THAT ARE ON THE SCREEN AT THE SAME TIME. THEY ARE ALL RUNNING AT YOU AND MAKING LOUD NOISES. ARE YOU SCARED YET?

The only thing that came close to being scary in that game was the feeders and the small buildup you get from the audio log you find before coming across them for the first time. But those got old fast as they just zerged you 20 at the time while screaming instead of hiding, sneaking up on you and start chewing on your leg while you're fighting something else which would fit much better for something small and weak.


There are also next to no difference in enemy behaviour compared to DS1. In DS1 you have those big ones that stand in hard to spot places making HORRIBLE otherwordly noises. You had the ones that charged you and you sometimes came across necromorphs that would make no noise and try to sneak up on you while you were busy. 

DS3 everything just makes a lot of noise and charges you. Not very interesting at all.

True,bjos144,,,"A lot of people here are saying it's the weight, that might be part of it, but I've known heavier girls who were way uglier than you who didnt have this problem.  I'm not saying a healthy lifestyle and a more fit body wont increase the odds that guys will want to take it to a romantic level, but in my experience, being 'friend zoned' is usually more of a mental thing than a physical thing.  Although one can affect the other quite easily.

Guys and girls have to play the dating game differently, on average, for optimal results.  Guys often get friend-zoned for not being 'confident' enough.  ie, they're afraid of their emotions and act in such a way as to be putting other people's needs before their own.  This submissive behavior makes them comfortable to hang out with, but less desirable than a male who knows what he wants and expresses it.

It's almost the opposite with girls, I've noticed.  When a girl takes male dating advice, she puts herself out there and flirts and takes the lead.  Guys on the internet say they want this, but they want this from specific girls.  They dont like it from every girl, unless they're really that desperate.  When a girl who isnt the object of our desire does this, it can be more off putting than normal.

I have a female friend right now who is very overt in demonstrating her interest.  I almost feel pushed by her.  I'm not into it.  When we first met I kinda was, but she ended up dating a friend of mine and after that ended (a year ago) she got interested in me.  Too much history, and it's not new for me now, plus, I'm no one's second choice, so I'm not feeling it.

She is making the mistake of being very 'pushy' (yes, we've talked about it, but my disinterest seems to be attractive to her).  It tells me what she thinks of me, where she places me, and my stupid primitive brain says ""if she was this easy to get, I can get someone better with a bit of effort"".  IE, she just put me out of her league by being too available for me.  There's also a lot of extra drama, but this is the main thing that's making me uncomfortable.

A desirable girl (IMO) is a hot commodity and doesnt need high pressure sales tactics to get picked up.  Ever seen a Ferrari commercial on TV?  Why not?  Cause everyone knows they're awesome!  She has a line outside her door, more guys than she can possibly want, and she acts accordingly.  She is elusive, rare, something to watch out for.  When she does pay attention to me, it is a challenge and exciting.  But she puts up some barriers and plays 'hard to get' a little.  This let's me know that I have to work for her attention, that she knows she's worth the risk and effort, so if she knows that, it's probably true.

A lot of times when a girl puts on the pressure or is aggressive, it can be off putting also because we fear being responsible for such high expectations.  We fear that if we want to 'give it a go' that she'll get super attached and we're either gonna have to break her heart when all we wanted was sex (at first, thats all we ever want at first) or put up with her and feel like we settled for something that landed in our lap.  When we have to work for something we appreciate having it that much more.

You sound cool.  But maybe you need to make yourself less available to the men you want.  Invite them to things, but also invite friends.  Flirt with other people, cultivate options.  Then you'll notice guys trying to pluck up the courage to ask you out, because you've got it going on.

If you do choose to lose weight, do it for you, not for them.  Desperate is desperate, no matter how hot it is.  IF you're super hot, but still desperate, you'll get laid, but then you'll get dumped, or treated poorly, or ignored after the initial physical curiosity is met.  Having confidence in your value as a human and as a sexual creature is an internal battle.  Losing weight can help, but it wont win that conflict for you.

I wish you the best of luck.  Remember that being hot is a state of mind first and foremost.  It starts with self respect and ambitious expectations for your life.  Then it's about following through and being content with who you are and what you're doing.  Getting in shape is a symptom, not a cause of being truely sexy.  It's important, especially for girls, but not the only thing.  Pooring energy into your own life will make others be more drawn to you.  

TL;DR:  I wrote too much to TL;DR

True,rcuhljr,,,"&gt;Cross-thread operation not valid: Control 'tb_Chat' accessed from a thread other than the thread it was created on.

This is why I made my suggestion that it's very odd for class2 to be making changes on Form1 triggered by Form1. The problem that's occurring is your GUI lives in it's own thread, anything that changes it needs to happen in that thread, other threads aren't allowed to access it. You should see how you can rework things so that your Form changes itself, based on data that Class2 provides.


For example, lets change your Connect method too..


    public void Connect(string Server, int Port)
    {
     IRCConnection = new TcpClient(Server, Port);
     //If Fails Connection Error
     ns = IRCConnection.GetStream();
     sr = new StreamReader(ns);
     sw = new StreamWriter(ns);
     sendData(""USER "" + nickname + "" somewhere somehow :"" + realname);
     sendData(""NICK "" + nickname);
     //If Fails Comm Error
     //Start Thread for IRCWork
     Thread workThread = new Thread(new ThreadStart(IRCWork));
     workThread.Start();
     }

And change log

    private void logMessage(String message)
    {
      myList.Add(message);
    }

Now you can just make a method called readMessage (thread safety makes this a bit more convoluted)

    private List&lt;String&gt; readMessages(){
      var oldReadTo = readTocounter;
      readToCounter = myList.length
      return myList.range(oldReadTo , readToCounter );
    }

What we're doing here is that the networking creates a buffer of messages. The GUI thread should be polling ReadMessages every so often to get the newest messages to display. You'll also want to probably delete old messages after they've been read, but that gets trickier as you can't delete messages while read messages is being called without dealing with some threading head aches that I honestly don't remember the details of without experimentation.

The point is that network lives in a different thread, and can't force changes on your GUI form, it should just be providing data for the GUI when the GUI requests it. You might also want to look into eventHandlers, it would probably be simpler to have the GUI register an event handler with the networking for ""message arrived.""  However the sample code for that would make this already long message even longer. I suggest googling for a C# event handler tutorial.",0,1363638021,,0,False,1,c8xzyan,t3_1ajjd4,t1_c8xzyan,t1_c8xzj1g,,1431626468,3,False,learnprogramming,t5_2r7yd,3

True,gerrybutler,,,"1) The most realistic scene - or character to me - is Gerard Butler's character. He took on the character, the courage, and the heart of what every Secret Service agent has - and he really honored the Secret Service with his acting ability. 

2) No - I know what already exists. Mr Fuqua had one Secret Service agent - and I think Gerry worked with him as well - to work with those guys who are still active today.

3) There were more things that we couldn't tell in the first place - so we couldn't reveal anything that was classified. It is the White House, and it is where the President lives, so we are not going to reveal anything that is classified, top secret, or would jeapordize the White House.

GB: Ricky was on set with us every second of every day - advising and encouraging - and we used a LOT of his ideas, and trying to make Banning's journey through the White House more informed, fascinating - he brought up the idea of psychological counterterrorism - the cat &amp; mouse game with the villain - which is something we always wanted to bring in, different tech we could bring into the movie - what are the strategy and tactics used by the Secret Service - and firstly, arming yourself, assessing enemy capabilities, what's the purpose, establishing outside lines of contact with the crisis room, and starting to neutralize the threat. But what Ricky said before really made me think - when he started to talk about the heart that I brought to Banning - because that's what I got, especially from Ricky - because you can learn all the information, and the expertise that they may have, but at the end of the day, when you're talking to someone who has lived this and engaged the enemy, even been wounded by the enemy, is what you see in their eyes and in their soul when they talk about the performance of their duty. And that's what I took into Banning's character, was this incredible courage and commitment and this kind of protection of the president &amp; the people of this country - how those ideals seem to pump through their blood. And that when they talk about the enemy- those who would hurt them, or those they protect, or innocent people, that you could see this gleam, this danger in their eye. And that, to me, is the crux of this movie, because when this happens, this attack, it's so appalling and horrific and shocking, that we need - the audience - needs satisfaction and payback. And if I can go as far in saying that in situations when this happens, there's a certain amount of emotional satisfaction that they get from essentially kicking the bad guys' ass. Because this is really good against evil. 

4) Ricky again - Rothenberger and Benedict, they're historians and they did a lot of research on this when they wrote the script. They did a lot of research on what was available to the Secret Service - there is very little out there, but there are photos, there's the oath that they take to the Constitution, and they got those things right in the script.

GB: But there's also specific things that people do - like how they look - that can't be written in the script - how they move, and those would be things I would go to Ricky for. Like how do I turn this corner, or how do I relate to my men, what's the attitude, what's the posture - even the camaraderie - those are things you don't necessarily get in the script - you could either always ask those more specific questions that helped put the meat on the bones of the script, and that an audience can relate to and engage with, to Ricky. And that's the value of having an expert there. Or just to tell you that what you're doing is working. Encouragement, which is always a good thing. because it's a big responsibility to try to play a Secret Service agent and being convincing.

5) No - this is a work of fiction. Some of the things we created in the attack on the White House were things that I have dealt with in the past, but on foreign soil. 

GB: Some of the genius of the movie is the simplicity of the plan. In 9/11, they used boxcutters and changed the world. 

RICKY: They used our own aircraft as missiles.

Edit: Story I was reminded of: I got arrested on the Brooklyn Bridge with Occupy and since there were so many of us, they couldn't use cop cars, they commandeered city buses to take us to central booking.  I was in one of the first buses with about 60 other people for HOURS waiting to get booked.  There were 4 cops on the bus and one was really cool.  We were singing songs, and we found out that it was the cool cop's birthday and we sang him happy birthday and apologized for keeping him late on his special day.  The cops were getting on an off the bus to smoke outside and we asked if we could go out to smoke.  The cool cop asks if we have cigs, about 10 of us do.  he says he can't let us off the bus.  **The cool cop then finds our cigarettes in our pockets/bags, puts them in our mouths, and lights them for us!**  After about a minute of smoking, handcuffed on a city bus, he got told by another officer to put out all of our cigarettes and got in a bit of trouble.  Every now and then I'll see someone who was on my bus and we reminisce about that cool cop.  Our court date was more of a reunion than a legal proceeding.

True,somehacker,,,"Very nearly, yes. When a star enters its expansion phase, nuclear fusion accelerates as it eats up the elements heavier than Hydrogen and Helium (Lithium, Boron, etc all the way down to Iron). After it hits Iron, further fusion of heavier elements will result in diminishing returns of energy and the outward push of radiation pressure begins to be overcome once again by the star's own gravity. If the star's mass is beyond a certain limit called the [Chandrasekhar Limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandrasekhar_Limit), it will reach a critical point where there is too much mass compressed into too little space. There are too many fermions and too few accessible energy states, so all of that energy starts to compress the atoms of iron to the point where the electrons are crushed back into the nucleus of the atoms, combining the Protons and Electrons into Neutrons (a lower energy state than the combined energy of the two). When this happens, the excess energy is released in the form of a Nova. The remnant will be either a white dwarf or a black hole, depending on how massive it was. If the star is even more massive, around 100-300 times the mass of our star, the collapse goes past even reconstitution of neutrons and causes the runaway production of antimatter as a [pair-instability supernova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_instability_supernova), the most energetic thing in the known universe. In a few minutes, the entire mass of the star annihilates itself as more and more neutrons collide to make more and more electron-antielectron pairs which then annihilate each other to produce gamma rays. A single star doing this can outshine entire galaxies for a brief period of time, and after it is over, nothing remains. Not even a black hole.

True,TwoLattesLater,,,"Sad story, but really good ending. 

I had a two-year-old, blonde, long-haired chihuahua named Lola. She was the sweetest, most lovable dog I'd ever had the joy of being around in my many years of dog friendships. Last May, she had escaped from the backyard to chase a cyclist. I ran after her, but I could not reach her in time. And almost as if it were slow motion, I watched her stop in confusion and began running across the road to safety. She didn't make it. It was rush hour on an otherwise pretty low-key suburban street, and all the cars just kept moving along. All the while I am screaming in panic. I rushed over to her limp body as she took her last breaths. I had never witnessed such a thing; it was terrifying, heartbreaking, yet so surreal. After a few moments of shock, I realized I was in the middle of the road so I carefully picked up her body and knelt down on the grass. 

As I just stared at her in disbeleif, I noticed a man pull over in a white jeep from the corner of my eye, slowly remembering that car as the one who hit Lola. I was experiencing so many different emotions; I didn't know what to do or say. He rushed over saying sorry again and again, asking if there was anything he could do. I knew there was nothing anyone could do at this point, so it was here that I just let it all sink in. The tears began flowing down...and I just cried. The man knelt next to me, my lifeless dog, and put his hand on my shoulder. He cried with me for a long time.

I had never felt so comforted or bonded to a stranger before. It has almost been a year since this incident and I still think of him from time to time. His genuine sincerity and empathy helped me get through my dog's death that day. And I beleive the feelings of closure and peace were met with much more ease as well.

EDIT: Thanks for all the kind words! I thought I'd honor her with a couple adorable pictures; they always make me feel happy. :) [Lola as a pup!](http://imgur.com/uG66Ri3) And [frolicking in the meadows](http://imgur.com/u8kpjrJ)",0,1363644134,,0,1363655060,1,c8y280u,t3_1ajhkj,t1_c8y280u,t1_c8xylcm,,1431627524,1145,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,1145

True,blindsight,,,"This is actually probably more ergonomic, too. If the keyboard is angled up, then there's more of an impetus to rest the wrists on the desk, which can lead to Repetitive Strain Injuries (RSIs). It's *far* more ergonomic to have the wrists hovering in the air above the keyboard.

Everyone should have these clips taken off their keyboard, in an ideal world. Of course, this requires a low enough desk/keyboard tray so that the keyboard can be used comfortably.

Proper ergonomics* should have knees and elbows at roughly 90° angles, with the top of the monitor about 1""-2"" above eye level (depending on monitor size).

My guess is most people in this thread have their desk too high, which leads to leaning wrists on the desk, which can lead to injury.

*this is assuming you can't get a reclined set up, which is more ergonomic since it distributes weight better, but it's really expensive to get an ergonomic reclined workstation!

source: I worked at the WSIB where this was drilled into all staff, I've studied workstation ergonomics as part of a university credit, and my wife is an occupational therapist (so is licensed to prescribe technology to make workstations more ergonomic).

True,Paddl3r,,,"I may be a bit biased since I coach the Masters program at the Rideau Canoe Club. But we do have fantastic programs ranging from those who wish to just learn the basics of the kayak stroke so they can enjoy their time at the cottage and learn how to control their boat right to some of the adults in our sprint program are planning on racing at the World Masters games in Italy in August. There is a lot of information on the website to help sort you out which programs are best. Most of the coaches and instructors have grown up in the sprint programs and have been doing it for 5+ years while a few coaches have national team level experience available.

Beginner courses are recommended still as you may learn things in a different manner which may make things easier for you later on and can sometimes tailor the instruction slightly to those which are slightly more experienced in the group. Additionally you may learn a few things which may cause less damage to your boat in the long term when emptying it of water but depends on which boat you are looking to get and what stream you are looking to get into. 

I would recommend if you are just touring around, the touring and sea kayaks are more enjoyable and can keep things dry as opposed to the open top/ sit on top.

Buying used you can find some deals, there are always equipment swaps at some of the local stores and swift has a canoe kayak sale every year as well. There are deals to be had. 

Avoid the canal, it is fun to do it once but the waves from the big boats rebound off the walls for 5+ minutes sometimes and can cause you to capsize, so go in off hours when the boats aren't travelling through the canal or go on the Rideau river itself.

The paddling scene is great in Ottawa, there are always people paddling about and we always see groups which drop by the club and are looking for people to do paddling tours up north or people are planning to do some local paddling trips.

If you are planning on joining the club, I would recommend against buying equipment of your own yet (paddles, life jackets, boat...) so you can figure out what you like and make a smart buy later on.

If you have further questions, I can try to answer but most of my experience is with sprint kayaks. :)",0,1363645326,,0,False,1,c8y2n9i,t3_1aj9kd,t1_c8y2n9i,t3_1aj9kd,,1431627690,5,False,ottawa,t5_2qpoo,5

True,jonesie1988,female - mod,♀,"I tried to wax at home once.

I bought the highest reviewed Sally Hansen kit CVS had to offer and set out on my journey. 

I should have known when I couldn't get the fucking jar open that it would end badly. But noooo. My boyfriend was going to get a silky smooth lady garden to play in if it killed me. So, finally, with the help of hot water, a flathead screwdriver and a prayer, the top of the jar breaks off.

I microwave it according to package and sit on the floor in the living room (The LIVING ROOM, Jones? dafuq?). I spread a little wax on a corner of pubes. Cloth, tear, done. It's beautiful. A few more tiny patches along the top and I'm thinking, ""why get an office job? CLEARLY you are the messiah of pussy prettification!"" 

I notice the wax has hardened. No biggie, pop that bitch in the microwave again. Golden. At this point, I get a little overzealous. I decide to fucking spread wax down the entire right side of my vag. A LOT of wax. I grab a cloth and stick that mother fucker on there. But oh no... there are no edges... nowhere to grab the cloth. fuckfuckfuck the wax is hardening. Frantically try to pick at a corner of the hardening wax like the hard wax at the salon.. it's not working. the wax is too thick and the hair is going in too many directions and it hurts! Ok. Go to the bathroom. baby oil! Try to move, right side of the vadge is stuck to the carpet. give up. Cry.

True,gotpulledover,,,"presented as a counter question to this http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1ak2k3/police_officers_of_reddit_have_you_ever_pulled/

We don't pull over 10 people every day. So, no, we don't know that when you ""light us up"" you mean to pull over right this instant. We will continue driving until we find a well-lit, populated area.

We don't need our license and registration every hour of every day. The last time I saw it was when it came in the mail last year and I put it in the glove box. Chances are, it really is buried beneath all the crap that tends to accumulate with life. But you probably see this ten times per day and still can't stop complaining about it. Get used to it already and things will run smoother.

When we get pulled over, we know for a fact that the man/woman approaching our vehicle is armed and ready to shoot to kill. So yeah, it's kind of natural for us to be fidgety. Again, you probably see this on every single traffic stop, but again, you just can't get your head around it. Please, get used to it.

Remember when the cops shot up those newspaper delivery women in LA? Or the surfer dude a few minutes later? We don't expect you to be perfect. We are just worried that we may be the people you gonna make one of those unfortunate mistakes on. Hell, I'm worried you're one of the guys who let loose a flurry of bullets on a dark street into the back of a fleeing Toyota (not Nissan) truck. You can expect us not to have the greatest faith in your infallibility.

Sorry your job is so tough. I just can't imagine why you thought it would be a good idea to go down to the police department and apply. Maybe you were stoned that day? Don't you read the newspaper about all those cops who get injured? Remember, the minimum wage clerk in the convenience store probably has a job just as stressful as yours. Anybody who walks in the door could be carrying a gun and ready to rob the place. So please just STFU about your stressful job. 

As an aside, no, you don't deserve any more respect than any other person just because of your profession. You are well paid, provided with more benefits than most people, and enjoy the complete and total adjulation of six-year-olds everywhere. Enough already.

And please, please, don't give us any baloney about ""public service."" We all know you wanted to become a cop as some form of compensation, or you got a bad case of ""Superman Syndrome."" Or simply failed calc and chem in high school. 

Back to the high school math thing… Claiming that you think everyone you pull over is out to kill you is just plain stupid. Imagine all the people you've pulled over in your career… Now think of this… You are alive and reading Reddit right now. Do the math. Kinda blows a hole in that ""us against them"" theory right?

True,[deleted],,,"Oh boy.

Okay. Here's a very simplified version. Banks make loans to people, meaning that those borrowers are in debt to the bank. Debts can be bought and sold just like anything else, so through complex financial processes the institution that ends up owning your debt most likely has no idea who you are or if you are likely to repay the debt. In fact, these debts are packaged together in portfolios to help even out the risk. (The hope is that even if a few default, the rest will keep their value). This is all good and well. Now it gets weird.

Because we had a housing boom, people had this idea that housing prices would go up forever, so they viewed buying ""housing debt"" (simplified version) as a very profitable venture. This meant that banks had an incentive to lend money to everyone (even risky borrowers) because there was profit in selling debt. So now, tons of people are making loans that they can never pay back. (Many banks also offered ""teaser"" interest rates that stayed low for the first couple years and then skyrocketed, which made default more likely.)

On top of this, the rating agencies (Moody's &amp; the S&amp;P) failed to properly evaluate the risk of these debts, and often rubber stamped incredibly risky debts as low risk. So now we have a scenario where people that should never have been getting loans are getting them, people are buying debt that is actually incredibly risky, and the agencies meant to rate this debt have failed. Basically, people are buying this debt because they speculate that they can sell it for a higher price.

All of a sudden, people start defaulting on their loans. There is a mass frenzy to start selling this debt. The original assumption was that there was no way that everyone would default at once, therefore no risk. We were wrong. Due to high interest rates and a drop in housing prices the market goes nuts. Suddenly this debt is worth pennies on the dollar and huge financial institutions start to go under from their loss of money.

Bear Sterns goes belly up, Morgan Stanly reports huge losses, AIG does the same. The shock effect is felt throughout the entire market as these institutions that were considered infallible start to implode. All because we basically created something out of nothing, and paid exorbitant prices for debt that's value was far less.

Especially if the owner is being negligent and turning a blind eye to the behavior.  This behavior will become a hazard to any other animal on the property, and possibly even humans.

I grew up in the countryside, and a neighbor had three dogs that were allowed to run loose.  They hunted the wild rabbits in the area and terrorized the local livestock.  Eventually, they got into our neighbor's goat pen and killed both their pygmies, and then tore up their pigs before we were able to chase them out.  Don't let it get to that point.

Well in terms of it against me, back when I first moved here from a kinda ghetto area to here (upper-class&amp;rich area) people would judge me off of where i was from + my complexion and call me ""ghetto names"" like LaKeshia or Q'uanda and if i corrected them they refused and would only call me what ghetto names they could imagine.

I also got spit  on by this guy who I was going up to, cause he had pretty eyes and I wanted to tell him. As i walked away in shock his friends laughed calling me a stupid black bitch

When I walk home from school kids will drive by in their nice cars and yell ""Aye! nigga nigga nigga!"" Or ""White Power"" and do the ""hail hitler"" hand salute

Also some people like to make monkey sounds when I walk by and sometimes they literally run into me just to see me spill my binders/papers.

Someone once remarked about how if they dated me they'd need a dog leash to put me on so they dont lose me at night. 

Just little things like that everyday, it probably sounds petty and im sorry its not anything super interesting but the little things add up ya know? I moved here full of life and energy and now im a shell of that person.

(EDITED THIS PART FOR CLARIFICATION) And as far as teachers, they just tend to target me more, like the whole class will be talking and then if i ask a simple question to a friend its a referral to the office and dirty looks, or not letting me go to the bathroom cause they ""dont trust where I'm going"" because they've had incidents with ""my kind"", or just a lot of me being singled out and made an example when ive either done nothing wrong or its a group of people but because Im me they feel the need to use me as an example.

It sucks but thats life, much to their surprise I already have a University and major (Culinary Arts) picked out so HA to them, im moving from Cali all the the way to Rhode Island, study my dream career and far away from them.

(That said there's definitely nice and nor racially judgmental people at my school, im just highlighting the ones that are)

EDIT: Thanks for all the kind words you guys! Im seriously tearing up! You've made my night[: 

To clarify some things:

No, im not lying. Pm if you want more details/proof/whatever. I think it'd be incredibly distasteful to lie about something like this for ""Karma""

There were a few downsides, yes, i've struggled with depression, suicide attempts, binge eating, eating nothing but mints, inflicting pain on myself, and a variety of other things. Slowly but surely Im coming closer to the light at the endcof the tunnel however. Rain before rainbows!

Yes its a instagram-type filter sorry I cant help it

I plan on majoring in Culinary Arts &amp; Entrepreneurship at JWU

And lastly, you are all lovely people who have given me hope[: 

SECOND EDIT:

Regarding JWU, Im a Junior in high school, i just mentioned it because its my dream school that I know im going to go to, and im applying early decision in Nov. and the odds of me getting in are really high. Thanks for everyone who wished me good luck or told me about the place though! Im excited for when the time comes. 

Okay so one, I wasnt looking for attention, I just wanted to post of picture of something good that happened to me lately. I had NO CLUE it would blow up so much.

Yes obviously the whole entire school isnt horribly racist, I just HIGHLIGHTED the events that i remembered/stuck out the most

Please, stop calling me a liar and an attention/karma whore, i didnt want all this, I just...yeah...

I DO have friends and a couple great teachers, as i mentioned, i was just mentioning the racial bigotry against me because that is what the OP of this question asked. So I answered.

The majority of comments have been incredibly kind though, so I thank you all for that &lt;3

**For Aesthetic Reasons** The novels are awful on every level. People enjoy them basically because they are all the trappings of big, operatic Cecil B. DeMille movies ([who did provide most of the plot for *The Fountainhead* in the first place, hoping Rand would make it a screenplay for a present-day movie](http://books.google.ca/books?id=jwjXltLIqRoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=cecil+b+demille+epic+life&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=V6JIUfilB4jjiwK6kYHADg&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false)) transposed to present day concerns. It's a powerful structure, and it draws people in, but the characters are like third-rate imitations of Shaw; nothing more than hieroglyphics for a single reductive political system carrying out perverse allegories of a single unproven and unprecedented philosophy.

**For Moral/Philosophical Reasons** Rand would be quite the figure indeed if her views represented an actual moral system; they break from every single moral guideline we've ever encountered as a species. She suggests that the unbridled use of calculating egotism itself is enough to make a society function and thrive (which is her chief debt *and* misunderstanding of Nietzsche). While some hardened Utopianists may wish to test the possibility of such unbridled spirit in an actual capitalist system, I think we've come pretty damn close in the Reagan years (which led to a market collapse, and deficits in the hundreds of billions) and the government-blessed corporatism of the Bush administration (which led to the collapse of 2008, and led by one of Rand's own disciples, Alan Greenspan) to have learned our lessons. Of course, you could counter that most philosophy, especially today, [consists of only hardened Utopianism based on outrageous reductions and generalizations](http://www.reddit.com/r/literature/comments/14upyq/what_the_hell_is_postmodernism/), and I have little objection, [my own politics being located in an entirely different direction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achieving_Our_Country). 

Unfortunately, her examples of success are all in the economic sphere; the Buildings and Infrastructure that populate her novels are not there by accident; she actually believed that these were the highest things man has ever accomplished, and excused any failings a society might otherwise have (if you're interested in seeing how this might actually be the reverse of how things actually happen, [Robert Browning's poems](http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/rb/bishop/text.html) about [the Renaissance](http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/rb/lippi/text.html) are shockingly illustrative). The arts do not matter. The ease of others' sufferings do not matter. The moral movements of a nation do not matter, and according to Rand may well be simply sidecars carried along by industry. Anybody with a good knowledge of twentieth century Totalitarian regimes knows this is absolutely false. 

It's one thing to tell people to try their hardest. It's another thing to kiss and anoint outright egotism as a favourite child of society. We all have our occupations, and all bear the responsibility to keep things going (and hopefully opening up for others) as best we can. Sometimes that requires us to act fearlessly and quickly in our own long-term interest. Sometimes it requires us to lie low and let another take the lead for some time. But as we've (hopefully) learned with the crashes I mentioned earlier, (and hopefully, any literary tradition you can get your hands on) egotism eventually perpetuates itself in a single direction, blinded to all around it. If egotism itself has any benefit, most often needs to be protected from itself, if nothing else for its own long-term survival.

And finally, as libertarians have pointed out, the system Rand envisioned in her novels contain no children, no families, and no space for those not driven by egotism. While these people as exceptions need not drive the whole of a society (a society can easily be sick with their own pity irrespective of its being effectual, like Victorian England, or India in the mid-twentieth century), their comfort has been seen in the best moral systems (Socrates, Jesus, Mencius) as the true barometer of a nation's health. 


**For Historical/Political Reasons** Rand's political prescriptions consistently favour that one class that has proven itself time and time again to be utterly irresponsible with any favour society gives them; the Machiavellian Robber-Barons. As even Neitzche accedes, those concerned only with commodifying everything should never be trusted with values of a society. 

Yes, there is a certain glory in seeing things *happen*, like huge buildings, hospitals, transit systems and power plants, but none of these things would exist without a backbone of an expanding ""nursing"" class under them; tenant farmers in the Middle Ages and the working Middle Class today.

To adapt what might be her best line (which incidentally she didn't actually originate), it's not so much that I think of her in hate, I don't really think of her at all. She's a mediocre thinker, and it's impossible to isolate her thought at all; it seems either to be a vague imperative flexed by whoever is using it, or a philosophy no philosopher has ever read. She is easily debunked, and her followers mostly prey on those who know no better; high school kids (I first read her for a scholarship), the vulnerable and the desperate.

Children often adopt their parents ideas verbatim, whether through indoctrination, through being force fed or through osmosis. Upon reflection, I was not careful about what I said. I wasn't being flippant but I certainly can see why it seems like I might have been. I think it's uncommon, not impossible, but uncommon for children of his age to have such a thoughtful and reasonable understanding of some very big existential questions. I don't think he was prompted to repeat someone else's ideas on film, so to speak. I don't feel like this was a scripted or rehearsed piece of film making. What I should have said is that I feel he might be reiterating someone else's ideas but that he had clearly ruminated about these ideas and was comfortable with communicating what he had been thinking about. I am impressed with this young man, regardless of whether he's trying on some philosophy he'd just learned, or whether he came to his own conclusions using the evidence around him. The things he is saying are important, and in my opinion are the foundations to being a good citizen of this world.

Slow down, guys.

.
I'm 100% positive I know where this animal came from. There is not a doubt in my mind. I included pictures at the bottom of my post. AT MOST, this dog is a very low content. 

.
Note to the owner: Even if I can't convince you, please don't tell people you have a wolfdog. If he bites anyone, ever, for any reason, he is dead. Because the rabies vaccine is not proven to work in wolfdogs (anecdotal evidence says it does, for the record, and there is no reason it wouldn't), a wolfdog that bites will be killed and examined to check for rabies. There is no second chance for a wolfdog who bites. 

.
I have worked in wolfdog rescue for years. Many, many years. Too many years. My father does it, so I do as well. IF this is a wolfdog (hybrid is an inaccurate term), it's a very low-content. Let me explain a few things.

.
First, I am NOT saying the following to be an asshole. HOWEVER... misrepresentation of these animals and terrible breeders selling fake wolfdogs is completely ruining the ""breed."" Absolutely ruining it. If someone buys a fake wolfdog and believes it's a real one, OR they buy an ultra-low content and were told it had much more wolf in it than it really does, and that animal turns out to be an awesome easy pet, they're in for a REALLY bad surprise when they get a real one that does not act like their doggydog. Yes, some wolfdogs are very easygoing and great pets, but the majority are very difficult to train and not easy animals to keep,, at all. This ""bad surprise"" results in THOUSANDS of dead wolfdogs every year because the owner was not prepared. Same thing happens if someone has a friend with a fake wolfdog who's a great pet and they decide they want a pet like their friend has.

.
Almost all the wolfdogs I have seen come through rescue are abandoned because their owner ""used to have a great dog who was part wolf"" and ""there is just something wrong with this one."" No, nothing is wrong with him, he's just the real deal.

.
I will explain why this animal is either all dog or a very low-content. Regardless of ""papers,"" ""DNA tests,"" etc. or whatever else the breeder probably came up with. There are no DNA tests to determine the level of wolf content in an animal. They cannot distinguish between a 1% wolf dog and a 99% wolf dog. Papers are equally bullshit because they're easy to fake.

.
Again, I am ONLY doing this because MISREPRESENTATION IS KILLING THESE ANIMALS. I'm sorry if it looks like I'm just being an asshole and degrading this guy's gorgeous animal. He is an AWESOME dog (or -very- low content wolfdog).

___________________________________________________

.
Note the very pink ears. Wolfdogs that have a significant amount of wolf in them ALWAYS have VERY furry ears. You cannot see that much pink. Ever. 

.
Note this animal's ""stop,"" which is the ""bump"" between the eyes where the muzzle connects to the forehead. Wolfdogs of significant wolf content have a smooth transition. Understand that German shepherds and some other breeds also have little to no stop most of the time; however, the PRESENCE of a stop is ALMOST ALWAYS an indicator of little to no wolf content, and, yes, years of experience mean I can tell what is fur and what is the actual stop.

.
Note the ""snow nose."" Wolfdogs with significant wolf content have black noses unless they are albino or leucistic. This is not the case with this animal. Snow noses are a telltale sign of an animal being either all dog or almost all dog.

.
Note the compact feet and clear nails. Wolfdogs with significant wolf contact have large feet and black nails. The only exception is the arctic wolf and wolfdogs with significant arctic wolf heritage. While it is possible that the wolf in this animal is of arctic descent, arctic wolfdogs are extremely rare. Only a few people have them. These people, with the exception of ONE breeder that I am aware of (and this does not look like one of their animals), do not ""waste"" a rare arctic wolfdog by breeding it to dogs. The arctic breeders -generally- have only very high-content animals, which they sell to zoos and private owners, not people who want a hiking pet.

.
This animal appears to have a wide chest and appears to have fairly straight hind legs. Wolfdogs with significant wolf heritage are cow-hocked, meaning their hind heels will nearly touch. The effect is almost comical. While it is hard to make out this animal's chest, it does appear to be wide. A wolfdog with significant wolf heritage will have elbows that nearly touch.

.
Note the extremely long fur on the tail and all over the animal's body (though he seems to have gotten a haircut). This is an indicator of heavy Samoyed lineage. 

.
I am not saying this animal is definitely pure dog. However, the amount of wolf, if there is any, is VERY low, to the point where I would probably not call this animal a wolfdog (again, ""hybrid"" is not accurate).

.
Also, please note that the ""wolf traits"" I listed ARE NOT only wolf traits. Several breeds have them as well. However, the fact that this animal is missing key ""wolf traits"" is important.

.
I will include several images to compare to this animal.

.
Here are low-contents. Even though they are lacking several important wolf traits, which is why they are considered low-contents, you can see they are still much wolfier than Lobo:

______________________________________________

Here is the animal I believe is Lobo's sister.... I do not know her or her owner personally but her pictures are all over the internet. Her name is Snow, I think. Her owner is very adamant about misrepresentation and is open about the breeder's dishonesty.

I'm 100% sure, honestly. I don't know anyone else who sells ""fake wolfdogs"" that look like this. I have seen multiple relatives in person and in photographs and videos. Some of this breeder's animals are VERY low contents, technically speaking, but they are way too low to be considered wolfdogs. Of course, the breeder claims they are 90% and up, most of the time, although, due to impending lawsuits, she seems to be changing her tune.

As for you and learning mathematics?

True,milkyjoe241,,Llama factory,"What I like to do is to pretend these actions are being held up by local government bureaucracy. 

For example when I want to allow an ambulance to visit my neighbors city :

First as mayor I tell the city I'm doing this.

One of my staff goes ahead and writes up the legislation which is going to allow the creation of a joint city committee to write up details of the plan.

Then the city council approves the measure. I have them all around my finger so they approve the measure. This step is just an aesthetic one so the sims in my city think this is a democracy.

Then I wait for the other city to approve the measure to make a committee, this one takes time because the friend I'm playing with is a horrible mayor and doesn't have his city council under control. He also has a university in his city so his sims wont take the kind of tyrannical crap I can pull of in my city. But I bribe them with some free tickets to a Motorcycle show at my expo center. They pass the bill.

A joint-city committee is then created, and it takes time for them write up the deal, detailing what each city will do. It would be faster if my own people did it, but it has to be a joint-city effort so my friend sends over some clowns from the university. These intellectuals stall the process by having to ask questions like ""What is an ambulance?"" ""Is it moral to drive between cities?"" ""Can we define what we mean by sharing?"" ""If one firetruck is heading west at 40 mph, and another firetruck 20 miles away is heading east at 30 mph, how long until they just follow each other to the same fire?"". But after some deliberation the committee settles on a deal.

Once the deal has to go thru each city council again. My council being quick and easy, but once again it takes some bribes to get the other city to get the bill thru. But this time they know it's coming so they just deal with it.

The bill then goes to my hospital, which the chief of staff then has to hire a new driver, create a schedule, and order supplies for this to all work out. He then reports the cost of all of this to the city councils.

The city councils then once again vote on passing the budget. You'd think this step would be just as fast as the other steps of getting it thru my city council, but it aint. Since it's a budget issue, it has to go thru my city's comptroller, and this guy has been an asshole to me ever since I slept with his sister. But it's ok, as the city council members have already put so much effort into this they would hate to see the bill die at the hands of this asshat, so they do the convincing for me.

Finally the bill is passed, and an ambulance can head over to my friend's city. Of course this is all fake and in my head there should be no reason it takes this long to send over one ambulance. Don't get me started on what actions the city council has to take if they want to send a gift of money.

When I notice this contortion, I simply relax my face and get rid of the grimace. Now, this is usually enough to stop the train of thought altogether.

See if you can find a physical correlate to your negative mental habituation -- do you grind your teeth, chew your nails, or make faces like I do? Once you find this physical correlate, stop it. Relax it.

As you continue to do this stopping or this relaxing, you will find the thoughts come less and less and become easier to stop each time. This is how it has worked for me; hopefully it will work for you too.

Jonathan Reed

-------------------------

I am part of a lost generation.

And I refuse to believe that

I can change the world.

I realize this may be a shock, but

“Happiness comes from within”

Is a lie, and

“Money will make me happy”

So in thirty years, I will tell my children

They are not the most important thing in my life.

My employer will know that

I have my priorities straight because

Work

Is more important than

Family

I tell you this:

Once upon a time

Families stayed together

But this will not be true in my era.

This is a quick fix society

Experts tell me

Thirty years from now, I will be celebrating the tenth anniversary of my divorce.

I do not concede that

I will live in a country of my own making.

In the future,

Environmental destruction will be the norm.

No longer can it be said that

My peers and I care about this Earth.

It will be evident that

My generation is apathetic and lethargic.

It is foolish to presume that

There is hope.

And all of this will come true unless we reverse it.

I'll admit, if you weren't a fan/didn't watch the 
[absolutely](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolph_the_Red-Nosed_Reindeer_(TV_special\)) [wonderful](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frosty_the_Snowman_(TV_program\)) [Rankin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Claus_Is_Comin%27_to_Town_(TV_special\)) / [Bass](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Year_Without_a_Santa_Claus) Christmas specials when you were growing up, I can see why the stylization would catch you off guard. We didn't see another style shift this dramatic until Digital Estate Planning.

However, for those of us who did recognize it, we were instantly pulled back to our fondest memories of Christmas. Sitting around with family, snow piling up outside the house, covered in blankets, sipping hot chocolate, watching these animations. It makes total sense that Abed would have devoured these, to make sense of Christmas as a child. He would likely have the same associations, so when he loses the presence of his mother that year, it makes sense he would retreat into the most comfortable version of Christmas he knows. 

Because here's the thing. Like Abed says at the end of the episode, ""The meaning of Christmas is the idea that Christmas has meaning. And it can mean whatever we want."" What's easy to overlook there is that ""we."" Christmas is an intensely personal holiday. It's not about red and green, or trees, or Santa, though it is about all of that. It's about spending time with the ones you love, and giving gifts because you love them. That was usually the message of these specials as well. That people, caring enough about each other, despite the fact that it's easy to be cynical on ""the coldest, darkest nights"" is what made them so cheerful, the ""warmest and brightest."" 

Let's face it. Abed could have coped with this on his own, eventually. He's seen enough media to know that kids grow up, and do their own things. That would have taken time though. That would have been painful. In his mind, this was no less than the abandonment of a parent, the loss of family. We've already seen how great his relationship with his father is. So what is it that brings him around? The fact that he has a new family, willing to be there for him at the North Pole of his delusions, a [dark, windy, desolate place](http://patrickwillems.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/community-abed-christmas-pic-3.jpg) by all accounts. Despite the cold, despite distance, despite the fact that all except Pierce were pushed away (well, Troy and Annie too, but you know what I mean), and could have easily left, they pushed on, to be there with him, because that's what family does. Realizing he still had a family he could count on is what saved him. Realizing he still had those people he could sit and watch those Rankin/Bass specials with, and feel just as safe, just as comfortable, just as loved as when he was a child with his family. 

So yes, you missed something. Like TVDW has said throughout his coverage at Community over at the A.V. Club, at its heart, this show is about acceptance. It's about Jeff letting other people into his heart. It's about this study group providing companionship for all these people feeling very adrift. It's about having a family when you don't necessarily feel like you deserve one. That's why this episode is, to me, the ultimate expression of Community's heart.

That said, I'm a huge Christmas geek, and a sucker for those specials. It was aimed right at my heartstrings. It couldn't really miss, unless it missed the point of those specials, which is obviously didn't. I can see why it's not a huge favorite among the fans. However, even among the latter party, it should still shine as one of Community's best done ""meaningful"" episodes.

Oh, and it's phenomenally funny too! [Christmas Pterodactyl](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ld775krje11qdoloyo1_500.jpg)! [Bjork](http://invertedsoapbox.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/screen-shot-2010-12-15-at-12-49-27-am.png)! Lost jokes! What more could you want?

&gt;My opinion is it should mostly have been live action except for this winter wonderland thing if necessary, flashes between both realities and stuff.

I have a non 24-hour circadian rhythm for some reason, and it has been making me (and people depending on my schedule) miserable for the last decade so... yeah.

The only thing that helped: The room I had been spending most of my time had just one small window in a place that doesn't see much sunlight. My significant other had to force me to move into another room in the house (I don't like change so she had to make me) and now I see more sunlight during the day and I can maintain a more workable sleep pattern (the body supposedly syncs with the sun to maintain the circadian rhythm). Well it's not really a pattern but you understand what I mean.

When I HAVE to break the pattern (say it's night time, I'm wide awake and I *have to* be awake the next day, all day) I use medication. It is an antidepressant that was prescribed to me for getting me to sleep at odd times. Years ago, the doctor said, ""take this every night until your rhythm stabilises"", but the side effects of it is unbearable. It makes me very groggy the next day. So I use it ONLY when I have to sleep. It is a 30mg pill, and I take a quarter of it. It knocks me out in 1-2 hours. I used to take it once or twice a month, but since switching rooms (has been a few months) I didn't have a reason to use it.

I haven't tried melatonin yet and willing to give it a try. They say it makes you have some intense dreams.

All that said:

Can you imagine how awesome free running sleep would be like? Like you will never have to sync to the 24h clock, sleep when you feel sleepy and wake up when your body wakes you up.

This is why Vimeo and the others always seem to run so much better-- not because they have a better platform, but because they are not YouTube.

I realize how stupid that sounds, but there is another thing... The internet sometimes uses what are called CDNs or Content Delivery Networks, which cache and effectively host/mirror content for a corner of the Internet. What's happening here is basically at the root of the net neutrality debate-- if you experience troubles like the OP here and constant slowness or eternal buffering, its most likely because your ISP is shuffling you to their CDN for YouTube (and probably other sites) that dish out your videos. That all sounds fine and good, and it would be, if they didn't throttle the absolute ever living shit out of that connection. It's their line so they can do whatever they want with it, but they corner you into using their specific CDN so they can do that to you. They save bandwidth and thus money, and you're none the wiser and yelling at YouTube.

How this was discovered and can be circumvented is to **block the IPs of the CDN.** This will force you to use a 'regular' YouTube host to stream your content from, and everything downloads and buffers as quickly as it should have but never did.

Luxuriating in its warmth, and lost in your cloak-related thoughts, you wander off your usual path.  You stop at a coffee shop you don't usually frequent, and get in line, deciding what to order. No more lattes! Lattes are for sheep.  I'm wearing a *cloak* now - what's my drink, you're thinking.  

Lost in menu-study, you're suddenly surprised to hear something from behind you - ""what an awesome cloak!""

You turn, startled for a moment, and you see her.  She's also dressed for weather - a full-length trench coat, cinched tight, and a practical deerstalker cap which perfectly frames a pale, oval face. She appears entranced by the cloak, impulsively reaching out to touch the fabric ...


Let's face it you'd rather have a cloak-compatible girlfriend than a $GENERIC_FEMALE you'd have to hide your cloak (and other ...) longings from, wouldn't you?

True,I_Rep_Naija,,,"Becoming a doctor here is no easy task.
Most of our textbooks are foreign, and so apart from the pictures in the books we're left to our imaginations, in many cases.
Imagine 20 medical students around one patient, trying to learn something.
We do work very hard though to meet up with international standards, but it's really not easy.
Our professional exams are sometimes very subjective, so you could fail just because a senior examiner is having a bad day, or pass because she knows your mum.
it doesn't end in medical school.
Getting a place for Residency is another cup of tea. Usually you must be an indigene of the host community, or you must know someone 'at the top'.

I chose medicine because it appealed a lot to me.
There hasn't been any doctor in my family before me, but... I don't know how else to put it. Practicing medicine was the only thing that made sense to me. (Next to computer science). I guess this is the 'call' I've heard so much about.

True,passwordcool,,,"Kind of the same reason why it was good for Google to let any manufacturer use Android. Well, I don't know the details, and I imagine there are various restrictions with using Gmail, Google Play, Google Maps, and the like, and maybe different contracts with manufacturers and telecommunications companies, but anyway.

Look at the story of the iPhone. It's great. Personally, I hate that the App Store is completely controlled by Apple, but hey, the iPhone runs nice software.

Now look at Android. It's a flourishing, messy, chaotic community with lots of active developers and hackers. Sure, iPhone has jailbreaking, but that is not the scale I am talking about. Android is hackable. Users make it what they want. Also, look at the variety of devices. Many are not very popular. But some, like the Samsung Galaxy, have risen in popularity to rival the iPhone. I do not think that Google could have accomplished that on their own, and they know it. That is why they open sourced Android. That's the power of open source.

Kind of analogous to the model of reddit. Some super-popular reddits (front page) but countless subreddits that appeal to a particular audience, and crucially, anyone can grow the smaller communities. That is what I think is the success of Android (many other examples: Wikipedia, Firefox, Occupy, Tea Party, blogs in general), and that is what I think is the success of reddit. 

So addressing your original question, why do I think it was a good idea to have no official app and just have dozens of unofficial apps? It's competition, baby! Let the Darwinian mechanism take hold!

True,plaguefish,,,"There was another thread lately where a lot of the comments were about wishing all the icky sex wasn't in the books. I will go on a little tangent here, as this has been sitting with me for a couple of days.

The sex is in the books because it's something that happens to these characters. It's not written to titillate, and like all the other fine details in the novels, it's not prettied up to spare anyone's delicate sensibilities. This is not a world full of beautiful people making tender love. Sometimes you get that. Most of the time, you don't. Just like the violence, the sex reflects the gritty realism that we all claim to love so much.

These novels are intended for mature audiences. We often take that phrase to simply mean ""sexual content,"" but that's not really accurate. It pertains to the mindset of the intended readership.

Something which comes up again and again is the ""fat pink mast"" scene - where Sam, a notorious coward sworn to celibacy, finds himself losing his virginity to a young mother. People fall out of their chairs giggling at the ludicrous description of his cock, and then bemoan how totally grossed out they are when she starts to lactate. A ""mature"" reader is able to recognize that the phrasing is *intended* to be shocking, even absurd, because that exactly defines the scenario.

Sam is a guy who could have been voted ""least likely to get laid, ever."" His sexuality has been nonexistent up to this point. This is a teenaged boy who is so conscious of being undesirable that he doesn't even allow himself a single lusty thought. Suddenly, he's about to have sex with a girl who is not only willing, but eager. It is, in his eyes, a preposterous situation. But he goes with it, and their bodies function as bodies do, and they go with it. That's what people do when they're having sex and something imperfect happens. That's what makes sex an intimate experience. ""Mature audiences"" know this. It's great writing.

The sex scenes are all like this. They're not all absurd, and they don't all contain elements of the taboo, but they do all convey truths about the human experience. There's the man so desperate to be reunited with his lover that he ignores the fact that she's on her period. There are the teenagers futtering at each other in some dark cave, lacking the vocabulary to describe what they're discovering about each others' bodies. The widow who just needs some measure of release and gets it from her drowsy handmaid. And there *are* the sweet moments as well... the contended wife hoping her husband has left her pregnant again, the knight so enamored that he forsakes his vows with true passion.... etc. etc. etc.

GRRM is telling a story about the way people think, the way people relate to one another, and the way they act and react. It would be disingenuous to omit the sexual component. Love, lust, and base animal instinct are just as much factors as pride, greed, shame, anger, justice, vengeance, joy, fear, resentment, envy, disgust, ennui, insecurity, guilt, sorrow, desperation, and so on.

True,MBarry829,,Marine Veteran,"Camp Coyote, Northern Kuwait.  My entire battalion in the USMCR had been mobilized about 5 weeks earlier.  From notice of the mobilization to wheels down in Kuwait was probably about ten days.  

I had been seriously injured about a week before hand when moving a water buffalo by hand (part of the equipment that we had been given from the MPS and had to be inventoried).  It was near chow time, and we got careless.  The locking pins on the landing leg weren't locked down.  I was crushed and pinned underneath the buffalo when we turned it and it collapsed.  Once I got home and saw a civilian sports medicine doctor I found out the full extent of my injury (a complete tear of the anterior talo-fibular ligament), but the Navy docs believed it was just a sprain.  

Funny enough, they gave me morphine but no crutches.  As I was sitting in the Battalion Aid Station the First Sergeant rushed in with actual concern on his face.  As these things are want to do on the grapevine, word was that the damn thing landed on my head and I was dead.  

He came in and said ""Barry!  You're alive.""

The drugs were swarming through my head.  I was in la-la land by then, so I'll could do was look back at him and say ""Sure am First Sergeant!  Hell of a thing!""  

That broke his facade and he cracked the biggest shit eating grin I've ever seen in my life and just said ""Good!"" and walked out.  

It was an interesting couple of days after that.  Because of expected casualties the BAS didn't want to give me a pair of crutches.  Without those I was helpless, I had to be carried on the back of another Marine to even shower.  So my buddies in my section made me some out of a pallet and bubble wrap.    THAT pissed off the the Sergeant Major and he made the BAS Chief cough up a set for me.

Anyways, that a large digression.  So the war starts, and the battalion is gearing up to support the logistical push with the Division.  But after the first strikes the Iraqis began risking certain death to launch missiles at our staging forces into Kuwait.  Since the chemical threat was perceived as very real at the time, it was assumed these missiles would have gas on them.  This would require us to go to MOPP IV and shelter in place.

  We had rehearsed in the days leading up, and the original SOP had us shelter in poorly prepared Scud bunkers.  Ours didn't even have a roof.  during one of the drills, being a cripple, I feel into the bunker and unbeknownst to me I crushed my gas mask.  Days later the SOP changed to trade of what little protect the open air shelter offered us from shrapnel to staying in the large haji tents we were using as shelter.  The canvas wouldn't stop shrapnel, but it may help with the gas.  

Anyways, we get the alert that night and stay in the hooch.  All we're wearing are out gas masks.  A minute or two into the alert some asshole bursts in full MOPP and tells us that confirmed chemical attack is inbound- get in your MOPP suits.  THAT was a near panic, but we do it.  We're Marines after all.  

So we get them on and can do nothing but sit and wait.   At this point I feel the faint sensation of fresh air in my mask.  I attempt to clear and reseal it, no go.  I try again, and again.  Now I'm no bullshit freaking out.  

I tell my squad leader.  In hind sight he reacted the same way I would now as an NCO.  Assume my soldier/Marine is stupid and isn't doing it right.  He tries to help me clear and reseal it.  It's still a no go.  The mask has an opening some where.  The nearest spares are a quarter of a mile a way and we can hear the Patriots launching.  I can see the fear and regret in his eyes when he tells me there's nothing we can do.  He has me take my atropine out of the carrier and has me wait.  I resignedly accept my fate and wait it out on my cot.  Minutes turn into hours.  

Nothing happens and the all clear sounds.  

When I took off my mask I inspected it.  Turns out when I landed on it I cracked the inside the voice mitter.  

I ditched my crutches 2 days later to go over the border.  They were going to evac me to Germany.  I sure as shit didn't go all that way to miss the big show.

But the shooting, the mortars.  Tours in Iraq and Afghanistan.  None of it was remotely terrify as those 20 minutes in Camp Coyote when nothing actually happened.

- I feel the new base model is cool, but give me the impression of a melee monk fist fighter.
- I do not really care for the dance. I had hoped that the fans will fold and unfold as part of the dance similar to Jade Fang Cassiopeia.
- I really like the Sun Goddess changes, but feel as though the cleavage is poorly shaded, and her boobs look mushed together.
- If you wanted Karma to seem so level headed in the heat of battle why was she given such an angry expression?
- What brought about the decision to use a purple and green motif? Purple in Ionia is usually associated with evil (Varus/Syndra).
- What leads to a character having an articulated face? Why does Karma not have one?
- Why was Karma taken from a AA to a DD cup size? Do you feel this standardized silhouette will help her popularity?
- Why was the decision to remove Sakura Karma's kimono made? I am sure most people like myself were most excited for that remade skin, but it is clearly the ugliest.
- One of the common and valid complaints I have seen floating around is that Karma has lost a lot of her femininity or more “Lady-like” attributes, such as wearing gowns and using fans. Was this Riots intent with the changes made?
- Most importantly to me... What was the thought process behind keeping the eye makeup the way it is? I have always felt that makeup made Karma look evil, like Morganna. I am disappointed to see it remain in the VU.

True,RogerStrong,,,"My favorite Star Wars conspiracy theory:  **It's the rebel terrorists who were evil.**

Look at the Ewoks for example.  A primitive tribal people.  And yet the Empire was able to build a massive shield generator and landing pad right next to their village without disturbing them.  

The landing pad was built on pylons and the power generator was underground, so that there was hardly any disturbance to the forest.  The Empire used a mix of walking and hovering vehicles, so that they didn't even need to carve roads into the forest.  Only the shield antenna poked above the tree-tops.  The empire was as ""green"" as they could possibly be.  Small wonder the Ewoks had no real fear of them.

Along come the rebels, and what's the first thing they do?  They take advantage of the Ewok's religion to convince them that their golden robot is actually a god, and by extension, that the rebels are the god's representatives.  Then they tell the Ewoks stories of good and evil, with the Rebels being good, and the Empire evil.

In short, they convince the Ewoks - who have club and spear technology - to attack the Empire with its blaster and walking tank technology.  Many are killed.

Then the Rebels blow up the power plant and shield generator - near the Ewok village - with a nuclear-level explosion.

Then they blow up a Death Star - the size of a small moon - in low orbit around the Ewok's planet.  They stayed to party that night, but no doubt they left before the atmosphere and surface of the planet were laid waste over the following weeks by hundreds of cubic kilometers of metal wreckage raining down from above.

They're evil, I tell you.

True,[deleted],,,"I sometimes have to explain to people, 4chan as an internet culture is on some levels actually using a different language. The lingual patterns are so intersparced with internal memology that someone who speaks english may not understand a word that's been said in a thread despite a full conversation going on. It's a great example of the Darmok style of language. 

It's why Lurk Moar is so important to the culture, because to speak the language you have to understand the references. the *Chan's obsession with the use of the word ""Fag"" while born out of homophobia no doubt takes on a much more fluid meaning inside the community. The lingual root is still there but much like many words in the English language as used within the mixer that is the *chans it may not necessarily hold the same meaning, more so then every day culture. 

Plus where else am I going to say 

""My neighbor was a really terrible guy, then one night he tried to an hero. Being a failure, he turned to a life of CP and later got vanned desu~"" 

Not ""Impossible to understand"" by any means, but there is a certain level of knowing the ebb and flow of the place. 

I give the *chans and only the chans a pass on this matter because they do have their own kind of internalized culture that is unique (for the most part) to an anonymous image board service. It's culture shows up in other places (like reddit), but the heart of it remains. Places like know your meme, encylopedia dramatica, and the likes have served as a sort of Rosetta stone to the outside world, where as before you just hung around, watched the threads, and eventually you began to associate phrases with their actual meaning. 

You learned ""Don't mess with Football"" was a way of saying in a less formal way ""You will be reported to the FBI for terrorist activities"" or the likes.

True,jstrydor,,,"I'm on the field side of this (Paramedic) and here is my most disturbing call...

Got a call for a Traffic Accident on the 5 Freeway in California... we get there and there is a mutilated body laying in the road. As I approached the body I realized it was a child... looking at him I knew there was nothing we could do... his skull was concaved and his chest was crushed from being run over by a semi-truck. apparently he was driving in a car with his uncle which broke down on the freeway... he tried to get out in the middle lane on the freeway and was ran over by a semi-truck... I initiated CPR anyway because of how young he was. The fire department showed up and I heard one of the firemen say, ""If we leave him here, CHP will be pissed because they'll have to shut down the whole freeway, we better take him in"". Even though I knew there wasn't anything I could do, I still worked him up the entire way to the hospital... everytime I did a chest compression blood and brain matter would come gushing out of his ear... It was hard to get a seal around his mouth because his jaw was halfway ripped off of his face and he had a single tooth that was halfway hanging out of his mouth that was only held on by his braces... We arrived at the hospital and the Firefighter stopped pushing meds and stopped trying to shock him... he casually got out of the ambulance and told the nurse that, ""The kid was done"". He told me I didn't have to keep doing chest compressions, but I didn't listen... I don't know why, but I couldn't stop... even though I knew there was absolutely no way he was coming back. We pushed him inside and the doctors and nurses gave a brief effort of trying to bring him back... I remember standing there in the hallway watching them work the kid up while my pager was blowing up from dispatch asking what our ETA was to go back into the field... finally I heard the doctor ask for the time of death... Then as I was cleaning this poor childs blood and brain matter off the floor of the ambulance I saw the boys parents show up at the back door... the mother had a slight look of concern on her face, but I could tell that she didn't know the severity of what had happened to her son... I walked back inside to throw away the blood stained sheets when I heard the doctor break the news to the mother... There is no sound in this world that is harder to hear than the sound of a mother who has just been informed that she lost her child... The mother lashed out at the Father and screamed that it was his fault... The mother had to be restrained by hospital staff and sedated... I spoke with the Father who seemed to be in a state of shock and disbelief... apparently he and the boys mother had been divorced for years and he said that he hadn't seen the boy for months because he failed to pay child support... he said that he couldn't remember the last time he told his son that he loved him and he said he would do anything to have a chance to tell him how proud he was of him.

Sorry for the format of that story, I just typed it in a rush. But that was by far the most difficult call I ever had and it definitely scarred me for life... I still think about that boys father to this day and when I do, it always reminds me to never hold anything back... I always tell my friends and family how much I love them and how I feel about them now, because you never know when your day will come.

Edit:Thank you guys for the support and encouragement. It has been a while since I thought about that call, it happened years ago and I honestly kind of repressed it, but talking about it and hearing you guys has been therapeutic for me... So thank you!

Edit2:I am amazed at all of the support and encouragement I received for telling my story. It really warms my heart to know that it touched so many peoples hearts! It definitely makes me feel good knowing that I may have caused somebody to tell a family member how much they love them. I am a Christian, I do believe in God and all I can say is that he definitely gave me support and comfort during this time in my life, and my hope for all of you would be that you find comfort and strength in him as well!

True,hollywoodhuskey,,,"im only going to leave one because its the one that really got to me:

after only working there three months i took a call from a trucker who had wrecked on the interstate and was flipped on his side. he was pinned by the steering colum and the lower part of his body was crushed (like mel gibsons wife in ""signs"".

usually when a wreck happens on the interstate we get bombarded with calls from everyone passing the vehicle. i happend to recieve that call from the man himself, he was awake and told me who he was, who he worked for, and that he must have dosed off for a second.
he told me that he was pinned in and that the bottom part of his body was numb. he hold me where he was from and about his family (at this point i was making small talk to keep him calm)
he started talking about god and asked me to pray with him, he lead the prayer, asking for help and for gods will to be done.
i kept him on the line while responders traveled to the scene. as a little time went by, he started to slurr his speach and he wasnt comprehending my questions anymore, my guess is that he was slowly bleeding out and his level of conciousness was lowering.  eventually he stopped answering my questions at all, he had passed out. 
very shortly after, responders arrived and extradited him out of the vehicle.. as soon as the pressure from the steering column was released he bled out. dying almost instantly. medics told me that if a team of the best doctors in the world were 20 ft away, they would not have been able to save him. 
i was pretty much the last person to talk to this man alive, and in my eyes i made  friends with him. 

being a dispatcher, you are the last person to talk to people all the time. but usually its a suicidal person, or an older person. not an innocent man trying to make a living for his family

True,wjbc,,,"In Western culture, [historical criticism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_criticism) -- that is, the idea of examining the history around the text to determine the ""true"" meaning -- ""began in the 17th century and gained popular recognition in the 19th and 20th centuries.""  In the 19th century such efforts were aided by the [development of modern archaeology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeology#History_of_archaeology), and in the 20th century by the [invention of radiocarbon dating](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiocarbon_dating#Inventors_of_the_method).  As a result, we now have a wealth of information to use to consider the veracity of ancient texts.  

Before these developments, however, it was often difficult to distinguish between fact and fiction and legend and myth and history.  Often they were all told the same way, as stories, and the reader was left to make of them what they would.

While it is possible to find ancient historians who had almost a modern concern for literal veracity, like the ancient Greek historian Thucydides, even he was helpless to contradict the stories of Homer, written hundreds of years before his time, because he had no evidence to support such claims.  He could, however, check contemporaneous claims with eye witnesses, and approach his own historical account very differently from Homer.  Even so, Thucydides thought nothing of writing speeches for famous people in his histories and passing them off as verbatim accounts, and he did not list the primary sources for any of his material.

True,Attack_Squid,,,"That is not true, all the mmo's with a respectable production value and expected to go ""big"" always put an emphasis on PvP, not PvE. Even if they have PvE it is poorly done. Here are some examples:

Warhammer Online - PvP (RvR) focused, and PvE was a secondary. The PvE was just terrible, and even though there was a form of the trinity, it was not very well put, healers had to do damage to get to heal, and some like the warrior priest even had to be in melee, meaning they didn't always have the heals they needed, meaning lots of dead tanks. Overall the PvE was laughable, while the RvR was fun for a while, it only lasted so long. 

Guild Wars 2: It doesn't take a genius or someone who has logged many hours into this game to know that the PvE is just broken. No trinity at all, and class lines are blurred, essentially everyone is everything. The boss's have obscene health and damage, and with the lack of a ""tank"" it just runs back and forth smacking the shit out of people, hardly a real encounter while maybe ""realistic"" its not fun, and if you are playing a game with magic, and people that come back to life after they die, you can't really be serious about ""realistic"". 

EVE: Now, I am not going to even attempt to say that I understand this game. I have a good friend that plays it plenty, and what I know from talking to him is that it is mostly centered around completely different systems, but if it had to be described in traditional terms it would be an economic game, and then a PvP game, with a real absence of any traditional PvE end game.

Rift: This game actually has end game content for PvE and is doing well, they have been able to maintain a subscription model unlike Warhammer online, and not resort to micro-transitions like GW2, it is also on its way to an expansion. Huh, a game that actually has good end game progression and content is doing well?

I know there are many other mmo's, many crash and burn within months and don't even have the production value to bother talking about, and there are older ones like DAoC, EQ etc... BUT, this list includes some of the modern mmo's with high production values. 

Back to the argument, so as we can see PvE can either help or hurt the game. If you are going to half ass the whole PvE and make it a secondary priority expect it to fail, and you are better off without it (Warhammer online). Now, if you make a system has cannot even support the idea of a ""raid"" or even a dungeon, again just don't bother, focus on the appeal of your game, PvP (GW 2). However, we can see that a game that has real endgame content (Rift) that is not secondary, but has equal importance can be great. 

PvE attracts a certain crowd, one that is much more devoted and invested into the game, so why not have these type of people? It can only help the game to have a real endgame with real raids, and not this adventure zone shit that resembles public boss fights from Warhammer Online, which was just a terrible idea. An instanced zone, that requires 25 or so players to work together, communicate, and progress, that is a raid. 

I see no reason at all for not having a real raid especially after saying they would. I understand the game is not even in Beta yet, but to claim something for so long, and then at a snap just remove it seems like they never really gave it a real thought and only said it to reel in PvE players. The massive world of Tamriel and all the legendary enemies alone lends to a great Raid scene, but I guess they think otherwise. Overall I am very sad to hear this, and if it is true I will not be buying this game, nor will many others likeminded. 

*Edit* just remembered that I forgot to mention SWTOR. Great story and progression, but the end game content was so stale that the number of people that quit after reaching max level is just record breaking. Again, showing that real end game content that isn't just PvP is needed to keep people interested in the long term. It is why WoW is still alive and strong, they have Raids for one group, Arenas for the others, and more casual forms of both in the forms of Dungeons for casual PvE players, and battleground for casual PvP players.

True,[deleted],,,"To me, this opinion piece is all about confirmation bias. This writer would like to interpret the particular reaction of a few media outlets as being pervasive:

""This particular evil has been rotting at the fractious heart of Western culture for so long that it barely registers as abnormal, and the initial emotion when it is challenged is rage. Rage that anyone dare question the notion that men's 'bright futures' matter more than women's right not to be attacked and degraded.""

That horrifying picture is not my reading of ""society's"" response to events like this. It is, however, the response of some people, in every society everywhere.

Another impulse of some people in every society everywhere is to forgive, or at least, to be judicious in administering justice. We should be careful not to interpret this impulse, *prima facie*, as indifference to a crime. It's that error that makes people rail against, for example, the advent of juvenile courts.

It's certainly a plausible and coherent argument that a focus on the impact of sentencing on these young men shows a disregard for the rights of the victim. But as impassioned as this author is, she doesn't provide any information that would suggest that such a focus requires, or causes a disregard for the victim.

Let's be aware of both the impact of rape on the victim *and* on the nature, motives, and effects of our retribution. It's only when our justice system is co-authored by these two concerns that it is truly just. It's keeping these two dimensions in mind that's the challenge, and in response to this opinion piece in particular, I say that endeavouring to do so is not a contradiction to feminism or to women's rights. 

Laurie Pennie, find an instance of indifference, and go after it, by all means. But in the process, don't conflate those instances of indifference (that you will surely find) with the impulse towards measured and judicious punishment. The enshrinement of that impulse is hard-won, and easily lost.

True,A_Tusken_Raider,,,"I would recommend buying a C harmonica first. Doesn't have to be expensive. I blew out two cheap harmonicas learning to bend before purchasing a nice Hohner Blues Harp. I find the C harp is a good place to start because it should be familiar to the ear....the typical, ""do re me fa so la ti do,"" which you probably learned in school. 

After purchasing the harp, just start experimenting with it! The first thing I trained was control. By this I mean the ability to hit individual notes and blow or draw out of individual holes. Most beginners will blow and draw out of several holes first resulting in that unpleasant garbled noise. Do not get discouraged! Eventually your mouth will adapt and hitting individual notes will become second nature. There are typically two styles people develop to hit individual notes. One style uses the tongue to block other holes while you blow or draw through the desired hole and the other uses lip control to blow or draw air through individual holes. Each style is valid in its own so do what feels most comfortable. When practicing, I found I instinctively knew when I was hitting an individual note. It just sounds so much sweeter and complete. 

Once you can hit individual notes, learn the C scale... it's easy.

blow 4, draw 4, blow 5, draw 5, blow 6, draw 6, draw 7, blow 7

After this, try to learn a simple song, like Love Me Do by The Beatles. 

Make up your own songs and riffs as well. I found that I made pretty good riffs while trying to emulate South Parks Cartmans harmonica when he is in the woods with the gang. ""I hate you guys, you guys are assholes, specially kenny, I hate him the most.""  
      
My final advice would be to practice everyday for 10 minutes. Of course you can do more, but try to fit in 10 minutes a day. Use youtube and search for backing tracks in the key of G (if you are using a C harp) and it will sound really good (you are in the cross harp position, musical theory and whatnot).

True,CiderDrinker,,,"I served as an officer in Iraq, early in the war. This happened more often than I like to admit. It makes me sick to the very core. I hate the fact that many died, many more were physically or psychologically scared for life, and that those who conceived this evil - Bush, Chaney, and in the British case, Tony Blair - are still getting away with it. Most of all, I hate myself for my complicity in this terrible war. I was an instrument of lies, of torture, of evil. I should have done the right thing, and faced court-martial. Instead, I obeyed orders, and have lived  with the guilt ever since. I often wish an Iraqi, defending his home, had shot me dead: because I deserved it, I was an invader and complicit in an evil, unjustified, unnecessary, and ultimately pointless war. Between  this and the banks, I have become convinced that we are ruled by a powerful, evil and irresponsible oligarchy, that our governments with their smart bombs and drones are the terrorists, not some kids with AKs, and that we need real change - real democracy, real peace, real social justice. What makes me more mad still is that with the money spent on the war and paying off the private speculations of bankers, we could have provided better for the poor, the sick, the old, the children - we could have spent it on making a socially just, humane society.

True,RiPont,,,"I've held what I call my ""small world theory"" for a while.  It's my justification for always trying to be nice to people.  If you run into any person once, you are most definitely more likely to run into them again than some random other person.

Fate is real and does not require any belief in the supernatural.  For certain loose definitions of ""fate"".

Think of fate as nothing but a series of mathematical probabilities that condense down into a two-dimensional vector (direction + velocity) at the time of your birth (or conception, if you prefer). All the factors present at your birth go into this value.  Your geographical location, your parents native language, income, etc. all put strong probabilities on things that will happen in your life.

But your fate is not a straight line.  The decisions you make and outside influences cause this line to change direction at different points.  So, for most people, it's a line travelling in one general arc, with curves and wiggles.

When you meet someone, that is your fate line intersecting with theirs.  If you form a relationship with them (by choice or not), your fate lines are obviously more likely to intercept again.  They're influencing each other.  But even if you don't form a relationship with them, the very fact that your curvy line intersected theirs means that you were likely on a similar trajectory to start with.

Two wiggly lines that intersect once are much more likely to intercept again than two lines that have never intersected before.  (and apology to mathematicians for butchering the terminology.  They're technically ""curve segments"", I believe, as they do not extend indefinitely in either direction)

In the case of the OP, there are several obvious factors that increased the probability that they'd meet again.  Their parents were both friendly to a specific kind of USA culture and of roughly similar incomes.  They were of similar age.  Etc.  While I wouldn't call it likely that they'd end up together, it's not quite as astronomically unlikely as simply plugging in raw ""number of people at Disney World on this day"" type numbers.",0,1363727874,,0,False,1,c8yoz4d,t3_1alnhe,t1_c8yoz4d,t1_c8ynsc9,,1431638424,56,False,todayilearned,t5_2qqjc,56

True,Deradius,,,"&gt;A girl got raped multiple times and there were multiple witnesses. People thought it was no big deal.

I don't know.  There was a trial.  *Someone* thought it was a big deal.

&gt;People took pictures and circulated them without thinking that this rape was wrong. 

If you read the text transcripts, they knew it was wrong.

[Mark Cole:  Don't send it to anyone else.  No really u can't be doing that, is that your jizz on her stomach?](http://www.mobilebroadcastnews.com/NewsRoom/Don-Carpenter/Text-Messages-led-convictions-Steubenville-Rape-Trial)

and

[Sean McGee:  U shouldn’t have did it if she was that hammered](http://www.mobilebroadcastnews.com/NewsRoom/Don-Carpenter/Text-Messages-led-convictions-Steubenville-Rape-Trial)

They knew.

&gt;The parents of the rapists (and many other people from the town) tried to downplay the rape as something the boys did in good fun and that the girl was just a slut out trying to destroy the poor boys and their reputation.

No doubt about this.  Do you expect the parents to turn their own children in to face (even well deserved) lifelong consequences?  Maybe some would...

But having taught high school I'll tell you there are parents out there who will defend their kids to the death, even with the knowledge that their kids are in the wrong.

That's whether the charge is rape, murder, robbery, or cheating on an exam.  It's always someone *else's* fault.  Couldn't possibly be the fault of *my* snowflake.

A better point would be the media coverage that spent more time talking about the consequences for the rapists than for the victim, but even that can be explained (to some degree), as the news was reporting on the *conviction*, which was the temporally proximal event.  (Not saying reports should *ever* be sympathetic to rapists, of course.)

&gt;This is exactly what rape culture means. Almost every participant (the rapists, the witnesses of the rape, the parents of the rapists, the people governing the town where rape happened) were part of a culture which thought this rape was okay.

The kids didn't think it was okay.  They knew it was wrong.

The judicial system didn't think it was okay.  The boys were tried.

The news didn't think it was okay; they called it a heinous crime even as they lamented the boys' fate.

I think the problem is simply that we have an imperfect system run by imperfect people.

Perhaps I'm too naive, but growing up as a male in the rural south, *I* never had the idea that rape was an okay thing to do.

I like this one from last week.

Neanderthals seem to have had larger eyes than us; and a small but significant percentage more of their brains dedicated to vision.

This gave them an advantage in the less-sunlit northern lands. 

But: *they lost some social skills*. Apparently humans at the time traded for hundreds of miles for necessities; whereas Neanderthals had a trade circumference of some 25 miles.

Which boiled down to this: *We were the smaller guys with glasses who talked fast and had friends.*

True,SukottoMaki,,Canada,"You don't need to use a spreadheet if you don't already have one.  You can do just fine with a few sheets of lined paper. The important thing is to get started, write neatly, date everything, and keep moving toward the big goal.  

Careful that you don't get bogged down. For example, it's easy to get stuck trying to perfectly track your spending.  While it's a good idea to track every penny.  It's an even better idea to get an imperfect system in place and improve it over time.  Just so long as you keep moving toward the big goal.

Budgeting doesn't have to be that complicated.  To start, look at the last few bank &amp; card statements and group things into general categories.  

For each category, ask yourself.  

1. How much did we spend last month?
1. Was the result worth the cost?  (OR, would we be worse off if we had NOT spent that?)
1. Did the spending in that category improve the family or the (family's environment) in a meaningful way? 
1. What would it cost the family if we moved some of the money spent in that category over to debt payment (later change this to ""retirement saving"", ""college"", ""vacation"", etc)
1. Is paying that cost to the family worth the gain of reducing our debt?
1. Based on the above, how much do we want to spend in that category next month?


Think a bit about psychology.  To get around ""me vs you"" thinking, it can be helpful to frame things in terms of the *family*.  The family owes X. The family's income is Y. The family spend Z on _____, was it worth it to the family? Does the family *need* a new car right now? Does the family get enough benefit from each of those cell phones?

That is why I added an allowance section in the fixed costs.  Each person needs a little pocket money for ""makes me feel good / I'm special"" spending separate from the family.  This should be a token amount during this emergency, but in my opinion, each spender in the family needs *something* that's no-questions-asked spending... and the amounts have to be fair.  

For everything else, consider having a family-spending rule.  Everyone spending the *family's* money has to get at least one other spender to agree to the transaction.  They agree that family needs to spend that money on that thing right now.  And the spending has to be documented in the family's spending record!

Once you are out of the crisis, then consider making that a $5 or $10 (or whatever you all agree is reasonable) limit rule.  If the total cost of the thing you want to buy exceeds the limit, you have to get another family member to agree to it.

I say ""spender"" here because sooner or later, each child will be old enough to participate in this system. When that day comes, you'll no doubt want to educate your children in good money management.  No better way than to give them some responsibility in the family's finances (and it's good insurance too in case something happens to either of you parents making you unable to to give 100% attention to the family's finances). For the teenager, it wold likely be a good idea to involve them now.  Gee them starting to think about money issues in a real-life setting. There's an excellent chance they will have useful opinions and insight.

True,[deleted],,,"Exactly. ""anything to help me play the game better""

There is a group of Ultimate players in my city who refuse to ""conform"" to the standard because they consider it too competitive. When they get together, they don't call anything, a aught disc on the line is in, a dropped pull is not a turnover, and endzones might not have backs. I have frequently reached out to certain members of this group trying to get them to ""switch sides"" and take it more seriously but they just won't do it.

It really might be a difference in ideology but, trust me, I don't think anyone is arguing with you to be a dick. Obviously if you can beat them in throwing challenges, you have some skill. Perhaps some of these guys legitimately wish you would play competitively because they feel (whether they know it or not) you could help their team. This is why I give ""casual"" players a hard time; for the same reason my dad and brother used to give me shit when I was younger. They wanted me to be tougher, stronger and better as a result of a little hardship.

All I'm saying is casual and competitive coexist all the time in ultimate but players might not know the right way to express this point. Not even I do. If I did, I'd have all those casual guys at tournaments skying the shit out of dudes and surprising opponents. But they just don't want to, which is really the only difference between them and myself. I'm not sure it's truly indicative of any true difference. It just kind of is and I don't think you or I should read into as much as we are or other people have in the past.

There's no reason every Ultimate player shouldn't coexist. I've got a lot of people's backs only because they fed me or let me sleep on their floor once.

Without me getting into why this is built this way, here's how to go about it.

You need to add your images in two places (two separate movieclips).

Create a keyframe at the end of the image sequence that's in place under these two moviclips:

""12"" and ""pics_alone7"" (without quotes)

to add an image, once you import it into your library, drag it to the stage with your appropriate keyframe selected.

you'll need to add stop actions above those images. - bring up the actionscript menu (F9) and put in:

    stop();

you need to then change the actionscript in ""slide_play"" - on the second last frame there's a script that keeps track of how many images there are, so you need to change that number from 4 to 5 like this:

    if(num&gt;5) {
	num = 1;
	_root.gal=1;
	gotoAndStop(""s1"");

First, while many labels may be bottled at the same plant from the same 95% NGS, I can guarantee you that there isn't a single one that simply ""adds local water"" down to 80 proof then bottles it.  If they did, it would be painfully obvious (literally).  The main difference between brands is the blenders they use to attain the feel and flavor they want.  Most common is citric acid because of the Federal tax break bottlers get (FL citrus growers lobby at work).  The problem with that is when it is mixed with a cream or cream based liqueur, it curdles.  The decent vodkas (or imports, as the tax break is null anyway) will sacrifice the tax burden to use an alternative.

Second example, after blending many vodkas will charcoal filter (add charcoal dust to the blending tank then filter it out through Diatomaceous earth) while another one bottled at the same plant will not in order to keep costs low.  Is there a clear cut filtered vodka is better than non filtered?  No, but it creates a much different body, flavor and texture if you do.  It's all about personal preference of the blender or distiller.

Yes, it is possible to scientifically create a ""perfect vodka"" as you put it.  Guess what?  It tastes like shit.  Blending down vodka is what makes them all different.  I don't know where you got your information, but it is probably from a sales rep trying to get you to cut down your vodka selection in order to place his new product in.

Put any vodka in front of me, and I can tell you if it was blended down from 95% NGS from a column still, or from 100% corn in a pot still.

Having said all that, there is a ton of truth in what you are saying though.

One possible reason for this condition is referred to as ""edaphic climax.""

If you're following with classical ecological succession theory, this condition arises when there are two different conditions in a similar area so that two distinct climax communities arise.  

Since the ridge has likely differing soil type (e.g. different A-layer depth due to slope, different pH due to hydrological differences from the slope/elevation), one could expect that the communities that dominate these different areas, even though they border one another, to be quite different.

I've photographed this type of thing happening in the US as well, it is particularly evident in the early fall when the communities that dominate the top of a slope (i.e. oaks) turn color after those that dominate at the bottom of the slope (i.e. maples).

I'm sure no one will see this as there are already over 800 comments here.  But I have a story that is kind of similar.

This past fall I moved away to college, and my little sister who was 10 years old at the time was devastated that I was going to be leaving her.  We would spend a ton of time together, and I think I played the role of a big brother pretty well, I would let her paint my finger nails, and put somewhat short hair in ponytails for her amusement.  Well she made me three friendship bracelets and put them on me before I left for school, and said that I had to wear them forever so that I when I looked at them they would remind me of her.  

First couple weeks of college are going perfectly, she calls me every day sometimes every other day depending on if she was busy or not.  Well her birthday was coming up, and she called me really excited to tell me all the plans that she had for her birthday, and was talking about what we were going to do together to celebrate her birthday.  But I had to tell her that I wasn't going to be able to make it home for her birthday, as it is an eight hour drive and I had two midterms on that day, but I would come home two days later and spend the weekend with her.  She couldn't understand why I wasn't able to make it home for her actual birthday, and said ""You don't care about me anymore and only care about stupid school"" and hung up.  She didn't call back the next day which I was expecting as she was pretty upset with me.  

Well three days later I got a call from my parents telling me that while my sister was getting a ride home from school with a friend, someone ran a red light, t-boned the car, and my sister died on impact.  

This absolutely devastated me, to think that my last conversation with the person that I was closest to and loved the most ended on a horrible note, and that she died while being mad at me was the worst thing ever.  And truth be told, I still can't accept that, it still hurts just as much 6 months later as the day that the accident happened.

But I still have these friendship bracelets that she made for me, whenever I'm feeling down I just kind of rub my thumb over them as a way of being close to her again.

Before joining the military I thought it was some kind of legitimate higher calling, on some level, now I couldn't be more bitter about it.

Thoughts of suicide are a combination of the reality of what they make us do, and the drilled in notion that we have no recourse, that no one is on our side, that we'll get in trouble if we report anything, or that things will just get worse in some way or another, so we just have to suffer through.

I was specifically told by my senior leadership that if I believe an order to be unlawful, I have to do it anyway and then I can argue my case, and this was reinforced by just about everyone around me save for people who had not been fully indoctrinated.

True,CalvinDehaze,,,"Too many, so here's a list.
  
- My grandmother was coaching my 3 year old sister to say ""daddy plays with my pee pee"" so that my mom would get everything in the divorce. I was 8 at the time, and my stepdad, (in a last ditch effort to not get thrown in jail), insisted that she was saying ""Danny"", not ""Daddy"". Next thing you know, there's two cops at my door, putting me in handcuffs and asking me questions on the front lawn for everyone to see. My mom let them do it because (as you'll soon read), she thought I was out of control. When she found out that it was my grandma doing it, the charges against my step-dad were dropped, she got nothing in the divorce, and I didn't get an apology until decades later.
- I had really bad teeth that I always got made fun of. I envied kids who had braces because we were poor and couldn't afford them. My mom married her second husband, but they didn't have a wedding. A year later, they get a fat tax return check, and my mom told me they were going to use it for braces. Even buying me a water-pik. Well, my step-dad decided that since it was his tax return, he wanted to spend it on a wedding party. I didn't realize until later in life that this was the reason why I didn't get braces. They got a divorce two years later, and I'm 33 with braces on my teeth.
- My mom abused me throughout most of my childhood. Beating me for not washing the dishes correctly, bad grades, anything my sister did, etc. The beatings went from spanks, to full on anger infused tirades where she would smack the belt across the back of my head so that the tip would hit my face, or would be kicking me on the ground while forcing me to do push-ups so I could ""be a man"". The thing about this was that I was getting bigger, and the more she hit me, the more I got used to it, so she decided to up the game. Her 2nd husband offered to take over the beatings, and she obliged. He started with a back brush, which split my ass open and I started to bleed everywhere. Blaming the injury on a pattern carved into the back of the brush, he changed to a brass ruler. One day I was caught forging my mom's name on a report card, and was beat so severely that I started to shit on myself. I yelled this out and my mom came rushing in, telling my step-dad ""if he shits in his wounds, we'll have to take him to the hospital and we'll be charged with child abuse."" All this time, she was convincing me that what I was experiencing was not abuse. That SHE was abused when she was a kid, not me. I hated her for this admission for years.
  
There's many more, but it's late. I hate to tell these stories because the people who did this to me are not bad people, they just made bad choices. I wrote this here because there seems to be many stories like this out there, and I want Reddit to know that a child could go through horrible things like this, and still be okay when they grow up. After years of healing, and my mom apologizing for what she did, I've forgiven her and she's my mom again. I talk to my step-dads every once in a while, since they are the fathers of my brother and sister, and I completely forgive them.
  
I'll tell these stories over and over because I want people in similar situations to know they are worth something. I've spent most of my young life feeling worthless, because everyone that I loved treated me like I was, and even when I was in foster homes the state treated me like I was worthless. This sunk deep into my core, where even something like brushing my teeth didn't seem worth it. Having confidence in myself didn't seem worth it. Chasing my dreams didn't seem worth it. Why me? Even my mom treats me like shit, so I must be shit. Well, I'm not shit, and neither are you. My mom loved me, but in an awful way, and the only way I saw that was when I forgave her, and allowed myself to understand her.

True,southernCD,,,"I am also trans, and intend on getting SRS and everything at some point too, so maybe I can shed some light on this.

I would certainly tell whoever I was dating, before we had sex, but I have two problems with your wording.

&gt; I would vomit

To say that implies that you are revolted by the idea of being with a trans person, and quite frankly, that's extremely insulting, you could certainly word that better. But whatever, I can get past that, the bigger issue is with this:

&gt; a ""girl"" I loved

Why the quotes? We are women, no quotes needed. I have identified as female from the age of 3 years old, basically since the time I was forming conscious memories. Again, your lack of respect for trans people is evident in your wording. 

Secondly, I can't help it if you fall in love with me. I pass 100%, as do many trans women, and you would never know that I was trans just by looking at me. Once I finish transition, my final goal is to model for a life drawing class with my new body. So the fact is, you really wouldn't know until I told you, or until you got super up close in my business. Beyond that, I assure you I won't just be randomly telling people that are interested in me. I have to know that I can trust you with my most personal details before I will reveal them to you, because you could ruin the whole stealth thing if you decided to be an asshole about it. I assure you that we wouldn't get that far if you were so openly transphobic, but understand why that information isn't necessarily revealed on the first, second, third, or even later dates.

I liken it a lot like someone that has been raped. Is it important for them to reveal that information to their SO? Probably, but what if they don't reveal it before, say, the first time you have sex. Would you be taken aback that you weren't told before then? Probably not. So, yes, I am trans, it's an unfortunate part of my life, and I wish that I would have been born a girl instead, but whatever, that's not how it happened, but I fully identify as a woman now, and I'm working to make all the parts match. If I choose to share that information with you, you should feel honored, not feel like you want to ""vomit.""

So, you don't want to date a trans woman, fine, I can respect that, and like I said, if we started dating, and I found that out later, I would quietly cut my losses and break up with you, and you would never be any wiser. I suspect that OP has told her SO, if they've been together 5 years, I find it highly unlikely that they have known for less than 4-4.5 years. 

But seriously, your wording is super disrespectful, and it would mean a lot to me if you educated yourself some, and tried to be a bit more respectful. We have a hard enough time as is. ",0,1363761084,,0,False,1,c8yzi2b,t3_1amnsj,t1_c8yzi2b,t1_c8yyl9i,,1431643451,76,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,76
True,JubilationLee,,Card expert - Magic:The Gathering,"Uh.. Dude. That binder is probably with tens of thousands of dollars.   

**edit 1:** ok. For real, that binder is worth at least 20-25 grand retail. If this isn't staged, you basically found one of the best hidden magic the gathering collections of all time. I am being completely serious. I would have literally fallen over and passed out. Probably peed myself a little.   

I want to believe so bad. This is a dream for a lot of people. Please be gentle with those cards, though. Please please please please  

**edit 2:** man. I know it's 3 am. But I really wish I knew how to contact you. Maybe you're on reddit right now. I don't know. I am so fucking excited for you, though. And jealous. I have been playing magic since the game came out 20 years ago. What you have in that binder would rival all but the largest retailers in the US as far as expensive older cards. I watched it a few more times and a conservative it's-3-am-and-i'm-half-asleep estimate would be about $28,000-$32,000 (retail, you could probably get 70-80% for 3/4 of the cards in there). Please PLEASE be gentle with those cards. Not only is that a substantial amount of money, but that stuff just isn't out there much anymore. You found history. A very meaningful binder of treasures. I'm not gonna lie, I thought about making you an offer on it of around $10k, but that would be a shitty thing to do. You deserve to upgrade your house, get a new car, whatever.  

I'm rambling like an idiot now because I am this excited. Man. I don't even know what to say. Congrats though. You've got the most expensive personal collection I've ever seen. If you have any questions, as in how to move those, value, etc.: please pm me. I'm happy to help.   

**edit 3:** **DON'T OPEN THE PACKS OF CARDS OR THE STARTER DECKS IF THEY'RE COMPLETELY SEALED.** The legends packs are between $75-$100 a piece and the unlimited decks .. I .. man. Several hundred a piece.  

**edit 4:** I'm working on a spreadsheet, based on near-mint values of the cards I can make out in the video because I am neurotic and can't sleep and have to know how close my estimate was. Will update  

**edit 5:** holy flying sheep dicks, I am really kind of proud of my initial guess up there, the total of the cards I could make out from binder in the video above, at current retail (starcitygames.com) prices, assuming everything is near-mint, and all the (alpha/OR/beta) cards are Beta, is **$32,358** (for the fellow MTG folks, I know that is a LOT of assumptions, but we are ball-parking from a time trial, potato-cam video here after an all-nighter, cut a brother some slack)  

here's a spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ai8tOGnVZ6ogdEtsYVVEZVZOd1h0WEZNUnNTaWl5QWc&amp;amp;usp=sharing  

The thing about some of those cards is that the difference between the editions can make a fairly significant impact on the price. The difference between alpha and beta is something that can't really be judged via paused phone-recorded video. It is absolutely necessary to find it out though, whether you're going to part with any of this or not. You don't want to sell yourself short here. I hope the spreadsheet helps! it's nap time!  

**edit 6:** Holy crap, reddit gold (thank you random internet stranger!), bestof'd, AND we broke googledocs! Yay team!  

For those saying this collection is worth more than $32k, you're absolutely right. At 5am, I just wanted to get something in a spreadsheet for OP to reference and went with the video above, I realize there are two other videos, but this should give OP the idea that this is an extremely valuable collection.  That's not even counting the black cards at the beginning (no idea) and the artwork. 

For those saying selling this is won't get much, it totally depends. If you took this collection to a local game store and presented it to them with the intent to sell, one of two things would happen: 1) you'd get lowballed to all hell or 2) you'd get told to sell it elsewhere because they don't have enough money to pay for it. Either way, it would be neat to see the visible duress on the face of whomever looked through the binder. The secondary market for MtG is very much alive and well and, as I mentioned, these cards are a part of history.  A near-mint beta black lotus sold on ebay 3 days ago for $4,482.00. Granted, ebay takes 10% and paypal another 4%, but you still get the gist. To the right people, through the right medium, OP stands to make an astronomical amount of money from a safe he believed had nothing in it.

For those who have asked me to price things: First and foremost, please don't get your hopes up to this level though: the odds of you having something that rivals this binder are probably right up there with getting struck by lightning. **I will be happy to look at cards for you if you PM me some clear photos** (thanks to the one user who did, I'll have a look this afternoon and get back to you!). It was really fun to actually do this her. As an avid collector and player, it makes me feel good to know that we actually have found some more of these rare cards, notwithstanding OP will be able to buy a boat. Every year, the supply for ultra old stuff like this dwindles. As far as ""I have a box of cards, what do you think?,"" it's impossible to tell what something is actually worth without seeing the cards themselves. For those curious, [Ark42](http://ark42.com/mtg/pricelist.php) has a price list that updates retail value when you refresh the page. You can sort the price list at the top, it starts at  [ Alpha - Revised ] and goes in chronological order to the right to the newest sets released. Each set in here has the set symbol next to the name, and every card that is worth more than $1 is listed. For a list of set symbols see [this page at Wizards of the Coast](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Article.aspx?x=magic/rules/faqs). Once you know what you have, have a look on ebay for the higher dollar cards. Or find a local game store via [the wizards store locator](http://locator.wizards.com/) and get back out there and play! :)

**NOTE TO OP:** It may behoove you to look at getting some of these cards graded professionally by [Beckett](http://www.beckett.com) or [PSA](http://www.psacard.com/) -- older cards that are in 'good' condition to the untrained eye (ie, not bent, no water damage, nice corners, not a lot of whitening around the edges, etc) that are graded can fetch SIGNIFICANTLY higher prices (see: Black Lotus, Mox [jet/emerald/ruby/sapphire/pearl] and any of the black bordered dual lands there, specifically Volcanic Island]. For comparison, you could go to Wal-mart or Target and grab a booster pack of magic: the gathering cards. The cards that come out of the pack are, 99.99% of the time, in near-mint condition. If any of the cards that I mentioned above or are in the spreadsheet for over $500 are even close to near-mint condition, getting them graded will increase their value.  

**FINAL EDIT** apparently we have been had, thanks to thekidd142 for his awesome detective work.

Let me guess, you aren't a Magic player? I creamed myself when I saw this. There is easily $50k USD in the first binder.

I have been in the Magic: the gathering buying and selling business for over 15 years. Best advice about this: **DO NOT SELL THESE TO A DEALER!!** They will talk you down and rip you off. You will need to put 75% of the cards in the first binder (with VERY clean and careful hands) in toploaders with sleeves and individually ebay them.

Go to starcitygames.com so you can get an idea of what these magic cards are worth, and subtract about 15%. I can easily tell you that the each Mana Drain is ~$100....and there is ~25 of them. Whoever said that Beta is more valuable hasn't sold Magic: The gathering in years. Alpha, which has more rounded corners, are worth around 20% more than Beta, since there are significantly less of them. Are those tournament boxes of Unlimited sealed? They, too, are worth a fortune.

What game do you plan on running that needs 1gig per character? You could probably turn down graphics way down on all other clients and get more for your money

This is a quick pick, and there's a combo on the CPU+motherboard for a small discount.

The ram you could probably go cheaper on lowering down to 16gigs cutting price by a lot, but you said 18-24 characters and 1gig per character.

True,LondonPilot,,,"Pilot here.

Some people have an irrational fear of flying. If that's you, I could describe in as much detail as I like how safe flying is, and it probably wouldn't help you. There are ""fear of flying"" courses you can attend which *can* help. They typically involve spending some time understanding some of the technical aspects of what's happening, talking to pilots and air traffic controllers, and then going on a short flight, with *incredibly* understanding flight attendants who will help explain what's happening, what all the noises mean, and so on.

Since you specifically asked why you should trust the mechanics, it may be that in your case, your fear isn't totally irrational, but is based on a lack of understanding of flight and aeroplanes, in which case the following will help:

First of all, understand that aeroplanes naturally *want* to fly. The wings are designed to keep the aircraft in the air. The tail is designed to keep the aircraft going straight. The engines aren't even needed for flying - they're just needed to get into the air, and to maintain speed and height. If all the engines stopped, however unlikely that may be, you'd be left with a big glider. One of the few examples of this was the US Airways flight which landed safely in the Hudson after both engines stopped, resulting in zero injuries. The crew did a brilliant job, but the aeroplane was designed to fly, and that's why it was able to fly to a safe splash-down.

Having said that, there are certain items which are important in aeroplanes, and yes, engines are one of them. So are flight control systems. And autopilots. All airliners have duplicates of these systems, so that if there is a problem with one, the others can carry on working. A typical airliner will have two engines, three hydraulic systems that are used for moving the control surfaces, and three autopilots. If anything does fail, there will be a backup system to take over.

Finally, there's the safety culture that exists within aviation. We all make mistakes from time to time. If we make a mistake driving, we usually forget about it and move on. If the mistake results in an accident, we deny it. In aviation, the opposite is true. When mistakes occur, pilots, engineers, and everyone else in aviation is actively encouraged to report it. Reports are regularly published so that everyone else can learn from them. That means that flying gets safer and safer as we all learn from previous mistakes, and change our procedures to ensure we don't repeat them.

It's because of all these things that commercial flying is consistently the safest way, statistically, to get around.

I hope that helps, but please do ask if there's anything else you want to know.

True,plasticmice,,,"I doubt anyone will see this now that the thread is 7000 comments strong and 11 hours old. But here it is anyway.

I'm 31 years old and I have been lying ever since I have been capable of speech. From my youngest of memories until 10/11 years old, I was molested by my father. Everyday he would hurt me, physically and mentally. So would his friends. It became routine - normal. It only stopped because my Mother and Father split. We went away to a refuge for battered and frightened women and I spent the next few years getting bounced around different schools. 

I was not allowed to tell anyone where I lived, because refuges are protected places. So I would create fanciful lies. Lies about my parents, about how lovely my life was, how we moved around a lot due to my parents' jobs. Kids aren't daft however. And I guess I was just seen as a fantasist by many. I was a loner for a long time.

I constantly tried to run away, and was even featured in a local newspaper once, when I was found with my teddy bear clutched by my side and a homemade sign saying please take me, whilst I was stood in the central reservation of the motorway.

I tried to kill myself. Several times. My private joke is that I even fail at death, which always raises a macabre smile from me. I tried taking a bottle of paracetamol, with a bottle of Baileys, one Christmas. 'Friends' found me; called an ambulance and I got my stomach pumped. I write 'friends' because the worthless asshole that found me was fucking my live in other half at the time. 

Another time, I decided to jump in front of a train. I walked for a good hour or so along a train line until I found an out of the way bridge; climbed over the fence and sat there a while getting upset and waiting for a damn train. But then I started to think about the driver and how fucking selfish it would be to possibly fuck up his job/life and I wussed out. 

To segue nicely into my next paragraph from the last; all of my relationships have been train-wrecks (badum-tssh). The vast majority of them have just given up on me because I am fucking impossible when I dip into my dark moods. I have never cared for any of them enough to tell of my darkest memories, and the reasons for why I am the way I am. And so I just lie. 

I've tried nearly every type of anti-depressant there is. I've talked to people - but not really. I've never actually told a therapist about my childhood. I gloss over it. I cannot talk of it. Because I have held that door shut for a very long time; and when I slip, and it opens; the anger, violence, sadness and madness spills all over the place and there is fucking nothing that I can do to contain it. In fact it is fair to say that no-one frightens me more than I do.

Recently, the door was pretty heavily slammed open, and I am a fucking wreck. I spend my days having imaginary conversations with people who have hurt me. I scream, shout, rant and fucking yell until I go hoarse. I imagine beating the living fuck out of them until they breathe their last breath. I feel a terrible power in those moments. But then I remember that it's all just in the playground of my mind and the crushing anxiety attacks, breathlessness, and general fear and mistrust of the world and everyone within it comes right back.

However; were you to ask the folks I work with what they thought of me; they would paint a very different picture. I am the model employee. I work fucking hard, and am respectful of others. I am funny, charming and personable. I'm the person people come to for advice. But this is a smokescreen. I spend my days being a different person. Perhaps it is the person I would like to be. I don't know. Maybe I am being a person I feel that others would be most comfortable with. One thing I do know is that I should win Oscars for my portrayal of a human being that is not even remotely like myself.

Things are coming to a head. Soon something bad is going to happen. And it will be me that makes it happen. The fact that I know this and am absolutely powerless to stop it terrifies me. Not least because part of me welcomes it. 

To the two redditors who have scrolled this far and actually read this - thank you.

True,megispj89,,,"I started finally gaining ground on my depression when I realized I do have some say in how I feel. I still have it, and it still sucks, but there are days when I can choose how bad it sucks.

Some tips I learned:

1. Always, ALWAYS keep in mind things are situational. When days were shit storms that I couldn't control, always reminding myself that ""the situation sucks, not me, not life, the situation."" Remembering that it will pass helps. 

2. Letting it go. When it's not your problem, it is not your problem. My dad hates his life because he keeps grudges. That seems so exhausting to me. I was raised by an abusive, neglectful woman, things got better when I realized I couldn't change her. I find a lot of depressed folks dwell on the bad, 1 &amp; 2 help that.

3. Rule 76, play like a champion, no excuses. I don't care if the last thing you want to do is get out of bed in the morning, get out and go hard in the paint. Go hard because you tell yourself to. If you have no reason to, make one up. In the same vein, you are hereby forbidden to make an excuse for anything. Own up to your work, good or bad.

4. If you are in control, seize it. If you have the option to be a leader,do it. The more practice you have at controlling your situation, the more you can control yourself. 

4 years ago I. Wrote a suicide letter and lived a lonely, sad life. I had to take control. These steps helped me get to a point where I'm ok. I fall down, but I pick myself up. I'm now a leader in my college campus, I have a meager, but good social life.  Every therapist I had always told me that depression was fixed/managed by training your mind, I didn't believe them until I cowboyed up and decided I was going to do it. It's exhausting.

For instance, you hear every bird chirp, every conversation in a large crowd, etc., your brain just filters it out and throws away the memory.

What's happening here is you did hear what they said to an extent, you just didn't pay enough attention to commit it to short term memory. Once you say ""what?"" it's almost like you're kicking your brain on to listen, and it will retrieve that information that's still in the 2-3 seconds of sensory memory and commit it to short-term.

True,Infrmnt,,,"When you miss your lecture and decide to listen to the online recording instead - I'm the guy who the university sends the online recording to, so I can make it sound nice, add compression, equalize it properly, make sure it's mono, remove pops/crackles and so on.

Edit: Thanks a lot for the Reddit gold, very kind.
I recieved a large amount of comments and PMs with similar questions in them, so I'll answer them here-

I make it mono because it's recorded in mono but then often saved as stereo with the mono signal panned entirely left or right, I cannot explain this, it's just dumb people higher up than me in the chain rendering it this way. So, when I get it, I make it proper mono. This also helps cut down on file size for students when they download it, because a mono render will be much smaller than a stereo render, and it really won't make a big difference on a spoken word file. On a side note - most major label vocal main-takes and such are recorded in mono too, it just seems to be what you do with vox.

As for tools I use to make it sound good, I get rid of hissing and background noise by using excessive additive equalization with a narrow eq Q (bandwith) to find the part in the spectrum that is causing trouble, and then once I've got it sounding as bad and isolated as possible, I turn the volume on the EQ notch all the way down to -64 ish, to cut out the annoying noise as much as possible.

If (and this does happen on rare occasions) the annoying background noises and hissing sounds and so on are in a frequency that is helping the actual lecturer's voice be heard a lot (some of the lower vocal harmonics for instance), then I'll tend to use a gater instead so that the audio goes silent when the speaker isn't talking. This can make a huge difference.

Other than that, just light compression and using basic volume automation to get minimalize pops and stuff. I tend not to use one of those audacity style sound-noise profile removers as they can be pretty ruthless and remove a lot of the good content you actually want in the persons voice. Especially when the file is 2 hours+ long and a really important lecture. You don't want that happening! Those noise profile remover things are better for shorter audio clips.

And for the final question, I got into the job because I'm a student at the uni, and during my honours year I made a film project that had great audio in it, and my professor noticed it and wanted me to work for him on this stuff. I already had 10+ years experience doing audio privately in my bedroom, it has been a long time obsession of mine. So anyway, I stayed on to do a law degree after finishing my bachelors, and I got offered a job by the professors and associate professors, to do sound for them on all sorts of things. Right now I'm helping produce video lectures for arts undergrads for instance, that they can download off the LMS portal and play. It may not occur to some of you, but if you work hard at uni in something that they might need, they WILL employ you! It's an ideal job to have while I'm a student, well paid and not too time consuming.

Also, having my music played on national radio, and having an EP that went to number 1 on beatport certainly helped in getting this position! Anything sound related that can boost your portfolio will help put you above other candidates for sure.

Miyazaki: The directorial mastermind behind Studio Ghibli.

Ozu: Neorealist Japanese director who shot mainly black and white simple stories, delicately told. Tokyo Story is his best known work.

Haneke: A dark writer whose work involves a great deal of social commentary. All his works are similar, though Amour or The White Ribbon may be good starting points.

Wong Kar Wai: Explores many genres and made many accessible works. Chungking Express is his masterpiece, Ashes of Time would interest anyone attracted to the idea of an arthouse Wuxia film, and 2046 is the final part of a collection of his, an arthouse romance with sciencefiction elements.

Fellini: 8 1/2 is his best known work, an experimental, funny meta-film.

Tarkovsky: Solaris. The Mirror. Stalker.

Bergman: Quite an experimental director who used a great deal of symbolism in his films. The Seventh Seal is probably his most famous work, though Fanny And Alexander might be his most critically referenced.

True,lhwang0320,,,"OP, I actually have the same condition as you. It took me 5 years to get it treated properly, but I finally found a urologist and physical therapist who have been able to help me. 

Here are some tips. I'm no doctor, but I've lived this condition since I was 22, and I'm now 29. The 5 years leading up to my proper diagnosis and treatment were some of the darkest of my life. But you can regain control of this condition (maybe not a ""cure"") but it is very manageable. 

1.To get you started, I would recommend that you read ""A Headache in the Pelvis,"" (http://www.amazon.com/Headache-Pelvis-New-Expanded-Understanding/dp/0972775552). This book was a real eye opener for me, and a bible in terms of treatment methodologies and understanding this condition. 

2. Familiarize yourself with the ""Wise-Anderson Protocol"" that is mentioned in the book. 

3. Find a urologist and mention this book. Apparently the authors of this book are a huge deal in the field of urology. Any decent doc should know who they are.

4. Request a prescription for a ""Pelvic Floor Physical Therapist."" Most hospitals have them, and a good one will be able to help you out. 

5. See if you need an antidepressant of some sort. A lot of the pain and muscle tension associated with this condition is related to anxiety/depression. It's a nasty cycle--each one makes the other worse. You get anxious about your pain, which causes tension in your muscles, so on and so forth. 

That's all I have for now. If you wanna PM and chat more, let me know. 

Be strong, OP. your condition is treatable, and not as rare as your doctors may have led you to believe.

I'm 45 now and still have a 3"" three-ring binder full of poetry I wrote in high school. The title page has a ghastly, self-absorbed verse I wrote, which I shudder even now to remember, but it honestly represented who I was then. Am I proud of it? No. Do I hate it? Never!

I still have the first short story I wrote in high school, the songs I wrote in college, essays I wrote for competitions, editorials I wrote for corporate and commercial newspapers, technical reports that I wrote for work, blog entries about my technical interests. All of them are part of me, of who I was and am. And all of them are bad.

In some of them, I feel like I am looking at the picture of my middle school years, with a snaggletooth smile and unruly hair. Later ones remind me of my long-haired glamour shots taken when I was in modeling school in the 90s. (Seriously.) Others make me recall how it felt to grow a paunch along with my business, supported by my wife and family.

Now that I am old, I am writing fiction again. There are stories once more that keep me awake at night, just like when I was young. Some early mornings I wake with a flash of an idea, of how something I mentioned in an off-hand way sets up a perfect surprise to make the friends who read my stories feel a kind of frisson as it is revealed. And it is all uniformly, unashamedly bad.

I am not a good writer. So bad, in fact, that I sometimes mine TV Tropes for bad ideas to try. I play, and experiment, and practically roll around in my badness, I squish it through my fingers and serve it with a smile to anyone willing to let me in their brains for a read.

Wow thank you for gold dear Internet person. 

TL;DR: I know its long just read it sorry its a lot of a story. Also sorry if grammar of spelling sucks.


Its a long weird story but here goes.
When I was little before the age of 6 my biological mother did not make the best choices in men to bring around so my experiences were pretty rough. During that time I had an older cousin who would come and pick me up and take me to do things like movies, ice cream, shopping, etc. He was like a big brother to me more than anything.


Well when he started dating his now wife she would come too and after they got married I would stay the night with them and she would buy me clothes and toys. All the while I was getting abused physically, mentally and sexually while living with my bio mother and her new husband. I was also having to make sure that a finger wasn't laid on my little sister but luckily since she was my step-father's flesh and blood he didn't touch her ever.


When I was 6 years old my biological mother had asked my cousins if I could live with them for a year while she moved from California to Arizona and then after that year she would pick me back up. About 3 months into that year she quit calling, sending cards or trying to make any contact. Around 6 months into the year I finally shared with my cousins that I didn't want to go back with her because of what was happening.


They contacted CPS in the state we lived in and I shared what had happened, they drew up papers for my cousins to be my legal guardians and kinship foster family because my bio mom hadn't done that, she legally abandoned me. When it was time for her to pick me up a year later my cousins, a state worker and a few other people showed up at the airport but she never showed. The state hired PI to try to find her and lawyers to terminate her rights. I told my cousins at that point I wanted to live with them forever and they started the adoption.


The whole adoption took about 3.5 years because of investigators, court dates, and a whole slew of other things I was young so I don't remember much other than a nice paralegal giving me chocolate cake. A few years ago I was going into a Wal-Mart to get some things for my boss to set up at a Farmer's market and as I rounded the corner on one of the aisles I came face to face with my biological mother. I was so scared I covered my face and ran out. Every week for 6 weeks I went to that Wal-Mart and walked up to the door and then back to my car before I got the courage to go in and confront her. I had spent many years going through anger, depression, and other issues because of her abuse and abandonment. The day I went in she was actually off work so I left my business card for her to call me.


The only reason I wanted her to call is I had left my little sister behind all those years ago. The next day she called me and the first thing I found out was my little sister hadn't been adopted out (she was the only one, my older sister had been adopted as well). I found out that my little sister was working at a pizza place and I could even see her that day. For several months I tried to rebuild and forgive my bio mom because I just wanted to move past it all but I couldn't and she had made up this story in her mind I had been kidnapped.


About 2 years ago I had to cut off contact with everyone including my little sister because being around her and having her try to reconnect my bio mom and I was to trying on my mind. Over this last Christmas I got an email from my little sister and she told me that my bio mom had finally admitted the truth to her and because of it she has minimized contact to holidays and she understands why I can't have contact with our mother. I am able to have a relationship with my little sister and trust my bio mom won't be a part of it. Today she sent me these pictures because I didn't have any before the adoption.",0,1363807360,,0,1363870844,1,c8za0oz,t3_1aobzy,t1_c8za0oz,t3_1aobzy,,1431648550,61,False,pics,t5_2qh0u,61

True,Hobojoejunkpen,,,"5 years in the Marines as enlisted. **Here is what I got out of it**:

-Total compensation of about $120,000/year when I factor in money (base pay, housing allowance, food allowance) and benefits (post-9/11 GI bill, tricare, VA health coverage for 5 years after I'm out) If I added the value of some of my training, would put the number closer to $150,000/year, but that's much harder to quantify.

-The best friends I have ever had and probably will ever have. This includes a network of friends all over the country that I can stay with whenever I want.

-The best times (hence stories) I have ever had and probably will ever have.

-A resume booster that gets my foot in the door of a lot of places.

-I was able to get into a school that I maybe could not have right out of HS because I didn't care about grades.

-I gained a whole lot of confidence and social dexterity from the experience. My communication and teamwork skills improved greatly.

-I became more of a perfectionist which given my personality was a good thing.

-I had guaranteed employment of 80k-110k out of the military from my training and contractors I forged relationships with, but I gave it up to go to college.

-A new world view which puts life and death into better perspective. Some people study this shit their whole life without actually learning anything because they haven't had experience with a large spectrum of the human experience. There's a great part in Good Will Hunting where Robin Williams (Vietnam vet) blasts Matt Damon for being able to describe the intricacies of the Sistine Chapel, but not knowing how it feels to look up at it; to be able to quote Tennyson, but unable to know how the ""Light Brigade"" felt. This aspect is hard to describe, but has significantly impacted my life for the better.

**Here's what it cost me**:

-5 years of my life that I will never get back. I will be older than all of my peers

-Possibly a ruined relationship with my wife (who I would never have been with if I hadn't served).

-A tremendous amount of latent anger that I did not have before.

-For the last 2 years of my military service this anger was much worse than it is now. It was tearing me apart and made me feel very unstable.

-An unhealthy disrespect for authority that has at times burned some bridges for me.

-I have developed a disconnect with society where my humor is often times different than what's expected. People think you're weird when you laugh about bombings, shootings, and people getting killed.

-A nicotine habit that is really not as bad as some (a pack or a tin/week). I would have never started tobacco were it not for the military.

-I'm not sure if I drink more than I would have had I just gone to college, but I drink more than I would like.

True,byu146,,,"Err... this study has a lot of problems I think to make that conclusion.

This paper only shows that people who **click** on illegal music downloading sites **click** on legal avenue sites in roughly the same, or slightly more numbers than non-pirates. In fact, it acknowledges piracy is harmful for the industry. From the paper itself:

&gt; Most studies ﬁnd that piracy harms revenues, with estimated sales displacement rate far below one. That is, music consumers are found to substitute legal music consumption for illegal music consumption, but much of what is consumed illegally would not have been purchased if piracy was not available. **There is a rather clear consensus on the negative eﬀects of online piracy on the oﬀ-line physical sales of recorded music.** Less attention has been paid, however, to the eﬀect of online illegal music consumption on the online legal sales of digital music.

They also cite other studies of online purchasing that seem to show that anti-piracy laws increase album sales:

&gt; Some researchers have used natural experiments to identify the causal eﬀect of piracy on sales. Danaher et al. (2012) use the HADOPI graduated response law in France as an exogenous shock and compare iTunes music sales in France to sales ina set of other European countries. They ﬁnd that HADOPI caused a 22.5% increase in song sales and a 25% in album sales relative to sales in the control group, which is consistent with Internet piracy displacing legal iTunes sales.

The authors state very clearly they are only considering the digital realm but, can the authors even say they were measuring online sales, and not just visits to sites? Well no.:

&gt; It is important to note that we are only able to observe the number of clicks on a given website and that we do not have a precise description of the individual behavior for each click. Rather than measuring actual consumption or purchases, our data therefore gives a measure of the propensity to consume music.

So basically, the study is saying people who visit illegal download/streaming sites, are more likely to visit legal download sites, but says nothing if any of those visits to sites result in purchases.

Here's a big glaring hodge-podge of assumptions:

&gt; In particular, we do not expect individuals to go window-shopping on legal purchas-ing websites in order to illegally download after their visit. First, information on speciﬁc albums, songs or artists can be found on other music-speciﬁc websites, so it is not clear why consumers should use legal purchasing websites for such purposes. Second, we believe information on songs’ prices to be almost perfectly known to consumers before they go on legal purchasing websites,ruling out visits solely related to price information seeking.

A lot of assumptions, no? Let's just assume that pirates act like all other visitors to legal sites otherwise our conclusions won't be as strong!

Another problem:

&gt; Our analysis is also aﬀected by another related feature of the dataset. Many large retailers such as Amazon sell, among many other things, music in digital format. Our inability to observe precise consumer behavior within each website therefore prevents us from classifying any visit on websitessuch as Amazon in a music consumption category

So if you go to a pirate site, and then to Amazon, for anything, you're counted as visiting a legal music site, which is technically true, but the purpose of your visit might have nothing to do with music at all.

Finally, this study doesn't really address the fact that the people who pirate the most are the ones with most interactions with music at all. If I never pirate and obtain 100 songs, and you pirate 20% of the time and acquire 1000 songs, you have more legal interactions as well as illegal interactions. This study is basically doing the same thing with clicks. Their conclusion:

&gt; Most interestingly, downloaders are also more active than legals both in terms of legal downloading (10% more clicks) and legal streaming (40% more clicks), as shown by their **mean values of clicks.**

Great, so people who click more on illegal sites, also click more on legal sites as well. Not surprising, people interested enough in music to setup/risk pirating are those interested enough to be clicking on legal sites as well.",0,1363810860,,0,False,1,c8zbd3c,t3_1ao7g8,t1_c8zbd3c,t3_1ao7g8,,1431649184,155,False,worldnews,t5_2qh13,155

The illegal DMCA could have been an honest mistake, everybody makes dumb mistakes once in a while. However - to actually double down on it like you do is just absurd! 

How dumb do you/your Director of PR think we are?! 

Absolutely every ""fact"" is his response is a blatant lie for Gods sake! It would be sugarcoating to call it ""spin"", it much more dishonest than that.

Let me go through it sentence by sentence to explain:

-----
&gt; The letter that was posted next to the review on DigitalRev was not sent in response to the review.

Here's a direct quote from the illegal DMCA notice you sent:

&gt;we hereby demand that Softlayer.com immediately remove or disable access to the Infringing Material at:

&gt;http://www.digitalrev.com/article/gopro-hero-3-vs-sony/Njk3MDQ3MDg_A

The only URL you demand removed (illegally btw, I'll get to that) is the exact URL to the review...

------

&gt; This letter was sent because DigitalRev is not an authorized reseller of GoPro products and they were using images and had incorrect branding and representation of our product in their online commerce store.

So since you believe that DigitalRev has some inaccuracies (which is not illegal in any way) in their web store page that you would like to correct, you send a DMCA notice to their web host demanding that a review they made of a GoPro gets taken down... That makes perfect sense (not)!

I would have started by sending them a nice email explaining how the information on the web store page could be improved, not be going totally nuclear on a completely different part of their web site (a product review) through sending an illegal DMCA notice to their web host.

But hey - that's just me..

----------

&gt; As part of our program – we ask merchants who are selling our product to use authorized images. That is why DigitalRev was contacted. 

WOW. You ""ask merchants who are selling our product to use authorized images"". REALLY, that's what this was?!

Are you seriously claiming that issuing incredibly abusive DMCA notices directly to the respective web hosts and forcing legal content to be removed through a legal loophole in the DMCA law is ""asking merchants who are selling our product to use authorized images""? 

And in what way is sending a DMCA takedown notice to Softlayer.com ""contacting DigitalRev""?!

---------

&gt; But – our letter did not clearly communicate this and that is something we will correct.

The DMCA letter was actually extremely clear:

&gt; We have a good faith belief that the Internet site found at digitalrev.com infringes the rights of the Company by using the following trademarks of the Company:

Based upon information at its disposal on digitalrev.com, we believe that the statements in this notice are accurate and correctly describe the infringing nature and status of the Infringing Material.

You've already tried, but there's really no plausible way to twist this to mean anything other than what it says. It's completely obvious what it actually means. 

DigitalRev is ""infringing on the rights of the Company by using the GoPro and Hero trademarks without authorization on http://www.digitalrev.com/article/gopro-hero-3-vs-sony/Njk3MDQ3MDg_A and we demand that the page should be removed/disabled immediately"" is what the notice says.

-------

Even worse than the incredibly dishonest response by GoPro above is the illegal (ab)use of the DMCA (Digital Millennium *Copyright* Act) to take down sites due to supposed trademark infractions. Trademarks are not the subject of DMCA protection, see: https://www.eff.org/wp/unsafe-harbors-abusive-dmca-subpoenas-and-takedown-demands. 

This is even crazier though, since even if the DMCA actually had applied to trademark infringement - there wouldn't be any of it here. If DigitalRev Inc had registered goprohero3review.com there would be, but mentioning a product name in a review is not ""use of a mark in commerce."", as is required by the law in order for there to be trademark infringement.

True,Daps27,,,"I work in the engineering field and their are few women you encounter professionally and in academia, it's a shame because I've come across some brilliant female engineers. In undergrad it wouldn't be surprising to see 1 female in a classroom of 25 to 30.  I work in manufacturing and the jokes, puns, and witty remarks are 99% in bad taste - and I'm sure that's due mainly from a male dominated working environment. I went to a all boys military school, spent years in the military and it has always been the same type of crass language and rhetoric. Some guys don't know how to turn it off. The only similar situation is that I have a friend who is gay, and while I know he doesn't care for it sometimes the word ""fag"" comes out in routine conversation at the bar or hanging out. Never in the context where I'm making fun of homosexuals, but just like ""Lebron is such a fag"" - meaning a douche or a harley-davidson owner. I always catch myself and say ""shit, sorry"" and I legitimately feel bad when it happens, because I understand what's he's been through and what that word means to him. But it just comes out nonetheless. He always laughs and says it's ok, but I know it's just the fact that I recognize it's not cool with him - that I'm trying to respect him as a friend that he's willing to let a couple of those slip out. I have lots of women friends as well but they're usually even more vulgar then my male friends. I know this isn't always the case. But what I'm trying to convey is that people will try to change their habits when they know it's offending someone. But it isn't always easy to be aware of what is going to offend someone...

Women are persecuted around the world in ways men will never understand. I've seen it with my own eyes in the middle east, but the idea that complacency can destroy your life is so unsettling. I experienced this in the military 10 fold but the fear of getting in trouble with a female co-worker could sometimes just be a black hole for moral. Not because a man was afraid of a women working along side him, but just not knowing what is appropriate and what isn't. This idea of ""self-awareness"" is just a mask for extortion. How can a company, unit, group of friends ever work together if you can't be upfront with what offends you and what is appropriate. Obviously it isn't universal or these two guys would still have their jobs - they were just two older programming nerds with families acting like nerds at a professional seminar. She could have confronted them before posting their picture for 9000 of her followers, she could have just said anything to these guys and they would have stopped. They would have recognized that something they couldn't find inappropriate was in fact offending someone. And if they didn't stop she and everyone else in that forum would have been validated in their reasoning to defame and bring attention to them.  But she decided to publicly humiliate these two, while acting like a victim. 

Look through some of her twitter comments and there are dozens of questionable crass innuendos. She stated that she had a rough month, she was tired and ""had enough"". This women wasn't a victim, she was just cranky and decided a good way to take out her frustrations was to ruin two lives. She wasn't being persecuted, she was annoyed..  I'm not sure she knew at the time the severity of what she was doing, but 9000 followers on twitter is enough to cause quite a stir. It's just sick that she follows it up by stating ""now they can't hide behind the anonymity of a crowd"" while she's seeking approval from thousands of her own internet followers. Just speaks volumes about this lady.. Couldn't just turn around and say ""could you two stop, I'm offended by your language"" - who's hiding behind a group of people if her only validity comes from the thousands she interacts with on a constant basis over twitter?? It's hypocritical. I hope everything turns out well for these two guys. I would hope there is some sort of case for a lawsuit - defamation of some sort. 

I think gender equality is important, but as much as I hate to generalize this ""self-awareness"" idea is just a slippery slope to something dangerous. Mediation needs to be involved in these type of situations or else you're just sweeping things under the rug and creating anger/resentment, and misconception. Men should always try to be respectful, but I feel like this is a perfect example when sometimes there is a legitimate misconception of what is and what isn't appropriate. It reminds me of the Tom Brady skit on SNL. 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=gBVuAGFcGKY#! 
How is a guy supposed to know what's appropriate and what isn't? There should be far more validity in this type of questioning.

True,okp11,,,"**I meant to post this a few days ago as a self post but I'll just leave this here:**

I see people asking these questions all the time: ""What happened to all the SSD sales?"" ""Why is RAM more expensive now than 6 months ago?""

The answer? Both DRAM and NAND are both experiencing pretty substantial price increases. Flash memory is in short supply right now so demand is exceeding supply. 

[Here is an illustration of MLC's price trends over the past year](http://www.xbitlabs.com/images/news/2013-02/dramexchange_nand_price_trend_feb2013_2a.png). Its pretty apparent that during august/september when MLC was at its low we were also experiencing the massive influx of SSD sales. 

As for DRAM prices they [have been steadily going up for months now](http://www.dramexchange.com/WeeklyResearch/Post/2/3317.html). This is an extremely rare occurrence because over the last few years DDR2/3 have done nothing but go down(while being massively produced that is). This is due largely to the lesser demand for desktop PCs. It doesnt help either that the DRAM market has been consolidated down to a select few manufacturers which has greatly affected prices. Unfortunately, [DRAM prices are not expected to go back down anytime soon](http://www.pcworld.com/article/2030225/prices-of-dram-expected-to-stabilize-nand-to-fall.html). 

So what does this mean for PC builders? A few things.

**1.** RAM sales are going to be sparse. [The cheapest 8GB 4x2 kit on newegg is over $50 right now](http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&amp;N=100007611%20600006069&amp;IsNodeId=1&amp;name=8GB%20%282%20x%204GB%29). Back about 3-4 months ago sales like [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcsales/comments/13u83m/ram_patriot_viper_8gb2x4_1600_memory_1999_after/) were the norm. I'm not saying you should jump at every RAM sale you see...but im not saying you shouldnt.

**2.** It is likely that SSD prices will start back in a downward trend. Micron, Samsung, Toshiba, and Hynix(aka the 4 companies who make 99% of the NAND that goes in SSDs) all have had great quarters so far and that is expected to trickle down to SSD manufacturers. It may take a while for these prices to get to the end-user but alas they will come.

**3.** If the trend in DRAM prices continues DDR4 is going to be very expensive. Haswell EX(server/enterprise socket) will support DDR4 so realistically DDR4 DIMMS could be widely available very soon. However, we are still 2 sockets away from supporting DDR4 on consumer motherboards so we will likely be stuck with DDR3 for a few more years.

The reality is that you can't become a real part of the community until you become a real part of the community.  The community communicates via email, sometimes blogs (sailblogs.com I think is a common place) and VHF (short range for the local community) and SSB radio (world wide communications).  They call their radio meetups ""nets"" and you can get the frequencies from the magazines or your local cruisers.

Meet local cruisers by going to a marina and ask for the harbor master.  Ask him if he has any cruisers visiting and if they have a pizza night meetup.  Cruisers are extremely friendly (and often poor) so offer to buy one a beer and he/she/they will be happy to tell you more.

Or better yet, ask the harbor master if there are any distressed boats behind on their slip fees.  Buy yourself a $3,000 boat and flip through the channels on the VHF every morning until you find the local net (usually at 9am or so on a channel like 74 or 77 or 68... it varies with the locality).

When someone asks for help on the 'net, offer to help them fix whatever they are doing.  Ask them for tips on fixing the boat you just bought and getting it ready to leave the country (whatever country you are in... this applies to any country with a coastline).

You'll learn enough within about a year to leave and be self-sufficient at sea (although everyone in the cruising community will always tell you that you need more time).  Leave and go to the next place.  You are now officially a ""cruiser"" and the community at your new port will welcome you as such (especially if it is in a new country).

So i go through the process of looking at there dogs, and felt none of them were really all that special. So I go home and look around for local shelters. Turns out one of the local (45 minutes away local) shelters was about to put down there dogs. 

So I take a trip out there with my pops, and look at them. A few loud barking dogs, a few puppies (cute ones, but people were on them quickly) And then she was laying scared to death in a corner of her little cell. So i took her out of that place asap. Me and my dad assumed she had recently had pups, because her nipples and all that. 

Well, it was a rough going for the first week or so, she was very very timid. And it looks like she was abused at some point. She warms up starts coming around to me more. And to an extent the cat.  While she was getting bigger. I was going to take her to a vet soon. but was holding off due to her being very afraid of car rides, and people in general.

So around 2 am, she starts yelping and moving around a lot. And I get out of bed, had not fallen asleep yet and she had a puppy trailing behind her. So well I did what i could lined her crate with towels, her bed. And did my best. 

11 puppies later.. she is ok, and the pups are doing just fine. Might have bit off more then i bargained for, but hopefully I can find them homes when they ready.

I've heard that stupid comment ever since I was a freshman. In fact there's even an [xkcd about it.](http://xkcd.com/435/) It's like you're asking for problems though, but maybe that's what you want. It's as if you enjoy arguing with people online for no real reason. Every comment is some stupid half thought out retort that depicts your hubris and inability to let things go. But why? So you can be the person that *you wish you could be in real life* on the internet? But what do you have to show for it? Pride. Does arguing with people on the internet bring meaning to your meaningless existence? I hope not, because that's pretty pathetic. 

*This is the part where I'm supposed to feel bad about taking a stab at your personal insecurities, but I don't because you're a pretentious narcissist.*

Here's a tip from the wise, the only meaning your life has is the one you put on it. So go outside and appreciate the fact that by some anomaly that we all exist. Appreciate the things that you do have and stop complaining, because complaints offers no solutions to your problems.

True,Swerveyswerve,,,"The mentally challenged certainly have a different skill set than most people but I wouldn't exactly say they got screwed over. I went to a high school with a program for mentally challenged students where we all were encouraged to work with the students in the program. We generally tutored them in simple skills such as addition, although the mental and social capacity varied dramatically, or just hung out with them to help develop their social skills. 

Most were some of the happiest people I have ever met and seeing them in the halls would brighten my day. There definitely were some students that were more difficult to deal with who people would sometimes want to avoid in the halls, but they really were happy and made my/others' days better. It seemed they never got bogged down by silly little problems they knew they would get through which is what made hanging out with them so enjoyable. I may have stronger math skills but not fixating on small things is certainly an admirable trait that can improve anyone's life. Many people ought to practice this virtue more in order to improve their and their loved-ones' lives. It definitely did help me to work with those students. 

edit: ""virtue"" not ""vulture""
Glad I could brighten your days with this little anecdote! I really enjoyed seeing those students in the hall and I was glad our school had a program, that ought to be more popular, to encourage healthy and mutually beneficial interaction between all students.

True,raging_asshole,,,"After smoking over a pack a day for years, I one day had a coughing fit, after which I spat out a wad of stuff that was very dark, and flecked with black.  I took one look at it, wanted to puke, and instead crushed my pack of smokes and quit cold turkey on the spot.

I told myself, ""You used to be a non-smoker.  Then you started smoking.  And now you just quit.  You're a non-smoker now.  That's it.  If you smoke another cigarette, it'll be because you decided that being a pussy was easier than quitting.""  

Haven't touched a cigarette in probably... 7 years?  Nowadays, the smell turns my stomach and gives me a headache.

The thing is, it's not like cigarettes magically jump into your mouth and light themselves.  If you smoke, it's because you *decide* to.  You use your brain to make a conscious decision to smoke.

People absolutely **cling** to the idea that ""nothing is harder than quitting cigarettes!"" because then they don't feel bad about failing or relapsing.  ""Oh well, it's super hard, everyone says so, so I shouldn't feel like a weakling who is devoid of self control, just because I made a conscious decision to quit and then made a conscious decision to quit quitting and smoke instead!""

The truth is, ""self control"" (the way most people talk about it, anyway) is an illusion.  If you decide to quit, you're also deciding to fight the urge to smoke.  You already know for a fact that your body is going to experience withdrawal symptoms, especially cravings.  So when a craving strikes, that's where you would normally think to yourself, ""OK, this is the hard part.  This is the craving that I knew was coming.  I have to fight this craving until it passes, and each craving after it will be weaker.  This is me putting in work to quit.  I know for a stone-cold fact that I will be happier and healthier and have more money in my pocket when this is done.  I have absolutely NOTHING to gain by smoking a cigarette right now, expect it'll feel good for a minute, and then I'll feel like shit because I failed in my goal, and I failed to improve my health and happiness.  I will have traded long-term success for short-term satisfaction and failure.""

And when you put it that way, it's pretty fucking clear, right?  Who could POSSIBLY choose to smoke in that situation?

Most people, because they immediately think along the lines of, ""Quitting cigarettes is the hardest thing in the world!  Failing is natural!  I shouldn't be afraid to fail.  If I just smoke one cigarette right now, that doesn't mean I have to give up on quitting.  Who cares about quitting anyway?  It's not worth the stress, especially considering all the other stuff I have going on in my life.  I just don't have the *self control* to quit right now.""

That's bullshit justification.  That is you taking what you know for a fact to be true, and burying it under platitudes and social stigma and excuses.  That is you making a conscious decision to accept failure and take the easy road.  That is you saying that your physical urges are more important than your conscious thoughts, and that you're a slave to base impulses.  And on a grander scale, that is basically you denying responsibility for your own life.

So, since I don't know you and you don't know me, I'll just put it out there baldly and you can take it however you want:

If you want to quit smoking cigarettes, then quit fucking smoking: fight the good fight, and come out on top, and have a reason to be proud of yourself, and improve your health, and realize that your life is yours to control.  

Or don't.  Tell yourself that you're too weak to do it.  Tell yourself that being healthier and happier isn't worth fighting for.  Tell yourself that you can't control what you do, and it's easier to live being a slave to urges and cravings.  Tell yourself that you're going to lay back and accept whatever life does to you.

Just realize that either way, it is a decision you are making.  

(And just as a PS, I genuinely do hope that you decide to take control and quit.  I realize that I may be living up to my name and coming across like a complete asshole, but sometimes you need an asshole to rip down the blinds and shed some sunlight on the truth, instead of a pal to hold your hand and tell you it's ok.)",0,1363833957,,0,False,1,c8zji3h,t3_1aozhr,t1_c8zji3h,t1_c8zeg9b,,1431653204,188,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,188

True,Bruce_G,,,"Late in the evening, just after the Inaugural Ball -- after the speeches, the handshakes, the toasts, the dances, the congratulations, the pictures, everything -- you finish brushing your teeth for the first time in the White House bathroom.  You shake your head and laugh to yourself; you're standing around in your boxers in the house that *for a quarter millennium* all our presidents have called home.  Not yet tired despite the exhausting ordeal of a day, you walk out of the bedroom onto the second floor landing and admire the portraits of the few dozen men who came before you.  Both leaders and liars stare back at you, silently measuring the newcomer.  Your feet tread softly down the stairs, afraid of disturbing them, as you wonder where they'll hang your picture.  

You gravitate towards the Oval Office -- the place where you'll make your legacy, for better or worse.  This is where Teddy literally wrestled with foreign dignitaries, where Truman decided to drop the bombs, where Nixon ordered the break-in, where Clinton got his dick sucked, hell, where Kennedy probably did a lot more.  The door is heavy; it carries the entirety of American history.  You see the desk, over a century and a half old, for the first time; the chair, too.  But *the seat of power* isn't what jumps out at you -- it's the suspiciously thin, innocuous manila folder so casually before it that causes you to frown in confusion.  *Is that...?*  Now curious, you cross to the desk, place a finger on the folder and drag it toward you.  Thumbing it open you see it's a collection of files you requested at your transition meeting just weeks ago.

You pick it up and begin to flip through it, but then think again.  It takes you a few more steps that you thought to get around the desk, and you slowly take your seat behind it for the very first time.  The folder before you, you lean back, place your hands on the arm rests, and take a deep breath.  Now you can read.

...

Rubbing your eyes, you stand up and look around for a clock -- you don't even know where they have one in here.  After a brief search you find a small timepiece in a wood casing on one of the room's end tables; an ancient looking baseball covered in scrawled ink sits in a glass case beside it.  It's nearly 4 a.m.  A yawn comes over you and you stare out the window, past the trees and past the lights.  The curtains are open, but the moon has long since gone to bed and the sun hasn't yet thought of rising.

What you just read has left you empty.  The *Maine* exploded because it was a poorly maintained, floating tinderbox.  The Zimmerman Telegram was indeed an actual communique from Imperial Germany, but neither they nor the Mexican government were in any shape to act on it.  The Great Depression early in the 20th century was simply a harsh, natural market correction, just like the Great Recession early in the 21st.  The ""Banker's Plot"" was nothing more than the drunken musings of a few industrialists in the depths of the '30s.  Pearl Harbor was the result of fractured, sniping intelligence agencies dropping the ball.  A high-altitude balloon testing a military camera strayed off course and crashed in the boonies of New Mexico during the summer of '47.  Fluoridation was a matter of public health.  A lone madman shot Kennedy in '63; same for MLK in '68.  We landed on the moon.  The CIA experimented with psychedelics but nothing came of it.  Gerald Ford didn't have head injuries from playing college football, so they didn't affect his judgement.  We came frighteningly close to nuclear war a few times, not out of malice, but out of incompetence.  We foolishly overthrew some Latin American governments because of poor intelligence and stubborn reasoning.  The USSR collapsed entirely on its own.  Vince Foster committed suicide.  9/11 happened because of poor intelligence aggregation, and the Saudis knew nothing about it.  Homeland Security bought those bullets as a kickback.  The NSA never found out how to efficiently sort through the oceans of data it collected.  Global warming is real, and stopping its glacial advance would require an unprecedented effort from humanity.

As you turn away from the window to leave the Oval Office, you pause to set the folder back on the desk.  You close your eyes and slowly massage your forehead.  There is no plan; there is no one in charge.  Freak events and human imperfections have ruined nations and cost countless lives without the slightest concern.  The human tendency to see patterns and connections doesn't change the degree to which random, unforeseen events effect the world's fortunes.  No one knows what's going on, no one can control it, yet you're charged with the responsibility to try.  After a heavy sigh you decide it's finally time for bed.

Upstairs you take a piss in the presidential toilet -- while new, the experience is somewhat less novel after the night's revelations.  You think of the folder, of the files; how they were available so quickly, so concisely summarized, how the important primary documents were so neatly organized right there at your fingertips.  As you glance at stubbled, tired face in the mirror before turning out the light, you wounder if that same file was shown to the man before you, and the man before him.  You think back to the grayed portraits lining the walls of your confines, wondering if you already saw a bit of gray on yourself.",0,1363840481,,0,1363840832,1,c8zln97,t3_1aonl1,t1_c8zln97,t3_1aonl1,,1431654223,1078,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,1078

True,lillesvin,,http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198045758250,"I've played forward [Super Meat Boy](http://store.steampowered.com/app/40800/) (IIRC).

I got it myself in a Humble Bundle and everyone was talking about how absolutely rage-inducingly hard it was, so I thought, ""how hard can it be?"" Turns out that the answer to that was ""pretty fucking hard!"" However, I wasn't raging. Not in the least. I was actually quite focused and in an almost zen-like state of mind when playing. The game is well-designed enough that you understand (as a player), that if you die, it's through faults of your own --- not because the game has sloppy controls (because the controls are freakishly tight) or impossible levels, but because you simply haven't learned this level yet. The game became like a science to me, so over the course of a few weeks I spent around 24 hours in total to 100% the Light World, then over the course of a week of obsessing over the game I spent further 60 hours completing the Dark World and 106%'ing the game. Holy fuck that felt AWESOME! I was a Golden God --- nothing could stop me. No game was too hard. ... Then I saw [Exo's sub 20 minutes Light World speedrun](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ede7qFbrbKI)... Well, I've now put around 200 hours into the game and just set a new personal best at 28:17. I'll never reach Exo's insanely awesome time, but I'm definitely not stopping until I'm sub 25 --- maybe sub 23... Or 22...

Oh right, the game... There is a story to the game, but over-all it's quite generic. You're a boy without skin and this Fetus with a PhD keeps kidnapping your girlfriend who is made of band-aids. You know, the usual stuff. You gotta rescue your girl --- Mario style! The game is a run n' jump precision platformer. There is no combat but still plenty of ways to die a meaty and bloody death. Salt piles, saw blades, spikes, lava and many other interesting things are trying to come between you and your Bandage Girl, and once you reach her, Dr. Fetus shows up, beats the crap out of her and takes her with him to the next level... If you don't reach her --- i.e. if you happen to die one of the many thousands of deaths you'll be dying over the course of the game --- you respawn immediately, the music isn't even interrupted, so death really isn't a punishment as much as a necessity. Sure, you can play it safe and go super slow, but then you'll start noticing that this definitely isn't how the game is meant to be played. This game is meant to be played fast, and when done right, it has a certain natural flow to it that I haven't really felt in any other games. People mistakenly think they just have to complete the levels in order to advance, but the real progress lies in understanding the levels and being able to complete them in more or less one fluent motion. You'll know when that happens, because your hands will be shaking from pure adrenaline and joy.

Super Meat Boy is an amazingly well-done platformer (design-wise, on the tech side it has some bugs) and I have no problems saying that it puts the vast majority of platformers throughout time to shame. Many people will probably cry tears of blood, get aneurysms, blistered thumbs and rage-related hardware problems while playing it, at least if you are to believe the majority of people on the Internets, but if you enjoy a good platformer there is absolutely no excuse for you to not enjoy Super Meat Boy.

True,[deleted],,,"This idea may not be popular, but I don't think CNN should apologize for sympathetic coverage for the rapists.  I don't watch the news (but I did see the highlights of this specific coverage), so I don't know what kind of coverage was provided discussing the victim.  I don't know whether they talked about her much at all and this is just people isolating them talking about the boys that were found delinquent and pitchforking, so I can't really say much there.  If they didn't sympathize with the victim, then I think they should probably apologize for that (although people suggesting CNN should have said the girl's life is the one that's been ruined forever are doing a disservice to rape victims, suggesting that it's something that they can't come back from).  But I'll reiterate the sympathetic coverage for the boys isn't a bad thing.

Sexual assault is a lot more common than a lot of people think.  Over a quarter of women, almost a fifth of men, will be sexually assaulted.  There's not just back-alley monsters committing all this rape.   It's committed by every day normal guys and girls that find themselves in situations where right and wrong is not as clear as it's made out to be, and often the lines are further blurred by hormones, alcohol, peer pressure, poor sexual education, poor upbringings, etc.  

This doesn't remove culpability of the offenders--people who rape are and should be held completely responsible for their actions.  But highlighting how they were young and popular guys with promising futures--and how those futures were ruined by their actions--is doing a service to spreading awareness that a normal person, just like you or I, could potentially find themselves in a situation where they might make a mistake like this.

Demonizing the perpetrators only goes to further spread the ill-conceived concept that only ""bad people"" rape others.  Is that really an idea worth spreading?  Maybe they're bad after the fact, but how many do you think would've been considered such before?  And what are we telling teenagers today when we pervade our culture with that concept?

Holding the offenders accountable is a good thing.   Stating in no uncertain terms how horrendous what they did is a good thing.

True,Honda_TypeR,,,"Life is funny like that. Bust your ass grinding to a goal is a rough road. Taking the lazy way out is easy in short term, but rough later on in regret.

There is one huge philosophy I have learned about life (especially in the last 3 years, easily the darkest times in my last 38 years). If you are struggling, worrying or suffering from fear, sadness or sickness... it's a good sign that you are alive. These are all parts of life. Even if you are given everything for free in this world and ride a train of success a long time, you can't escape the human condition. They will visit you at some point down the road often many times more than once. Wealth can never shield you from them.

The key is to weather the rainy seasons of your life, storms do not last for ever, the sunny season of your life will come back eventually. One must learn to appreciate the quiet (which should never be called boring), happy, loving and successful times in your life when they do come back (or even experience them for the 1st time ever)... These are the days not promised. These are the rare times we all secretly live for, even those of us too jaded and shielded from the bad times to admit it. When you are lucky enough to get them... smile, laugh and cherish the moment... You just stuck gold... You just found your tropical island after being deserted at sea. It's the rarest of gifts you should always treat them as such.

PS: One should not read this with hopelessness. Yes life can be cruel, but it can also be beautiful. Your goal in life should be to fight becoming jaded so that you can appreciate the good times. They are the only things worth living for and passing on to a new generation. You should also bust your ass for your goals. Not to avoid feeling of regret (which is minor in the grand scheme), but you should bust your ass for your goals so you can be successful... this is not something that is promised or handed out for free. With enough hard work you can forge a better and happier life, much better than if you did nothing.

Also, flourish in every small happiness and small quiet moment that gets handed to you while you are going through it.

True,marymuthu,,,"What I find really fascinating is that the main point of this post -- that by demonizing and dehumanizing the rapists of Steubenville, we simultaneously reinforce an unconscious assumption that we are nothing like them, that were we at the party with everything going on, we would have singlehandedly stopped it, or done our damnedest. I know I've been subject to such fantasies before whenever I've read about particularly heinous crimes.

I think such an assumption is dangerous. I think it makes ""evil"" something that only ""evil"" people do. As I'm guessing the downvote brigade of SRS considers itself to be ""good"", that effectively absolves all of you from having to consider that you, too, might one day be a victim of the [bystander effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bystander_effect). 

The main point I was trying to make (which I obviously did rather poorly, or at the least with a lot less finesse than is required for sensitive matters such as these) is that I don't believe that ""evil"" is something out there, that is only in ""evil"" people. I think that evil is something that every human being has, a base set of emotions that, unrestrained, can lead to terrible actions. I think that by demonizing most everyone in Steubenville (as the author in the article does), we dehumanize them, and fail to use this situation as a time to re-examine our own capacity to do bad things.

It is through understanding this capacity that we come to recognize it in ourselves when it emerges -- when we get irate at the care that cut us off, when we place all the blame on the other person in a dispute, when we let a clearly sick girl to her own devices at a party because we don't know her. That time, when good people do nothing, can set heinous events into motion. And while we all recognize the end result as a horror, there might be times when we would overlook the sick girl, convincing ourselves that her friends would be along at any minute, that she's just about to wake up, that it's just not worth it to end the party right then and there in order to watch over her all night. 

It's through acknowledging these potential failures in ourselves that we are better able to recognize them when they occur, and make a conscious decision to help prevent it. Merely brushing this off as ""bad people"", paradoxically, leaves us less well-equipped to do the right thing when it does pop up. Because if we never acknowledge that we may not do the right thing -- laugh at the girl instead of helping her -- we may not recognize that failure if it creeps up in us.


**************************************

Fuck it, I'm going to speak my piece and I am aware that this could very well be perceived as an awful opinion, but here it is: I do have some modicum of sympathy for the rapists.

Yeah, there I said it. Not CNN levels of woe, but I think also calling them ""evil"", as the author of that article did, is extremely overblown.

The fact is, that there isn't just a culture of ""rape"", there is a culture of ""fucking with people who are passed out"". They straight-up molested that girl. They may have done something similar to their male friends (I haven't witnessed anything personally, but I do know of incidents of men sticking shit up the ass of their passed-out friends).

Is it wrong? Yes. Is it fucked up? Yes. Should it ever be tolerated? No. But I can also see how these boys could have plausibly thought that they weren't doing anything wrong, that they weren't rapists.

Like there are degrees of murder, there are also degrees of rape. When people think of rape, they often think of the extremes, of someone chasing down and violating a woman in a dark alley. People don't see themselves as capable of such an act, so they don't see themselves capable of rape. People see themselves as essentially good, and think that good people don't do bad things. Ergo, just fuckin' around with someone who is passed out doesn't make you a rapist. Hell, look at everyone else who slowly condones each step.

Likewise, they exist in an environment that completely reinforces all this awful behavior. That doesn't make them evil, but that does make them prone to evil acts.

Mainly, I'm just annoyed at a culture that attempts to draw a line in the sand -- that says ""These people are monsters, thank God they were locked up and protected from the good people like me."" Because that's exactly how shit like this perpetuates itself. We all think the others are the bad guys, that we're just regular Joes and Janes workin' to get by. 

We should stop victim-blaming. It's disgusting and has no place in society. But I also think we should tamp down on perpetrator-blaming. The football players need to be punished for their actions, but the real people behind this are all the adults that allowed the creation of a culture without punishment, without limits, where kids didn't even comprehend that they were going to far, where they could be so ignorant as to put photos of serious criminal activity and abuse online for their peers to see.

These kids aren't evil. Very few people are. When we pretend that we can identify the bad people, because they're the ones the good people like us oppose, we permit ourselves the ability to carry out horrible acts, excusing them every step of the way.

True,playdizo,,,"My reasons:

In the last 80 years the Scottish vote has never been able to turn the election result down south. Our political participation in the UK General elections quite simply does not matter.

There's a trillion~ GBP worth of oil left in the north sea, it won't last forever but this is why it's CRITICAL that it does get used to build industry and infrastructure for the post-oil Scotland. This is done through education and high-tech industry, something both Labour and the Tories have been shitting on from a great height via the introduction of tuition fees, fucking over phd funding etc.  

If we think the slagging we get whilst being a net-contributor to the UK is bad just wait until they actually have to start subsidising us when the oil does run out.. Also If they won't invest in us whilst we're lining their pockets then i don't think it bodes well for when we are no longer a money producing asset - we'll be left to rot like the North of England.  

And lets face it Westminster does not have form for investing a fair amount in Scotland relative to what we contribute. Since the oil started to flow we've extracted TWICE the amount of oil as Norway  (40vs20bn barrels). With a similar population size (and a lower yield selection of other industry) they're leading world charts in health, education and wellbeing whereas Scotland leads in cardiovascular disease, knife crime and youth unemployment. Now either we're so profligate that we've squandered all that dosh, or maybe it's that it's just being mis-invested by Westminster on nuclear weapons and wars..

Either way I think it's about time we stop criticising the chief and we get into the kitchen for ourselves. For better, or for worse.

1) Dogs really are used quite rarely for animal research.  
2) The cost of doing any type of animal research is enormous. We pay hundreds of dollars for a single mouse sometimes and the housing of the animals is also very expensive, so its silly to think that we would be perusing the internet looking for free animals and passing up the ones that cost 4$ or something because they're too expensive... since the rest of the experiment already costs tens of thousands of dollars. 
3) Experiments almost always need to be done on a group of identical animals of the same age- we don't just assemble collections of random animals from craigslist of different ages, species, backgrounds etc. using the exact same animals increases the chances that you will be able to get a clear ""yes"" or ""no"" while using fewer animals overall- which is one of the most fundamental concepts of animal research; answer the question clearly while using the absolute fewest number of animals. 
4) I just want to state here that I am indeed what you would probably consider an evil scientist. But I think I speak on behalf of my fellow scientists when I say that I don't enjoy doing animal testing. I hate it. I hate the thought that any life needs to be sacrificed for my work. I am aware of my responsibility to be watchful, ethical and respectful of the tiny lives that are briefly in my care. I do everything in my power to minimize pain and distress to the animals while conducting the most accurate, precise research possible. But- just for the record; if I DIDN'T care- if I didn't do all of these things, if I didn't protect my animals; I would never get away with it. Because there are dozens of other people involved in the process who are equally responsible for the animal's wellbeing. When we plan an animal experiment, a committee (explained below) reviews every LAST detail of the animal work. If we deviate from that approved protocol AT ALL, all animal work would stop and we could very easily lose our jobs. 
Although I am not happy to be doing animal research and never imagined that I would... I'm finishing a PhD in molecular biology and I truly believe that there are some questions which must be answered that can not, in 2013, be answered in any other way.

&gt; Legitimate pause due to LoH having a problem or not, XBOCT only started spamming rightclicks to sidestep the shackle after the pause effectively allowing him to survive the initiation by Pepi which is pretty much what mattered for the purpose of the argument of pauses being too easily abusable.

I did honestly not intend to bash Na'Vi in particular, as I said in my question to Merlini I've long suspected not every pause being made with honourable~ intentions. This situation in particular just showed imo very clearly how a pause in the right situation can massively favour one team, ""legitimate"" or not because frankly, I don't believe for a second that XBOCT would've survived without it as he didn't start moving until the actual pause and it looked to be a very close escape from the shackle latching.

True,ImperiumAeon,,,"The U.S. and Canada have been sitting on a massive, massive quantity of shale/sands oil reserves (either known for a while or just made public now). It has just been made public that the U.S. and her allies Australia are sitting on VAST quantities of reserves. Increasing prices in non-OPEC nations controls the rest of the world's development. Oil still is the lifeblood of the early 21st century economy and will continue to do so until ""fusion"" technology comes about or nuclear produced power becomes accepted by the civilian populations.

He's not saying that diminishing oil production in Iraq or restricting it in Iran is the ""gain,"" he's saying that ""control"" is the name of the game. Have a projection of power in Iraq and confining Iran to its borders maintains the West's control over the region, and reduces the free flowing oil to states like China from ~~non-~~OPEC nations. OPEC will sell to China, obviously, but at a higher price than would have been if the U.S. never got involved to begin with, meaning a higher bottom line for the PRC. China's strategy right now is to protect Iran from sanctions, not because they care about the Iranian people's suffering, but because [a supply of cheap oil comes from Tehran](http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/03/21/china-oil-iran-idUKL3N0CC0CS20130321).The reason for this is because OPEC will see a restriction in global supply due to ""war, famine, political instability"" and cut production. The U.S. and her close ally's can now weather these political storms caused by OPEC. We won't be seeing another 1970s style oil crisis.

Russia can produce their own oil, and they do. Russia now sees the U.S.'s strategy all along -- use the world's external oil reserves as much as possible until it becomes too costly and then tap our reserves at the last minute before oil prices get out of hand. Obama has done a great job with this, in line with his predecessors actions, Bush and Clinton. He's now pushing to dump as much as possible into clean/alternative energy research (most recently creating a huge investment fund for energy research) since he knows the clock has started on the West's saved reserves. Saudi Arabia is not worth mentioning, they're essentially U.S. loyalists.

Leaving the Middle East in chaos, perpetuating the Arab Spring (while not getting directly involved), saber rattling from Israel, Iran being constricted by sanctions while allowing them to pursue nuclear technologies, etc. is all a part of allowing uncertainty. Israel can handle any major problems that arise with the U.S.'s support, but the strategy now seems to be ""let's just have a controlled burn"" in order to prevent a consolidation of power in the region that may reduce the West's control over oil, and thus the world's markets.

Going back to China, which is now the only real possible challenge to the U.S. (or West)'s hegemony in the world, you can see the de facto ""Allies"" encircling China. The pieces are in place in Japan, South Korea, and even Vietnam to a degree. Obama's decree that a ""pivot to Asia"" is critical to world stability has been aided by a belligerent North Korea, which is still a Chinese vassal-state. With the West able to be self-sufficient with energy (for now) and the supply restricted elsewhere, China is getting slowly squeezed. In the event of a prolonged conventional conflict, China will not only have to contend with vast border defense and mobilization efforts, but also supplying their armies. They are going to have the same problem Germany had in World War II, and that is a lack of oil. It is why North Africa was so important, as it was the gateway to Middle Eastern oil. Many people attribute invading the USSR as the start of German decline in WW2, but I believe the loss of North Africa, and thus their oil reserves, as the real cause. They lost the steam to counter attack and retake territory and thus lost the war. It is why the USSR, post-WW2, focused so heavily on invading the satellite states in order to position themselves to gain cheap oil and choke out the West.

Therefore, to prevent the rise of another Cold War and two-pole geopolitical state, the U.S.'s foreign policy has been exactly how Russia has described it. Crazy to the rest of the world, making perfect sense for Western interests.

True,[deleted],,,"This is going to be my one huge bitch rant here, promise.
Trigger warning: logical bitch rant

What we have here is a case of someone being so unable to support her opinions using reason that she tries to discredit the entire system of logic, that predates her by millennia. Saying something has existed for a long time by no means designates that thing as 'true' or 'good,' but it does suggest that there is a reason that it has remained a part of our culture for so long. In the case of logic, this reason is because it allows members of our species to abandon caveman babble and actually communicate. With the formation of speech, the formation of logic naturally followed (see what I did there?) such that the things our ancestors said actually had meanings, sometimes hypothetical and abstract, but often in order to describe the real world. What would be the purpose of language and words if we could not form causal relationships and use deduction? We would be like toddlers, pointing at objects and saying ""ball!"" ""tree!"" ""spring!"" or uttering simple declarative statements like ""the sky is blue"" and ""the ground is hard.""

The only reason this SJW is alive today is because of the LOGIC behind the technology that allowed our species to lower mortality rates and propagate from the thousands into the billions. The only reason she is able to sit at a computer today is because of the LOGIC behind those who designed the different components that have been used to construct it. The only reason the formations of pixels she types have any SEMBLANCE of meaning (and they barely do; she sounds more like the aforementioned caveman babble to me) is because of a logical system that allows us to say ""this, therefore this"" among an infinite number of other things. She would have no audience if it weren't for this ""ideology based on lies.""

As someone pursuing a research doctorate, and who just spent 12 hours in a lab yesterday, the only tool that I have is logic. If I believed that ""feels"" influenced the way the proteins that I express fold, to give one example, then I wouldn't be able to produce an experiment with any relevancy to the real world. Data, statistics, and experimental observation are absolutely key to establishing falsehoods and supporting (though never quite proving) truths. There is a direct relationship between this supporting of a claim and determining its truth, because every time you support the claim with a valid argument based on good data, you are crossing off an alternative possibility on the list of causes for the phenomenon you are working to explain, leaving a smaller number of plausible remaining explanations and a better understanding of the way in which the world works.

In beautiful, (to be expected) poetic justice, her argument against logic takes the form of a logical argument, and fails on a number of levels, not the least of which is her myriad of logical fallacies (strawman, personal incredulity, loaded question, black or white, begging the question). She says things like 

&gt;Anyone who seriously expects me or anyone else to engage the ideas of nazism and fascism out of some absurd need to follow arbitrary rhetorical rules deserves to step on a lego.

and 

&gt;As the fallacy fallacy notes: what matters here is truth.

shows that her idea of ""truth"" is actually completely and utterly what we here call ""feels."" This is the ultimate display of SJW self-delusion.

I will sit quietly now.

TL;DR In trying to dismantle logic, SJW tries to use logic, fails epically.

True,darthluiggi,cust iebro,On Keto since 2001 37/M/5'6'' ~161 lbs / 73 kg,"Hey!

I´ll go and try to explain as best as I'm able.

On maintenance kcalories:
You get your maintenance kcalories by following some simple equations. Note, the following formula is a fairly basic one. I used the one found in ""The Ketogenic Diet"" book from Lyle McDonald.

* Take your Total Weight (150 lbs)
* Deduct from this your body fat % (20%), this will give you your ""Net Weight"" = 120 lbs
* Multiply your net weight by 11 (Resting Energy Expenditure) = 1,320 kcals
* Multiply your Resting Energy Expenditure (REE) by 0.1 (to add the Thermic Effect of Feeding - TEF) = 1,452 kcals -&gt; this are your ""maintenance"" kcals.

There are other formulas out there, some more complicated. So far I use this one because it's simple to understand and it has helped me achieve my goals. 


On gaining muscle with a ketogenic diet:

Basically, to gain muscle you *will have to eat above your maintenance calories*, you are quite right on that.

Normally, on a bulk, you will gain lots of weight, some of it will be muscle, but a lot will also be fat, thus you get in a bulk and cut cycle. Most people find it very difficult to cut, and that's why most ""average"" guys in the gym are always ""bulking"" (their excuse to be fat).

The great thing of doing a CKD or TKD is that you get the best of both worlds: you gain muscle, while minimizing fat gain (yes, you might gain some fat, but you can control how much if you play your cards right).

As to understand how you can ""add muscle while losing fat"", take a look at [this article by none other than Mr Keto himself, Lyle McDonald.](http://www.bodyrecomposition.com/fat-loss/adding-muscle-while-losing-fat-qa.html)

As for exercises for muscle building, first you will have to learn the basics, and once you have mastered the movements, the next step is to start adding more weights / reps / or a combination of both, also adding advanced techniques such as pyramid, supersets, etc.

I would stick to your current routine, just set a goal and start adding a little more weight every week (even 2lbs is good progress). Then after 2-3 months you could review and change exercises / routine.

For the calculator, check the sidebar, under ""useful links"", it's called the ""ketogains calculator"", you can download it and use it as you see fit.

True,ravia,,,"There is a ton of reasons for it. Among them: difficulty, obscurity, ignorance, capitalism, dishonesty, extremist versions and conclusions, social behavior, etc. Postmodernism is actual in some very basic ways; ""we"" are all postmodernists to some degree, at least when thought against some of the older modernist claims. Even simply to question a story of progress in a promotional video for some big company that is now ""fueling the future"" while we now know they poisoned a lot of water and had to pay out a mega lawsuit is postmodern thing to do.

I think it's a phase. Lyotard's general definition -- skepticism concerning grand narratives --- is good enough. And you can say that right to those who give you the strong negative reaction. Just pick a case of ""we have *arrived*!"" and tell how people now don't take that hook, line and sinker, and show that that is beyond (post) the first vision that was offered and taken to amount to the ""end of history"", in the sense of humankind finally reaching the true, final goal and getting it right.

Yet it is a phase in that it is a large, and largely negative, formation of operations. Rooted in critique that realizes itself in practice, a lot of which is textual, this skepticism has its limits and problems. One can even add that the skepticism concerning postmodernism is a pretty postmodernist thing to do. Instead of just accepting the ""new thing"", one is skeptical. Well, that is postal, and post what is with the times, ""modern"". To be skeptical of postmodernism is not, in and of itself, post-postmodern in a true, substantial sense, however; it is more of the same, but only doubly reflective. Being doubly reflective is not a big thing, and anyone can do it, and do it very crudely, as you realize. To say ""I don't buy these philosophies of reflection"", for example, is doubly reflective in some very simple sense. 

The truly post-postmodern arrives as an accomplishment of something that has a basic issue with *postality* itself, in part. This means that it concerns a *positive development*, in such a manner that that postality itself is drawn into fundamental question. It is not simple backlash against skepticism, however. It arises through the consideration of the grounds of skepticism in an original, basic way that both retains skepticism as a positive possibility (the affirmation of the not) and returns one to the grounds and *raisn d'etre* of that skepticism. The skepticism concerning grand narratives is skeptical for a reason, and that reason does pertain to a general good, to issues of value, and arises from within a kind of general trajectory -- most general -- concerning something like a general good, the good of humankind (even if the term human, along with virtually all the other terms, can be spun in that skepticism). This grounding positivity, however, is as actual as the skeptical accomplishments of postmodernism. 

At a critical juncture lies the formulation that ""there is no grand narrative"". This negation likewise is founded on affirmation (of truth), in a performative mode that yields the oft-cited performative contradiction (it is true that there is no truth?!). But that's just the beginning of part of post-postmodernism, which is nonviolence thoughtaction or nonviolenceharm thoughtaction or ameliorative thoughtaction. 

In nonviolenceharm thoughtaction, several things happen at once. In this respect, it has the character of a certain kind of revolution, which is characterized as a kind of overall ""turning"", revolving, etc. Yet we are given, as is pretty obvious, to question such turnings-over as well, are we not? Indeed. And why? In large part due to the history of violence that has accompanied the revolutionary, to the point that the fell-swoop gesture of the revolutionary is drawn into question as well. Yet the ground of this question is a concern about violence as such, which inculcates and problematizes the whole ""history of meta-physics"", which is, of course, a centerpiece for much of postmodernism. At the same time, while postmodernist, poststructuralist thought has brought the limits and problems of metaphysics into *play*, it has not adequately arrived at what is other than physics in original priority. This ""other than physics"" is nonviolenceharm, in part, and original relations that are primary and irreducible to the neutral concept. The work of unfolding the turning of this revolution given to thoiught is what I call ""envolution"", an other-than-revolution revolution that leads into the ongoing unfolding of nonviolenceharm thoughtaction. It is this that is more truly post-postal, and hence post-postmodern; postal indeed, it is also arising from out of a *priority* that is decidedly not post-anything at all, but was there all along. Again, this is part of why it is more ""properly"" post-postmodern as well. 

While this seems contorted (entorted?), at the same time, if one finds ones legs in it, one can respond much more ably to critics of postmodernism in some very interesting and productive ways. One an look at a decidedly postmodern movement like Occupy in new ways as well, and begin to project positive work that may be more effective; one can give support to some of the background motivations leading some to the strong resistance to postmodernism, while retaining the best of postmodernism. 

Etc.

""O, cholera!"" literally means, ""Oh, cholera!"", as in the disease. The English equivalent is ""Oh, hell!""

""Z kurwy syn"" means ""son from a whore"", and the English is ""son of a bitch."" These are functionally equivalent - you can use it to describe someone, or as a general curse at a situation. The modern version of this is [""skurwysyn""](http://pl.wiktionary.org/wiki/skurwysyn#pl), though. You can see the etymology from the older version (z kurwy syn) being compressed into a single word with no breaks, and the ""z"" being turned into an ""s"" - an example of evolution in language. The sound of the ""z"" is softened, because it's easier to transition from an ""s"" sound to a hard ""k"" than it is from the ""z"", and people are fundamentally lazy about language. I still use the archaic form, but the difference is so slight that it would take a Polish speaker to hear the difference.

There's ""Tam gdzie psy dupami szczekają"", which means ""Where the dogs bark from their asses"". The sense is something like ""This is a really shitty/bad place.""

I like ""w dupie byłeś, gówno widziałeś"". Literally, it means ""You were in your ass and you saw shit."" The sense is that ""You weren't even there, you don't know what you're talking about,""

""Trzymaj się swojego fiuta"" means ""Hold onto your own dick"", or ""Mind your own business.""

Slavic languages like Polish and Russian have really good insults and profanity. Arabic is fun for that too.

**Edit:** I'm Polish, but grew up in the US. My Polish profanity was rather limited, because my parents didn't curse much, and they didn't tell us kids what it mean. We had to figure it out on our own, so I thought a ""kurwa"" was a female dog... because the phrase was similar to ""son of a bitch"", and a ""cur"" is a dog.

It's now been 10 years since I've been married, and my Polish wife has taught me a LOT more profanity, to the point that I sometimes use it around my mother, much to the chagrin of both of them. My mother is shocked that such words come from my mouth, and my wife is embarrassed that I said something like that around my mother... and that my mother knows *exactly* who taught me.

In the meantime, I think it's funny as fuck.

True,wijagain,,,"Everybody please read Adria's post on her blog, one of the gentlemen's post on Hacker News, and Adria's reply to that post on Hacker news.

What really irks me about the follow up is that this event is a catalyst to discuss MANY interesting and valid questions, which are all buried under BS like this:

&gt; Purely on the basis of her say-so

These guys weren't fired on ""her say-so"". They were fired by their employers for acting unprofessional while representing the company. If you read her reply to the HN post, she thinks that was an overreaction.

&gt; because they allegedly told a joke 

In the HN post, the guy admitted telling the joke, and I'm sure the conference organizers went over that before he left voluntarily.

&gt;during a private conversation

The conversation occurred in the middle of the audience.

&gt; that she construed as sexual in nature

The dongle joke was sexual in nature. The HN post indicates the fork-repo joke wasn't.

&gt; Adria's intention to create a hostile environment for other developers at PyCon 

Her intentions are to make a *less* hostile environment for young women hoping to become programmers, as stated on her blog. Did her actions really further that goal, or were they counterproductive? Is the community going to change without activism, which will unavoidably be met with push back? These are examples of really interesting questions that we SHOULD be discussing instead of validating this drivel.

When his daughter was only 4 months old, his ex-wife (who is literally the **worst** person I have ever met, out of every single human I have ever encountered personally) broke his daughter's left arm. Spiral fracture on the upper arm. She and her boyfriend claimed that her arm got stuck in the crib and she tried to roll over and broke it herself, and so far every doctor we've talked to has told us that that is simply not possible. So, bullshit. 

A year later, he is **still** fighting this custody battle, mainly because the case worker who was assigned the case is extremely sexist against men, and uses any and every chance to insinuate that my room mate is anything from a tweaked out methhead, to a pedophile. Mainly because he loves his tattoos and has ink up and down his arms and chest.

He is honestly the best father I have ever seen, my father walked out when I was four, and I hope someday I can be even HALF the dad he is. We used to go out and hit the bars right after work, do stupid stuff, aka young guy things. The very day he was granted temporary custody of his daughter, he stopped drinking, smoking, sleeping around, he sold his PS3 and flat screen so he could buy her a nice crib and decorate her room. A little while ago he skipped on a Vegas trip with me and some friends because he needed to take her to a Yo Gabba Gabba concert thing, because good god that little girl fucking ***loves*** Yo Gabba Gabba. So much so that all three of us adults in the house have the songs memorized, and now we have a giant Brobee doll and Gabba posters all over our living room.

True,BrooklynNets,,,"I once offered to carry an elderly lady's cart up the subway steps, which she accepted, but only on the condition that I never be more than two steps ahead of her lest I steal her stash of plastic bags and empty cookie sleeves. What I hadn't anticipated was her superlative slowness. She stalled at the foot of the stairs for a good ninety seconds before making her first move, following which she took a break of about three minutes. Around a quarter of an hour had elapsed by the time she reached the fifth step, at which point she sat down, leaned her head against the wall and appeared to prepare for a nap. I managed to prod her awake after a minute or so, prompting her to accuse me of attempting to ""grab the goodies"".

She grumbled something about the youth of today being unhelpful and ungrateful, and then sat down for what I assume was a second nap to prepare her for the final push to the summit.

True,Eater_of_Birds,,,"When I was in high school I sat next to this shy, quiet kid in my English class.  He always seemed like a nice guy, just kept to himself.  I'd often try to start up a simple conversation with him to break the ice and see what he was all about, but he never took the bait.  He definitely wasn't rude, just sort of indifferent to everyone around him.  Our teacher was kind of a lazy piece of shit and would have us partner up with someone for the majority of the class time and we were supposed to discuss a book or whatever piece of literature we were talking about that week.  That's hard to do with someone who's talkative and outgoing, let alone someone who's practically mute.  We fumbled over some awkward conversation of a particular book we had been reading in class but he quickly became disinterested and stopped talking.  It was his first year in our school so I tried asking about his last school, where he was originally from, any hobbies...the kid stonewalled me.  Again, wasn't rude, just disinterested entirely.

I had tried and struck out, so I accepted that we would probably be sitting in silence for the next hour or so and figured I'd just entertain myself.  Here's where I tell you my hidden talent - I can make an incredible noose.  And I can even do it with just about any string/rope-like material you can find.  So to pass the time I pulled a shoelace out of my backpack and started making a noose...He. Was. Amazed.  His eyes immediately lit up and he scooted in closer, watching very closely.  Then he said ""could you teach me to do that?""  I had done it!  Of course I would teach him, I was thrilled to have broke his wall down, even if only partially for now.  

He caught on very quickly and I'd catch him practicing making the tiny nooses in class, we'd exchange a nod and crack a little laugh.  By the end of a week he was making Grade A nooses.  I was proud!  That friday when class had ended he pulled me aside.  He thanked me for teaching him and said he appreciated it more than I would ever understand, it was the most I'd ever heard him speak.

True,wedgeomatic,religion,Thought from Late Antiquity to 13th Century,"&gt;This is where I disagree. The question that I see answered is ""what is the evidence for Jesus' existence"" not ""is that good evidence?""

I'm not sure the distinction is meaningful.  All evidence is good evidence of *something*.  It's for the historian to determine what.  

&gt;My point is that I don't accept your claim that no one ever questioned the existence of Jesus before. Maybe nobody ever thought to do it, but that seems unlikely.

You're welcome to provide a counter-example of early interlocutors of Christianity suggesting that Jesus did not exist at all.  

&gt;That seems to be an argument from ignorance that is assuming the default position is that Jesus must have existed and accepting it simply because there is no counter argument.

I don't think you're approaching my argument with anything resembling charity.  It's an argument that none of the people closest to the time of Jesus with an active interest in suppressing and eliminating Christianity attempted to argue that Jesus didn't exist.  It's a pointing out of the fact that Paul is clearly a controversial figure and is basing his authority (in part) on the claim ""the dudes who actually knew Jesus trust and accept me, if you don't believe me on this, or about this Jesus stuff you can ask them.""  If he's just making it up that seems like a darn odd claim to make, especially since it's also quite obvious that he's not exactly buddy buddy with these same folks.  This is just the sort of evidence that someone claiming Jesus didn't exist needs to account for.

&gt;I'd be interested to know what that point is. I'd really prefer more explanations and less dismissive, ""You just don't understand"" responses.

Paul is claiming to have met the *actual* resurrected Jesus, not a ghost or shade of the man, the actual man.  That's what grounds his theology, his claims of direct revelation, not his claims to have seen a ghost or spirit.  It's not dismissive to say that if you missed this then you don't understand, it's true.  If you've read Paul, and think he's talking about a ghost, then you really, really missed the point and you should re-read the text.  

&gt;I don't see that distinction if the evidence for either is the same. If I have the same basic evidence to suggest that Jesus was a ghost or that Jesus was a carpenter, both of those claims are equally supported or not supported by that evidence.

I think this returns to your misunderstanding of how historians use sources that I've mentioned before.  Also, no one has claimed that the *same* evidence exists for the claim that Jesus was a carpenter or a ghost.  In fact, the same evidence obviously *doesn't* exist, since no one claims Jesus was a ghost.  

&gt;Sure, there's Occam's Razor and the idea that it's more likely that he was a carpenter than a ghost, but what is more likely is not the same thing as being true.

Historians don't deal in certainty, sorry.  Try math if that's what you're looking for.  

&gt;Again, I'm not looking for what's accepted, I'm looking for why it's accepted.

Because it accords with what our sources tell us and with what we know about first century Palestine, our understanding of ancient genre and convention, and a whole host of other reasons, which are outlined in the many, many, many books on the subject. 

You obviously have a problem with these claims, that's fine.  Now the onus is on *you* to investigate them if you're interested.  It'd be great to get all the answers here or on wikipedia or on some other website, but these questions are complicated, the historical research that went into them is massive and widely varied, sometimes a book really is the best format.  If the problem is that you don't believe the claims of historians on the matter, then you need to find out what their claims are and why they make them.  *Then* you can start to mount some real, substantive criticism, rather than just raising your incredulity over and over

&gt;I'm doing my research now after having looked at the provided evidence. It is not at all convincing to me. If all you want to tell me is, ""Well then you just don't understand the evidence"" then you might as well stop replying to me.

You said you've read two authors on the subject, one of whom is a crank, and have repeatedly demonstrated a lack of understanding with how historians use sources and consider evidence.  I've seen no indication at all that you have any real familiarity with the evidence or the historical method.  I'm sorry if that sounds harsh, but I simply don't believe that you understand or have really looked at the provided evidence.  One of my primary reasons for saying this is that your response to almost everything that I've pointed out has either been ""I don't buy it"" or a distortion of how we understand sources.  I'm trying to help you understand, but you can't get upset because I suggest you need to do more reading on the subject.  If you want to know more, if you want to understand, you do, it's as simple as that. 

&gt;Why is this wrong? Don't answer, ""Because historians say so."" Please explain to me where I'm making some sort of error in my reasoning.

Because you're drawing an analogy between ""a preacher who caused some trouble with the authorities in first century Judea"" and ""Bigfoot"" which does not hold.  You're passing judgments on the trustworthiness of Josephus simply on the basis of whether or not he met Jesus (which really means nothing at all, Peter Brown wrote very well and in great detail on Augustine and I'm confident he has never met the man), without considering the purpose of his work, the context of his mentions of Jesus, his overall trustworthiness, other contemporary writings, or any number of other incredibly important factors in judging this type of thing.  It's as if you just want us to take the bare text of Josephus and proceed from there, determine whether it's ""trustworthy"" or not and throw it out if it's not.  This is what I keep harping on with regard to how historians read sources, we don't read them in isolation, we don't read them out of context, with a postivist ""true or false"" understanding.  It's nuanced and complex.  My continued call for you to read books on the subject was based on the fact that I thought you actually cared about this stuff and wanted to learn more.  It wasn't a ""hey, you're an idiot, read a book, LOL!""  It's ""hey, I think your questions will be resolved by reading more on the subject by people who both have a ton more space to expound their thoughts and research and by people who are magnitudes more intelligent and eloquent than myself.""  Don't assume that just because I'm pointing out that you're wrong that I'm personally attacking you.

True,Jazzspasm,,,"A bit of text, but it's straight forward:-

Governments issue bonds - essentially, they take a loan and offer interest, payable in 50 years.

Sometimes, governments take cash loans from banks - for the Olympics, for example.

If a government is super stable (AAA credit rating) these loans are perfect investments for pension funds, for example, as they have long term security. They're also good investments for other governments.

Summary:- A government is now in debt to the banks to the tune of €Billions. The banks sell those bonds to other banks and, importantly, other governments as long term, safe investments. The banks *themselves* also become good investments because they have given a loan to a AAA, super secure government.

Our pensions are tied up in that system. We have personally invested in banks and governments in other countries.

**Therefore, governments need banks that manage other government's money to be financially stable.** 

If a bank that is heavily tied up with the finances of a government falls over they can take the finances of not just one government but many with it.

Therefore, governments will prop up banks in other countries to make sure other governments are secure and stable. That's why we prop them up.

Everyday life example:- If your bank goes bust, it will take your savings with it - but you manage to withdraw your cash in time.

Unfortunately, your landlord had a mortgage with them. Your landlord is now broke. They sell the house you're living in and kick you out. You are now homeless and your savings aren't enough to fix that problem. 

Therefore you have a massive interest in your bank not going bust. Getting your savings out and moving to another bank doesn't make any difference because your relationship with your landlord is tied up with the security of the bank. You're all tied up together.

That's basically it. 

So, now the stability of banks in another country are really important.

One bank going down (Lehman Brothers), can create a tidal wave of financial horror and can lead to governments that aren't entirely robust becoming bankrupt. That's when the lights go off - terrifying. Imagine if everyone on your street declared themselves bankrupt overnight, but you were fine. Pretty soon, you'd get a knock on your door from very hungry and desperate neighbours. Scary!

That's the situation governments have found themselves in. 

Of course, we can vote the government out - and replace them with who? People who'll tell the banks to fuck off? If a government is in debt and doesn't pay that debt, the whole lot comes down. Government bonds become junk, you have a bankrupt nation and that threatens the interlinked risk system of global finance and investment. That affects everyone.

So we have to suck it down. It's not our fault, you and me, but that's the situation our country is in and the system we allowed ourselves to get into.

We as nations allowed ourselves to get into this because we weren't paying attention to what our elected representatives were doing. And so we pay, whether we're a taxi driver or a teacher - we pay.

Because we don't want to go bankrupt as a nation and keep the lights on, we have to make sure that other governments we are linked to via the banks are secure. The banks are that link, so we have to prop them up - otherwise the lights go off all over the place, not just in another country. And we could lose our pensions.

So we pay.

Simple.

But really, if they're turning Cena heel during the main event, they could incorporate the cold temperatures and the need to wear extra clothing.  

Picture this: Cena comes out and he's looking kind of puffier than usual.  That's because he's wearing [all of his shirts](http://fc01.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2012/096/5/3/wwe_john_cena_multi_color_wallpaper_widescreen_by_timetravel6000v2-d4v9e69.jpg) at once, in layers.  Cole talks about how Cena is smart to guard against the increased pain that impacts in cold temperatures bring, and Lawler jokes that Cena looks funny.  Neither realizes what's really going on.  

The **[purple](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/46/John_Cena_purple_shirt.jpg)** shirt is on top, representing his bruised pride from the past year of failures.  Cena takes that off before the match starts, revealing a **[blue](http://i15.photobucket.com/albums/a367/bentley283/tenyearsstrongcenacostume.jpg)** shirt, whose color represents the sadness John feels as he reflects on how the Rock defeated him at the same event a year ago.  The match starts and the competitors proceed slowly, sizing each other up with cautious maneuvers (tests of strength, whips into the ropes for standing shoulder blocks, etc.).  Cena decides he's had enough with the slow game and wants to ratchet up the pace.  He takes another layer off to show his **[green](http://images.wikia.com/prowrestling/images/0/0b/Cena_green_shirt.png)** shirt: he points to his torso and yells, ""Green means GO!""  A flurry of strikes between the two follow as the match starts to devolve into a brawl.  We get some quick, high-impact moves that force John and Dwayne to slow things down, and the latter takes a breather outside the ring.  Cena's ready to go again, and he strips another layer to show Rocky a **[yellow](http://wrestleshare.com/?dm=606Z)** shirt: ""King, I think he's saying the Rock's being yellow!  He's calling him a coward!""  Rock is pissed and starts to beat Cena down.  After a kick-out or two, Cena powers out of a rest hold and starts into the Five Moves of Doom.  Before the Five-Knuckle Shuffle, John takes off another shirt to show the **[orange](http://wrestlingsuperstore.com/images/products/detail/cenaorangeshirt.jpg)** design, representing the skin color of Hulk Hogan as Cena hits the peak of his own Hulking Up.  Five-Knuckle Shuffle!  Attitude Adjustment!  Cover, one, two, NO!  Cena hits a second AA, but Rock kicks out again!  Certainly a third will do the trick-- Rock's gotta be out cold.  But NO!  Another kick-out by the champ!  Cena's not frustrated or shocked like he normally is when someone kicks out of his finisher; he's *furious*.  He's done everything he can to redeem himself, he's waited by while the Rock no-shows event after event, and his path out of the depths of failure ends with his best not being enough?  Another shirt off, and we see **[red](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-09S4Ve1NGkU/TZk-1x5PLkI/AAAAAAAAA-0/UQ2wOcX2dx0/s1600/dfff.jpg)** as Cena ""sees red.""  Instead of resorting to another finisher, Cena goes into a rage and just punches the Rock on the mat without mercy.  It's quite excessive-- the once-mighty Rock looks frail as he bleeds from the beating Cena has just given.  Cena takes off the red garment, whose graphics are now blood-stained, to reveal the [**black** ""Rise Above Hate""](http://images5.fanpop.com/image/photos/26300000/HQ-John-Cena-RISE-ABOVE-HATE-wwe-26342371-979-1200.jpg) shirt, but this is an altered design: the words ""Rise"" and ""Above"" are crossed out with rough red streaks, leaving only the word **""HATE""** intact.  Cena spits on the bleeding Rock, and goes back to work with punches/kicks/stomps to the head again.  The ref tries to pull Cena off, but Dark Cena lashes out and we have a ref bump.  John smiles with hate in his eyes as he takes the opportunity to put Rock in the STF.  The Rock has the rope, but without the ref to break the hold, Cena keeps it locked in until Rocky's hand limply falls from the rope and we see under the crimson mask that he's passed out.  Cena wakes up the ref and goes for a cover: one, two, WHAT?  Cena pulls Rock off the mat!  He turns the champ onto his stomach, grabs his hands, and delivers his new finisher, the Curb Stomp.  Cena covers, gets the three, and hoists the belt without any preening for the fans.  Cena spits on the defeated Rock again and leaves the audience cold and without the John Cena they knew.  

**TL;DR**: Cold weather --&gt; wrestlers wear more clothing --&gt; Cena turns heel and wins the title through the power of a shirt rainbow.

Like not having any friends and being married to someone I can't fully trust means I have no one to talk to about anything one on one in person.

For example, I lied a lot to my friend. I told him that so and so said this about him so he'd not trust them or be mad at them, and again I lied to make my self sound more interesting to him to impress him. When he got a boyfriend I complained about his boyfriend a lot instead of being supportive about there relationship. I did that about his friends too. When I gave him space I decided I was going to wait for him to text me first and never initiated any communication, when what I should have done was instead of messaging him every ,minute and responding the second I received a text, I should have only messaged him if I hadn't heard from him in 24 hours. Plus when I was texting him I was always bitching or complaining about my life. I never had anything positive to say. I was inviting my self over a lot, I never had him over and if I did I made him do what I wanted to do. I mean there was other stuff, but by the end of it, all what I mentioned is what ended it.

True,Gemini00,,,"First of all, one important consideration is that people play games for fundamentally different reasons, depending on their personality, motivations, and current mood.

Marc LeBlanc has written and lectured extensively about game design philosophy, and he categorizes games and game enjoyment under [""8 Kinds of Fun""](http://8kindsoffun.com/):

- Sensation - Game as sense-pleasure
- Fantasy - Game as make-believe
- Narrative - Game as unfolding story
- Challenge - Game as obstacle course 	  	
- Fellowship - Game as social framework
- Discovery - Game as uncharted territory
- Expression - Game as soap box
- Submission - Game as mindless pastime

Any one game can provide multiple different kinds of fun, either simultaneously or alternating with the pacing of the gameplay, but in general games tend to be primarily focused around 2 or 3 of these.

The kinds of games you are talking about are ones where the main motivation behind the gameplay is problem solving, developing new mental models to approach unique challenges, and then mastering those challenges. For me, and I suspect many of us who would consider ourselves more ""serious"" gamers, that ability to stretch your mind, set goals, and then accomplish them is incredibly rewarding and leaves you feeling smarter, mentally sharper, and just plain satisfied in a job well done.

I like to think of challenge-oriented games as being like a mental testing ground. In real life, when you try and fail, when you compete against others and lose, there are real consequences. We are innately wired to try and avoid those kinds of negative outcomes. This can either result in powerful motivation to succeed, or paralyzing fear of consequences which result in inaction.

In gaming, however, there are no real, tangible consequences for failure, unless you're a pro-gamer or something. Thus, I feel free to fully engage this competitive mental space knowing that I can go all-out, and if that's not good enough, nothing will happen. It's like a testing ground for mental strength and endurance, that I feel carries over into real-world benefits. It helps me better understand my own mind, what drives me to succeed and what holds me back. If I spend a Sunday engaged in intense Starcraft ladder practice, I come back to work the next week feeling more motivated, I have better multitasking, and it's easier to stay cool under stressful circumstances.

Not everyone understands this, or plays games with this kind of mindset however. Hell, even the most competitive of us sometimes just want to play an easy mindless game as a way to disconnect and unwind after a long day, pursuing fun through Fantasy, Sensation, or Submission instead of Challenge.

OP, perhaps it would help if you think about your wife's personality and which of these 8 Kinds of Fun she tends to value in her own leisure activities. That may help you find games that better match up to the kinds of experiences she will really enjoy. Perhaps that means a co-op game that gives the two of you a chance to work together and to interact, or maybe she would enjoy a simple game that is primarily story driven instead of challenge oriented.

**TL;DR: People enjoy games, and leisure activities in general, for different reasons and with different underlying motivations. Finding someone's motivations will help you find out what kind of games they'll enjoy.**

True,Bobby_Marks,,,"The stories in FF6 and Chrono Trigger are worth going low-fi for. 

I'm going to make a pretty crazy suggestion: go play Final Fantasy 1 for the NES. You don't have to finish it, but play it for a while to get used to where the JRPG was in the 80's. It's a fun game, from a party construction standpoint (I've beaten it over a dozen times), but has little in the way of plot. It wasn't about the plot, it was about a world that was crafted with a variety of monsters and locations and peoples, and it left the player a ton of room to creatively fill in the lore for themselves.

Since that probably isn't your cup of tea, I'd recommend using a walkthrough and stopping after level 15 (unless you are interested in continuing - it is a great game to finish). When you can't stomach anymore, move to FF4 for the SNES. The first great story-driven FF game, 4 is a gem that is often overshadowed by the superior party mechanics of 5 and the WTFBBQOWNAGE of FF6. 

Play 4 with some walkthrough/tutorial/strategy guides, and go as far as you can go. Then do the same with 5, noting how impressively vast the jobs system is. 

Then play 6. It will blow your mind. Finish it. Use walkthroughs, maybe even the rafting loop with turbo to overlevel your characters if you want to consume story content more than getting into the strategy of fighting. This game is the holy grail of RPGs, perfectly executing the combination of story-driven plot-heavy play and an open, free-to-roam world. It has everything, including side characters and stories to be found everywhere you go. If you can stick with FF6 until you get past Figaro Castle, you should be hooked. The pace of these games is very slow, especially coming from western RPGs which IMO all play like FPS or ARPG games anyway.

Then play Chrono Trigger. Often held in high regard along with FF6, you will soon understand why. It has better graphics, a more fluid combat system, and IMO a more interesting world than FF6 (far fewer RPG tropes). Finish this one as well. After these games, you will have a far better understanding of where JRPGs are coming from, and why they are the way they are.

&gt; Turn-based systems in general really break the immersion for us and make the whole thing feel very disjointed. Is there something about it we just don't get? 

Turn-based combat adds depth. In the early days of gaming, combat was either Link shooting sword bolts in four directions, or it was the full-fledged stats, skills, and status management from D&amp;D. Turn-based JRPGs pulled from the D&amp;D side mechanics that allowed incredible depth compared to other RPGs of the time. The powerhouse JRPG franchise stuck with it, and continued to refine it. 

Once you've experienced FF6 and Chrono Trigger, compare them to other Super Nintendo games you've played: does anything else come close? Those two games are more complex and involved (not to mention longer) than many many games released today. The battle system is a huge part of that.

&gt; Some of the fights seem nearly impossible to figure out on your own without looking up a guide. I don't have a problem looking at a guide every once in a while but I hate having to keep it open on my screen the entire time.

Some games are better than others. FF5's job system is regularly hailed as a breakthrough, even though it was a refinement of the system from FF3. What 5 did though was create meaningful fights, where you might fail once but in the process figure out how to get it done. And occasionally you realize that you should go level up some more, but good fights that make good games are the ones that don't make the player suffer.


&gt;The stories just didn't seem really awe-inspiring or immersive. Maybe it's just a cultural difference, but I assumed enjoying anime and Japanese culture in general would help me bridge that gap.

Not necessarily. I have a really hard time with modern JRPGs, largely because they seem chaotic in their plot arcs. Almost like they are needlessly complicated to create a deeper experience. I'm sure good ones exist though, it's just a matter of quality instead of quantity. As we've seen from the rest of the gaming world, quality-over-quantity isn't something big budget studios really allow for regularly.

&gt;Both games, but Lost Odyssey in particular had a ton of text to read through. It seems just crazy sometimes how much you have to read. We're not strangers to reading, and we enjoy fiction, but on the TV screen doesn't seem to be the best medium for it. 

Reading is unfortunately the best way to feed information still. Cut-scenes are expensive to produce, and there can be dozens of hours worth of lore content in these games. Many players are going to skip the lore anyway. If you've ever played old D&amp;D games like Baldur's Gate or Planescape: Torment, you'd know that the best RPG stories still have you reading. A lot. Because written text is the _only place_ where writers aren't subject to the needs and whims of the rest of the development team.

&gt;So maybe I just don't get the JRPG thing and they aren't for me.

And there's nothing wrong with that. Like I said, I haven't been able to enjoy them as much since they went 3D. They are slow-paced, confusing, and frustrating at times. Even in the older ones, they reward a certain combination of frustrated trial-and-error and 100% completeness playstyles. If you want to appreciate them for what they are, start with the older ones and gain some historical context on the series.

Airsoft. I was 14.

Me and this fella named Danny are camped out in the top of a barn. Just two men, two BAR-10's, and more ammo then God himself would have known what to do with. 

And the enemy. Kids from a few neighborhoods down the street. They surrounded that broken down barn like a plague, screaming taunts over the sound of their electric gunfire. You could smell the adderall and mountain dew all the way up in that loft. Me and Danny told each other stories while we waited for the next brave motherfucker to come chargin' in the barn. We just kept puttin' them down but they kept comin'. 

I don't think Danny was ever quite right in the head, but that barn took the last of his mind. He would scream back at that ungodly horde outside. I saw him start to slip away. 

That day wore on for an age. When night came, their whooping turned into some kind of war chant. We looked out at the sparse woods around our wooden prison, illuminated by the pale wash of barrel-mounted flashlights. And we saw the Devil.

One of these monsters had brought his Big Brother. 19 years old. With a God Damned beast of a weapon. A fucking abomination of PVC and steel. We heard that thing spin into action to the sound of cheering outside. And we knew it was the end.

I'm stackin' hay bales against the edge of the loft, trying to give myself enough cover to get one good shot. Danny's just sittin' there. Gun in his hands. He's dead already.

I turn to the entrance of the barn and this ape-man slowly steps into view. There was moonlight on his face. He was laughing.

The scream of his weapon drowns out my own as I hit the floor of that loft. 3 rounds a second worth of plastic is tearing through the bales above me when I look around for Danny. And all I see is his gun on the floor. That's when I hear this sound I'll never forget. It's Danny's war cry.

I look up and Danny's standing on a hay bale, shirt half ripped off. There's a look on his face like he wants to die and take every last one of those bastards to hell with 'im. And he jumps. He fucking *jumps.*

The Big Brother just unloads on Danny as the kid flies at him. But he can't stop what War made. Danny lands a Flying Suplex with perfect form. Big Brother goes down with a groan, but he gets up, struggling to his feet. He throws Danny off him and looks around for me. And he sees me. And I'm looking right back at him. Through the sights on my rifle.

A BAR-10's a good weapon for a good sniper, but it's got some bad pistons right outta the box. You wanna do some damage, you gotta put a heavy spring in there with some steel pistons instead of those shitty plastic ones. Yeah, you go with metal, you can fire BBs weighing up to a gram each at 500 god-fearin' feet per second. 

I pull the trigger and my bullet smacks this ape in the chest. He might as well have been hit by a truck. He goes reeling backwards outta the barn and the cheering outside turns to silence. I hear panic as these kids take off for the hills. I'm almost ecstatic until I see Danny. He's lying there covered in welts. No life left in him. I shut his eyes and left him there. 

In that barn, Danny told me about this pond in his backyard. 'Bout how he used to sit there with his feet in the water and dream about a world without this violence. After what happened, I took his rifle out to the middle of that pond and let it just slip under the water.

I think he would have liked that.

True,NeonRedSharpie,gilded,The Fallen God,"Hey there champ, you feeling any better today?  A little bit?  That's great to hear.  I hope you're really enjoying your stay here with us, well, except for the whole being sick thing.  You want to know more about why you're sick and how long it will last?  Well, how about we play a little game so you can understand everything about Leukemia?  It'll be fun I promise.

So here, take this bag and let's get started.  You know how blood is red when it comes out of your body?  Well it's made up of red blood cells and a thing called plasma.  This plasma is a little over half of what makes up the blood in our bodies.  The plasma is going to be represented by this liquid sugar (corn syrup).  Go ahead and fill up the bag about half way full with the liquid sugar.  There, that's good.  This plasma helps to filter the waste and yucky stuff out of our blood so it can be cleaned again.

Those red blood cells I was talking about just a second ago help carry oxygen around the body.  They last about three months and then they get retired.  New ones are created in the blood factory located inside of your bones.  Why don't you take those red hots over there and throw them in the bag.  Almost as much as the liquid sugar, but a little bit less.  Red hots are going to make up about 44% of our blood soup.

The rest of our blood is made up of white blood cells and platelets.  The white blood cells fight off infection and are going to be represented by these marshmallows here.  Why don't you throw a couple in the bag.  The platelets help our blood to clot when you get a cut, so your blood doesn't splash out everywhere.  Take a few grains of rice and sprinkle them in the first bag here.  Now why don't we write ""HEALTHY BLOOD SOUP"" on the bag.  This is how a healthy blood system looks.

Now, get a second baggy from the pile, and let's fill it up with the same stuff.  Let's put in the sugar, the red hots, and the rice to start with.  Great job.  Ok, now, what Leukemia does is it gets inside of your blood factory and kind of takes over.  Instead of making the tasty marshmallows that keep the bad guys away, it starts to make these things called ""blasts"".  They're white blood cells, but they're not very good at their job.  So instead of putting 9 marshmallows in this bag of blood soup, let's put in only 2.  The other 7 of the white cells are going to be these yucky black jelly beans.

Now let's write ""MY BLOOD SOUP"" on this bag and squish them up real good.  See how in the first bag, the marshmallows and the red hots are all combined and kind of float in the liquid?  But see how in the other blood soup, the black jelly beans just sink to the bottom?  These black jelly beans are in your blood system because of Leukemia.  They don't do as good of a job killing infection and that's why you're sick.

Sure, you can eat the left over marshmallows, and you can have whatever else you want.  I'm sorry that you're stuck in this stupid hospital, but I'm really glad I get to be your nurse.",0,1363893329,,0,False,1,c8zxns1,t3_1aqxqo,t1_c8zxns1,t3_1aqxqo,,1435563717,2045,False,explainlikeIAmA,t5_2t5iz,2045
True,DucAdVeritatem,,,"Whoa whoa whoa, did you just compare welfare to a ""rounding error"" in the budget? According to a report from the non-partisan Congressional Research Service, means tested welfare in 2011 fiscal year totaled some 746 billion dollars. For comparison, social security for the year was 725 billion. Medicare? 480. Non-war defense? 540 billion.

The lie that we spend soooo little helping the poor is getting old. If you take everything our country has spent on war from the Revolutionary War more than 200 years ago, to date in Iraq, and inflation adjust that sum to 2011 dollars, it totals something like 6.9 trillion. Pretty big number, right? 

Well, since the beginning of the mythic ""War on Poverty"" we have spent 19.8 TRILLION fighting poverty. That's right, 3 times what we've spent on war in the entire history of our nation. 

Stop making up these phrases that diminish the magnitude of the spending. You can attempt to defend it all you want, but don't lie about it.

True,Unidan,,,"Biologist here!

Okay, all throughout this thread, there's people claiming whales and dolphins are this or that, so I figured I would try to organize it a bit to stem any confusion.

First off, let's look at how taxonomy works.  Taxonomy, in general, is a system of human-influenced groupings that simply exist to make it easier to make generalizations about organisms.  On a fundamental level, things like the Biological Species Concept break down.  On a genetic basis, many things are on a continuum and are not exactly ""discrete"" from others.  These divisions are generalities.

For example, let's say you have species A, B and C.  A can breed with B, and B with C, but A and C cannot interbreed.  Nevertheless, because A breeds with B and B breeds with C, alleles from species A ends up in the gene pool of species C, even though they literally cannot interbreed.  Are these separate species?  This situation is referred to as a ""ring species,"" one of the many ways you can complicate the common model of ""species"" taught to most students.  

Anyhoo, back to taxonomy, you can take these generalities about groups of organisms and then rank those groupings, which gives us the format we know and love today: Kingdom, Phylum, Order, Class, Family, Genus, Species.  You can tell these *don't always work out perfectly*, because you have things like subphylums, suborders, infraorders, subfamilies, races, morphs, etc.

Alright, so we know whales and dolphins are animals (Kingdom Animalia) and that they have backbones (Phylum Chordata, subphylum Vertebrata).  We also know they are Mammals (Class Mammalia), like us, which is neat, too!  

On top of that, they share a common set of characteristics that put them in the order Cetacea.  Cetaceans are fusiform mammals with modified forelimbs that we call flippers.  They typically posess vestigial hindlimbs and have horizontal tail fins.  One adaptation they've had to a water environment is to lose hair (an adaptation to terrestrial environments) and, instead, possess a thick blubber layer.

Cetacea stems from a word (Cetus) which can literally mean whale, under some translations.  Thus, one could call dolphins a type of whale.  You could also call porpoises whales, under this definition.  Is it a true statement?  Yes.  Is it particularly accurate?  No.  

Scientifically speaking, the term ""cetacean"" is the blanket term for each.  

In OP's post, the cetacean pictured is a False killer whale (*Pseudorca crassidens*).  You could call it a whale and be correct, but not be very accurate.  Dolphin is correct, but again, this is not on the same magnitude of specificity.  It would be like comparing the term ""chemistry"" to the term ""science.""

A better comparison, the one that people seem to be *trying* to make is that this is not specifically a subset of what people think when they think ""whale.""  

They see something that is ""whale-like"" with teeth, which, for many people, conjures images of things like sperm whales (*Physeter macrocephalus*).  This still does not divide up the taxonomy much, as it only excludes baleen whales in suborder Mysticeti.  

Thus, to find the differences, you have to go even *finer* to the suborder level of toothed whales (Odontoceti), which includes things like sperm whales, dolphins and porpoises.  So, even though we have made some large ""taxonomic leaps,"" most of the species that people confuse are still grouped together.

The sperm whale confuses many as they are *larger* than many whales.  Their Family, Physeteridae, only contains three genuses of living species.  In comparison to the array of other members of the order of toothed whales, it is easy to see how they are misclassified at first glance by the casual observer.  

The divisions that split up the order of toothed whales into dolphins and the like are things that may not be readily assessed by laypeople, such as forehead ""melons,"" dorsal fin curvature, pronounced beaks and so forth.  Additionally, the divisions have many exceptions, necessitating genetic sequencing and behavioral observations to truly tell apart and group.  

So here's some guidelines in order to be better understood, at least, scientifically:

* Whales, dolphins and porpoises are all **cetaceans.**
* Technically, everything that is a cetacean can be called a ""whale,"" but that definition is unclear, not typically used, and is scientifically vague.
* Comparing dolphins to all cetaceans is not valid, as the groups overlap.
* Many exceptions exist in classification, so no set of easily-assessed morphologically based rules exist.
* Most people know what you mean when you say ""whale"" versus ""dolphin,"" so gigantic diatribes like this are generally unnecessary.

True,Iamnotanorange,,,"Hey there, I was a TA throughout graduate school for a class that taught these analyses. Here are the answers to your questions. 

&gt; Whether there is a significant difference between maze completion times.

Let me first doublecheck something. Did you counterbalance the maze order? In other words, did the participants always complete maze 1 first, then 2 and 3 after? Or did they sometimes complete 2 first or 3 first? Was this evenly distributed? 

If so, you want to use a repeated measures ANOVA, as existence-essence has suggested. In SPSS, go into Analyze &gt; General Linear Model &gt; Repeated Measures ANOVA. (note: stay away from generalized linear model). 

You'll have a single repeated measure variable with three levels (Maze 1, 2, 3). If the effect of your ""Maze completion time"" variable is significant, you can used paired sample t-tests to examine the differences between each of the levels. That means you'll run a paired t-test for Maze 1 vs 2, Maze 2 vs 3 and Maze 3 vs 1.  

&gt;Whether there is a significant difference between word recall in each music condition (WORD1/WORD2/WORD3)

This is the same as the repeated measures ANOVA I explained above. Just replace ""Maze completion time"" with ""word recall""

&gt;Whether the level of enjoyment relates to time taken to complete mazes, and the number of words recalled.

This can be addressed by using a Pearson correlation between the enjoyment of music 1 and the time to complete maze while listening to music 1. (Repeat for music 2). Don't report the correlations for enjoyment of music 1 and time while listening to music 2. That doesn't make sense and you increase your risk of Type I error. 

One of the problems with this analysis is (if you counterbalanced your maze order for every subject) some of your subjects are completing maze 1 first and some are completing it last, when they will be substantially faster. This is OK in a large rmANOVA, where you include all the counterbalanced levels, but correlations within one of those levels (e.g. music 1) will be confounded by the order the participants completed the maze. 

A good way around this would be to a) separate the subjects based on maze order and run correlations separately within each ""order"" group. Or you could run a regression, using Maze1 as your DV, and both order and enjoy1 as your IVs.   

&gt;Whether how often people listen to music while studying effects their maze time and word recall.

The simplest way would be a Pearson correlation between ""Often"" and the maze-time variables, or ""Often"" and the word recall variables. That should work ok, but not as well as the next option. 

Next option: You might want to average together your 3 maze-time variables into a new variable (maybe call it AVE_MAZE). This should be a more robust measurement of maze completion time and won't be as affected by the order they ran the maze. Same deal for word recall. 

I hope you found this to be helpful. Good luck on your assignment!

American taxpayers fund between 20 and 25 percent of Israel's defense budget (depending on how you calculate this). Twenty-six percent of the $3 billion in military aid we grant to the Jewish state each year is spent in Israel on Israeli defense products. Uniquely, Israeli companies are treated like American companies for purposes of U.S. defense procurement. Thanks to congressional earmarks, we also often pay half the costs of special Israeli research and development projects, even when - as in the case of defense against very short-range unguided missiles -- the technology being developed is *essentially* irrelevant to our own military requirements. (Though someone is going to bring up C-RAM as if thats not essentially irrelevant).  In short, in many ways, American taxpayers fund jobs in Israel's military industries that could have gone to our own workers and companies. Meanwhile, Israel gets pretty much whatever it wants in terms of our top-of-the-line weapons systems, and we pick up the tab.

This 26% is a special privilege that no other country enjoys. Its one of many special arrangements that goes beyond the $3billion figure. 

[WaPo](http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/united-states-needs-to-reevaluate-its-assistance-to-israel/2011/10/15/gIQAK5XksL_story.html)

&gt;In addition, the military funding for Israel is handled differently than it is for other countries. Israel’s $3 billion is put almost immediately into an interest-bearing account with the Federal Reserve Bank. The interest, collected by Israel on its military aid balance, is used to pay down debt from earlier Israeli non-guaranteed loans from the United States.
Another unique aspect of the assistance package is that about 25 percent of it can be used to buy arms from Israeli companies. [No other country has that privilege](http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/united-states-needs-to-reevaluate-its-assistance-to-israel/2011/10/15/gIQAK5XksL_story.html), according to a September 2010 CRS report.
Look for a minute at the bizarre formula that has become an element of U.S.-Israel military aid, the so-called qualitative military edge (QME). Enshrined in congressional legislation, it requires certification that any proposed arms sale to any other country in the Middle East “will not adversely affect Israel’s qualitative military edge over military threats to Israel.”

I should add this post from [decemvir](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/ogrwz/russia_fears_israel_is_pushing_us_toward_iran_war/c3h947z)

&gt;The US spends well over an order of magnitude more on defense. The United States spends 5% of Israel's entire defense budget on MIT's Lincoln Labs, a single academic research institute. Israel's relative technological prowess comes from either back-channel American funding and support over the last five decades to build up their aerospace and communications industry, or direct influence (eg, Intel setting up shop there). The only half-decent purchase I can even think of from the last thirty years are the Pioneer/Shadow UAVs, which, while good (my day job is writing code for UAV autopilots for civilian and military non-combat use), are simply the US reaping their own investment and putting money back into it. Israel's also very insular about their home-grown technology. If it really is developed in-house, they'll usually keep it for themselves.

2010 to begin negotiations to purchase advanced F-15 fighters. In turn, Israel — using $2.75 billion in American military assistance — has been allowed to buy 20 of the new F-35 fifth-generation stealth fighters being developed by the United States and eight other nations.

&gt;Another military program, called U.S. War Reserves Stocks for Allies, begun in the 1980s, allows the United States to store arms and equipment on Israeli bases for use in wartime. In the 1990s, the arrangement was expanded to allow Israel to use the weapons, but only with U.S. permission. During the 2006 war against Hezbollah in Lebanon, the United States gave permission for Israel to use stored cluster artillery shells to counter rocket attacks. The use drew international complaints because the rockets struck civilian rather than military areas.

&gt;The initial limit was $100 million worth of stored missiles, armored vehicles and artillery munitions, but that has increased over time. It reached $800 million in 2010, $1 billion this year and by 2012, it is expected to grow to $1.2 billion.

An economist tackled this problem in 2002 and came up to a [1.6 trillion figure in 2002](http://www.csmonitor.com/2002/1209/p16s01-wmgn.html).  YMMV, but simply looking at ~$3bn annually is a huge misstep. 

Portion of this list from 2002 (ten years old) - Can be debated, but relevant to show the weaknesses in simply looking at ~$3bn annually. 

&gt;In 1973, for instance, Arab nations attacked Israel in an attempt to win back territories Israel had conquered in the 1967 war. President Nixon resupplied Israel with US arms, triggering the Arab oil embargo against the US.

&gt;That shortfall in oil deliveries kicked off a deep recession. The US lost $420 billion (in 2001 dollars) of output as a result, Stauffer calculates. And a boost in oil prices cost another $450 billion.

&gt;Afraid that Arab nations might use their oil clout again, the US set up a Strategic Petroleum Reserve. That has since cost, conservatively, $134 billion, Stauffer reckons.

&gt;Other US help includes:

• US Jewish charities and organizations have remitted grants or bought Israel bonds worth $50 billion to $60 billion. Though private in origin, the money is ""a net drain"" on the United States economy, says Stauffer.

• The US has already guaranteed $10 billion in commercial loans to Israel, and $600 million in ""housing loans."" (See editor's note below.) Stauffer expects the US Treasury to cover these.

• The US has given $2.5 billion to support Israel's Lavi fighter and Arrow missile projects.

• Israel buys discounted, serviceable ""excess"" US military equipment. Stauffer says these discounts amount to ""several billion dollars"" over recent years.

• Israel uses roughly 40 percent of its $1.8 billion per year in military aid, ostensibly earmarked for purchase of US weapons, to buy Israeli-made hardware. It also has won the right to require the Defense Department or US defense contractors to buy Israeli-made equipment or subsystems, paying 50 to 60 cents on every defense dollar the US gives to Israel.

&gt;US help, financial and technical, has enabled Israel to become a major weapons supplier. Weapons make up almost half of Israel's manufactured exports. US defense contractors often resent the buy-Israel requirements and the extra competition subsidized by US taxpayers.

• US policy and trade sanctions reduce US exports to the Middle East about $5 billion a year, costing 70,000 or so American jobs, Stauffer estimates. Not requiring Israel to use its US aid to buy American goods, as is usual in foreign aid, costs another 125,000 jobs.

• Israel has blocked some major US arms sales, such as F-15 fighter aircraft to Saudi Arabia in the mid-1980s. That cost $40 billion over 10 years, says Stauffer.

this is an excellent do/don't list that highlights common mistakes designers make, and offers alternative strategies for accomplishing important goals without sacrificing usability.

this brief but entertaining read contains a wealth of valuable info on common human cognitive and neurological processes, and how designers take these into account when constructing interfaces.  i couldn't put it down.

* *[homepage usability](http://www.amazon.com/Homepage-Usability-50-Websites-Deconstructed/dp/073571102X)*, by jakob neilsen and marie tahir

while this book is quite dated, at least by internet standards (2001), one shouldn't dismiss its core precepts out-of-hand.  user habits do not change as quickly as design trends. the book contains detailed deconstructions of many popular websites.  so long as you read it in tandem with your original research, you'll be able to distinguish for yourself which guidelines from the book still apply. i found it to be useful.

i'm currently reading this book, which is also a little dated, but the information in it is still valuable.  it deals specifically with the presentation of data, which is important for designing interfaces for applications that present data to the user.  this is a large part of our company's new CMS, which, in addition to website content management, also allows our clients to track user traffic to their sites, monitor their inventories, manage customer leads and prospects, conduct mystery shops, manage human resources, and assign and manage employee tasks.  we collect data on all of these things, and presenting that data clearly and effectively is one of our chief concerns.

this is pretty much the bible on the graphical display of information. even though it deals primarily with the display of data, some of the concepts can also be applied to user interface design, and of course, it's very useful when it comes to the display of analytics. the most salient concepts i've encountered so far deal with the data-ink ratio and chart junk, and how sometimes user preferences can actually make it more difficult for them to read data correctly.

We split up, as he went to the drivers aid and I to the minivan. The whole front of the minivan looked like a crushed soda can. When I arrived at the van, there was a mother and 4 children in the car. The oldest had been in the front, her legs were pinned and she had been knocked unconscious . I ran back out to our truck and retrieved a crowbar and returned. When I got back the mother had gotten the rest of her kids out, and was panicking. That's when I started working. With all of our strength and a couple of bends, we had free'd the girl. I started performing first aid on her mangled leg, suddenly it hit me. I knew her, in fact we went the same school and we had classes together too. After that I finished taking care of her and getting her away from the car (I noticed fluid coming out of the engine block). Alas she woke and immediately had the whole *""What the FUCK just happened?* moment, recognized me and immediately hugged me without saying a word. Then **Finally** the ambulance, police, and fire dept. showed up and I went to check on my dads progress on the drunk driver. What I saw **scarred me** from that day forward. The man had been thrown from his old nissan altima, which was barely recognizable, and hit a tree. His body looked to have the equivalent of spaghetti with the sauce being blood, and lots of it. He barely had a pulse and was already being treated by EMS workers. Somehow he was still alive while airlifting him to the hospital, but not for long. He died in the sky over my town on the way to the hospital as I had heard over one of the EMS workers radio.

True,NotLateJustAWizard,,,"I knew my ex since we were kids.  I know it's a complete cliche, but I fell head-over-heels for him when I was 16.  All of my friends and family supported us, and we kept our relationship going through college.  Long distance was tough, but we'd talk almost every night and have sexy skype times on the weekend.  I ignored little things that didn't seem important then.  For example, he never talked about plans with friends but he sometimes missed calls because he was ""busy"".  Also, I don't consider myself materialistic, but I was hurt when he didn't buy me presents for my b-day or Christmas - he always claimed he was ""out of cash"".  Of course, he always managed to win me over with some gesture or another.  


We got through the rough patches though - I still believed he was my knight-in-shining-armor.  So much so that after graduation I turned down a job offer in Austin because he ended up taking a job in Dallas.  We moved there and I had to take up shifts at a local restaurant while hunting for a decent job.  There were times when I felt things weren't clicking exactly - god, how naive I was - but I brushed them off, as we were planning a December wedding. 


The wedding went off without a hitch.  He seemed loving and totally devoted to me, and the number of times he was unexpectedly late had diminished.  And just when I thought *we made it*, things came to a head during our honeymoon.  I had always wanted to go to the UK, so we had planned a 10 day tour for our honeymoon.  He made a lot of calls before our trip - very suspicious in hindsight, as he wouldn't tell me who he was calling - but at the time, I foolishly thought he was planning a surprise for me.  Yeah, well what a surprise it was.  


About halfway through our trip he said he wasn't feeling well - maybe it was the fish - but that I should go visit Urquart castle anyway because we already paid for the tour.  I loved him - *actually LOVED him* - for being ""selfless"" and letting me explore the castle instead of watching him puke.  He knows that I've never been able to be around sick people.  So off I went, happy that my husband loved me enough to give me independence.  Except the tour ended early, and when I got back to our room he wasn't there.  I checked in with reception, and they said they saw him leave with a woman *they assumed was his wife* two hours ago.  


I think I went into shock, because I don't remember how I got from reception to my room, or what I did to pass the time.  All I remember is hearing his card swipe outside the door and his footsteps in the hall.  ""Kara...""  He said my name, and I knew from his tone that he knew the jig was up.  Just hearing his voice filled me with a bubbling rage, and I stood up to go smack him.  He spoke again: ""Kara, please, let me say something first.""  I was ready to slap him, but a tiny, foolish bit of hope in me told me to stay my hand, that maybe he had an explanation for all of this.  And then he said, ""Can I have tree fiddy?""

I have touched a moon rock and it blows my mind to this very day that I could touch such a thing.

Look at it this way.  You touched a piece of something not of this earth.  A solid and discernible object.  That object was a picked up by a man on interplanetary body after days in a space capsule using the gravity of the orbiting bodies to slingshot him there.  After getting into a lunar orbit they detached a landing craft and landed on that interplanetary body.  He collected that moon rock and put it into the landing body and they took off and rendezvoused with the original spacecraft that was orbiting the moon.  They then burned back to the earth and landed in the ocean. 

This was done in the 1960s!  Think about what sort of advances we have made and what life was like back then!

You touched an honest to goodness miracle in my book.  I mean science and math made it possible and understandable but goddamn dude.  We flew to the mother fucking moon and scooped up rocks and brought them back!

Think about how many people throughout the eons of human thinking have looked up at the moon and wondered what it felt like.  Or what it was made out of.  Right now if it's dark and clear you can look up at that moon and think ""I touched a piece of that bitch ass moon""

True,NPPraxis,,,"First, let me clarify that I am defining Retirement in the Mr. Money Mustache sense; I am retired when I am capable of living at a basic level entirely on passive income without need for employment.

This does not mean I can buy boats or expensive cars or even go out to the bar every night.  If I desire luxuries I will need to do consulting work, side jobs, or part time work.  If I don't, I can stay home and a 4% withdrawal rate (leaving any additional income to grow the investment) will cover all of my basic living needs- rent, food, clothes, gas, insurance.

With this definition of retirement, I can comfortably quit my job with a net worth of $500k.

4% withdrawal rate leaves me with an income of $20k, which is about what I am living on now (remember, 1/3rd to 1/2 of my income) happily and frugally.  I live in a low cost of living region (so rent is cheap), own my car outright, cook everything at home and take it to work, etc.

However, this is actually being *conservative*.

Currently, my cost of living is bouncing between 1/2 and 1/3rd of my monthly income.  Everything else goes in to investments.

I am aggressively buying real estate, leveraged.  The returns are very high on leveraged real estate currently, due to absurdly low mortgage interest.  Running the math on my properties, the internal rate of return is around 10-11% on the actual properties (i.e. a 100k house returns ~$10.5k a year in rent after taxes and insurance), but the return on equity is around 16% (comparing after-PITI profit to after-loan equity) because I only put a little of my own money in to that property.  See [**Scenario 2 in this article**](http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/02/24/pay-down-the-mortgage-or-invest-more-a-winwin-question/) for a sample on the math.

There's another trick here to being able to hit retirement quickly; it's a lot easier to buy undervalued investments in real estate than the stock market.  You can buy a 50k foreclosure that needs 20k work to be worth 100k.  That's 70k for a property that produces the rental income of a 100k property.  You add 30k to your net worth the instant you fix up the property, which is a ~43% gain to the money you put in.  Via this method combined with leverage combined with saving most of my income I have been able to so far actually grown my net worth annually by an amount *higher than my annual salary*.  (Granted, I've only been doing this with real estate for a year.)

I expect I will be beating market returns significantly when I have 500k in net worth due to the leverage, however, *I am assuming I won't* when I say I can live on a 4% withdrawal rate.  If I am still getting a 16% return on equity instead of the 7% I am assuming, yay for me, I'll max out my IRA and put the rest in to a savings fund for my next house and buy a friend a beer.

I intend to continue to contribute to an IRA so when I hit my 60's I can have a ""second retirement"" with tax-advantaged money as well.

Not a glamorous rich retirement, but an enjoyable one.  If I get bored with the free time and stop learning languages and instruments and traveling to low-cost countries (I already fly for free whenever I want by churning credit cards), I can do ""riskier"" income producing projects like trying to write a book to sell or trying to write apps to sell or start a home business or do consulting with all the free time.",0,1363928196,,0,False,1,c909h41,t3_1arbpc,t1_c909h41,t1_c9067d2,,1431665617,20,False,financialindependence,t5_2t34z,20

True,martypanic,,,"Yeah, most of reddit doesn't seem to understand that we don't live in a vacuum, and that racism/sexism/homophobia exist in the real world and have had huge cultural ramifications, which is why you get arguments like ""saying cracker isn't any different then saying nigger!"" When anybody who has experienced a place that is actually racist knows that's utter bullshit. It's similar to the casual acceptance of the word ""faggot,"" and how people use it under the guise that they're ""re-appropriating the word,"" when really they're just recycling a joke from /b/ that was tired in like 2009. Also, newsflash guys, you're doing nothing for the re-appropriation of that word, you're making it worse. Using it in that way is essentially saying that it's okay to use a word that means ""homosexual"" to mean ""stupid"" or whatever is homophobic and ignorant, and if you think you're being *edgy* or whatever, knock it off. Yeah you can argue all you want, but if you knew how many young kids think it's okay to say that you might be singing a different tune. [nuclearcircular has a really good post about this in this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1as6i9/welcome_to_reddit/c90anqm).

These criticisms are often combated with the same couple arguments; ""I know a black guy/I am a black guy who thinks racist jokes are funny"" ""DAE Chris Rock routine"", etc. I don't really need to go into why these arguments are stupid because if you stoop to using them, you probably know you're wrong anyway and you're trying to just find an excuse to be a jackass.

Also, for a site where the general community thinks they're so forward-thinking, it's pretty unbelievably sexist. There was a ""good girl gina"" macro on /r/circlejerk awhile ago where the caption was pretty much ""gives you a blowjob"", and I think that summed up the general community's feelings toward women pretty well. I know it's no longer cool to use the phrase ""friendzone"" around here anymore, but the sentiment is still there; that women are sexual vending machines where you can just keep pumping in friendliness coins until you get sex/blowjobs/whatever. Another commonly-massaged idea is that women are cold bitches that will take take your money, home, and children away from you and then accuse you of rape. Again, don't really need to get into why this is sexist because it's just an ignorant-as-fuck generalization. 

What tends to come up a lot in these sexist circlejerk threads is the fact that men can be raped, can be the victim of sexual/domestic abuse, etc. This is one of the worst arguments you can possibly make. Without sounding like I'm downplaying it at all, these cases happen much less then the abuse against women and- wait for it- *are not an argument that has to do with women at all*. I seriously don't get how people even think that this is an argument. Sometimes the people making this argument even sound like they're implying that *it's okay because it happens to us too*, which makes me want to blow my brains out. Most of the time, however, it comes from the whole ""men are oppressed"" thing, which is almost as common as the ""whites are oppressed"" thing. Seriously, if you think like this, stop. Educate yourself. Do some critical thinking. Be empathetic. 

I should point out that I'm talking about adult sexual abuse towards men, as far as I know (I'm not an expert) it happens just as often to little boys as it does to little girls. Probably saved myself about 50 comments saying that.

Basically what I'm saying is that Cptn_Sisko is right, plenty of redditors completely lack empathy (and critical thinking, knowledge of history and culture, etc.). I hate to complain about users getting downvotes but it's seriously kind of depressing that he currently sits at +13/-14 just for saying that it's hard being black/lgbt/female on reddit. He's fucking right you guys.

Anyway, that's enough. Seriously, I love you guys, but some of you need to take a step back and think about what you're saying sometimes.

True,ProlapsedPineal,,,"Can you smell the Bengay and beef jerky? It's old man story time hour. I do this for you because of Don Quixote and I was, and still am, a champion of vile windmills and savior of maidens in distress wherever they may be found.

I was thighs deep into the punk scene in Boston and Cambridge during the 80s. People all had different cliques just as they do now but it was a little different as anything that changes after 20 years tends to be. 

The tribes would break down by geography as well as class (punk, skin, hippy, goth, metalhead, stoner, mods etc). These classes all have skill trees and alignments and different combos make you and they approach each other differently. Different tribes have different rules. Sure there's lots of cross over but some things just dont mix. It's natures way of saying don't put pickle juice in your chocolate milk.

I hailed from the tribe of mohawks, devillocks, ""jailhouse"" tattoos, parties of people on acid, runaways, artists, musicians, skaters and anarchists. I'm sure someone here will remember The Pit in harvard square during the 80s, if you do, we were probably friends. 

Skinheads had their own tribes. One group that was prevalent in Cambridge I had a number of good friends in. This would be what I think of when I think of skins. Hard working, blue collar guys, some back from the Army. Scooters, flight jackets, doc martins, sharp dressers, clean shaven, polite and takers of no shits ever. We have different politics but we all get along. These guys are my Ska/Cro-mags/Slapshot type skins. I'm using bands because it's the fastest way to give you context if you're familiar with them.

The rule on the streets was that the color of your laces and suspenders said something about who you were that you wanted to let the world know. It was like wearing a team's jersey. If you saw someone on the T with a Bruins shirt you knew you could talk hockey with them. If you saw a guy in a flight jacket with white laces in his docs you could talk about something else. White Power. 

My tribe did not like the white power tribe. We thought they were dingbat racists and should mostly be left alone because that dog bites. I think that the closest time that there was ever a true peace treaty was when one of the runaways - there were lots of runaways living in and around The Pit in Cambridge at the time - she was assaulted at a party. It was a sixteen year old skin-chick who got drunk and alllllllll of the young braves from all the tribes took it personally. Life sucks sometimes, why hurt someone down on her luck? This is also 20+ years ago. There's no internet. Sexual crimes happen and cops say ""well, don't be 16 and drunk, where are you from? We're sending you home."" 

No superman is coming to save this day, is Bobby busy? Lets start making calls.

This was my first exposure to diplomacy. Hey Swinga, you know that skin chick with the red bangs? Yeah. Somebody hurt her. If you guys aren't busy we need to have a talk with him. Dudly at midnight. That kinda thing. Some guys were way into the excuse to fuck with someone than the making things right thing but we're talking drug addicts, runaways, a whole mish mash of people who all, in our own rights, have our own axes to grind. The guy who messed with the girl, he was going to get some misdirected anger and street justice from a pack of anarchists, with some skins involved. We needed Tanks. He had friends.

Now down the skill tree of skinhead evolution you have the optional and unsavory tree of racial / national supremacy. The National Front was a polite way of saying Nazis. The NF at the time would identify themselves by wearing red laces in their boots and or wearing suspenders that were also red. Side note: at the time, I don't know if it holds true today, but then, if you wore your suspenders down around your ass it meant you were looking for a fight. 

These things might not mean anything today, but this was tribal in the most literal way that I can think of. I wish I could talk to an anthropologist about the social structures and politics of how anarchists worked. Even the most conservative skinheads were unafraid of working outside of the boundaries of the law. I think it worked like this.

Anarchist punks: Fun to party with. 

Skins: Fun to ... I don't know, they were kinda boring to me. I liked some one on one but I think Vespa scooters are goofy so I knew I couldn't go for that. Also, I like black leather and painting my jacket so we can't get along too much apparently.

Goths/Artists/Metalheads/Potheads: Take their women, hear the lamentation of their Bauhaus tshirts, and see their guitar strings and pastels scattered before you.


You said you were interested. I'm giving it to you. I think that we all still need people to pass down stories.

Now that we have the groundwork laid out to some extent this is the story of how the National Front kicked my ass and saved it because they thought I was the little brother of one of The Immortals of the National Front and shit themselves after kicking my ass.

There was this one dude that worked in ""The Garage"" in Harvard Square. The Garage if you haven't been there is named such because it's built like a multi level parking garage but stores have replaced  parking areas. He was named, as far as I know, Nazi Chris. NC was a big man. I was probably around 16 at the time so him being 22, and much larger than I... Basically to me he was the giant with the fucked up teeth in 300 with the chains on his wrists looking for a reason to fight, and was openly a neo nazi. I hate Boston Nazis. I also hate giants with fucked up teeth who can eat me. Give a respect-nod to another brave from another tribe, move along, don't fuck with the spooky pitbull.

There used to be a place near South Station Boston called The Channel. The best shows of my life I saw there and it's ruined me for stadiums forever. Rollins, Danzig, Circle Jerks, Gwar, The Meatmen, Butthole Surfers (missed that one 18 plus show winky tears) it goes on and on. This place was Punk Mecca. Better than The Rat. I liked all kinds of music and heard that Slapshot was going to play the Channel. 

Step one. Talk to skinhead friends that aren't jerks. Ask when they are going because there is safety in numbers and the bright red mohawk + devillock is a dead giveaway that I am an outsider to the tribe. I want to go to the skinhead show because Choke is badass and I listened to [Step On It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1iv3TwQC-A) so many times in ""boarding school"" I must pay tribute to this shaman of ""go fuck yourself. MY WAY"". 

I get a pass from the skinhead ""gang"" that I'm friends with and make plans to meet with them. I get into the show and slapshot is ripping it up. If you don't know what I'm talking about thank blessed internet because it has recordings of one similar to it. Less blood and fights though. It's friendly CQC. Context:

People would be brutal but it was all done in a respect your enemy kind of way. Make a circle, if you get in it you're in it. If someone outside gets tagged strong you apologize. If you hurt someone you help them up. People got hurt but there was very rarely hard feelings. If you walk in you knew where you were walking.

The general convention of tribal diplomacy is that it's unwise to be a punk and walk into skin territory. They owned The Channel this day, but I thought I had my friends at my back. 

Didn't find them. Go on in. Play the game as usual. Never show fear. Never back away. I get in and just have fun at the show. It's probably about 3 songs in and Slapshot is playing You're No Friend of Mine I think. I'm sweating buckets and 

*TWEEEEIIIIIINNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNGGGGGGGKKKKKKKKK*

That's the sound of bells ringing in your head after you just got a closed knuckle punch to the side of your head from a very large skinhead who doesn't like kids with leather jackets and mohawks. 

I came to being dragged by 4 skinheads all in tshirts, wifebeaters, and red suspenders and laces. The first thing I remember was hearing one of them yell ""WE'RE WITH THE NATIONAL FRONT AND WE'RE HERE TO HELP YOU. DO YOU WANT A GLASS OF WATER.""

My mortal enemies, are saving me from getting curb stomped. This is new and interesting.

Yes please. My head is exploding. They physically dragged me up onto a bench, got me water, checked my eyes and made sure I was ok. I had some water, decided this would be a good time to exit stage right because.... what the hell was that... went home and talked to people over the next few days.

I found out that the rumor was that I was Nazi Chris' little brother. This is years before decades before twitter, facebook, even cellphones were exotic. Information traveled in books and gossip. I found out that all of the nazi and white power skinheads thought that I was the little brother of an Evil Leonidas, king of Sparta. Nazi Chris.

My balls grew 10 times that day. I had a +10 resistance to skinhead fights. Nobody ever found out that I wasn't his little brother and I exploited that every chance I could get. See those skins over there? Check this out.

Hey dude, got a light? WHO THE FUCK ARE oh. Yeah, Murphy, you got a light right. Have a nice day kid. 

I don't think that I suffered major brain trauma from being punched out but it did alter how I think about things due to the experiences. 

Brain is done with making words for now. Maybe more another time if you'd like.

Brain functions are returning to normalized operational levels. People don't often do this but you might like personal context. This is the face that got mashed at the skinhead show. I think stories work better with pictures. I might make a kids book out of it.

True,Shaper_pmp,,,"It's not the number of people so much as it's [the feeling of belonging to a club](http://philosophtly.blogspot.co.uk/2009/12/internet-memes-are-not-without-purpose.html).

Memes serve as shibboleths - they allow group-members to identify each other, reinforce group-bonding and allow people to feel like part of a defined tribe or social group (which in turn - thanks to millions of years of evolutionary advantage in belonging to a tribe - activates all sorts of reward pathways in the brain and makes people feel good).

When a meme is co-opted away from its original group (4chan-&gt;reddit, reddit-&gt;facebook, facebook-&gt;a faceless multinational corporation, etc) it becomes diluted.  Now the meme is worn and advertised by people who have nothing to do with the original group and don't know the original meaning of the meme... and in fact often who don't even know it *has* any meaning beyond ""some weird picture"".

Now when group members see the meme it's lost all meaning and association - it no longer represents ""them"" or ""their tribe"", and as such causes no sense of belonging to their tribe, and activates no social-success or group-membership reward pathways in their brain.

People talk about meme-dilution as if someone's ""stealing"" something from them because it feels like it is - previously encountering the meme caused them to feel positive reward feelings associated with group-bonding and social approval, but now (thanks to the actions of others, *not* in their tribe or group) it doesn't.

Those good associations and the happiness they engender has been ""stolen"" by the clueless outsiders, depriving the group of that bond and that shared experience until another meme is created to replace it.

This feeling of loss is real (if usually subconscious), and is a large part of why people get so pissy with outsiders (and especially commercial entities) that appropriate and dilute memes and in-jokes from various groups due to ignorance or for crass commercial profit.

It's not necessarily entirely defensible for people to feel that way, but I think it's entirely *understandable* why they often do.

-----

As an aside, I suspect this is why the average on-line community - left to its own devices, without heavy-handed moderation - always seems to descend into a morass of memes, in-jokes and masturbatory self-reference.

By analogy, refined sugar was evolutionarily rare (and hence often worth gorging on whenever it was available).  As such we developed a profound and instinctive attraction to sugary snacks, but never needed to develop an *instinctive* counterbalancing force to stop us eating too much of them.

However, now we don't have to hunt for seasonal fruit, and we can eat practically any kind of (and as much) food we want almost all the time, we have a massive obesity problem as people are having to learn to *consciously* override their *evolved* near-limitless desire for sugary crap.  We're getting there, but it's *really fucking hard* as a society to learn to consciously moderate behaviour evolved over the course of millions of years.

Similarly, historically we get a sense of reward and wellbeing from being part of a group.  Historically that was comparatively rare - you'd only gain social approval for succeeding at some difficult achievement or exemplifying some trait the group found particularly valuable (craftsmen, warrior, raising a lot of children, sacrificing something of yours for other individuals' or the group's benefit, etc).

Again, we developed a drive to acquire social approval and feel like part of a large, powerful group, but (due to no need for it) little in the way of counter-balancing drives to prevent us indulging to excess.

Just as with sugary snacks, however, these days (with the advent of on-line communities) we're *post-scarcity* when it comes to social approval.  Instead of going out and killing a mammoth or painstakingly raising children or crafting a valuable object you can just jump on your favourite social network and post a hive-mind-pleasing comment.

The only down-side to that is that thoughtful, insightful comments require intelligence, originality and creativity - it's even easier to merely *reference* a shared meme or in-joke to get the same effect.  Hence communities get overrun by social-approval addicts who create and consume minimum-effort memes and image macros in a runaway feedback loop of social gratification.

**TL;DR:** In exactly the same way I suspect the current trend towards obesity is primarily caused by an evolutionarily-unprecedented freak abundance of doughnuts, I suspect the problem with memes and low-effort, low-investment social-gratification-porn overtaking and squeezing out good content in on-line communities is caused by the fact we have a powerful evolved drive to trigger our ""monkey-belong-tribe-feel-good"" instinct, and no opposing *evolved* drive to limit how often or desperately we keep [hitting that particular happy-lever](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat_Park).

**Edit:** I suspect this is also why many people instinctively hold attention-seekers (eg, karma-whores and novelty accounts on reddit) in such low esteem - they're addicted to that feeling of social approval, and (like any other addict) their monomania and constant badgering for a fix quickly becomes boring and irritating to others around them... as well as the fact that (in on-line communities) they tend to actively accelerate the process of mindless attention-seeking, memes and other low-investment, low-effort content taking over.

True,Storm_Shock,luna,,"I'm Zedrin, and I was the lead animator on this project.

I do appreciate criticism and feedback, but at the same time there's a few issues I'm noticing recurringly--

There's a difference between critique and expectations. A lot of people are stating their expectations and expecting them to pass as critiques. This was a fan made work by all means, and can't really hold up to the standards of the show itself-- thus these expectations are a bit unrealistic.

That doesn't mean a critique can't be made on what can be done to be more like the show, or better overall. However, there's a lot of inconsistencies I've noticed:

People either *loved* the voiceacting or hated it/claimed it was mediocre. There's no mention of why it goes either direction--not to mention most people in this fandom are REALLY BAD at critiquing voice work, so it's often easier to dismiss a comment on VA work than it is to dismiss a story about an OC.

Animation-wise, people either said it was good or that it was meh, very rarely have people mentioned what was specifically wrong with it-- however, I've gotten enough mentions that it was mostly with the pacing and transitions/cuts, and this I'll wholly agree with. Our storyboarder did a very lazy job, so I had to come in and rush to get some loose, better animatics out so we could start animating on time. However, they were a lot more general than specific, mostly the minimum for what's necessary for an animatic. (Future projects will definitely feature more animatic work, I can guarantee that, especially since they won't be on deadlines.)

Writing wise, there's been a few legit complaints, mostly that there was too much talking, and that she was blind without reason (or that this fact wasn't expressed clearly). On the note of monologuing: I think this was mostly educational for Meredith. VAs want to write in a LOT of talking. I had persuaded several cuts out of the script, but a lot still remained. For several shots, I ran out of ideas on what to do because it was just 'wordswordswords'.

On the note of blindness, however (which was brought up in 3 different scenes, so I'm confused how it isn't clear that she is), one thing that a lot of people missed was that because she's blind, she has no disposition to night or day. Because of this, she's able to connect to Luna a bit easier, and is more attentive to the night (which, combined with a stronger sense of touch and hearing, helped her figure out how to turn the undeveloped snowflakes into 'star-shaped' ones, which allowed the pegasi to take better control of winter storms). We tried to draw parallels to Luna as winter, and Celestia as spring.

Maybe the blindness was also present to slightly make her a bit more of a 'pityable' character, yet I can't confirm/deny this. Would be a question for Meredith.

In regards to final cuts, a few issues did come up. After Effects is, in short, SLOW. It can take 7 seconds to edit a single property in one keyframe when you have enough layers/effects, and 3-6 seconds per frame during export. Many of the errors we found we found after the preliminary (uncompressed AVI) render (these were then stitched together in the Premiere file). Fixing an error in just a single shot often would take an hour or longer just to render, which is why some of them were left unfixed. (Over spring break, my schedule was: wake up at 2pm, animate or work in AE from 3pm to 3am, go to bed at 6am, over the course of 5 days, so I wasn't really willing to do more after this bout.)

One thing that is disappointing me though is just how few comments I've gotten on the AE lighting. D: I don't know if people liked it or thought it was unnecessary, and I'm starting to wonder if it was even worth it (best example would be on Luna and Celestia in the snowflake room).

Seriously though, I just hope never to cross paths with her again.

Right next to the train station he had to use in order to go to work and next to the best grocery stores. Fortunately the restraining order is no longer in place and I think she moved away.

It's a shame, since I got along with my mother better than with my dad for most of my life.

Sanskrit is a language that people who study languages love for a lot of reasons. One, there is lots of stuff written in Sanskrit. Two, we have lots of stuff from way back when: The Vedas, the oldest texts, are from nearly 4000 years ago. 

Most importantly, three, we have books composed (not written- this was all spoken out loud, like Homer's stuff) about 2500 years ago telling us exactly how Sanskrit works: What sounds are in it, how you put a sentence together, how you tell what a sentence means. The people who did this are called *grammarians*. 

These works are works of art, especially the way the rules are arranged: they are definitely, in a lot of cases, something a computer could understand, and they are very logical. 

What I got from this abstract is that these people are attempting to say that because the grammarians were able to describe Sanskrit in this way, the gap between artificial- computer- language and natural- spoken by people- languages is not so great. 

-----

Looking through the paper, this seems a bit nutty because I think they're saying that because you can do this-- equate natural and artificial languages-- with Sanskrit used in within the grammatical tradition-- you might be able to do this with other languages. In Sanskrit, the Grammarians wrote down a set of rules, and then wrote sentences that followed those rules, ignoring a lot of messiness that actually exists in language. It's like saying that since Newtonian physics describes objects moving in a frictionless vacuum perfectly, we should also be able to use it to talk about string theory.

**But DRM needs to become a standard or Hollywood will boycott the web!**

""The perception is that Hollywood will never allow movies onto the Web if it can't encumber them with DRM restrictions. But the threat that Hollywood could take its toys and go home is illusory. Every film that Hollywood releases is already available for those who really want to pirate a copy. Huge volumes of music are sold by iTunes, Amazon, Magnatune and dozens of other sites without the need for DRM. Streaming services like Netflix and Spotify have succeeded because they are more convenient than piratical alternatives, not because DRM does anything to enhance their economics. The only logically coherent reason for Hollywood to demand DRM is that the movie studios want veto controls over how mainstream technolgies are designed. Movie studios have used DRM to enforce arbitrary restrictions on products, including preventing fast-forwarding and imposing regional playback controls, and created complicated and expensive ""compliance"" regimes for compliant technology companies that give small consortia of media and big tech companies a veto right on innovation.""

""Let's look at the record on threats to boycott non-DRM broadcasting from these companies. In 2003, the US Broadcast Protection Discussion Group (a committee in the Hollywood-based Copy Protection Technical Working Group) went to work on a plan for adding DRM called the Broadcast Flag to America's high-def broadcasts. I attended every one of these meetings, working on behalf of the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the free/open TV projects it represented, including MythTV (an open video-recorder) and GNU Radio (an open radio/TV receiver).

Over and over again, the rightsholders in the room during the Broadcast Flag negotiations attempted to create a sense of urgency by threatening to boycott American high-def telly if they didn't get DRM. They repeated these threats in their submissions to the Federal Communications Commission (Ofcom's US counterpart) and in their meetings with American lawmakers.

And here's how it turned out:

So what happened? Did they make good on their threats? Did they go to their shareholders and explain that the reason they weren't broadcasting anything this year is because the government wouldn't let them control TVs?

No. They broadcast. They continue to broadcast today, with no DRM.""

**But at least DRM will allow the end of Flash and Silverlight**

I'd rather have DRM stay in they dying Flash player than infect what's supposed to be a free and open standard. This creates a fragmented web which defeats the purpose of having an open standard. 

""The EME proposal suffers from many of these problems because it explicitly abdicates responsibilty on compatibility issues and let web sites require specific proprietary third-party software or even special hardware and particular operating systems (all referred to under the generic name ""content decryption modules"", or CDMs, and none of them specified by EME). EME's authors keep saying that what CDMs are, and do, and where they come from is totally outside of the scope of EME, and that EME itself can't be thought of as DRM because not all CDMs are DRM systems. Yet if the client can't prove it's running the particular proprietary thing the site demands, and hence doesn't have an approved CDM, it can't render the site's content. Perversely, this is exactly the reverse of the reason that the World Wide Web Consortium exists in the first place. W3C is there to create comprehensible, publicly-implementable standards that will guarantee interoperability, not to facilitate an explosion of new mutually-incompatible software and of sites and services that can only be accessed by particular devices or applications. But EME is a proposal to bring exactly that dysfunctional dynamic into HTML5, even risking a return to the ""bad old days, before the Web"" of deliberately limited interoperability.

...

All too often, technology companies have raced against each other to build restrictive tangleware that suits Hollywood's whims, selling out their users in the process. But open Web standards are an antidote to that dynamic, and it would be a terrible mistake for the Web community to leave the door open for Hollywood's gangrenous anti-technology culture to infect W3C standards. It would undermine the very purposes for which HTML5 exists: to build an open-ecosystem alternatives to all the functionality that is missing in previous web standards, without the problems of device limitations, platform incompatibility, and non-transparency that were created by platforms like Flash. HTML5 was supposed to be better than Flash, and excluding DRM is exactly what would make it better.""

**But DRM should be a choice for producers and distributors**

""The purpose of DRM is not to prevent copyright violations.

The purpose of DRM is to give content providers leverage against creators of playback devices.

Content providers have leverage against content distributors, because distributors can't legally distribute copyrighted content without the permission of the content's creators. But if that was the only leverage content producers had, what would happen is that users would obtain their content from those content distributors, and then use third-party content playback systems to read it, letting them do so in whatever manner they wanted.

...

The only people who are stopped from doing anything are the player providers -- they are forced to provide a user experience that, rather than being optimised for the users, puts potential future revenues first (forcing people to play ads, keeping the door open to charging more for more features later, building artificial obsolescence into content so that if you change ecosystem, you have to purchase the content again).

Arguing that DRM doesn't work is, it turns out, missing the point. DRM is working really well in the video and book space. Sure, the DRM systems have all been broken, but that doesn't matter to the DRM proponents. Licensed DVD players still enforce the restrictions. Mass market providers can't create unlicensed DVD players, so they remain a black or gray market curiosity. DRM failed in the music space not because DRM is doomed, but because the content providers sold their digital content without DRM, and thus enabled all kinds of players they didn't expect (such as ""MP3"" players). Had CDs been encrypted, iPods would not have been able to read their content, because the content providers would have been able to use their DRM contracts as leverage to prevent it.

DRM's purpose is to give content providers control over software and hardware providers, and it is satisfying that purpose well.

As a corollary to this, look at the companies who are pushing for DRM. Of the ones who would have to implement the DRM, they are all companies over which the content providers already, without DRM, have leverage: the companies that both license content from the content providers and create software or hardware players. Because they license content, the content providers already have leverage against them: they can essentially require them to be pro-DRM if they want the content. The people against the DRM are the users, and the player creators who don't license content. In other words, the people over whom the content producers have no leverage. ""

Eventually my mom noticed I wasn't outside and she found me and yelled at me because ""those guests didn't do anything to me"" and I was being ""disrespectful by ignoring them"". So I had to go outside, puffy red eyes and all. 

They tried to console me by saying things like ""I'm sure they just forgot"" and ""just give it a little time, I'm sure they'll come"".

True,SemolinaChessNut,,,"Don't be so quick to jump to your conclusions based on an internet article that tries to pass off opinions as ""facts"". Look at the list again. How many facts are there? How many things up there in that list are not only a) known to have existed or happened, b) cited from a trustworthy source. Not one source, not one fact that survives scrutiny. Just an internet writer with an axe to grind and some history to rewrite.

Edward Benjamin (the author of that list) surely does understand art, artists, or artistry. I agree, Lennon was far from perfect. And I think it is important to be critical of popular icons. Actually, Lennon would also agree with that people should be critical of popular icons. He spent most of the 1970s demystifying the Beatles. Listen to the lyrics of his song God. But there is so much misinformation listed that piece, I feel the need to refute the hyperbole.

* Regarding #10) Read Cynthia's biography. John did hit her once, early on (when he was around 20 years old). After a period of time he came groveling back and promised to never hit her again which he never did (read Cynthia Lennon's very honest book John for confirmation). And was forever sorry and ashamed of it. And he never hit Yoko. Also, he admitted publicly that this was an issue for him: ""I used to be cruel to my woman, and physically—any woman. I was a hitter. I couldn't express myself and I hit. I fought men and I hit women. That is why I am always on about peace"". There is absolutely no accounts of Lennon hitting Yoko.
* Regarding #9) Yes, Lennon was a bad father. He didn't know how to communicate with his kids. He had zero role models in this regard. His father abandoned him. His father’s father grew up in an orphanage. His mother was incompetent and lost custody of John because she was unable to provide him with proper care. He was still a kid himself in many ways until his mid-30s, when he started being more of a father to Julian. By his own admission he was a crap father to Julian. However a 1980 interview right before his death he admitted that he had a lot of making up to do with Julian. He accepted that he had treated his son in a similar manner to the way his own father had treated him which he deeply regretted. At least he did not make the same mistake with Sean - even going as far as to give up his musical career for 5 years to look after Sean. He was never a good father to Julian. But he was a great father to Sean.
* Regarding #8) a) Lennon never claim he was working class, although Paul claims John was working class. Lennon said in an interview: ""I was a nice clean-cut suburban boy, and in the class system I was about a half an inch in a higher class than Paul, George and Ringo, who lived in subsidised government houses. We owned our own house, had our own garden. They didn't have anything like that"". b) It was Brian Epstein who feared the fans would be alienated by the idea of a married Beatle. And that lie only lasted about 6 months, when John decided he wanted the public to know; that lie was never perpetuated in the United States.
* Regarding  #7) Bands break up. Big deal. I am grateful for the great music they made. And I am grateful they quit while they were ahead. Have you listened to the last six Rolling Stones LPs? The Beatles were the most innovative musical group in the history of popular music.
* Regarding #6) Lennon was not a politician. He was an artist. He used songs as a form to express political ideas. He also tried to use his fame and performance art as ways to spread the idea of peace. Also, by the way, the Black Panthers were not a violent group (unless you include the FBI agents and infiltration). Lennon was not a politician or a political leader. He was an artist who made peace and love a major theme of his work.
* Regarding #5) a) ""at best an average guitar player""...Lennon himself said he wasn't good at solos, but considered himself a great rhythm guitar player, which he was. but listen to the guitar work of his in For You Blue, I Want You, the first solo in Long Tall Sally, And Your Bird Can Sing, etc. etc. b) ""a lot of his works comes off as silly and dated""???? ""You've Got to Hide Your Love Away""? ""The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill""?? ""In My Life""??? ""Across the Universe""???? 
* Regarding #4) yes, Lennon, like any artist, is influenced by others. But to suggest that Lennon himself did not influence countless musicians and artists is just idiotic. The Beatles set the pace for the 60s. Everything the Beatles did in the 60s, everyone else followed. Yes, Lennon jumped on board the peace movement but so what, all he did was highlight the cause and take it to a bigger audience. People like Ruben were desperate to get him on board and on stage because they knew how much influence he had.
* Regarding #3) this is such a vague argument, I can't even think of how to retort to it. Lennon hated the suits from the early days but he wore them because Brian told him to and because he realized that it was necessary to be successful. He loved the leather teddy boy look and always thought of himself as a rocker which is why he returned to his roots in the mid 70s with the 'Rock and Roll' album. Lennon was never a sell-out. A sell-out is someone who makes a record they way they are told to make it by executives. That was never Lennon or McCartney. 
* Regarding #2) ""As much he liked to pretend to be a misunderstood artist following his own uncompromising vision""...when did Lennon ever say such things??? Also, it is no surprise that Lennon liked money. He sang a cover of the song “Money”, and when asked in 1964 what the best part of Beatlemania was, he said “the money”. That does not discount his artistry. – 
* Regarding #1) All the song says is ""Imagine"". Imagine what the world would be like. It doesn't say ""Do this now"" or ""how dare you not do this"". It says ""Imagine"".

To answer your question about tongue brushing and potential damage to our taste receptors. Yes and No.

Let's start with how it would be a Yes, and work in to the final answer of No:

If you are using a hard bristled toothbrush, highly corrosive toothpaste (usually whitening toothpaste or something with a thick paste of baking powder mixture), then Yes, you can erode the taste buds on your tongue away.

But is this a permanent change to your tongue?

No. And to explain this, I'm going to explain the make-up of our tongue's dorsal surface (the part that contains our ""taste buds"").

Our tongue is a muscular instrument which is used to not only taste food, but also to recognize poisons/toxins (partially through taste), to determine the quality of food by texture, and to help you not only hold on to your food during mastication, but to also chew and swallow your food by acting as a muscular plunge. 

It contains specialized structures called ""papillae"" which are outcroppings of the epithelium making up the tongue and are often confused with just ""taste buds."" There are several type of papillae, and each has their own function.

The most numerous type of papilla is the filiform papilla. It is shaped like a little finger that comes off the surface of your tongue and actually does not really involve itself with taste sensation. They are the the part of your tongue that allows you to hold on to food and determine texture. They are also what make your tongue feel rough when it is dry. If they grow too long or their growth is altered by certain anti-biotics, peroxide-based chemicals, or unusual chemical reactions, then they act negatively to hold on to bacteria or fungus to give you a minor case of something called ""hairy tongue."" I can explain that more if you like, but it's a bit outside the realm of your question. Overall, if you brush too hard, you're more likely to scrape some of these guys away, so your taste won't really be affected directly. What will be affected is how well your tongue can hold on to food and water (which is absolutely necessary to ""taste"") so your taste will be indirectly involved. As a neat experiment, try completely drying your tongue off with a dry towel and then put some sugar or salt on it. If you dried it off thoroughly, you won't be able to taste either!

The taste buds actually involved in taste are the fungiform papillae. They are little, mushroom-shaped bumps (as their name suggests) on your tongue interspersed throughout. Their histologic structure actually shows that they're like little caverns with centralized ""bulbs"" that are connected to the cranial nerves in charge of distributing taste reception. These are very tough to brush away or damage with toothpaste or a toothbrush because of how they are formed and shaped. So brushing them will not affect taste. (This is how we overall come to the answer of ""No"").

The other types of taste buds are a bit more boring and are located on the sides and back of the tongue. Brushing them would be very hard to do and even if you did, nothing would happen. If you're interested in learning about them further, feel free to read about the Circumvallate Papillae and the Foliate Papillae. They are also involved with taste, but act mostly as a  defensive feature where something very bitter or toxic tasting will be ejected just prior to being swallowed. I'm simplifying a bit, but it's close enough to reality to get the point :)

Now, let's say that you did somehow manage to rub off the top layer of your tongue and damage the papillae somewhat. Well, in a little over a week, that'll clear right up as their average turnover is 10-14 days :)

So, now you can see how the answer is both a Yes and No, depending on how you want to perceive it.

But because I really doubt you're going to grind away the top layer of your tongue, rest easy, my friend, and continue to brush your tongue, your teeth, and even the roof of your mouth! Keep your mouth clean and take care of it, because we only get one!

Also, mandatory dentist reminder: Floss!

True,nicoleta_,arts-sci,Hispanic Studies '14,"In the thread posted the other day about a prof pulling up an email in front of the lecture theatre and ""outing"" someone, it was mentioned that this happened in my Social Psyc class from last winter. I requested access to old WebCT and went through some of the lecture recordings this morning. I found two occasions on which the prof would open up student emails and read them to the class, and both times were when students had been asked to respond to a survey question by email to gather data to talk about in class. To be clear, he pulled all the emails up on the screen and you could clearly see that none of them had been opened yet. He then went through each of them reading them out. This happened in the lecture on January 19th, 2012.

I'm not sure if this is the situation that the microaggressions post is talking about, but it was the only thing I could find that remotely resembles it. As you can see, the sender gives no information about their own situation, which is why I think either this isn't the right email, or the post was exaggerated. Yes, the student's name was shown to the class with the email, but I'm not sure if the text shown here is really ""outing"" anyone?

As the prof was reading off the comment he snickers a little bit and you can hear the people in the lecture laugh. Once he's finished reading the part where it says that the survey question leaves people out he says ""True, it does, and I-I-uh apologize for that, it's just that we find in our discussions that have to do with evolution or biology tend to be more binary - but apologies to people who felt left out by the question.""",0,1363963870,,0,False,1,c90f7t5,t3_1astwr,t1_c90f7t5,t3_1astwr,,1431668459,24,False,mcgill,t5_2rhkw,24

True,mirtazapine,,PGY4 - geriatrics - IM,"First of all, congratulations!  Second, most of what I say probably won't make a lot of sense until your third year when you work with the residents and interns and you see what they do firsthand.

Sorry if you already know this, but what I was describing above was a scenario from an ""inpatient"" (hospitalized patient) setting.  For better or for worse, much of internal medicine residency training is in the inpatient setting, presumably because as a newly minted physician, you need to learn how to take care of the sickest patients, and those would be the hospitalized ones.

I usually wake up between 4-4:30 AM and try to get into the hospital by around 5 AM.  I roam around the wards interviewing and examining my patients, talking to the nursing staff and reviewing the charts to see what happened overnight, and looking up vitals, lab results, and imaging  until around 7:30 AM in the morning when I usually have some kind of mandatory academic activity to attend (morning report).

After morning report, I quickly go over assessments and plans with my interns and medical students (i.e. what's going on with the patients and what do we want to change for the day).  We then meet up with the attending physician and round on patients for at least a few hours.  In internal medicine, rounding (discussing and examining patients) is where a lot of time gets spent.  We spend a lot of time thinking (or philosophizing) about problems.  This is in contrast to a field like surgery in which they need to spend their daylight hours doing actual surgery, so their rounds are earlier and significantly more streamlined.

At some point in the day, we need to work on documentation.  Writing notes takes a long time, especially if you need to do it by hand.  Documentation as a trainee is important in that it allows other people to review your thought process, but there's also an attitude these days that if something isn't documented, then it wasn't done, so I spend a disproportionate amount of time writing.  If I have interns on my team, they do most of the documentation.  I also spend time going over notes with the med students.

Many days also involve admissions, so we'll spend a significant amount of time in the emergency department assessing new patients and coming up with plans for them.  Whenever a patient enters or leaves the hospital, they require additional extensive documentation (H&amp;Ps and discharge summaries).

On most days, I'm able to leave the hospital somewhere between 5 pm and 8 pm.  I try my best to tie up any loose ends before the night shift team comes on.  We need to explain to the covering team overnight any issues that we anticipate arising overnight or things that we would like them to monitor for us.

Many fields of medicine are becoming ""shift work"" these days, so there are some times when I'm part of the night float team (I'm on nights right now).  I work from about 6 pm to 6 am.  I admit new patients to the hospital overnight and answer calls from the nursing staff regarding problems with the patients.  The hospital that I'm currently at is usually pretty busy, so I don't sleep overnight.

Alternatively there are some days in which I work a 30 hour shift; I come in the morning at 5 am, and I don't leave work until the next day at around 11 am.  On those days, I admit patients to the hospital throughout the entire day.  Interns are no longer allowed to work more than 16 hours at a time, but upper level residents are still allowed to work 30 hours at a time.  It's hard work, but the advantage to longer shifts is that you have ""continuity of care,"" i.e. you round on the people you admitted overnight, so the patients are managed by teams of providers who are familiar with their problems rather than being transferred to a new team in the morning.

As I mentioned before, I work about 80 hours per week and six days per week during inpatient.  No holidays.  Technically it's forbidden to work more than 80 hours per week, but especially for a new intern who's still not operating at peak efficiency, getting the work done in time isn't always possible.  ""Duty hour violations"" frequently go unreported because there's no real incentive to report them.  If enough duty hour violations are reported, then the residency program risks losing accreditation, but that just means that you and your colleagues lose their jobs, so it's a lose-lose proposition.

Off on a tangent, but I remember when I was a premed and even as a second year med student, I thought that 80 hours a week didn't sound so bad.  After all, I was tough, wasn't I?  Haha, after a while, it really has worn me out, and the sad thing is it's nothing compared to the old days.  Residents used to work 120 hour weeks.  Apparently the term ""resident"" came from the fact that residents in the old days needed to live in the hospital, and the father of the modern residency felt that ideally residents should be on call 362 days out of the year [citation needed].

When I get home, if I have the stamina, then usually I need to look up some kind of management question during the day for which I didn't have an answer.  Often times this will involve looking up research articles.  Med students come in handy because they can help look these things up for the team.

The days are filled of random other things that are difficult to predict.  I may need to spend an hour talking to a patient about why she shouldn't leave the hospital against medical advice or to a family about the fact that their grandmother is suffering from multiorgan failure and that from a medical standpoint there is very little that we can offer her and that while there is always hope, I cannot reasonably expect her to recover and that performing CPR on her would likely only prolong her suffering.  Sometimes I'll be giving a talk to the other residents about a recent journal article that I read.  Sometimes I'll be putting a large catheter into someone's internal jugular vein in order to better manage his septic shock.

Not all of residency training is in the inpatient setting.  You'll also have outpatient rotations and electives.  The hours are better, and sometimes you even have weekends off!  Oftentimes the patient populations are what make these rotations tough; residency clinics are often full of patients who private practice physicians don't want to take, and it's not because they're poor but because they're actually difficult.  Many of them have personality disorders and other poorly controlled psychiatric issues.  They frequently don't take their medications, and they frequently blame me for their medical problems.  I have patients who only come in because they want narcotics.  You see these folks in the inpatient setting too, but the difference between a private practice and a resident clinic is really night and day.  It's really helpful to have thick skin (I don't) and a passion for humanity in order to deal with some folks.

I don't like to sugar coat things; it's a tough job.  My friends and most of my family members have no idea what I'm doing and assume that I'm on a golf course at a country club somewhere, and most people my age are healthy and don't have chronic medical problems that require close follow-up; their experiences are limited to well-child checks when they were young or routine visits to the ob/gyn, kind of like the way they assume that all the pharmacist does is count the number of pills that goes into a bottle.  But man, when people come into the hospital dying and you clinch the diagnosis and turn them around, you feel like a champ, especially if their friends and family come to thank you for a job well done.  Improving someone's quality of life is huge too.  If I can get an elderly patient into home hospice and ensure that the last chapter of his life will be dignified and he'll die peacefully in the comfort of his own home surrounded by his family members rather than equipment in the ICU, then that's a big victory for me; landing the plane smoothly, to me, is as important as knowing how to keep it in the air.  I can't imagine myself being more fulfilled doing something else, and I get a lot of satisfaction knowing that I'm helping people every day.",0,1363965327,,0,1364006651,3,c90fn69,t3_1aou9z,t1_c90fn69,t1_c90e2na,,1431668667,1677,False,medicine,t5_2qhff,1677

Intent and emotion being shared without words.  She puts her head on my shoulder getting comfortable and I get to stroke her long hair.  And then she starts to sing.

They also wrote [another article](http://www.deepmagik.org/Writing_Fantasy/2013/03/20/how-to-write-a-fantasy-novel/) where apparently you need a hero and a villain to make a fantasy story that doesn't suck. Of particular interest was the line ""We must start with with a hero that appeals to us"". Given that the OP mentions Game of Thrones and Prince of Thorns in the same article as being great fantasy books, saying you need an appealing hero to make a fantasy story seems rather contradictory given that neither of these books really have heroes. Also, apparently ""you must have a love story"". I would again point to books like ASoIaF, books the blogger mentioned in the very same article, to counter this.

I've never written anything in my life but even I know that not only do you need a basic understanding of grammar, but that you do not heroes and villains if your characters are compelling enough. ASoIaF, Prince/King of Thorns, The First Law - these books all show that you can create a great fantasy novel without true heroes or villains. You should write characters that are compelling and interesting in their own right rather than forcing these characters in the moulds of hero, villain, love interest, etc.

The OP does raise some very good points - plan the world and the story beforehand. While I imagine some writers can conjure up scenarios on the fly they'll have the basic bones of the story plotted out, and most writers will need to do a lot of planning.

However, overall (and while this isn't meant to sound personal there's no way of saying this without sounding insulting) the blog reads less as a guide to writing epic fantasy and more as a guide to writing generic fantasy. Relatively generic 'good vs evil' fantasy can work really well, such as in the Wheel of Time, but most of the time it will simply come across as generic and derivative. I'm not saying anything against what the OP is writing - I assume he's writing some kind of fantasy story but I know nothing about it and so am not making any judgments on his story or writing - but this blog unfortunately comes across as a guide to writing rather generic fantasy rather than a guide for epic fantasy.",0,1363966361,,0,False,1,c90fypw,t3_1ase4s,t1_c90fypw,t1_c90f2y6,,1431668798,3,False,Fantasy,t5_2qknd,3

True,4io8,,envying the maturity of italian politics,"I think I am in a good position to answer your question. I am of muslim background, a decade older than you, knew Australia pre 2001, and grew up in both the whitest parts of Sydney, as well as the most multi-cultural.

Firstly it's a myth that Australia is a place where people get along with each other. It's contradictory to the traditonaly myths of Australia, so it does not get mentioned on TV shows, or in movies or books, or written about etc. But if you listen to people's *actual experiences* you realise that Australia has always had a pretty strong undercurrent of not liking each other. 

The Vietnamese and asians got crap through the 80's and 90's. Lots of it. The Italians and Greeks before them in the after WWII wave of immigrants. But the weird thing is that *even before that*, there was just as much crap. Before the wogs, the protestants and catholics (both white and from Britain) were at each other's throats. They fucking hated each other. The idea of a Catholic leader of the Liberal party in 2013 was simply unimaginable to people back around WWII. It would be like telling someone that the leader of the Liberals in 2040 is Waleed Aly. The Irish were hated. The Chinese came for the gold rush and were kicked out. 

Australia likes to see itself as tolerant, and a place were people get along so Australia never talks about this stuff. It's swept under the rug. But if you listen around to what people actually had to put up with you realise Australia has always been a bit messed up like this. You see it in places here and there. The absolutely shit treatement of aboriginals is somewhere its obvious. And for reasons I will get to later, its not so hidden any more so its sprawled all over the front page of NewsCrap papers ever other day.

But mostly people shut up about it. Australians like to pretend it doesn't exist. Australians hate, really hate, having their own intolerance pointed out. You see it on this forum all the time. Well educated, polite and genuinely friendly white Australians go ballistic when you try to talk them about things like mandatory detention. They hate hearing about the obvious intolerance of policies they support. Makes their head explode. 

And the groups on the recieving end mostly just shut up and get on with the business of making money and a life for their kids. No-one is going to do anything so why complain? Keep your head down, build up that concreting business and it doesn't matter. But they are not as happy as it migth often seem on the surface. Again this pops up in surprising places. For example a surprising number of older southern European migrants who came to Australia fleeing WWII say later in life that it would have been better if they had stayed, now that they know how Europe turned out.

But if you look at Austalia's history the thread of racial intolerance (not racism, that's a different thing. Australians are mostly not racist) it stands out like a sore thumb. The main reason Australia exists as a single nation rather than five or six separate countries is that it was the only way the could keep non-white migrants out. Pretty much the very first thing  the Australian Federal government did was to enact the White Australia policy. Get's airbrushed out of history today.

But all this has been kept at a pretty low level for most of Australia's history. It's been there, the feelings have been there. But actual conflict has been kept to a pretty low level by Australia's vast wealth. The quality of life available to people living in Australia has been so good that there has not really been much point in conflict. The traditional path of migrants to Australia has been to build up a bit of income, maybe a business. Both have been pretty easy relatively speaking. Then buy a block of land. Build a house. Move out to the suburbs. And before you know it they are living out at Toongabbie surrounded by a mix of Aussies and migrants. Everyone has a house, a car, works a decent job for a decent pay. Life is pretty good.

But that was up until the last decade or so. You see normally migrants come into areas filled with people of the same background. Lakemba, Auburn are the examples today. Then as they decide to get a bigger house they move out the suburbs. That is how its been for previous waves of migrants. Their kids grow up with Aussies. They all ride their bikes around the neighbourhood. Play in each others back yards. And before you know it you have the next generation of &lt;insert country&gt;-Australians.

But that is no longer possible. In Sydney there are basically no new housing developments. People don't move out to the suburbs because the only places its possible to afford a house are so far out they are not tenable places to live. So the most recent wave of migrants to Sydney, the Arabs, have kept on living in the same suburbs as when they first arrived. Mostly living in apartments, with very large numbers of extended family living near by, and social lives that revolve around extended family. For migrants its easy to adapt. Living in apartments is normal in most of the world.

I cannot emphasize enough how different this is to how most Australians live. If you have not lived out in the suburbs, relatively far from extended family. Living in a primarily nuclear family of just mum and dad and one or two siblings. With large amounts of green space around. With most of your social connections *not* being blood relations. Then you don't understand Australians. What defines Australians are the things that come with that sense of space. Where there is always enough room for everyone. Its hard to explain it, but it permeates every aspect of the thinking which make Australia different to the rest of the world. The fact that the most recent wave of migrants are not able to experience this sense of space from having your own back yard, your own house, because property prices have made it impossible is probably a large part of the reason you feel the way you do.

It's totally fine that she doesn't want children, and is glad that she can't happen. I can totally understand her hesitation to adopt children when she knows full well she will not be able to give them what they need emotionally. What I totally don't understand is why she is pursuing a *marriage* knowing that you guys are so incompatible on the subject.

The fact that you're thinking all of these things is a good sign that a marriage or an engagement under circumstances like this is not going to turn out very well.

Maybe she thinks she will change her mind? Maybe she thinks you will change her mind? I don't know. Unfortunately I agree that you guys are incompatible...one of you should definitely break this off before it gets even more problematic.

True,enfp1,,,"I'm sorry your birthday sucked, middle school kids can be miserable dicks. 

I went to one of these partiesparties though and I'm glad I did... 8th grade, a kids birthday comes around and he invites everyone. Mind you this is a kid who was removed from class one day so he could shower in the school showers because he smelled so bad it was disrupting class (not being a dick, just stating facts) 

Anyway, the day finally comes and my friend and I talk about it and come to the consensus that no one will be going to the party and that it will really suck for this kid so we go. We get there and it's just his parents, him, and a friend of his that was from another school or home schooled. They have various types of chips and a small cake, his mom lights the candles and leaves, we sing and eat cake.  Then he shows us his ferret and his favorite movie (Beethoven's 3rd) and the bag of hair that he saved from when he shaved his head. Not long after its time to go and that was it. 

It was unbelievably depressing but I can only imagine how bad it would have been for him if no one showed up. He thanked us again and again the next week in school for coming. Come to find out only one other person even acknowledged his invite - another kid sent a card with some money in it but ""wasn't able to make it"".  Our friends gave us a hard time for going but fuck that, it didn't hurt me any to go and hopefully it made his birthday a little better. 

tl;dr - went to a loner kids birthday, no one showed up, had cake, saw his bag of hair, he thanked us profusely for coming. ",0,1363970563,,0,False,1,c90hcc1,t3_1asjux,t1_c90hcc1,t1_c90drl1,,1431669447,123,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,123
True,Morning_Glorious,,,"I guess that ultimately this would be optimistic, even though the story doesn't end with us being together.

In high school I met and fell in love with one of the ""bad boys"" in our small town.  He was a year older than me, was a small time drug dealer  and had dropped out of high school.  His father was in prison for assault and his mother had a pill problem.  His life had been rough from the beginning but I could tell from the minute I met him that he had so much potential do be...anything he wanted.  He had such a kindness about him.  He did have a full time job at a construction company at the time so he was somewhat financially stable.  My parents forbid me from seeing him since I was basically a goody two shoes, straight A student, member of the church, etc.  I got the ""what will people say"" speech a few times as well as the ""he's going to ruin your life"" version.

Of course, I chose him to be my first act of rebellion and we had to create all these elaborate schemes in order to see each other.  We had a whole network of people who would cover for us if we wanted to spend time together.  He tried so hard to make my parents realize he was trying to turn his life around but they refused to ever even meet him; going as far as to not let him in the house when I tried to arrange a meeting.  I convinced him to get his GED (which he did with flying colors), enroll in a community college and get away from drugs.  All this was in an effort to convince my parents we needed to be together.  He was seriously the love of my life and my first everything.  We would spend hours studying, while I'm sure everyone thought we were just getting high or having sex.

Long story short, my parents wouldn't financially support my decision to  go to a college close by and being a terrified 18 year old, I went to the school they wanted that was 200+ miles away.  Looking back, I should have been stronger and told them to shove their money but I can't change that now.  Eventually, the distance got to us and after a year apart we officially ended it and I haven't seen him since.  

So here is the optimistic ending. :)  He sent me a letter around a year ago by way of a mutual friend basically thanking me for believing in him all those years ago and helping to get his life on track.  He said that no one had ever fought for him as much as I had and that even though it didn't work out between us, he is a better person for having been with me.  Reading that was one of the most gut-wrenching and proud moments of my life.  He now owns a very successful business in our hometown, has a beautiful wife, two kids, a gorgeous house, etc.  So that fact that we had a forbidden relationship actually was the catalyst for making sure he got the life he deserved.

I found the keycap donor board at a thrift store for $5.  It's a Esprit WordStar LR54106 terminal keyboard, which has some awesome looking keys including F1-F20 and a an extra direction key.  The Esprit has cherry blacks and would make a great board if it didn't only have an RJ-11 cable.

The last thing I need is more keyboards laying around, so I'm going to swipe all the keycaps off of the Esprit and then find it a good home.  If anyone wants the board for the price of shipping, send me a message and it's yours. It would probably be great for harvesting the switches.  Also if anyone wants to buy the original black A-Z keys off the CM Storm, let me know.

True,gloomdoom,,,"Love the insight simple comments in here provide to the deterioration of America as a whole. Anti-union sentiment taught to people 20 years ago from the right? CHECK. Pro-corporate statements about 'smart business.' CHECK. Cries of 'editorialized' headline: CHECK.

Meanwhile, the corporations and the wealthiest Americans continue to gather what little wealth is left and the middle class have slid off into poverty and the working class is the new poverty class. The right wing continues to chip away at any kind of safety net for the poor, decrying 'socialist' welfare 'entitlement's to the poor while showering corporate welfare on the richest companies and protecting massive loopholes for the wealthy.

And then the American people sit around with a Big Mac in their hands watching Dancing with the Stars wondering what went wrong and why we're turning into a banana republic. 

You fools have been desensitized to the truth and you tend to create your own. You get on your hands and knees and when you speak of the wealthy and corporations, you get a twinkle in your eyes. Even those of you who consider yourselves educated and informed are sycophants to these companies...those on the right cheer them on as they continue to pillage the small wealth of the working class and send families into poverty by gaming the system, the economy and the government. 

The problem here isn't the UMW. It's the weakness of the union members and miners themselves. 

This couldn't have happened 30 years ago. The miners would have stood up and did what miners had to do to get the message across that they wouldn't stand for it. It was workers like those who created and protected the middle class. These days, miners (like most people who grew up in a non-unionized world) can't grasp the idea of solidarity. They don't have the balls their grandparents had, nor the backbones. They (like you, like so many other Americans) bend over when the wealthy demand that they do and they acquiesce like typical Americans at every turn.

There's no mystery here. There's a deliberate, intentional theft of the what's left that the corporations don't own and they are going for it. The problem is that the general population (infiltrated by the poison ideas of the republicans and Fox News) are rooting them on as they do it, even as it has disastrous effects on themselves and their own families.

It's as shameful as it is laughable. 

Americans get what they deserve in the end for being weak and so easily led by those with the most money...this lustful love affair of things they will never have, they worship through those who can and do.",0,1363979512,,0,False,1,c90kfye,t3_1asweq,t1_c90kfye,t3_1asweq,,1431670996,27,False,news,t5_2qh3l,27

Anyway, yes, this is totally my area and it is *really fun* to read up on (in my admittedly biased opinion), and you timed this to coincide with my lunch hour so I can actually answer it! Woo! Let's do this in the style of a Choose Your Own Adventure, just for shits and giggles.

You are:

A) a rich young man of 18 or so - daddy's a senator, uncle's off leading a legion somewhere choice, mom came from an excellent family

B) a very, very pretty 15-year-old daughter of a well-off merchant whose family has no connection to anyone important

C) an ordinary soldier in his late 20s, fighting in the Legio VI Hispaniensis, back in Rome after a six-year term but about to head off again

D) a 20-year-old son of a baker in the Subura who will probably inherit his dad's bakery someday

---

A) Congratulations! Your life is probably pretty awesome. You will have lots of stressful decisions to make someday, but for now you're about to embark on your career (Senate? Military? Some combination thereof? The world is your oyster!) and what's gonna help you with that is a connection to another good family. But there's a problem. Is it:

I. You really aren't that much into women. (If this, go to answer 2.)

II. All the daughters of your parents' friends are either ugly or boring. (If this, go to answer 1.)

III. You're already in love - and she's not someone your parents approve of! (If this, go to answer 3.)

IV. Actually, no problem - you really don't care as long as you make your family proud. (If this, go to answer 4.)

---

B) Hi, beautiful. Your family has gotten double-lucky - not only have they earned enough money through selling something necessary to the functioning of the state that you can live a very comfortable life, but you're also pretty enough to be useful to them in furthering their ambitions! They decide to use you by:

I. Marrying you off to the first rich man that asks (If this, go to answer 1.)

II. Letting you get to know other families of a similar status to see which young men become interested in you, while also trying to make connections with families that have more status using your merchant father's wealth. (If this, go to answer 4.)

III. Marrying you off to someone perfectly horrible, even though they know you're in love with the baker's son. (If this, go to answer 3.)

---

C) You have survived one enlistment, fighting the Cantabri in the north of Hispania. You now have all of your salary, plus bonus money your commander has given you. You can buy yourself an excellent time in the city - but your mom is after you to settle down and give her some legitimate grandkids. You don't really know how to do anything else but fight, and you've already signed up to reenlist for another 6 years. Do you:

I. Start to look for a nice young lady somewhere? (If this, go to answer 5.)

II. Head back to Hispania without looking for anyone? (If this, go to answer 6)

---

D) You have lived in the Subura all your life. All your clothes smell like bread. You only know what the emperor looks like because of the statues. Your interests include bread, money, making fun of foreigners, and the Green chariot team. You're going to take over the bakery from your dad, so you probably should find someone to make a future baker with, and it'd be even better if she shared some of your interests. Do you:

I. Let your mom and dad worry about it. (If this, go to answer 1.)

II. Go to the Circus Maximus to cheer on the Greens. Wear your nicest tunic. (If this, go to answer 5.)

ANSWERS:

1. Part of being a good Roman was obedience to the paterfamilias, either the father or the grandfather of the family. Your parents find you a nice young person whose family they get along with, and you marry them because that's what you've been told from a young age that you're going to have to do. Oh, what's that? You're not attracted to them? Well, you're gonna have to figure something out. If you're a guy, you can find someone to sleep with as long as you stay in the lower social classes. If you're a girl, you might be able to find a ""close female friend"" to help you pass the time - you wouldn't be the first, and your husband would never figure it out. (See Martial's epigram I.90 - *""Girls surrounded you all the time… so I assumed you were a chaste Lucretia…*)

2. You don't like women? Too bad. It's your job to give your family kids - families like yours are dying off because there aren't enough babies, and it's bad enough that even Augustus is concerned. Figure out a way to get it up. If you wanna sleep with a dude later, on your own time, nobody's gonna judge you. Unless you let him fuck you up the ass, or you decide to suck his cock, in which case you might get someone writing some gossipy poetry about you for Latin students to read a few thousand years later. (See Martial's epigram 2.51, where he accuses a man called Hyllus of going to special dinners where he gets fucked instead of eating anything, and says, *""Your unfortunate belly watches your ass's banquet. The one hungers miserably all the time - the other gorges.""*)

3. You fell in love! Aww, yay! But wait, they're of the wrong social status and your parents don't approve? You should probably have thought a little bit more before falling in love with them. You know your paterfamilias has the power to dissolve any marriage they don't approve of, right? Try to get over it. I recommend thinking about all the things that annoy you about them. Didn't you notice how they have a slight lisp?

4. Your parents introduce you to (a nice young man from a very old but very poor family)/(a beautiful young woman from a very rich family) and tell you you'll be getting married. She is radiant in her saffron veil as her family brings her to your house / where you are Gaia, he is Gaius. You have three babies. Augustus himself congratulates your paterfamilias on finding such a fertile young woman to continue the family. Congratulations, you're living the dream.

5. You wear your nicest tunic to go see the Greens win at the Circus Maximus. The Reds crash at the turn, and you cheer as loud as you can. You notice the girl in front of you is cheering louder than anyone, and you think, *Hmm, she has excellent taste in chariot teams*. You offer her some of the food you brought along. Later, she tells you she lives a few streets away from you - her father runs a laundry, and she looks after her little brothers and sisters. You start sitting together at the races, and eventually you see her on the street and she invites you over. You play XII Scripta with her little brother and let him win, and she kisses you next to a piss pot on your way out the door. (See: Ovid, *Ars Amatoria* 1.135-1.164)

6. You're not allowed to get married when you're in the Legions, so even if you'd met a nice girl at the races you probably would have had to leave her behind - best case scenario, you might have left her with your parents at their little farm outside the city and they'd have helped her with the kid you got her pregnant with. But you made the responsible choice, and now you're back in Hispania, getting off with camp followers. Maybe you meet a nice local girl, and she comes back to Rome with you after your enlistment period is up. Either way, you're not allowed to get married. Should have thought of that before you enlisted, buddy.

I agree completely that Christ's self-giving, his sacrifice of himself, worked the reconciliation of humanity with God; but it wasn't God's side that needed reconciliation; nothing fundamentally changed in his position or attitude toward us (he was loving and forgiving all along); in Christ something changed *from our side*.

True,twinkling_star,,,"I think that's some of the starting point, but that there's more complexity to it than that.

As pointed out, ""nerds"" were ostracized and mistreated for their interests. Not just because for what the interest is - though in some cases that's sufficient - but also for the depth of their interest. We've pain for our choice of interest though years of suffering and exclusion.

There are multiple reactions that are developed to that. One comes about through one approach to ""fairness"". If we've suffered to get where we are, then others should too. This isn't by any means unique to nerds. It's a big reason that medical residents work insane hours that regularly put their patients at risk, for example, or why demeaning initiations into groups and organizations keep going. But unlike most cases, this is not something foisted upon someone by others who have already paid the price, but something that comes from the outside. If existing members make you suffer to join, the humiliation is short-lived - those making you do it remember being on the other side, and it can help to create a sense of bonding and connection between old members and new ones. Nerds don't have it this way - their process was based entirely on exclusion by others. They're not choosing to endure something that will take them into the in-group, but being forced to endure it when being pushed to the outside. This the lesson learned - that the stronger people exclude the weaker, and it's then turned inwards. So they're all trying to ""out-nerd"" each other in that way.

Then there's also the piece that when someone's actually trying to get the nerd to help them in those areas of expertise, there's going to be a natural defensiveness that comes about. If someone's suffered greatly for spending all that time learning about computers, and people have made it clear that's why they're being targeted, it's hard to trust others when they step into that sensitive area. Many nerds experienced the betrayal early on, when someone you thought was a friend would ask for assistance when needed - a class project, for example, or getting some basic setup done. But afterwars, said person would turn around and use that additional knowledge they've gained about the depth of your interest to further inflict ridicule and exclusion on the nerd. Likely more than one. Now they've been trained not to trust people's intentions, to believe they're likely to be tricked into opening up for being hurt again. After all, going all that time without people being genuinely interested in their knowledge and interest, you become suspicious when it happens.

Finally, let's not forget the recent cultural shifts. The way that many traditionally ""nerdy"" things have gone much more mainstream. Computer and console gaming. Programming with the rise of the ""brogrammer"". Heck, even comics with more superhero movies. Now the same sort of people who excluded the nerd for their interest are getting into the interest themselves. Here's an area where a nerd was effectively shoved because of being excluded from everything else, and now others want to come in, of the type of people who seem likely to now work again to exclude the nerd, but this time from the area that they paid dearly to become an expert in. What do you do when you're then excluded from there? There's at least the perceived threat of being backed into a corner when that happens. Of course they'll fight back.

True,Scuttlebuttz93,,,"A high with the pax, as with any other vape, is different than one from smoking. You get all of the effects in your mind such as the greater appreciation for music and drifting thoughts as well as a physical high feeling in your head but less of a high feeling in your body. You can function a lot better on a vape high than a smoke high.

It takes a lot longer to set in, maybe 5 minutes. You also have to take many more hits, but bear in mind you get way more hits per load. A fully loaded pax oven is maybe 4 hits from smoking but you can get absolutely baked from it twice. 

A big plus for the pax is its ease of use, just click the mouthpiece out and take long slow draws from it, giving it a few seconds to build up more vapor between hits. You can puff it into your mouth before inhaling too. Don't hold it upside down as oils will drip into the mouthpiece and make it stick. The light lets a little air in and as such can function like a carb, and pushing down on one side of the oven can let a little more air in and make drawing from it easier if you don't like the ""thick milkshake"" feeling.

When you're traveling with it I recommend putting a rubber band around it lengthways to protect the oven lid from falling off in your pocket/bag/whatever and losing whatever was inside. I've had mine since it launched last June (I think?) and this has happened to me twice, once was totally my fault, but the other time I had it in a compartment in my laptop bag and part of my mouse or a cable must have pushed it up and off. It's extremely rare that that should happen to the pojnt that I wouldn't consider it a flaw of the pax, but it's best to be safe with precious MJ. At the very least put it in it's own pocket.

The temperature setting is a matter of opinion. Low (yellow) is 370 F, medium (orange) is 390, and high (red) is 410. A lower temperature will get you more hits but less dense hits, and also causes more of a head high while a higher setting will cause more of a body high (still not as much as smoking). Obviously the battery will drain faster on higher settings as well. High is slightly above the recommended safe temperature for vaporizing weed so I would recommend saving that for just when you want to get high fast or for squeezing that last bit of high out of a mostly expired load. Also ABV that was exposed to the high setting for a good while won't have much potency. Personally, I use medium nearly all of the time. I start at medium and turn it down to low if the vapor is too dense and tickling my throat (rare), and like I said to high if I'm finishing off a load.

Grind your herb very fine and pack it tight. Personally I find that as low as a half an oven works fine, but the tighter the better. You can get a small 2 or 3 piece finishing grinder for a finer grind, or do what I do and grind it as you normally do (so you still get kief in your kief catcher), then take the top two pieces off and grind it again upside down so it doesn't fall through the holes.

Clean it regularly. A dirty pax will get a sticky (or even stuck) mouthpiece and won't function as well. You can submerge the mouthpiece and screen in alcohol and then run an alcohol dampened pipe cleaner through the main piece and over the oven lid. Don't forget to get in the nooks and crannies and clean the mouthpiece extra thoroughly to prevent sticking. I clean it something like every third session, but it varies from person to person.

When you're done with it leave it upright until it cools off so oils don't drip down into the mouthpiece. Sticky mouthpieces are the bane of paxes in case you haven't figured that out yet. Some people even go so far as to not turn it off and let it go into sleep mode and turn itself off before clicking the mouthpiece in. You can charge it upright with the charger on top or remove the mouthpiece and charge it without it too.",0,1363988913,,0,1363990017,2,c90nlt3,t3_1asxsd,t1_c90nlt3,t3_1asxsd,,1431672471,38,False,vaporents,t5_2upjd,38

True,adamjm,,,"Ok you asked, so here goes.

Religion doesn't have a huge grasp on Australian society. We already deal with the influences of it on our schools, on government, but that said we manage to have a largely secular society. Why is this important? A few reasons.

First, because you only have to look to any theocratic country to see how poorly it does at being a country, how poor quality of life is, and how much misery there is. 

Without fail countries where the laws of a god mean more than the laws of the men and women and children we share this earth with, the society that lives under these laws is not successful. This is because many things that are common sense approaches to how we treat one another and interactions that have evolved over *millions of years* have been subverted or repressed by the dominate doctrine of the land, the religion.

If you want a western example look at the United States of America. The land of the *free*. The land where you cannot be elected if you do not profess to be part of the dominant religion. The land where you can watch someones face be blown off on national television, can watch a woman be raped or a man tortured, but you cannot see bare breasts of the female body. Religious puritan values have created a very complex society with strange priorities.

My point is, in places where it is man second, *religion first*, man doesn't do very well. Society suffers.

There are so many aspects to Islam and religion in general that are so *obviously* a creation of common very insecure tribal men that it blows my mind these ideas have persisted. But religion is insidious, it is taught from birth, it uses pressures to prevent questioning it. Ideas that cannot be questioned, that don't stand up on *their own merit* will not benefit Australian society. Here we are free to question everything. Like for example why is the onus on the *woman* to cover her body and not the *man* to show restraint? To respect beauty at a distance? Look at how women are treated in Islamic societies, as if they have something to be ashamed of, that their beauty should be covered and if it is not the consequences are *their fault*. 

I don't want that in Australia, I don't want that EVER to become the right idea for Australian women. I don't want my sister or daughter or mother to ever live in that way.

Now, why does this matter? You are in Australia now, surely these problems are going to be left behind in Lebanon or Afghanistan or Somalia? No. Because you left the land behind, left the people behind, and brought the one thing that can replicate the same problems over here. The doctrine, the religion, the culture that says *Religion first, my fellow man second*. Land is land, there is *nothing wrong with Lebanon*, with Afghanistan, it may be a little dry but these are beautiful places destroyed by *ideas*.

What it boils down to SIWander is when I interact with a fellow Aussie the laws of the land and normal human interaction applies. If an individual is a weirdo or not trust worthy or violent, I can apply normal responses to that individual. When an entire group of people follow a set of ideas that are not compatible with the framework of my society, how do I deal with them?

If I run into you, do those same interactions apply? At what point would your obedience to your religion trump your respect for a fellow Australian? And this goes for any religion. If you someone believes there is more waiting for them after this life how can I be sure they will do the  right thing by me in this life?

* Islamic views on women are NOT compatible with values Australians hold.
* Religious views on sex, marriage, education are not compatible. 
* A culture of obedience and of not questioning ""religious authority"" is *not compatible*.
* Religious hysteria is not confined just to ""extremists"". Entire governments such as Pakistan have condemned drawings and supported violence against completely harmless acts.
* You can be offended, it does not matter, I have no obligation to respect ideas I do not agree with. You should have no recourse legally or otherwise other than to be disgruntled that I don't agree with you. 
* There is no such thing as blasmepthy in Australian society, unless you include wasting beer or treating a woman poorly.
* Religion demands tolerance but offers none. It demands respect and earns none.

Muslim immigrants show little inclination to acquire the secular and civil values of our country, and yet exploit these values to the fullest—demanding tolerance for their backwardness, their misogyny, their anti-Semitism, and the genocidal hatred that is regularly preached in their mosques. Political correctness and fears of racism have rendered people incapable of even defending what it means to be Australian. You write 1/10th of what I've written and you are downvoted and callled a racist (As I am absolutely expecting).

As a Muslim, you are so isolated from the ideas that many Australians hold that you will never completely integrate. So if I know that going in, I'm going to politely interact with you if i have to but I'll never invest in you as a fellow Australian because there would be no point, your ideas are fixed in 7th century ideologies. Everything I'm saying right now is going in one ear and out the other. And if you *don't* hold to these ideas, if you are open to change and think women should be equal, think the laws of men matter, well then you aren't religious. It's one or the other.

Now I don't care where you a from, I don't care what your accent is, what you like to eat, whether you have dark skin or you are pale as a ghost. But you profess to follow laws and ideas that don't make sense and I can't relate to you. Simple as that.

First of all, houses can get smaller. I have heard of people living in RVs and campers to get through. Those don't have bedrooms, just the one bathroom. And yes I know that sounds crazy, but it worked for someone, why not others?
Instead of eating out once a month, you can move that to none. Maybe even get a weekend job at that restaurant to pull in extra cash.
You don't have to pay for any of little Johnny's education. Or little Johnny can help pay for college. My husband worked part time jobs while in school and paid out of pocket for the whole thing. He chose an in state school and lived at home. Not super glamorous, but he got the degree. And, you can say to hell with the forms all together.
For the most part I agree, typically moving won't solve your problem. But in some cases it would. If you live in a city, try a cheaper suburb. Or maybe another part of town would help you out; while maintaining your current job. But if you live in a small town, moving to a different new town may not get you anywhere. 
My point being, there are usually other options. Just because it seems 100% of the people are doing something that way doesn't mean its the only way.

Especially if these have been up since she was a kid. I dunno, maybe I'm weird, but I wouldn't want to raise my kid thinking that porn was a good schema for their sexuality. 

I'm a girl and I have no problem with porn, but I'm not sure how healthy it would be to have a bunch of pornographic nudies around the house, like, when the girl was in puberty. Not saying kids should be kept from it entirely, but they shouldn't be bombarded with it either. I remember hanging ""thinspiration"" pictures of models on the fridge when I was 12 to stop myself from eating.... this comes a little too close to that for me. 

If you want to ""celebrate sexuality"" I feel like there are better ways to do it than having it displayed all over the house. Rather than showing graphic images of sexual acts, you could discuss (maybe using personal experience) what leads two people into those acts, what they can express, and how to do it safely.

My gut feeling is that this encodes a sequence rather than a single thing.  That's because I don't think a single thing could be described very well by such a simple system unless the thing were very abstract (like ""k"" or ""$""), in which case there's little point in sending it and no way of knowing you've arrived at the correct answer.

If it's a sequence, I believe it is of between four and seventeen things.  As far as I can figure, each of a four-item sequence could have between sixteen and twenty possible descriptive bits depending on the encoding method, and each of a seventeen item sequence could only be one of four possible states.  It's of course possible that there are other relationships that I'm not taking into account -- for instance, modifying effects from the adjacent item(s) or position on the image, but that raises the complexity of the encoding very quickly to an unsolvable level.

True,GlassRod85,,,"To chime in with a bit more of the scientific details:

It can be useful to think of glass as made up of a bunch of little strands of thread.  These strands are naturally randomly ordered and this configuration gives them some inherent stress.  As you work the strands, twisting them, joining them with other glass and doped metals, etc. you change their interactions and generally introduce more stress.

At high temperatures, at and above the annealing temperature, ( ~ 1040F for boro and 850F for soft) these strands actually have enough kinetic energy to move around a bit.  They do that, and move themselves into a more relaxed, less stressed configuration.

The problem is, once they drop below the annealing temperature it is impossible for them to move anymore.  All that stress that is left over is trapped in a static state.

This is why vermiculite never really replaces kilns. Particularly for thicker pieces!  Sure, it slows the cooling, but kilns are programmed to  do what is known as a thermal soak.  Essentially they sit at temperatures slightly above the annealing temperature for a while to make sure that all the stresses have been relieved.  You can see these kinks or stress using a polariscope.  

Borosilicate is much more forgiving of shock but if you work thicker and more complicated pieces you will eventually find vermiculite to be inadequate.

One interesting factoid:
Ever wondered why you can pull stringers and they don't thermal shock afterwards?  They are thin and actually cool much more rapidly!  They should be extremely susceptible to shocking.
It turns out, that the mere action of stretching something out forces the strands out of their random state and into alignment.  This relieves a significant portion of the stress.  Poor analogy, but think of tugging on a ball of yarn or extension cord at the ends.  

PS.  these stresses and strains aren't really the same as the thermal shock of expansion that can also crack/break glass.  That's why you can pull a piece out at 700 degrees in a locked in movement state, dunk it in  ice and still shatter it.",0,1364015082,,0,1364016086,1,c90u8jn,t3_1atf0o,t1_c90u8jn,t3_1atf0o,,1431675665,13,False,lampwork,t5_2saoj,13

True,Waxenwings,,,"I always get crap for My Chemical Romance being my favorite band for all sorts of reasons.  A lot of people hate them for going ""mainstream.""  Others tell me that it's crappy emo music.  Others still claim that they simply have no musicianship whatsoever.  But to the disillusioned 12 year old MCR was a lifesaver.  They got me into music in a way I never had been as a kid.  And amazingly, perhaps uniquely, their music grew up with me.  

I have never ever encountered a band that displayed as much versatility and willingness to experiment as My Chemical Romance.  They went from garage emo to thrash rock to bubble gum stadium pop rock to energetic day-glo alternative.  Having a chance to follow a band as dynamic as My Chemical Romance was an absolutely delightful experience because despite how much I grew up over the years I could never say that I had grown out of MCR because they grew up with me.  Whenever I grew out of a ""phase"" of my life they'd release a new record that reflected how I felt at that stage of my life.  It was as though they were writing the soundtrack to my life and it's absolutely shattering to me that I won't get to hear their next evolution.

True,carl2point6,,,"You've got to start smoking as much as you can. No kids think their parents are cool, so when they see you sucking down a carton or more per day, they'll know to steer clear. 

If that doesn't work, you're going to have to try scare tactics. Take them out late one night to look for meteor showers or some shit like that. Make sure you're all alone, and then have a friend in a disguise jump out from behind a tree and start chasing you with a knife. Your kids will be able to run away, but you will not be able to keep up.  While your kids are pissing their pants running down the street, cover yourself in pig blood and call out for them. They'll come back and see you lying on the ground bleeding out. Pull them in close and tell them that smoking did this to you. Tell them you could have run away and seen them grow up had it not been for the cigarettes destroying your lungs and your endurance. Embrace them for what they think is the last time, and slowly let your body go limp. You have now successfully been ""killed"" because of smoking.

This next part will be tricky. Arrange for a different friend to happen upon you, see the scene and take your children home to your SO, to whom the children will have to break the news of your death. Meanwhile you and your stab happy friend will need to high tail it out of the country and hide out for a while to really let the devastation kick in, also the police will be looking for your body and your killer so it will be best if you keep a low profile.

 It may be difficult being away from your family for an extended period of time, but would you rather see your lovely offspring rot away from the cancers caused by smoking? I thought not.  Spend your time traveling and discovering new cultures of the world, all while knowing you've taught your children the dangers of smoking.

True,WiseWordsFromBrett,,,"Its the 'Filter' that we can see past that others enjoy.  That ignorance is bliss statement is absolutely true.  Ever see some teenage girl going ballistic over something that just isn't important in the grand scheme of things?  Well, the truth is that 95 percent of people are leading their whole lives that way, and just can't see it because they see the world through that filter.  Ask yourself if you would rather be stupid and happy or have evolved to the point to recognize reality for what it is?  I ask myself that all the time as both have their costs and benefits.  Do termites matter in the world?  Of course they do.  Does a single termite matter?  Not one bit.  However, you should know that you are not as smart as you think you are, not yet, hear me out...

I have an exercise that I want you to try.  Make a little hand written note and put it by your TV or at least in sight of it.  It can say anything you want, even draw a little symbol if you like, but what it means is 'TV SHOWS are not real!'   Now, on the surface, dumb people say 'of course this isn't real, we cant travel through space on a spaceship', thanks Einstein, really good job understanding there puppet.  What it means is that good guys don't win, bad guys don't loose, and don't believe what Disney tells you.  No, you don't need that fancy new phone that is on the commercial every 5 minutes.  You are bombarded with a shit load of nonsense from TV all the time and yet you just let it go right through the filter you have.  You have some ability to not give a single fuck and let that Activia commercial pass right through you with out effect. You not only suspend your disbelief to allow yourself to enjoy 'The Matrix' when it comes on, but there are a second general layer to that where you allow yourself the comfort to think that good triumphs over evil, and the bad guy will loose and that is what you want to happen (its not what YOU want to happen nor is it 'natural', that is something that you were taught and has been reinforced over and over)  There is a third layer where you tell yourself that these commercials are bullshit and don't influence you, but i have a secret for you, they do and they do it often.

Here is the purpose of the exercise.  Glance at that note from time to time.  Think about what it means while you are watching.  You wont always see the note, but sometimes you will, and it will annoy the fuck out of you.  You are trying to decompress and relax by watching TV, but that note will fuck it all up.  Not only will you not enjoy some shows that you used to, but you will start to hate TV so much that you will want get rid of it, but you wont, because it is entertainment and easy for the lazy bones.  Go ahead and hate and hate and hate all that comes with that horrible little note.  Let it get under your skin how controlling the world is, and you are manipulated all the time.  Now, before you ever get rid of the TV (even though you and I both know you wont), get rid of the note.  Doesn't that feel better?  Isn't it nice to not be reminded how fake it all is?  Its OK, you still know its fake after all, you are not stupid, but isn't it nice to not be reminded of it all the time?   Using the same metaphor, start with the note in the center of screen, blocking your view.  Slowly but surely, allow the note to get smaller and more and more to the corner of the screen.  You still know the truth, but its ok to have a little fun and not let that note ruin it for you.

Now what we are really talking about is you aren't we?  I hope you get that there is no TV, and there is no note.  There is the world how it is, and there is a world that is bearable because we suspend our disbelief.  What you are going to have to learn how to do is to not stare at that note all the time.  When you were little, you had moments of pure joy over very trivial things.  And while big joy comes fewer and fewer times in your life as you age, it still comes.  As you age, time goes by faster and faster, and while chronologically, those joys happen further away and fewer by number, they will still keep a steady beat to you and you you perceive time.  There will be some truly shit moments like friends dying, maybe a fucked up divorce, or even unspeakable atrocities, but even those times will have a magic spark to them that you won't want to miss.  I can tell you from experience, that no matter how smart you think you are about it all, you are not, and you will always have something new to learn.  Today, you start to learn not to stare at that stupid little note so much and just enjoy what you can between commercials.

We go to a ""pharmacia,"" and I buy Viagra. Probably not the real stuff (in fact, definitely not), but fuck it, MEXICO. I ask my friend, should I take 2 viagra? He says ""FUCK IT, MEXICO!!!!"" I take 'em. I start trippin balls (from the ritalin alcohol combo). My heart is racing. I start seeing things. I think we are on a ski trip. Why am I wearing ski gloves? My friends take pictures of me. I am retarded. My heart is racing. My dick is pounding. Occaisionally, a girl asks me if I want to have sex. I am in no position to do anything but wonder why we aren't skiing yet. Eventually, I go to the ship hospital because my friend is worried about my heart and my dick. I show up. They say, ""oh condom boy! we remember you!"" I'm like ""whatttt????"" I ask them, ""how much is it going to take for you to tell me I'm NOT GONNA DIE?"" Nurse calls the doctor. She tells him the situation. I can hear him laughing through the phone. ""About $250"" she says. DEAL. They lay me down to do an EKG. I have toooooooo much chest hair. A small asian woman says, ""Ok I got to shave chest hair now!"" What? Like what? So she shaves 6 goddamn circles on my chest to put the electrodes on. They tell me I'm not going to die. I go back to the room. My friends remind of every dumb thing I'm ever done. I puke. I wake up the next day. Letter is under the door. It says ""Due to incidents at the infirmary, your alcohol privileges have been revoked!"" WORST SKI TRIP EVER.

True,Scaevus,,,"China was the global leader in GDP for about 700 years until the mid 19th century, when the corruption of the Qing Empire allowed a 100 year dark age, punctuated by civil war, WWII, more civil war, then the worst excesses of Communism, until the visionary leadership of Deng Xiaoping restored the country to a path of growth.  If you haven't heard of the man, Google him.  Rarely has a single person changed the lives of so many and shifted the entire course of human history.  It's not an exaggeration to say modern China would be unrecognizable without his reforms, which propelled China from North Korean levels of poverty and isolation to exalted heights of success in a single generation.  The only thing comparable in scope and speed would be the Meiji Reforms in 19th century Japan.


One could argue that it's a matter of timing, though.  Sooner or later China was going to rise again.  You can't expect to forever bottle up the creativity and genius of 1.3 billion people with a culture of competition and academic excellence.  This was inevitable.

True,snoopyzanus,,,"**EDIT:** Wow! A big thank you to the person who bought Reddit Gold for me!


This campaign is a masterpiece in marketing to feminists and white knights, with all of the right buttons pressed:

* The brothers are cast as villains so that the daughter can be a damsel in distress — a worthy victim to rally in defense/support of. 

* Part of her campaign is about ""raising awareness and getting girls thinking about careers in technology at an early age.""

* The video introduction on the Kickstarter page mentions helping send her to camp to make an RPG game so she doesn't ""end up like this woman"" (with picture of a woman with her arms around a fat, older man) ""&amp; sugar daddy becomes extinct as a life plan.""

Of course, this level of marketing skill doesn't come as a surprise when you factor in that the mother, the project manager, runs her own crowd-sourcing site ""[FundHer.com](http://fundher.com/)"" and is a ""[FORTUNE Top Ten Female Entrepreneur](http://www.kickstarter.com/profile/susanwilson).""

There are a number of things about [this Kickstarter campaign](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/susanwilson/9-year-old-building-an-rpg-to-prove-her-brothers-w) that leave a bad taste in my mouth.

According to [this site](http://www.mademan.com/mm/10-successful-women-entrepreneurs.html#vply=0) Susan Wilson is the CEO of a multimillion dollar company. Leaving aside any income her husband brings in, are we really to believe that this couple cannot afford to send their daughter to this camp themselves?

The girl already has a computer that ""works fine."" She has the game-making software already. She could make a game now without going to camp. If the week-long camp were really all this were about (I'm sure it would be great fun and she would get good coaching on using the drag-and-drop software), then I'm sure her parents could come up with the $829 themselves. But they give the real game away here:

&gt;""My goal is to raise $829 to cover the cost of RPG Camp. But my Mom just told me about the [Veronica Mars campaign](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/22/veronica-mars-campaign-movie-industry_n_2934328.html) so now I'm secretly hoping to raise more.""

[Pledge $10,000 or more](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/susanwilson/9-year-old-building-an-rpg-to-prove-her-brothers-w/pledge/new?backing[backer_reward_id]=1479238&amp;clicked_reward=true) (limited 5 of 5 left)

She needs $50,000 (or more) to go to a camp to make a RPG game using drag-and-drop software that she is already using at home? No. It's just greed, and I suspect that it is all orchestrated (and perhaps all written) by her mother. 

Besides, it seems like the campaign, set out as it is, may be against Kickstarter rules.

&gt;Prohibited uses:

&gt;No charity or **cause** funding.

&gt;Examples of prohibited use include raising money for the Red Cross, **funding an awareness campaign**, funding a scholarship, or promoting the donation of funds raised, or future profits, to a charity or cause.
    
&gt;No ""fund my life"" projects.

&gt;Examples include projects to **pay tuition or bills, go on vacation, or buy a new camera.**

While she does have the project of making a game, the campaign is to get funding to pay for a camp where she will be taught game design using the software she already owns. Her mother says that extra money will be used to buy her a laptop (she already has a serviceable computer she is using the software on). It is also explicitly stated that ""raising awareness"" is part of their campaign, as is the cause of getting more girls interested in tech. 

Last, but not least, it really is a disgrace that the brothers are repeatedly denigrated and portrayed negatively as ""mean,"" brats,"" ""stupid,"" and so on, being identified by photo in a way that will obviously lead to them being mocked.

Now, supposedly it's the girl herself saying and doing this, but even if it's not the mother behind it all (as I suspect), she signed off on it and the project is under her name. She did this to her own sons and any real-life negative consequences that come to them from being publicly portrayed as bullying, unkind, unambitious assholes are on her head.

True,saiyanhajime,,,"I appreciate what you're saying, but you're missing some vital information, and thats why this discussion needs to be had.

If you don't want to know, then feel free to stop reading now. I have no problem with that. It's your choice. But please don't deny others the option to educate themselves.

Performing unnecessary surgery on someone for traditional reasons with no consent is a human rights issue. It's really that simple. That's the main reason circumcision is an issue. 

If you're happy with being circumcised, I'm really, really happy for you! Many men are not. Few people voluntarily circumcised themselves, yet many men are not content with being circumcised. BUT, many of those men do not even realise their problems are related to being circumcised, which is why we need to make a big deal out of this and spread awareness.

Your circumcision isn't an issue now because you're young. The glans is a mucous membrane and years upon years of being exposed will lead to it thickening and this reduces sensitivity. A newly circumcised penis will be MORE sensitive than a uncircumcised, and this ""new"" sensitivity can last well into the 20s. Circumcised men have increased sexual disfunction as they age compared to non-circumcised men. Men in their 40s and beyond are where the problems really lie.

Not all circumcisions are the same! Not all people are the same! Many people will go without issues, others will have many. It's a lottery! It means fuck all that YOU'RE happy, you're one of the lucky ones. Plus, like I said, you're still young. It won't be effecting you yet, if it's going to.

Anyone who's had surgery anywhere on their body in memorable history and has scar tissue as a result will understand that ""increased sensitivity"" is not always positive. Hypersensitivity in scar tissue is weird, it feels weird, to the point of being uncomfortable. When circumcised men say ""I wouldn't want to be anymore sensitive!"" it's because they don't understand that their sensitivity is not the same as that of an unscarred penis. The more scarring a circumcision leaves, the more hypersensitive a circumcised penis will be. Women who've had to be cut or torn during pregnancy and have an uncomfortable piece of scar tissue will also understand this, some women have this cut out to attempt to allow it to heal better.

I know someone who's restoring their foreskin, but I also know someone who voluntarily went to be circumcised at 16. People are different, and that's why the choice needs to be present. I, personally, believe my friend will regret getting it done when he gets past 30. But that's irrelevant to me. All I want is for people to make a CHOICE. An INFORMED choice.

True,thatsnotpc,,,"First of all, much respect for tackling a sensitive social issue, especially when we know r/australia is far from sympathetic to the difficulties of Muslims or Arabs integrating into Australia. I know it's not easy. But let me share some history. 

My mother came to this country in the 50s and got the ""bloody wog"" treatment despite being blonde haired and blue eyed. Go figure. We should remember that Australia was basically one step above South Africa in the 1930s. The White Australia Policy was in force then and if you weren't Anglo you weren't welcome. So by the 1950s given that Australia had let in a bunch of ""flaming wogs"" (aka ""New Australians"") I'd say that's progress. 

I have an old relative who worked very hard to be accepted by the white Anglo Saxon protestant institution by forsaking much of his cultural color for decades. Also my paternal grandfather's entire family changed their surname to a nice English name upon their arrival in the 1930s. Even the famous John Monash's family dropped the C from their surname to make it sound less German (it was Monasch when his parents arrived in the 1850s-ish). I bet you didn't go that far, and it's because you didn't have to. That my son is also progress. 

When the first large groups came to Australia after WWII they faced huge pressure to assimilate. Language, sport, food and temperament. Each successive generation of ""new wogs"" (that there is a badge of honour btw) were encouraged to blend in and perhaps keep some of their local flavour. With the exception of Jews and Buddhists, the majority were some flavour of Christianity (yes there were others, but I said 'majority').

Now however we find ourselves in a world where there is global tension drawn along religious lines. Islam is on one side and the modern world on the other. You and I know it's really geopolitical bullshit parading as Islam, but people on both sides are influenced by all that nasty bullshit.

It occurs to me that you have one thing most of the ""nice"" Australians in this thread don't, and that's experience living somewhere other than Australia (and in your case other than Lebanon). So I think you probably see things more objectively than your fellow Muslim aussie mates, and more so than the nice Aussies responding  snidely elsewhere in this thread (some were dicks, just sayin).

So what's different after all that history?? Well for one, global politics are making your mobs' assimilation longer and harder. Also a lack of economic advancement makes things worse too. I guarantee you, my upper middle class Muslim mates don't really know what you are going through because they have better education (no offence, you are obviously smart, punctuation notwithstanding) they live in nicer/safer suburbs and have better chances of making an enviable living than many white Aussies. But they're not the majority.

Truth be told, if you want things to change, be the change you want to see. Help yourself and your community improve their economic circumstances and things will magically get better in about 10-20 years. It takes time so suck it up. But it took everyone decades, so don't whine. Do you think the parents of the Asian dude making a killing living now didn't sacrifice everything?

Look,  the key is education and investing in your local community. A lot of aggressive young guys from any country say they'd be willing to die for a cause, but how many are willing to live for one?

True,The_Flabbergaster,,,"I used to work at an upscale jewelry store in Atlanta. We had some pretty rich clients come in regularly, but one woman, who I knew only as Vanessa, was over the top. At least once every two weeks she'd come in and buy a new pair of earrings (I'm talking $500-1000 earrings, sometimes more) and pay for them with her card like it was nothing. She'd then saunter out and leave in her Range Rover. 

For a while, I didn't particularly have anything against her, but I got the sense that she was a bit of a snob. This was confirmed one day when we had a homeless man come to panhandle outside our store. I had just noticed him and was about to go politely ask him to leave when Vanessa pulled up in her Range Rover, rolled down the window, and spat at him through her botoxed up lips.

Needless to say, I was appalled. The homeless man walked away sullenly, and I was too shocked to really do anything about it (in retrospect, I really regret refusing her service, but since she was a regular my manager would have flipped a shit if I was rude to her).

Anyways, after spitting at the homeless man, Vanessa walked into the store, and grabs a new pair of earrings. She came up to the counter to swipe her card, and to my absolute delight it was declined. She was furious. After making me swipe her card at least 8 more times (in every different direction and orientation possible) she demanded that she be allowed to buy the earrings on credit with the store. I apologized and told her that this was strictly against policy, but she kept getting angrier and angrier until her face was the same colour as her liberally applied lipstick. 

Finally, after her yelling had scared out the other customers in the store,  our manager came out of the back to try to reason with her. To his credit, he handled it quite well, and she eventually stopped screaming. Still, though, she was really insistent on taking the earrings with her, and since we made several thousand dolars from this woman monthly, the manager was patient enough to talk her out of getting her credit card rewards and find some other way of paying.

When this woman was digging through her purse, she actually pulled out several hundred dollars, almost enough to pay for the earrings. Oblivious to the pointless struggle she had just put up, she looked up smiling and asked ""Could you please just lend me the money to buy these? I'm not some lying hobo, I'll pay it back.""

My manager wearily replied ""Alright, then, how much do you think you'll need?""

Vanessa looked down at the earrings in her hand, back up at us, and replied ""I'mma need about tree-fiddy.""

At this point I realized that this rich white woman was really a giant monster from the paleolithic era! ""Goddamnit Loch Ness monster I ain't giving you no tree fiddy!"" my manager shouted. Vanessa hunched over in shame and squeezed through the door of our shop, never to be seen again.

True,IAmPhilipFry,,,"I have two. Wall of text. 

One: My ex-girlfriend and I were going at it and I had her in, what I fondly call ""the Jackhammer"". She's flat on her back with her legs over my shoulders. Well, we are sprinting towards the finish and then she suddenly SCREAMS, ""I HAVE TO PEE!!!"" She hurls me off and sprints into the bathroom. We had a running joke for the rest of our relationship anytime either of us said something about having to pee, we would bust into laughter. She said she wasn't sure if she was going to cum or pee all over me, so she took the safer route and I was grateful. 

Second: Same girlfriend. Same apartment. She decides to be sexy and take me in the shower. We begin doing all the fun things a man and woman can do together, then we finally get to ""standard"" shower sex position. She was bent over in front of me. WELL. Just about the time I begin to reach my point of no return, I ALSO start feeling myself losing traction...so I had a choice: do I reset my feet and start over again or do I just go for the finish? I obviously went for the finish, it was the point of no return. Nothing was going to stop me. Right before I got to my climax, I slipped. I slipped forward and head butted her in the back, which caused her to shoot out of the shower. Wrapped in the shower curtain, she went head first into the rim of the toilet giving her quite the knot and a black eye. I continued forward into the faucet which cut me right above my eye.

A more appropriate conversation would be whether the incident in question was ""Unintentional Bad Sex"" or ""Involuntary Ladyravaging"". Neither of which should be treated the same as Intentional Rape.

The other 94 are super fine though. Do you eat any donuts? Fuck no you don't. Now imagine that all donuts produced carry the same percentage of risk.

True,GuardianOfAsgaar,,,"Oh, this is easy.

After my wife (at the time) giving me the cold shoulder for (I kid you not), 2 years, things finally reached the point we had to split up. The day she moved out, I immediately began a quest for some strange. Unfortunately, being out of the game for so long (close to 6 years) had turned my already poor game to a non-functional shadow of it's former self. After striking out night after night for months on end, I worked myself into a bit of a depression. I did the only thing I could think of: register on some internet dating / casual sex websites, browse CL, etc. After about a month, I began chatting with someone in my local area. Her profile pictures didn't exactly flatter her...but I figured, ""How bad could it be?"" We agreed to meet at my place in a couple of hours. This is where things went south...

Turns out she didn't have a car and wanted me to go pick her up. I flatly refused, starting to have second thoughts. She said she would take the city bus, even though the closest stop was 1/2 mile away. She just wanted me ""SO BAD"". At this point, I began thinking with the wrong head and calmly agreed. She would arrive in about 2 hours.
I showered, changed, and smoked a couple of bowls to calm the ever rising sense of fear and dread churning in my gut. She finally arrived about 2 hours later. The first things I noticed upon opening the door: her looks were much worse than her profile pictures, and the odor of BO and cigarette smoke was overpowering. I gagged a little bit, but kept my cool (thank you MJ). We sat on the couch, drank some soda, made small talk, etc. The whole time I'm having a full scale war in my head if I should claim to have a headache &amp; kick her ass to the curb, or make a move &amp; go for it. Well, we can all guess what I did. Yup. Leaned in and kissed her. Tasted exactly like an ash tray...but at this point I didn't care. Gonna end my dry streak!

After making out on the couch for a while with quite a bit of heavy petting, we went upstairs and stripped off what was left of our clothes. I should note at this point the only thing I can smell is BO &amp; stank pussy with a hint of stale cigarettes. While I normally enjoy to ""dine at the Y"", I opted to skip the buffet and just end my dry streak. So, I pulled her to the edge of the bed, put her feet on my shoulders and.........balls deep. Didn't feel half bad...pretty good actually....so I started pounding her...slowly at first, but quickly building up my tempo and strength. All those years of sexual tension and frustration being let out all at once. As I'm ramming her as hard as I can, I notice the faint whiff of feces. Figuring I just shoved a fart out of her, I laugh to myself and keep pounding. But the smell continues to get worse and worse...

So, I stop briefly and look down. What I saw defies anything my mind is able to process. My dick is covered in a rainbow of dark brown, light brown, and almost green-ish shit. Her pussy is covered in a rainbow of dark brown, light brown, and almost green-ish shit. I pull out, and re-enter a time or two completely unable to comprehend what I am seeing. The smell of shit is now permeating every olfactory receptor in my nostrils. This, combined with the sight of glistening shit all over my cock and her vag, short circuits my brain. I can't think of anything to do except stand up and mutter ""I think you should leave"" as I start getting dressed. She simply sat up, said ""ok"", put on her clothes, and left.
As I watch her walk away from my house, I strip down, toss all the clothes I was wearing into the garbage can, take the hottest shower I can stand all while scrubbing my genitals until I bled with a scrub brush &amp; antibacterial soap. I repeat the shower process multiple times over the next few hours.

I'm convinced had I not been stoned out of my mind, I would've killed a bitch that night.

True,bigbadbass,,,"I think this has been downvoted because you are basically asking for locals advice on all of SEA?

SEA is so well traveled every question has been answered 100 times. It does appear you haven't done too much research before asking questions, which is what you should do.

I'm not a fan of BKK, it's a fun night out and a good hub for the area, but I'm not a fan of big cities. I've been to the museum you mentioned, it's ok and not that far out of the way if you're in the KSR area.

Cambodian temple is obviously Angkor Wat. Go see Halong Bay in Vietnam.

Anway, a month isn't that long at all for SEA. You could spend the month in Thailand easily, or pick 2 of Laos/Vietnam/Cambodia. If you like to party I would go BKK - Phi Phi - Phangan - Tao (2 weeks), then back up to BKK and either north to Chiang Mai + Pai, then the slow boat to Luang Prabang, or east from BKK and Angkor Wat, Phnom Penh and S Vietnam.

True,hachiko007,,,"First. I live in Bangkok and have been here for years. 

You don't want to stay by the airport. That's the far edge of BangNa and you are better off closer into Bangkok. 

As for places to stay, I fucking hate Khao San road. There are better places, such as pretty much any place that rents by the month. You get a better deal that way. For simplicity, someplace close to Sukhumvit road will give you easy access to taxis and the BTS/MRT. If you book in advance on the web you get an even better rate.

**Places to see**

Go to see all the temples you can. Most are heavily published like Wat Phrao (climb to the top), and the Royal Temple, Wat Phrakaew. Both are along the river an a simple trip. Be respectful in temples. You can take pics, but in some places like Wat Phrakaew you need to wear polite clothes.

Go to Siam Paragon and go shopping there, Siam Discovery, Siam Central, and MBK. Walk down from there to Central World. Go to see the street venders in Siam Square (across from Paragon, between Chulalongkorn University and MBK). Phantip is a big 5 story IT mall just about 15 minute walk from Central World. Go there if you like IT stuff. 

If you like Art, the Bangkok Art and Culture Center is just across from MBK. 

There is a weekend market at the northern MBK stop of Mo Chit. IT is called Chakuchak and easy to get to. It's only open on weekends. 

The nightlife is good, just get out and walk. Go to eat street food. It is really good and inexpensive. Bangkok is NOT dangerous for the most part. Walk around Siam Square, go for a stroll down Sukhumvit between Nana and Phrom Pong (BTS stops). just go!!

If you want to go to the beach, it is really simple to get a van to Pattaya for 100B at Victory Monument (BTS stop).

Ride the BTS (sky train) and MRT (subway). Really simple and cheap. Get a map of it and use it to go places. 

There is a lot of stuff to do in Bangok, Some of it is simple, like walking down a small soi and seeing a place to eat with a band playing. Bangkok comes alive at night and it is not seedy bars and girls (even though that is available). There is a lot of food, nice people, and things to see. Take advantage of it. 

**Nightlife**

Bangkok night life is not dangerous unless you are just stupid and drunk. The girls, even the bar girls are really sweet compared to western. The assholes are the western guys. Go to some clubs around the popular areas. I hate bars, so I never go, but we have decent ones. 

If you want to see the lady boys, go to Nana. Down the street from Nana just past Asoke (I think it is Soi 31) is Soi Cowboy. Lots of bars with hot girls to lure you in for drinks. If you go to Pattaya, go to Walking Street...it's like Soi Cowboy but 100 times bigger.

Also, the paid for girls are cheaper in Pattaya. Go to Soi 6 in Pattaya (not 6/1, that is for gay). About 1,000B for an hour. In Bangkok it is 2,000B an hour. There are street girls for less, but in the fucking shops it is clean and well managed. If outside, you still have to pay 300B for a short time hotel. 

**girls...**

I will start with the negative. You can't just BUY Thai girls, so don't even think about it. No one gives a fuck if you are western (farang), in fact they probably like you less. They are very good natured and have respect for themselves. However, you can buy bar girls and girls in the fuck shops. Just don't think normal Thai girls are like that. Thailand gets a lot of negative shit over girls. Yeah, we don't frown on prostitution and it is available, but it is really a bad rap when compared to the normal Thai girl.

There are plenty of places for sex. Between Phrom Pong and Nana, you have many side street shops. There are plenty of maps you can find on Google with directions and locations. Most tend to be in certain areas and there are lots of details so I won't go into that. Some are legit massage shops, some are massage with hand job action, and some are just fucking shops. You can tell the fucking shops as they have a menu and will tell you the price. About 1900-2000B for a 1 hour massage and fuck. The massage hand job shops are not so open, but the girl may* ask you at the end. The straight up massage shops might get offended if you ask and tell you no. Do yourself a favor, get one of each. hahaha

I guess what I'm getting at is please treat Thai women with respect. They are MUCH better natured that western bitches and really have high respect. They are typically not crazy, will never speak loud or say anything bad. What we don't need are more farang assholes that think they can buy women, walk around drunk, or just be a loud western asshole. If you plan to be an asshole and complain, kindly fuck off now and don't come to Bangkok. 

There are rumors of girls that drug you. It is *pretty much* bullshit, but can happen on rare occasions. You have to be careful if a girl and then her friend just suddenly approach you in a bar and want to buy you a drink. 

**Food**

If I see you eat in a McDonalds I will go back in time and bitch slap your mom. You are in Thailand, eat THAI food. It is really, really good and comes in so many varieties. If you hate spicy food, we had other styles. I highly recommend Tom Yum Goong (soup), Tod Mon (fish cakes), ANY Esan food like Nam Tok (sliced pork) or Laab, and Som Tum. Just try all the street food. 

**Drugs....**

just stay away from them. We have Nigerian niggers here selling stuff, but you must know a little weed here is like a little heroin. They don't really differentiate levels of drugs like in the west. You can get serious time for simple shit. Unless you have a sure thing, be VERY careful. ",0,1364054777,,0,1364056012,1,c9104fe,t3_1auv41,t1_c9104fe,t3_1auv41,,1431678450,0,False,Thailand,t5_2qjw5,0

True,4io8,,envying the maturity of italian politics,"&lt;-- continued from previous post --&gt;

In order to have the positive identity we really needed to look at our history, work out the positive aspects, and incorporate them into the stories we tell about ourselves. Keating was trying to do that, but for the reasons I mentioned above we never really got far.

So we have been building a symbolic identity for the last ten years. It started with the Sydney Olympics. But I think Howard actively encouraged it. Alot. He was just as uncomfortable with all that deep soul searching stuff and just wanted us to feel proudly Australian. And I think that he knew, deep down, that the values you find in Australian history that are positive, are actually quite different to his own. Or at least he felt that if he let artsy fartsy types like historians into the discussion they would not agree with him.

So he settled for symbolic identity. He, and the rest of the political conservatines that were in power up until 2007 happily imported the American symbolic forms of nationalims. Lots of flags. Lots of them. Lots of symbols.

The worst thing he did was what was done to ANZAC day. When I grew up ANZAC day was a solemn occasion. It was **not** a celebration. The veterans came together and basically did one thing. Remembered the guys who did not come back. You could see it in their faces. It was not a happy day.

&gt; They shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old:
&gt; Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn.
&gt; At the going down of the sun and in the morning,
&gt; We will remember them.

&gt; Lest we forget

Those words are ANZAC day. You see Australians in war fight pretty hard. They have a reputation as the best soldiers in the English speaking world. And they take heavy casualties. There are alot of guys who did not come home. And they traditionally did not fight for nationalist jingoistic bullshit. They fought because they had to. 

There is a really long tradition of Australian veterans being quite anti-nationalist and anti-war going back to WWI. When they watched their friends die under incompetent leadership by generals who would wave flags around while knowing fuck all. The RSL, for example, was **against** the most recent Iraq war.

But Americans are not like that. They tend to celebrate their military. So Howard copied that as a form of cheap symbolic national identity. I still cannot believe that they turned Gallipoli itself into a rock concert party. But, well, scratch another value. Anti-nationalism. We paid another price. We traded a genuinely admirable tradition of anti-war, skepticism of cheap symbols, ironcially, for actual cheap symbolic moments. And again, probably gone forever. Those young guys of today who go to Gallipoli will not even share that value with the veterans of the battle they are trying to remember. Its really sad.

Now I said earlier that you can have positive actionable values/identity, or a cheaper symbolic one. But there is a third way you can do it. Negatively, as the opposite of something. You see it in the great sporting rivalries of the world. Barcelona and Real Madrid. They define themselves in part by being against the other team. “I hate Real Madrid”. A negative identity.

Australia did the same thing. After a year of feeling good about all our flags it was september again. 2001. And the start of the global war on muslims. Lets call it what it actually is.

In this case we got tied up in a wider identity problem of the entire western world, and America in particular. For people who came of age after 2001 it will probably never be possible to explain the impact  of 9/11 properly. It was like waking up and finding the world had changed. Things were actually pretty good just before 9/11 Read this http://www.theonion.com/articles/bush-our-long-national-nightmare-of-peace-and-pros,464/ article. That’s The Onion. Its a satire piece. Try to imagine a world where that entire article was *light joke*. Where the world of international peace, economic prosperity, falling crime, and things just being fantastic was *taken for granted*.

Where the *Taliban* visited Washington to negotiate oil pipeline deals. A world where muslims were *just another group*. You know what the US Ambassador to Australia did the day of 9/11 *after* the attacks? He went to the Canberra mosque. He sat down with the Imam. Imagine that happening today.

So we followed America and developed a negative identity. “We hate muslims”. After 9/11 things were bad for muslims. There was understandable anger. But most political leaders went out of their way to try and defuse it. Even Bush. I expected things to be bad for a while, and then to slowly get better. Its been a decade and I am still waiting. It was really confusing to me. Why, so long after 9/11 are things still so bad? Its actually alot worse today than in 2001. Back then people felt anger, but the media and politics tended to hold back alot and focus on the issues, work with their muslim allies etc. Its not like that any more.

Eventually I realised what happened. Being anti-muslim became part of Australia’s and many western countries identity. It was how they defined themself. It was a belief they have about themself. As such it re-inforced itself alot of over the past decade. Its why its worse today than it was back in even the immediate aftermath of 9/11.

You see, despite the peace and prosperity, the 90’s were a confusing time for the western world, America in particular. They had just spent the last 50 years fighting the communists who rather rudely just got up and vanished. America’s identity had been in large part “We are anti-communist”. So when that became meaningless they were quite lost. And America is a place that is hard to hold together. It has very different cultures and values. Immigrants from all over the world. Its hard for 300 million people to agree positive values. They manage it, but just barely. The whole mess about Clinton, and in fact their whole politics ever since Clinton was elected is a demonstration of how little they have consensus on. So they need an enemy like the communists to have a negative identity. “We *all* hate the communists”. It needs to be a strong enemy so you feel good about yourself for opposing them. Having a negative identity like “We hate Bermuda” just makes you feel small. But durirg the 90’s no-one was big enough to fill that role. Eventully it should have been China, but they were still two decades away from being big and ugly enough to be a respectable enemy. Then 9/11 happened and muslims stepped in to fill that void of someone to define yourself against. Most significant psycho-social event of the last two decades, and probably for the next two at least.

Of course it was the perfect moment for Australia. A country searching for idenity, struggling to find it, had a new one dropped right in its lap. And its been enjoying it ever since. Every time there is a Daily Telegraph headline or Today Tonight episode about muslims this, or muslims that, a little part of millions of people’s brains lights up and remembers “Australians hate muslims”. And that feels good. Nothing makes people happier than having their identity validated. Nothing. Why do you think people climb Mt Everest, or struggle through the jungles of New Guinea? So they can get their identity as an acheiver validated. How does it feel Rangers to be a Rangers fan when they beat Celtic? Amazing.

Or watching your leader tell boat people to fuck off?

When people see the group they are opposed to being attacked, they feel their identity as a member of their own group validated. Simple human nature. And its one of the ways Australian identity is being held togther. 

All this bas been reinforced so often for the last decade that its just normal for a young guy from the shire to grab a few symbols (tattoo of the southern cross, Australian flag sticker on the rear window), and repeat some phrases about how much he hates muslims he heard on the radio while having no idea where these behaviours came from, or why he thinks this way. But that’s the nature of identity. It ingrains itself early and subconsciously at such a deep level you never think about it.

True,[deleted],,,"The student that would've gotten me fired if I didn't quit.

I taught in an after-school drawing program in the mid 2000's.  While it was just glorified babysitting for two hours a day, I'd give instruction on how to draw a scene or cartoon character for the first hour then have a ""free draw"" hour afterward so they can color or draw something else with their knowledge.

This one fourth grade girl always showed up late, sat in the back, and talked constantly with her four friends.  What I didn't like about her was how she would take more and more students to the back with her, so this group of five became a group of ten (half the class).  They were loud, and half the time they ditched the class (which reporting was a huge pain without access to the school's roster program), but the one thing that made her an unbearable nightmare...

...Was her bitch enabling mother.

Her mom was an absolute basket case, an obvious divorcee who was upset beyond measure that her caring ""douchebag"" ex-husband wanted to enrich his daughter's education with extra curriculars like it was some grudge move.  When mom would come in on the weeks to pick her up, it was never a hello or thanks, it was just a quick grab of the wrist, sometimes fifteen minutes early, and out they went.

She accused me of being a bad teacher because her daughter and her friends never drew anything, but I showed her the stuff kids three to four grades under her drew, and invited her to sit in on a class (spoiler alert, she never did).

But the afternoon I almost punched her mom in the face was when she came in and dragged her out ten minutes early, then came storming back in as we were wrapping up, and was shouting like a tantrum-fueled toddler at a first grader because apparently he wouldn't stop touching her arm.  Mom was way off the deep end, screaming with hellfire that this kid was a menace, that he would grow up to be a rapist, and I had to intervene immediately.

Mom was actually crying.  I took her outside, and told her to wait just two minutes so she could deal with me properly, and not berate this poor kid further.  Went back in, got clean-up underway, and told the kid that he didn't do anything wrong, didn't deserve that, and on his way out to not make eye contact with the mom.

Went to go talk to her, and tell her very sternly to never yell at the kids like that.  I was quite furious, and in the two minutes I spent trying to shake it off, I actually found myself getting progressively angrier at this horrible human being.  I had a lot I wanted to say about her and her terrible daughter and how I wish I had the power to kick her out of the program without a refund and how she was ruining the classroom environment, but miraculously, mom left.

She didn't even wait the two minutes I asked.  Just as well.  I probably would've gotten fired after the tongue lashing I was ready to unload upon her.

Still her daughter wanted out at all costs, even if that meant lying.  She found she couldn't get out lying about the students picking on her (though she was quite a bully), so her next idea was to lie about the teacher.

I showed up with my laptop, and showed the kids a number of paintings by Monet as well as a few comic book covers.  The lesson was a bit on color theory, and I wanted to show how both old paintings and contemporary pop art follow the same rules of composition, and did the lesson entirely with colors and no penciling beforehand.  It was actually an awesome lesson, one of my much better days, even the clique in the back started doing some painting.

Of course, nightmare student just groused and pouted.  She drew a single star with red, turned it in, then just sat in the back.  I was actually getting really concerned for her, and was afraid something at home was preventing her from focusing or just being a human being for once.  I decided to have a meeting with my boss to see what I could do.

He Emailed me first.

""Nightmare Student's mom Emailed me AGAIN tonight.""  If the words were hand-written, they probably would've been etched with enough force to tear the paper.  ""You have some major explaining to do.  Her daughter said you brought in your laptop and showed them nudes.  Photographic nudes for reference.""

I responded immediately, showing him the images I sent out, then explained the girl's horrible behavior in class, her awful mother, and apologized (apologized!) for not bringing it up earlier.  I said she had been ditching class, and looking for ways to get out of it, and if he were to ask any of the other kids or their parents they would say I did no such thing.

""Thanks,"" he responded.  ""That's a relief.  But mom already said she told the principal and all the other parents, and I don't know what to say to her or her mom when I meet them next week, the school probably won't renew us next season because of this.  I'll try to find another campus to post you at.""

Knowing how far mom took her daughter's lie, I was going to have no more of this.  I realized how easily an idiot child could ruin my life forever, how one lie to get out of a class they didn't want to be in could drag me down in flames, and was terrified at just how willingly a piece of shit mother like her's would take her darling daughter's side.

""Don't bother,"" I explain over the phone after thinking it through.  ""Tell the principal I'm tired of the mom and daughter's crap, and wish them the best of luck in their miserable pathetic lives.  Have somebody less patient deal with their trivial shit.  I quit.""

True,jjjmills,,,"It depends on what you mean by ""worst."" Hello, wall of text!

* A parent pulled strings to get her kid who could not read or write into my advanced HS writing class. The kid was nice and all, but he was definitely the worst student, in the sense that he really did not have the ability to do what everybody else was doing. Figuratively speaking, I cut the strings that Mom pulled and had him put into a remedial class instead.

* I had another HS kid who could read and write (not at grade level, but still, better than many of his peers) but who was extremely impulsive. In addition to continually getting into fights with his peers (both male and female), he threw stuff in the classroom (at me, at other students, out the windows), farted out loud, and had this horrible habit of announcing his desires and discomforts to the whole world.

""I'm HUNGRY!""

""Damn, I gotta PISS!""

""It's fuckin' COLD in here!""

""Damn I'm HORNY!""

He wasn't the only one who did this (I can't imagine what type of home environment would create a person who, instead of saying ""Hey, mind if I eat something?"" or ""What are we having for lunch?"" or even ""Mom, can you feed me please?"" just walks around shouting ""I'M HUNGRY!"") but he was definitely the worst offender.

One day we had a fire alarm (a real one--this happened often at this particular school). He was the last student out of the room and when he left he laughed in my face and slammed the door shut. He stood outside holding the doorknob so I couldn't get out. He wrenched or jacked the knob so hard that, once he fled the building, the doorknob didn't work any more. I was trapped in my classroom with the fire alarm going off and I couldn't call anyone to let me out because they had all gone outside with the students. So I sat there with my fingers in my ears (the fire alarm was VERY loud) for about an hour. Eventually I heard voices outside -- it was the firefighters responding to the call. I explained the situation through the door and they all had a good laugh, then they brought a custodian in to jimmy the door open. That was the worst day of my teaching career. And then of course the kids mocked me for it for weeks afterward. That kid was definitely the worst in terms of classroom behavior.

* The last one was the worst human being I have ever known. He was a very bright student, made good grades, and impressed all the teachers and many of his peers with his talent, but he was (and is) an utter sociopath. I fell under his spell for his 9th &amp; 10th grade years, but by the time he got to 11th grade I was starting to get suspicious. By the end of his 11th grade year, all the teachers knew he was a piece of shit, and by the time he graduated he was roundly hated by many of his peers and any teacher that had him in class. He lied, he stole, he cheated, he backstabbed his friends &amp; gossiped vigorously about them, and he was utterly amoral about all of it. He schemed his way into a full scholarship to an out-of-state university with a prestigious program in his field of interest and got kicked out within a year for selling drugs.

**TL;DR Worst student (academically) couldn't read or write; worst student (behaviorally) trapped me in a classroom during a fire; worst student (morally) turned everyone against him and lost a scholarship for being a drug dealer.**

True,Joelo246,Lakers1,Lakers,"**Team by team analysis part 1**

**Performance against Playoff Teams**: Overall, this team has one of the smallest drop-offs in win % against playoff teams of anyone out there (going from 78.7% to 71.0%). Their +4.82 point differential against playoff teams is second only to San Antonio. But who has actually given them trouble this season? 

Lets break it down:
First, let’s establish who isn’t beating Miami. **Brooklyn** is an easy one to cross off, they’re 0-3 against Miami and have lost by 30, 20, and 13, failing to reach 90 points in all 3 games. How about **Atlanta**, they’ve got athletes and a good inside game, right? 0-4 against Miami with losses of 17, 13, 9 and 6. Atlanta’s high in those 4 games is 92. The common thread? Well, for one, both teams rate at the bottom of the league in turnovers (26th and 27th), which is pretty much a death sentence against Miami. Both teams are also among the worst in the league at defending the 3PT line (21st and 27th), the other area where Miami puts teams away (Miami shot 39% from 3 against Atlanta and 44% against Brooklyn). Miami also took away their 3PT games, something both teams rely on.

How about **Houston** and **Denver**? They’ve competed, but they’re also a combine 0-4, with losses that look like this: 113-110, 98-93, 114-108, 119-109. Miami’s not shutting these guys down on D, but you’re also not going to beat Miami by playing at a high pace with no defense – their offense is just too relentless and too efficient. We can also go ahead and cross off the **Lakers**, good luck beating Miami when you turnover the ball like crazy and can’t defend the fast break at all, they’re 0-2 against Miami with losses of 10 and 9 points.

**Oklahoma City**? Also 0-2, with losses of 97-103 and 100-110. There’s no doubt OKC can compete with Miami… but with no real inside presence and being a poor passing/high turnover/high iso team, Miami has really taken control of this matchup by matching OKC’s athleticism, being superior at defending isos, and being much more disciplined and deadly on their perimeter passing. OKC has held Miami’s 3PT shooting in check in their meetings, but lost the battle badly in the paint, likely a reflection of Lebron’s athletic advantage over Durant.

**Milwaukee** somehow got on the short list of teams to blow out Miami (beating them 104-85 Dec 29th), in a weird game where Larry Sanders  destroyed Chris Bosh and Milwaukee basically never turned the ball over (5 turnovers to 20 for the heat), but I’m going to call this one a fluke. Milwaukee has also lost 94-107 and 106-113 to Miami, and while they are surprisingly decent defensively thanks to Larry Sanders and Luc Mbah a Moute, their defense is not good enough to overcome how far behind Miami they are offensively.

**Utah** and **Golden State** have also both traded games with Miami, with Utah winning 104-97 and losing 89-105, and Golden State winning 97-95 and losing 75-92. Those teams are scrappy, but with Golden States defensive woes and Utah’s across the board mediocrity, neither of them have a chance against Miami in 7.

True,jesyspa,,,"Interesting that there's always either 1 or 3 darks between a light, except at the edges of lines.  This hints that either the line breaks are 0s or each of the lines should be seen as a separate message.  Seeing as the lines alternate between dark and light as first symbol, the former seems a little more likely.  However, the 104 symbols present as-is seems much more agreeable than the 107 which we get if we include the line break symbols.  (Adding a line break to the end would only make things worse, as it would make a 2-symbol character.)

Assuming that the line breaks are significant, we can consider what happens when we treat lights as delimiters, 1 dark as a 0 and 3 darks as a 1.  We end up with the binary sequence `0001001010001100010010100110101001000100` which is equal to `79663098436` and is not interesting.  It doesn't correspond to any interesting binary, nor does the inverse correspond to anything.

Oh, by the way, looking at columns and treating them as ASCII doesn't help.  Besides, this wouldn't explain the curious pattern.

My main guess is still morse-code, will write a program to generate all morse code strings it could encode and report back.

EDIT: Hm, generating *all* more code strings leads to more results than I had anticipated; I wasn't aware morse code is so darn ambiguous.  Perhaps looking at what solutions different fragments give while only generating part would make sense.  Here's the code I was using, but something smarter (no ridiculous repetitions, for one) is probably necessary to make much sense of this:

True,KingsNobleScientist,,,"This is a pretty comprehensive answer, I think.  Most people have their own reasons for disliking GMOs in general, and Monsanto in particular.

If I may add a few points:

* Many modern GMO crops are designed to be used with ~~pesticides~~ herbicides, and so ~~pesticides~~ herbicides are often overused.  Because GMOs are typically used on monoculture farms that don't cycle crops or let land lie fallow (biodiversity is its own issue, see parent comment), heavy doses of fertilizer are often used.  Both are encouraged by an industrial food system that GMO crops allow to exist.  Overuse of both ~~pesticides~~ herbicides and fertilizer is terrible for the land, and can poison water supplies.

* Monsanto, specifically, has consistently pushed their GMO crops on developing countries, along with IP laws that completely change the way farming has been done for centuries (no saving seeds, etc).  This has effectively forced thousands of farmers into debt (now that I mention it, their push for IP protection of their seeds has forced thousands of American farmers into debt or out of business, too), and [it has been suggested that this contributes to a large number of suicides of farmers in developing nations](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-21077458).

* On top of that, Monsanto has a record of taking great advantage of the ""revolving door"" between corporate and government representatives.  A current, notable example: The Supreme Court is currently considering a case, Monsanto v Bowman, in which Bowman is accused of infringing Monsanto's patent for Roundup Ready seed (he bought a mix of grain to use as seed from a grain elevator, that mix happened to have some Monsanto grain).  One of the justices, Clarence Thomas, actually worked for Monsanto in the late 70s, and has ruled in favor of the GMO industry in the past (specifically in one of the cases that actually allowed GMOs to be patented in the first place).  [Other notable ties between Monsanto and the US government here](http://i.imgur.com/QYPYRuA.jpg), I believe by Lawrence Lessig.

&gt;Misinformation regarding IP enforcement. Someone tells someone else about something they remember reading and the false information becomes fact. A few years ago there was some nonsense going around about Monsanto suing farmers when seed blew on to their land and grew, the real story was two separate cases; one where a farmer recycled seed to use for a second season (against the agreement farmers sign to access seed) and another where a farmer cultivated seed he picked up from a neighboring farm.

And for the record, there's more to it than ""nonsense.""

&gt; As interviews and reams of court documents reveal, Monsanto relies on a shadowy army of private investigators and agents in the American heartland to strike fear into farm country. They fan out into fields and farm towns, where they secretly videotape and photograph farmers, store owners, and co-ops; infiltrate community meetings; and gather information from informants about farming activities. Farmers say that some Monsanto agents pretend to be surveyors. Others confront farmers on their land and try to pressure them to sign papers giving Monsanto access to their private records. ... When asked about these practices, Monsanto declined to comment specifically, other than to say that the company is simply protecting its patents. http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2008/05/monsanto200805

Personally, I'm somewhat ambivalent towards GMOs themselves, though I am very concerned about the environmental impact of monocultures and the overuse of ~~pesticides~~ herbicides and fertilizers.  However, Monsanto is undeniably a shitty corporation.

True,[deleted],,,"I agree with some of what you have said but have a few quibbles;

&gt; This has effectively forced thousands of farmers into debt (now that I mention it, their push for IP protection of their seeds has forced thousands of American farmers into debt or out of business, too)

This presumes that farmers are somehow forced to purchase Roundup Ready seed, unless you are suggesting they should give the seed away for free I don't understand this point of view at all. 

Pushing the IP issue is indeed a concern worthy of debate though, this is one area where I believe IP protection should be significantly curtailed.

&gt; and it has been suggested that this contributes to a large number of suicides of farmers in developing nations

This goes back to involved parties. The spike in suicides preceded the introduction of the seed by 14 years, the argument could be made that it may contribute to the the existing problems today but not that it created the situation nor that its likely the largest factor.

I could turn this argument around and state that the EU and US are responsible for Indian farmer suicides by blocking their produce from import.

&gt; On top of that, Monsanto has a record of taking great advantage of the ""revolving door"" between corporate and government representatives.

The ""revolving door"" is unavoidable, in order for regulators to be able to understand the industries they regulate its necessary for them to have worked in those industries. While I appreciate people find this extremely suspicious its important to isolate cases of true corruption from simple regulatory failures and not allow the suspicion of this effect to cloud  our judgement of how effective (or ineffective) regulation is.

I would agree entirely that we need a better mechanism to control for corruption but attempting to remove the revolving door effect will make regulation entirely ineffective, those regulating will have no idea what they are attempting to regulate. One of the better ideas I have heard proposed here is to tie regulator pay to private industry pay for the activity they are regulating +10% to attract the most talented people from the private sector.

&gt; One of the justices, Clarence Thomas, actually worked for Monsanto in the late 70s, and has ruled in favor of the GMO industry in the past (specifically in one of the cases that actually allowed GMOs to be patented in the first place). Other notable ties between Monsanto and the US government here  , I believe by Lawrence Lessig.

Perhaps it might seem proper for him to recuse himself but I would be hesitant to suggest bias in ruling given his track-record with IP in the past. He is universally in support of it and of all the justices he is the most hesitant to allow the federal government to regulate anything (quite famously he has upheld both the right of the federal government to prohibit the sale of marijuana while also upholding the right of an individual to cultivate it for their personal use). Would it make the case appear more sound if he was not ruling on it? Sure. Would his decision be different if he had not been involved with Monsanto? Absolutely not.

I think this again another cases of involved parties. If he recuse himself then those attempting to restrict GMO products believe they would gain numerical superiority. I suspect that the calls are less about a belief he would actually later his opinion based on his prior relationship and more him not ruling would benefit the position they are attempting to advance. I would take the same position with the two justices who have worked for environmental lobby organizations if the situation was reversed.

This kind of situation is certainly one where we need to carefully examine what is occurring to ensure no corruption is occurring but a prior relationship from 40 years ago shouldn't discount  a justice from ruling particularly when there is not someone to take their place.

&gt; As interviews and reams of court documents reveal, Monsanto relies on a shadowy army of private investigators and agents in the American heartland to strike fear into farm country. They fan out into fields and farm towns, where they secretly videotape and photograph farmers, store owners, and co-ops; infiltrate community meetings; and gather information from informants about farming activities. Farmers say that some Monsanto agents pretend to be surveyors. Others confront farmers on their land and try to pressure them to sign papers giving Monsanto access to their private records.

I agree that's creepy as hell and as I said I don't consider Monsanto to be a contender for a business ethics award anytime soon but that is very different from the myth they sued farmers when seed was blown on to their land.

True,kongforaday,,,"This touches on so much interesting stuff for me... (and well said, BTW)

I mean I consider myself to be very liberal, but there are always people out on the more radical left who are going to tell me that I may as well be a conservative if I'm going to disagree with them, so I guess I'm actually moderate.  I love the ideals of the far left, but typically I feel like their plans just aren't that realistic.  So many people want to just ""tear it all down"" without much of a clear plan of what comes next.  Historically what comes next is often even worse, and definitely not the utopia that was promised...  I think of the cultural revolution in China for example.  The ideal was social equality, but what they got was something altogether different. (I don't mean to get hyperbolic, but you're the one who brought up hanging people from cranes... :p) But it's hard to bring up these points because to many ears they echo the words of conservative pundits ranting about socialists, and I am just soooo much closer to your end of the spectrum  I hate those guys.

I've been learning a lot from lurking and attempting to participate on this forum though.  I feel like I was taught to believe that everyone was equal, but my notions about it were sort of naively hippyish.  I just didn't care whether someone was gay/straight/black/white/martian/whatever.  Never have, and that's from the heart.  But what this community has taught me is that actually completely ignoring it also means ignoring my own privilege relative to others, and I honestly never thought about that very much before on an individual level.  I was very aware of it in general terms, but I didn't bring it into my dealings with individuals much.  I had always just though not caring about it was the same thing as promoting equality. I'd stick up for any person who I thought wasn't being treated fairly, whether they were a woman or a man or whatever, not based on what group I thought they belonged to, but just on a situation by situation basis. 

But consider that other recent thread about Adria Richards.  If those guys were basically just not caring or noticing that Adria is a woman, which is basically how I was taught to think, then what would they have done? They would have just gone ahead and made dick jokes.  So to some degree, it has turned my whole notion of what it means to be egalitarian on its head... 

I do hang on to these hippyish notions though.  That peace comes through mutual understanding and real communication for example.  You need to humanize your opponents. And that means you as much at them.  Humanize yourself for them and try to humanize them for yourself as well.  It's not so much that stereotyping the people SRS targets does them harm in the same way as it would do to an oppressed group.  It's that stereotypes are the opposite of real understanding and peace comes through understanding.  It's an essential part of real communication.

Just a few months ago I was thinking, wow you know I don't even have a single Republican or Christian friend, I must actually be a radical liberal. I just fight with them, because I can't hear their views without calling them out. One side effect of that is that I tend to tune them out to such a degree that I'm actually almost shocked when I come face to face with the fact that so many people actually think that way.  I actually just forget, because most of the people I'm friends with are liberal hippie pagan freak poet misfit lunatic artists and so forth (and at the same time I do consider that the luxury of being able to be that kind of free thinker is also a function of privilege) . And while I have indeed spent time in the corporate world, I've always avoided cultural assimilation and mostly worked from home (and that too is a function of my privilege, I do recognize).

Now, I'm not sure where I would be placed on the ideological spectrum any more.  I've had some PM discussions with SRS folks and they usually end up telling me I'm just defending my privilege or think I'm an undercover agitator for the opposition, because, you know, I like George Carlin. Fucking hell.  I also love Margaret Atwood, you know.  I was told that I cared about language more that I cared about people just because at a certain point in my life I decided always writing ""he/she"" made for awkward sentences and I was just not going to trouble myself too much about defaulting to ""he"" as a generic pronoun.  That just seemed like an awfully big judgement to make about me for such a small thing.  I mean, at least I actually worried about it.  This group just seems so reactionary to me.  I am so not that guy that they want to hate, and yet all it takes is a few poorly chosen words for me to be cast in that role. 

It's all very mind expanding though.  I love to learn, especially by engaging with people who have very strong views which differ from my own. 

I'm also over 40 and I went to a liberal arts college (yes, I studied CS at a liberal arts college). I walked past graffiti that said ""all men rape"" every day on my way to class.  And it always made me hurt inside a bit. Not because I was personally offended so much, as that I felt that gender relations were just so damaged that there was no hope of healing. I've been through the youthful idealism tunnel and come out the other side already, as have most of my friends... I think a lot of folks around here are still in college and filled with youthful passion for changing the world.  I'm just never going to buy into any ideology wholesale because I think that the world is just more complex than what any ideology can convey.  I can't buy into any movement that takes a ""with us or against us"" stance, because I recognize that there is a whole spectrum of valid viewpoints out there.

* Portrait animation is not synced to dialogue, this was broken by the Sc2 update

* Attacking the objective in Episode 3 Mission 9 causes the game to freeze for a while every attack

* Some units are appearing as white orbs in some missions

* Some portraits don't display correctly if Shaders are on Ultra

I've been here 13 years myself.

It's that all the things you mentioned in your rant, for the most part, *are not considered rude* in this culture. Saying ""waygookin"", for example. They really have *no clue* that we would be offended by that.  

&gt;Korean apologists will give reasons for this but I think they will be insufficient for me.

There are two possibilities here. Either Koreans, as a people, are fundamentally rude, or you are measuring them against Western social etiquette.  

You know what's funny? Listening to Koreans who don't speak English and have little understanding of Western culture, the ones you're likely talking about, complain to me about the unbearably rude behaviour of other Westerners.

 It really is amazing how many little things we do that Korean's find horribly crass and inconsiderate. My wife *still* regularly points out ways that I inadvertently offend people by the way I speak or act, or don't speak or act. 

You know what's *really* funny? I find Koreans are far more forgiving when foreigners break Korean social etiquette *in their own country*. They're usually quick to give the benefit of the doubt and write it off as cultural misunderstanding, even when it isn't.

True,mathsforlife,,,"As a teacher in an almost failing district, with a few of my students in more than a little trouble with the law, I feel that the article is glossing over the problem. Sure these kids are worried that they are not being prepared for the future, and that is great, at least they are aware of the future. But there has got to be some ownership of the problems. Classes are not working because of the kids in them. We have ID rules because assholes come into schools and start fights and kidnap people, IDs being something these kids need to know how to wear for many jobs anyway. We have dress codes to discourage kids from screwing in stairwells and fighting over gang colors. Kids can't learn because they aren't able to sit and concentrate. They have shitty home lives, and they bring all of their chaos to schools. Of course you can't learn algebra if dad is going to drink himself stupid and beat you when you get home. And of course you can't learn if your classmate is the kid from the last sentence and is calling you a retarded bitch because he feels so much hurt he doesn't know what else to do. The schools are trying. The teachers are trying. These people don't wake up every day and walk to work thinking that today they are going to sentence a kid to a worse life. This issue is huge and ugly, and changing a rule about ID badges isn't going to fix much.

True,CheapBastid,,,"I've seen many wonderful and insightful comments, and folks who are getting serious (or thinking of getting serious) should read them and take them to heart.

I'll chime in with some specific things that really help, even though they are echoed in other comments I want to call them out specifically:

1) Expectations are Dangerous - The real issue that drives people apart is the resentments that gather from unmet expectations.  This is why you hear so many folks say that communication is key.  This is not incorrect, but there is a very specific thing that helps - clarifying expectations.  What you think of as 'married' is never exactly what your partner thinks of as 'married'.  This leads strongly into #2...

2) Value Alignment is critical - This is something that ties in strongly with 1 above.  All the key components of life can seem 'obvious' to you, but if you do not spend the time really going over them while expressing your views and also really understanding your partner's on the following:

Money

Sex

Friendships

Religion/Spirituality

Children

Time away from each other

Play

Work

...you're going to have a bad time.  Also (as **ElementalSoup** reminded me) these things can (and likely will in unexpected ways) change over time. Keep checking in with each other and reduce the resentment load!

3) Learn how to Fight - You will disagree, you will likely also fight.  Learning how to express yourself when upset is so important to reduce the damage that can accumulate (see 'accumulated resentment' in 1 above).  Understanding that being upset at your partner does not warrant attacking your partner (obviously physically, but also emotionally/psychologically) can be a hard won but vital lesson.  Anger and Pain are almost guaranteed  to be some part of your interactions with your partner, and if you have not felt it yet it's likely you have not reached into each other deeply enough to trigger old wounds.  You may be surprised, you may be hurt, and you need to find ways to communicate that without escalating the damage that is taking place.  Simple things like expressing yourself with 'I' centered statements help, but there is much work in this space that can be healing and can help you grow together.  I was given a wonderful gift by **xiko** of a [How To Fight As a Couple - by Ze Frank](http://youtu.be/IE-P11KKYFs).

True,CubedFish,,,"We have 5 rules,

1. When you are wrong admit it, and when you are right shut the fuck up.
2. Learn how to fight. What you fought about in the past, stays in the past. Don't dredge old shit up. Calm your self down, figure out why you are angry and come up with a reasonable solution and be prepared to  compromise on that solution. Don't EVER say anything that will come to regret.
3. Leaving, moving out, separating, whatever, means YOU ARE DONE. There is NO going back from that. This is not to be used to get what you want and have him crawling back to you or whatever stupid shit reason there was.
4. You will fall out of love. The trick is not to fall out of love at the same time. This is not Disney, there is no fucking prince coming to sweep you off your feet. This is a partnership, when one is down the other picks you up and visa versa. Shit will go wrong, that's okay. Just deal with it learn from it, laugh about it. Marriage is an adventure with ups and downs.
5. Learn to compromise. If something really means something to your partner, figure out how to do it. And if it's not possible, accept it and wait until it is. I want to live by the ocean, but we're not throwing our careers away for it, just waiting for the right opportunity. He wants to be a mad scientist one day, he knows he has to wait until we move out of our condo and have a garage.

Your partner is your rock,your best friend, the one that you can tell your secrets. They see the best and the worst of you and still love you. Don't disrespect something as special as that, and throw it away because of stupid shit.

Here's the ugly truth. What young people think of as romantic love has nothing to do with marriage. That is lust and infatuation. Marriage is about family. The way you stick by your parents and your siblings and grandparents. Your husband or wife becomes your FAMILY. 

You stick by them when you hate them, when  you love them, when you are angry at them, and when you are thrilled with them.

Why?

Because over the long decades, people change. Dramatically. She will lose interest in all of the things you thought brought you together. You both like hiking? That's nice. In ten years one of you will hate hiking. You won't have any artificial structures that helped create your relationship and bring you together.

You will have to do that all by yourselves. And how do you do that?

By not depending on romantic love to get you through. Not expecting to be ""happy."" Instead, do your job, do your best by them, and stick by them like you do your other family. 

It's going to be a bad time, folks. And a great time. It's going to be all kinds of times. 

Don't pussy out because you are disappointed that marriage wasn't fun. It's not fun. It's family.

He had to help take care of his little brother and sister, had no more time for football. After graduation he got a full time position shuffling paperwork at a tiny company to pay the bills and make sure his siblings had the chance for college.  The years flow by, he gets fat, his mom passes away, his brother and sister move out and start their own lives. His family has been his life, so he's alone, his life is shit, and he's miserable.

He wanders over to it to pick it up and bring it inside to the front desk, in case whoever lost it comes looking for it.

As he starts bending over to pick up the ball his back spasms and he stands back up. How pathetic. He can't even pick up a ball. Angry, he gives the ball a kick off the wall and back into his hands. He smiles, happy he can at least still do that.

Glancing at his watch, he finds he still has 2 minutes before he has to clock back in. He gives the ball another kick. He tries to catch it on his knee, and fails. But he just grunts, chases down the ball, and tries it again, and nearly makes it. He tries it again, and again, making some and missing some.

True,[deleted],,,"I love that if you listen very closely as the video starts you can hear an impatient ""Go."" It's like you catch a brief glimpse of what was going on behind the scenes with poor Steven. He was extremely nervous and the fact that he was doing something relatively simple made it all the more nerve-wracking. Thoughts like ""What if I fuck it up? What if everyone thinks I'm stupid because I can't even microwave rice?"" passed through his mind the sleepless night before shooting and on the whole sleep-deprived ride there.

The whole time everything was being set up he was running the steps through his head. ""Ok: introduction, open the package, poor it in the bowl, describe the steps as I do them...""

But he kept fucking it up. He kept missing lines and trying to awkwardly laugh it off, ""Oops sorry about that one guys...haha...""

Eventually the director and everyone else became completely exasperated with his incompetence. The tension was palpable and it got so intense that Steven became almost numb to it. Every word seeming abstract, it was like an alien in disguise trying to microwave something for the first time.

Then, they took five and pulled him aside and very patiently walked him through all the steps: Introduction, open the packet, poor the rice in....

The fact that they were so patient and talking to him like a small child made it even worse for Steven and he had already lost about three years of his life due to the stress at this point. Everyone, including Steven, said ""Fuck it."" There would only be one more take, hopefully somewhat closer to mediocrity than the rest.

""Go."" The director said. Steven tried his hardest to keep it together. Everyone in the crew was rooting for him mentally. Ok, he was saying the lines, a bit shakey but he was getting through it. He remembered the packet. Good. ""And into the....thing."" Oh god, not again. But Steven was determined, and he kept going, taking the slip in stride.

And then it fell apart again. He left the knife in the bowl as he went to microwave it. Dammit. Still, it wasn't too noticeable, maybe? At 40 seconds in he tried to adjust the microwave settings to one minute and panicked--the buttons weren't doing anything! Some kindly member on set had already set the microwave to one minute...trying to make it easier for Steven. He finally realized what happened and hit start.

At this point, having accepted his total failure, a serene peace came over Steven, allowing him to grind through the rest of the three minutes without anymore major mishaps.

After shooting, he left as quickly as possible, trying not to look anyone in the eye as he did and cordially saying, ""Bye everyone!"" as he left--figuring that he could compensate for the poor performance with friendliness. Maybe that last friendly impression would bump him up a few notches in their minds...it's the last impression that stays, right?

Actually, it was worse than that--Steven wasn't actually important enough for anyone on set to remember or even laugh about most of the time despite his horrible performance. But sometimes late at night, in a foggy place of the mind right before sleep came, a fleeting thought of an awkward man in his late 50s named Steven Reed would briefly float across their night-thoughts like a ghost. A man whose entire life had led to nothing more than an infomercial that was considered bad despite how little was expected from him to begin with.

Note, pcpartpicker, the website we use on here to put build together, doesn't have an Ireland section but I messaged the mod on this subreddit and he said a lot of UK stores will ship to Ireland for the same amount. Converting the total pound amount to euros I got 1514 euro. Since you listed your budget in the title at 1500-2000 I'm hoping this is okay, if not then let me know and I could change a thing or two.

Explanations on part choices:

* The i7-3820 CPU is on the LGA 2011 socket which means it will have more PCI Express lanes for you to run multiple video cards which you expressed interest in. The CPU will have ample power to run games and do video work, you can also overclock it some if you want.

* The CPU cooler I picked is a good cooler for the money. It's not the best cooler available so if you want to go for a high overclock then you'll want something better, but the one I picked will be perfectly fine for stock speeds and light/moderate overclocking.

* The motherboard I picked is good quality, has USB 3.0, supports multiple video cards, and will allow you to overclock some. It only has 4  RAM slots, but you really won't need more RAM than that for what you're doing so it's not a big deal.

* For RAM I picked 16GB which will be plenty for your needs. I also selected low-profile DIMMs so they fit under the CPU cooler.

* For storage I picked a 1TB drive and a 128GB SSD like you wanted. The SSD will be big enough for the OS and some programs/games.

* The Radeon HD 7970 is arguably the best graphics card available right now for the normal user.

* I went with an 850W power supply so you can add another graphics card if you want. Even with another graphics card, 850W will still give you enough headroom to do some overclocking and the unit should last you a good while.

* The monitor is a 23"" IPS panel which means it will have very good color reproduction.

* The case I picked is all black and looks very professional/clean in my opinion. It has great features and good cooling so you won't have to worry about your parts overheating. If you wanted something flashier, or just don't like the look of it then I'd strongly recommend you look around at different cases as there are a lot to choose from and it's highly personal preference.

This build should give you good performance for your needs and have upgrade room for the future. If you are serious about multiple monitor gaming, then you'll want to get another 7970 video card to run in Crossfire and two more monitors.

True,userKname,,,"The artist is [Barnett Newman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnett_Newman), one of the most well known ""color field"" painters. One of the things that you miss from seeing this on the internet is the scale of the painting. Newman made the paintings so big that they took up your entire field of view. When you're standing in front of these paintings, you can't see anything else. Another thing is you can't see the subtle color variations in that shade of ""red"". Seeing such simple breakdown can evoke very powerful emotions in viewers, and it also helps bring out the textures of the canvas. Another painter in the similar vain is [Mark Rothko](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/5f/No_61_Mark_Rothko.jpg).

Some of the context of these types of paintings is ""the medium"". One of the things that these types of painters were exploring was the unique properties of paint on canvas. 

For centuries people have been using paint on canvas to represent what they see in the real world (like the Rembrandt in the OP's photo). With the growing popularity of photography, there was a lessening demand for ""realism"" in painting because a photograph could capture the image of the real world exactly. One of the most well known painters that explored the concept of ""the medium"" was [Pablo Picasso](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_Picasso), who pioneered the painting technique known as ""cubism"". His idea was that since the canvas is a flat 2 dimensional surface, using it to try and represent a 3D image (the real world) was missing the potential of the unique properties of a flat surface. So Picasso broke his portraits down into flat image, hence why in many portraits you can see multiple sides of the same face.

So, in the context of artists trying to explore the unique properties of paint and canvas you have Newman, who's painting are broken down into their purest elements: solid paint colors on canvas, unbiased by references to the real world.

Another famous artist who went in a different direction is [Jackson Pollock](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/No._5%2C_1948.jpg). Pollock's paintings explored the concept of ""movement"". The canvas was laid on the floor and Pollock walked around it, flinging paint down. The paintings represented a record of his movements.

True,stoicassistant,,,"It was April 1st, 2012 and I was in cramming mode for exams. I had popped an adderall and was extremely concentrated on my work when all of a sudden my phone buzzed. Unknown number:

""Heyy I saw ur ad on CL and I wanna buy ur phone please""

*Wrong number*

I get back to work and within 2 minutes my phone rings. A different number. 

""Hi I'd like to buy your phone please."" 

""Sorry, you've got the wrong number.""

As soon as I hang up, I realize... *oh fuck, this is a prank.* 

I get on Craig's List and immediately find out that my roommate is ""selling my brand new iPhone 4 for US$100. Call me ASAP at 555-5555-5555""

*That motherfucker.* In the next two hours I got a total of probably 100 calls and texts. I was gonna get him back good. With the adderall still coursing through me, I racked my brain for the best possible prank I could pull.

Then I remembered I had introduced him to the deep web two days ago. We were surfing it, we had checked out the armory, the silk road, even the assassin's advertisement pages. And at one point, on his computer, we stumbled onto child porn.

I knew how I was going to prank him. When he got home, there was an official FBI envelope waiting for him. Inside, [**this letter**](http://i.imgur.com/0xNUZRj.png?1).

I lifted correct names, signatures, court addresses, court dates and official language (other than misspelling appertaining), but that didn't really matter. As soon as he opened it up, he almost started crying. I had to tell him it was a prank within seconds because he just broke down.

There are way better ways to phrase what you mean without using that word, and I hope in the future you will choose not to use it. :)

Also, the term was popularized by Rush Limbaugh, who is in my opinion pretty antifeminist. Do you all really want to defend a word disseminated by Rush?

True,Shark_Kicker,,,"Well, you know how happy a dog is to see you every time you come home? There are several years where your kids do that too. Every time. Far more often than they poop on you anyhow. It will be the first time, ever, girlfriends and wives included that another human being loves you 100% unconditionally just because you're you.  ... actually that's what makes child molesters and abusers all the more sickening. Because their babies and toddlers and small children are probably still genuinely happy to see them when they first come home.

You also get to see your kids learn stuff. It's fascinating to watch and to listen to the things they come up with. When my girl drew irises and pupils in the eyes of a Santa she drew a couple of years ago, when she was 2, I was awe struck. Where did she learn to do that? If no one told her she needed to add that detail in, then she made the observation and decided to do it on her own.  It's crazy, crazy stuff, and that stuff is every day. They figure things out so fast.

Then there's the fun you have. You can be a total weirdo about Legos or something, and now all of a sudden you're not ""eccentric"" you're someone's ""awesome dad"" (or mom).

It's not all poop and diapers.

If I were going to name a *real* reason people wouldn't want to have kids it's this: If you have kids two bad things happen: 1. You'll realize your life before kids was relatively carefree but meaningless, as now your responsibility holds the weight of a thousand suns. and 2. You'll suddenly, and for the first time, have something you're *really, really, truly* terrified of losing/getting/hurt/ruining/etc. You'll have THOUSANDS of worries, and you'll have to bury them and let them be kids and grow up.

You need to get a better handle on where exactly your money is going. There are a few ways, but mint.com is a nice, easy way to start tracking it. Use it, categorize every purchase you make, and after 30-60 days look at where your money is going. I guarantee this exercise alone will save you alot of money because you will start thinking about things before buying them. I'd also suggest sitting down with your wife and going over all of this together through the whole process - this comes from a guy with a stay at home wife as well. It sounds like she is doing most of the purchasing and you aren't really tracking it very well - stop doing that. There are not alot of real 'random' things in a budget - emergency spending is one thing, car maintenance and dental appointments are things you plan and budget for. I've rambled here, but really this comes down to one thing and that is changing your thinking about your budget and spending habits.

True,jamie_byron_dean,,,"Yes, and the whole thing is silly. There's no scandal here. They outsourced the coding of a website (common business practice, check) and, after meeting with success, are trying to create another popular website (common business practice, check). They sound kind of obnoxious and I'm not endorsing their practices or supporting quickmeme (I don't use it, I don't give a shit about memes), but it's not like this is some big conspiracy. 

That said, I wouldn't mind one bit if reddit stopped using quickmeme and killed it off. I wouldn't mind if memes (read: image macros covered in text) died off altogether, although thats a pipe dream at this point. I wouldn't mind if these quickmeme people managed to create a reddit imitation site that kills reddit, either. Why should anyone care? What's the issue here? That's how the internet works - people create websites to capitalize on trends and if people like those websites more than others, they use them. 

Edit: Okay, here's a more systematic analysis of why this whole thing is nonsense.

&gt;quickmeme is owned by the Miltz brothers of Miltz Media, and they are profiteering businessmen who have never coded in their lives, dont participate in the community here, dont follow what memes are new, and dont give two shits about memes. 

""Profiteering businessmen"" is unnecessary, sensational hyperbole. ""Businessmen"" is what your'e looking for. Each of the four succeeding issues are totally irrelevant - don't participate in reddit? don't follow new memes? don't care about memes? SO WHAT? They're businessmen, not 14 year olds on adviceanimals. I can understand why a redditor might take that personally and stop using quickmeme just because there are so many alternatives out there, but it's not inherently bad that they aren't part of the meme community. That doesn't make them scumbags, it makes them people with their own sets of interests.

&gt;they slip viruses and malware into their site sometimes just to make more money, then pretend it was an ""accident"" when they get caught later. 

Absolutely no proof of this whatsoever. The links given just link to people saying ""I got a virus from visiting quickmeme."" That doesn't mean the Miltz brothers are conspiratorially slipping viruses in for cheap cash. I mean, maybe they are. Maybe they have nothing to do with it, though. There's absolutely no evidence provided that they are ""slipping"" them onto their site ""just to make more money, then pretending it was an accident when they caught later."" (Maybe the OP does have evidence about that, but they definitely didn't supply it in that comment)

&gt;They paid some guy in India named Shah Pavel Jamal like 500 bucks to design and set up their entire site, and now they sit on their asses and make money off all his hard work while he sits in some slum and makes nothing.

That sucks for the coder, but that's called ""Freelancing,"" and it's super fucking common. Maybe he should have tried to work on a deal where he gets part of the future profits, but then the Miltz brothers would have probably just found someone else willing to code their shitty website for cheap. I mean, take issue with that sort of outsourcing I guess, sure, but it's not out of the ordinary business behavior, and it's not illegal or inherently unethical at all. 

And as for webtoid... It's a piece of shit website that will obviously fail. 

The gist of that whole comment seems to be ""they don't care about our precious reddit,"" which is so fucking stupid to me. Redditors are free to boycott quickmeme now that they know that the Miltz brothers aren't one of the hundreds of millions of redditors out there who get all their LULZ from memes and cat pictures, absolutely. But it's not a fucking issue at all. How can you be seriously upset over the idea that these people aren't part of the reddit community? Why should they be? How would that make a difference? People don't use quickmeme because they're supporting their best friends who they love, but because it's the website that people go to for hosting memes. It's not a fucking charity service, it's a business practice, and they succeeded. That's what 99% of websites are - who do you think makes these things? Passionate users who aren't in it for the money at all? 

Get ready for a shock: reddit isn't some secret club of do-gooders. It's millions of people under the umbrella of a super-mega international corporation. You can bet that Conde Nast doesn't give a fucking SHIT about precious image macros, and the owners of Conde Nast aren't browsing reddit all day giving out upvotes for good content. Does that mean it's time boycott reddit because Conde Nast is a *business*? (Edit: Advanced Publications, not Conde Nast. Thanks RB94)

Eh, whatever. I've already gone waaay too deeply into an issue I don't really care about. You're free to disagree with me and get out your pitchforks I guess, it doesn't matter. 

Last edit: Also, the whole thing about ""stealing code line for line"" - Reddit's code is open source, so that's a non-issue as well.

Post-edit: Yikes, if I had known this comment would take off I would have been much more systematic and a lot less vitriolic. 

A few points that have been brought up:

Assuming that the coder is living in a slum somewhere is offensive in its own right. Someone has suggested that they know him personally and he's living well in America. I can't say either way, but it's definitely a bogus assumption that he's slumming it. I should have pointed that out in the first place - it definitely calls the credibility of the original comment in question. 

Reddit's code is okay to use as long as you say ""powered by reddit"" or something, which webtoid clearly does. As far as webtoid goes, I'm now convinced its a joke of it's own, and was never meant to actually ""destroy reddit."" 

As someone mentioned, my suggestion that the coder might have been better off negotiating for a share of the profits is even worse than the flat $500 rate. I'm not involved in that business so I dont really know. Either way, the situation is sound and not some evil scam, no matter how you look at it. 

This whole thing is so stupid. If I haven't debunked anything, it's because there's really nothing to debunk.

True,TheToeSnail,,,"You can google ""marijuana tincture,"" but it's really quite simple. You just need to mix in all your vaped or fresh cannabis with some strong ethanol. The stronger the better. Vodka will be too weak, so try to look for everclear/grain alcohol (95% ethanol). I think there is also a 150 proof (75% ethanol) rum or something that is also adequate. As for how much to use, this gets a bit tricky. I like to have all my cannabis ground up first so it all settles down in the jar, then I fill it up to just about to where the cannabis comes, so it doesn't really increase the volume in the jar, it just fills in around all the loose herb. If you use too much, it will be a weak tincture (and you'll have to drink it like a shot), and if you use too little you won't get all the THC available out of the weed. 

By the way, make sure you use a glass jar. Plastic and strong ethanol don't mix. Make sure the lid has a rubber seal so it doesn't leak. I like to use jars from jams or fruit preserves because they wind up making it smell good... like strawberries. Mmmm. It's also good to store your smoking-weed in fruity jars... mmmmm...

Anyway, then you need to let it sit for at least 3 months, shaking it occasionally. Most guides say you only need to wait 2 weeks or 1 month, but that is way too short. It only gets stronger with time. If you have a crap load of weed to waste, and you throw in a hand full of your strongest buds, then yeah, you'll have something pretty good within 2 weeks. But if you're like me and just want to get the most out of the leftover weed you have left, then you'll want to let it steep for as long as possible.

I had one jar that I accidentally forgot about and left for two years. Holy mama, that one knocked me on my ass. It used the same old crappy weed I had used before, but after 2 years, holy monkey balls, it was strong.

Also, make sure you store it in the dark, or wrap it up in something that blocks out the light. Light degrades THC.

So then when that's all done, just get a strainer or some cheese cloth or something to strain out the plant matter. What's left is alcohol bonded with pure THC. The cannabinoids also make it through somehow, but I don't quite understand the process there. 

One warning: avoid letting the alcohol evaporate. Like I said, the THC is chemically bonded with the alcohol, so if it evaporates, so does the THC. On another note, if you inhale a good whiff of the alcohol fumes from the jar, you *will* get stoned. Because you're inhaling THC. That's why every time I open my jar, I like to sniff it... don't want to waste those evaporated THC fumes!",0,1364181513,,0,False,1,c91uvmj,t3_1awzr0,t1_c91uvmj,t1_c91tnd0,,1431693217,13,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,13
True,whattabow,,,"Transcript.

**Thooorin**: Okay, hello, I'm with [Dyrus][dyrus].


**Dyrus**: Hi.


**T**: Okay, I'm going to do one of my ""Grilled"" interviews with him here where I kind of go into his career, some people he played with, just some things I found during my research. And so, actually, the place I want to start with you is basically right at the beginning of your pro career almost, because you were one of the players who actually took part in the first season one championship of, Riot's season one championship, basically. And the interesting thing I found when I looked back was everyone remembers, okay, so, [Fnatic][fnatic] won that tournament, it was a surprise, and then aAa, [against All authority][aaa], came second, this French team. But actually, during the group stage, your team, [Epik [Gamer]][epk], beat both of those teams in the group stage. 


**D**: Yes.


**T**: But then, eventually you came, uh, fourth overall. So, I mean, do you look back on that tournament, like, ""We could've won the whole thing?""


**D**: Yes, we could've won the whole thing very, very easily. But usually when I lose, I didn't know much back then. When you say stuff, people look at it as excuses or they look at it as, ""Oh, Europe's the best this season,"" and all that. And when I look back on it, it was our first LAN, possibly everyone else's first LAN. We were a casual team, we were put together two weeks before the qualifiers, and we ended up beating CLG [[Counter Logic Gaming]][clg] and we lost against TSM [[Team SoloMid]][tsm], so we came second in North American qualifiers. And for a team that was made two weeks before, like anything, I just played casually, we just messed around, picked whatever we wanted. We were pretty good. And as time went on, throughout the year of Epik Gamer, we still took second place consecutively, without any practice at all. 


**T**: Okay, that's interesting, because that's actually what I wanted to talk to you about next, was that, I mean you're saying that, Epik was kind of a casual team, you weren't trying to be full-time pro like some of these other teams were. But the interesting thing I noticed was that the cycle while you were in Epik, you got all of like, second or third places, what often happened was, the team that stopped you in the one tournament, like in the final, the team who beat you, in the next tournament you'd beat them, but then some other team would beat you in the finals. So you were always being denied just before you won the tournament. How do you think back on that Epik period? I mean, since you're saying it's casual, was it not a problem that you kept coming second so many times? And like, you were kind of unfortunate with the people you happened to meet in the finals in that era. How do you look back on it now?


**D**: For us as a team, we didn't really look at defeat as a big deal because if we're like, ""Oh, we get to play in this,"" ""Oh, we get to do whatever we want."" Some of us were in school, I was just doing whatever in Hawaii. Our leader, [Dan [Dinh]][dand], he was kind of the opposite of [Reginald][regi], he's very passive. He's very responsible, but as for signing up for tournaments like IEM [Intel Extreme Masters] New York or any other tournaments like, I don't know who would sign up for what, we didn't really have anyone to manage that. And also, every time we went for a qualifier after we missed our chance, [Westrice][west] would be in Canada with his girlfriend, and we got disqualified for one round because he didn't have the tournament client downloaded. For [Salce][salc], one time he wanted to go play volleyball with girls. And another time we got DDOSed [Distributed Denial of Service] and another time we got DDOSed again. And I'd actually like to come back on the topic of Dreamhack, because it's something I really wanted to express myself on, and it's been so long I don't think anyone would find it offensive by now. But, back then, after we went 3-0, we were so happy, [Doublelift][dl] was [famous for his facechecking](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPYsIqYjfnk), and I was forced to be to play, either Support, AD or Top and we never had a specific role to play, which played a big part on the team. Our communication was very bad, for example, Dan would be yelling ""follow me!"" and no one else would be listening, everyone would be farming, doing their own thing. And he'd be yelling so loud that the team on the other side could hear, through the sound-proof headsets. And when I looked at that, I was a support, and I was the only one who followed Dan, and I looked back and it was just really sad. Westrice and Doublelift would be tunnel visioning, and we'd just throw the game. Usually the times when I'd get either top lane or AD, we'd win, most of the time. But back then I was just happy to be there, I wasn't so passionate to be in the top lane role or the AD role, but when we lost I felt really, really sad and I felt like we could've easily won it. 


**T**: So, when you think of the Epik team overall, you're saying there wasn't really any management behind the scenes, sounded a bit chaotic in and out of the game. And you had all these placings where you were coming top two, top three, and yet at the time, the top two or three teams were supposed to be these more professional teams, or your bigger names, your CLG, your TSM, et cetera. So was your team, really legitimately top two at the time? Did you think of yourselves at that level? Were you cocky? Did you think you were this good, better than the poor teams I mean?


**D**: We actually had no idea until the day we 3-0ed. I thought, ""Wow, we're probably the best."" Because TSM's in the other group, and they made it through, and we scrimmed against them a lot, and we made them better, and they made us better. But then, when we played against them, we just fell short in team composition and experience, we had no experience and no real leader to follow, because Dan wasn't really that strict about it. Which, there are good and bad sides about, but since we weren't really strict, we couldn't really go anywhere. Same thing for WCG [World Cyber Games] 2010, when I was working, I was actually listed as a sub for the team. I felt like if I had played with them at that time, we would've won then too. But I was just like, _there_. But I got free Riot points just for being a sub, so it was not so bad. 


**T**: Actually, that route goes on to my next topic, coming into the period when you joined TSM, just before you had that WCG, when you went with the mixed team, and it was all the Americans, and you won the gold.


**D**: Yeah, that was the next WCG.


**T**: Yes, that's what I mean. Going just before you joined TSM though, it was like the one a few months before. How much do you think of you actually getting to join TSM, do you think that had any role in playing it, because I mean you played along with Reginald, et cetera and a few of those guys who are in your team now, like [Xpecial][xpec], was it the fact that you were kind of beating them at LANs before? What do you think played into bringing you in instead of RainMan [[TheRainMan]][trm]?


**D**: When I was back in Hawaii, [Chaox][chaox] wanted a roommate, so I was in their Ventrilo once and they were just being friendly, and they were like, ""Oh, Chaox needs a roommate, you know, do you want to come and join the gaming house?"" And, from that, I was just there streaming, playing. Playing with them in WCG, I was just on the team, I just tried to do my job. Playing against [Dignitas][dig] back then, it was probably the [hardest matches of our lives][digreg], because I was still casual, and they were on a different level. I still did my job, I had my moments. But back then, in season one, and coming up to season two, no one was as serious as they were today, because they didn't know how far it was going to go. Season two, when we were on our winning streak, when I joined TSM, when I had my debut. CLG went to Korea to train, and then we beat them anyways, even after they had all that time. I can honestly say, that the serious level, even though we were in a gaming house, there was always something that could've been done better. Now that time's past we see what we really, really need to do.

True,TriesToMakeYourDay,,,"Hi,

I've been quiet for a while now, but I have something deep and personal I must share in this situation..

I was with my last partner for SEVERAL years. It took us more than 15 years to even get together because of 1) age, and 2) she had an uncurable STD, named HIV. She was born with it due to her mother. I was scared as fuck to even get with her. Guess what? I did. And I regret absolutely nothing.

I lost her recently, due to the disease finally winning and taking her life. But I'll tell you right now. Those were the happiest years of my life. I will never be able to get them back, and I never want them back. We played it safe, we had sex, but I made sure I took the proper precautions as to not get HIV from her.

Look. If you truly do love your best friend, get with her. You're both going to be miserable if you don't. If you truly do see eye-to-eye as you claim you do, you have nothing to lose. Jump in head first. Experience the happiest years of your life. If you don't, you're asking for it when you realize you could have had the love of your life, and she's gone.

You're on this planet once and once only in your current body and life. Take it by the reigns and do what it takes to make yourself the happiest person alive. I'm so glad I got with who I did, even though she did have HIV. My only regret is I didn't get with her sooner. I miss her every day, and I'd do it again in a heartbeat if I could.

Herpes is nothing, honestly. It's some petty disease that means absolutely nothing. You're a fool if you're letting that stop you...",0,1364188774,,0,False,1,c91wyki,t3_1ay643,t1_c91wyki,t3_1ay643,,1431694198,607,False,AdviceAnimals,t5_2s7tt,607

True,CatLadyofNY,,,"I posted this story in another link a while ago, but figured I share it again. It made such an impact in my career.
About three years ago I got a call from a man who was concerned about his friend. He wanted us to go with him and a local mental health group to check on him at his apartment. I'll call this man ""John"". The caller, myself, and the mobile mental health workers met us at John's apartment, if I would even call it an apartment. It was a basement ""apartment"" with two small windows looking out to bring light into the tiny living room. The place was pretty Spartan except for a bed, a kitchen table with no chairs, a couch, and a small coffee table with a three inch thick journal that was completely filled up with John's writing on the front and back of every page. I quickly learned that John was a Marine and had very recently returned from a two year tour in Iraq and Afghanistan. Those two years completely and utterly fucked him up. He knew basically why we were there, and admitted that he wanted to just kill himself but was not brave enough to do it. He went on to tell me about how he had to kill men, women, and children while he was at war, and read some pages for me out of his journal. I won't write what he read to me, but they were the deepest and most heartbreaking words I have ever heard read out loud. I learned that after he was at the end of his tour, he was shipped to Italy to await his trip home and tried to kill himself. He was placed in a mental facility that he described as something out of a horror movie. Once he finally got home, the Marines gave him his honorable discharge and booted him out without another word. It took every ounce of strength I had to not cry. It took a long time, and a scary moment where I thought he was going to fight us, but we were able to convince him to go get real help. I told him we could call him an ambulance to bring him to the hospital because if I drove him, my department rules stated I would have to handcuff him. He didn't have insurance so I was forced to take him in handcuffs. He got in the back of the police car and started to cry quietly to himself. I broke down at that point. When we got to the hospital I took him out, un-cuffed him, and hugged him. He broke down into violent sobs in my arms and we ended up on the ground just crying and holding each other. What did I learn from this one call? That the military and America failed this man. They sent him to war, offered no help when he needed it, and then booted him out into the world. Flash forward 2 more years, John is 100% better. He was transferred to a VA hospital and got the real treatment he needed. I happened to pull over his friend who made the call, for speeding, and he told me how John had made a complete change and was so much better.

True,Zoeyvonne,,,"So, the answer's right there in your clarification...

*It can be anything from a novel, to a poem, to a graphic novel.*

Read what pleases you.  The more you read and find joy in the language or the setting or understanding the references the author put down, the more you'll *want* to read, the more you'll want to draw these connections in theme and reference between works that are intentionally or unintentionally related... until you reach that point of reader's ennui: *there are so many, many, many more books than I will ever have time for, and there are more being written every moment*.

Sometimes, for me, that's a path I can trace from point to point (for example, I watched [The Libertine](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0375920/), which was an ok movie about a rather spectacular asshole... so then I read more of Wilmot, and, eventually, after several trusted friends had nudged me, started in on H. P. Lovecraft.  One of his early short stories, ""The Tomb"", included the phrase, """"My formerly silent tongue waxed voluble with the easy grace of a Chesterfield or the godless cynicism of a Rochester.""  It was both satisfying (""Hey!  I know exactly what he means about Rochester!"") and like a corn hull stuck in my teeth, because though the meaning was certainly clear, I didn't have as nuanced an understanding of the reference he was making in Chesterfield...), more often it's just that *this reference* or *that retelling of the monomyth* or *this piece of trivia* or *that particularly juicy phrase* finds a comfy spot in my brain and settles in, except to pop up now and then when it recognizes a friendly new piece of information or storytelling.


Alllll that said, I really like Armor by John Steakley and Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson.  If you have a reasonably high sentimentality threshold, ""The Ballad of the Harp Weaver"" is a favorite among the works of my favorite poet, Edna St. Vincent Millay, and if not you should at least stop and marvel at Michael Longley's gifts.  [Heron](http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/19565) is his eulogy for Kenneth Koch, who is also remarkable.  And, fuck, Billy Collins.  ""Introduction to Poetry"" and ""Reading An Anthology Of Chinese Poems Of The Sung Dynasty, I Pause To Admire The Length And Clarity Of Their Titles""... and without too much work, you can listen to the man himself reading his poetry.  I just put down Cold Days by Jim Butcher and am about to pick up The Book Thief by Markus Zusak.  Earlier today I made some harsh criticisms of the most recent Les Miserables adaptation, but what I left out saying was that *I still loved it*, because every version of that story will forever take me back to hearing the musical for the first time and talking it over with my dad, then reading the abridged version, then immediately digging into the door-stopper unabridged version... and then another translation of the unabridged, just to make sure I'd gotten everything I could out of it.  Without knowing you, or a tiny bit about what you've already loved, I couldn't say what your ""can't miss"" books are... but I could go on and on and on about my ""glad I didn't miss"" books.

True,yokayla,female,♀,"As a (hopefully) former forever alone woman, here are things which helped me :

- Taking better care and pride in my physical appearance. I don't mean  just trying to look pretty or hotter, it was about presenting myself to the world in a fresh new way, and making a new and active start. Going to the gym and eating better helped because I simply felt good and it showed. It made me happier and that in turn made me more confident. I taught myself to dress better, but without totally changing my style or denying my personality. People do treat you better, male or female, if you put in more effort. 

- Practice. I started volunteering at the community center and a local art galley. It was a safe place for me to practice conversation and being more outgoing. Saying hello to people as they checked in, talking to other volunteers. Smiling. Being friendly. Low rejection risk so its easier . Eventually I realized, you know what? There are people who look forward to seeing me, visitors who dont work there who try to make small talk with me. It began to clue in I wasn't as broken as I thought.

- Build confidence in yourself. If you identify as FA, chances are you might be being a little hard on yourself. I thought I just sucked, that something was broken in me that allowed for friendships and enjoyment. I was a lost cause. Now that in out of that, i realize I was sabotaging so much of it myself unintentionally. You need to learn to love yourself. 

For me, volunteering helped because I felt respected and valuable. At the community center, they offered swim aerobics  lessons and I was able to take them for free. I'd never learned to swim as a kid, and I lived on an island, and it had always made me feel kind of bad. So i decided to go. At first I thought it was so awkward and i was really self conscious, but eventually I came to love it. Socializing was still a low risk, there, though a little higher. I got invited to adult lessons by someone there. I learned how to swim perfectly like two months after. Learning a new hobby or skill instills so much pride and confidence in a person. It makes you feel so so good. That voice inside that worries what someone is thinking or if you're saying the right thing? Well, it started to correct itself, 'No, you're not stupid. Beth at the center says she loves speaking to you because you teach her things.' 'Youre  Unlearning negative thinking patterns is hard , but having new acquaintance and hobbies help. You have constant fresh reminders that the voice is full of shit. 

 - Be positive . Comes after the other steps. It was scary, because I was so worried about rejection. I had to keep thinking to myself - '""7bn people. So what if one doesn't like me? Even serial killers have fans, there must be someone there who could be my friend. Statistically speaking."" Or ""Okay. So. What is the worst possible thing that can happen if i invite this old hs friend out? They may say no? Will that hurt? Yes. Fine, will i be okay? Yes. But if they say yes, I will be more than okay! I will be happy. Potential happiness, or staying hone alone?   "" and things like that. Negative thinking patterns are seriously no joke and take active effort to fight. Those grooves are deep in your brain at this point, you basically need to force positive rewiring. 

- Put yourself out there. Move out of the low risk zone - make the first move. Call someone up and ask them to movies, go to events that interest you and start conversations. I went by myself, to places where I didn't know anyone. It was terrifying. I forced myself to approach people, to try. To go out. To talk to people. ""What's the worst that can happen"", I had to constantly remind myself. Well, it worked. People didn't hate me, and I had so much to share and talk about. I didn't spend conversations feeling awkward or desperate, I was able to talk about my hobbies and the people I knew. I could make people laugh by telling them about the crazy moves we did in the pool, or explain about the latest show we were having. I was better at communicating my other interests, too, that nobody seemed able to relate to before. And each time it got easier and easier. I liked talking with people now, I wasn't awkward - I could make them laugh, or nod intensely and listen. Whatever. I wasn't intimidated anymore.

 - Risk it. Text people and ask how they are, call, arrange outings, do everything you used to be afraid to. This is the work relationships require. I had the social skills to be pleasant and charming, but I was still unsure of how to make friends. I sort of wanted someone to just friend adopt me or something. It sounds stupid, but I just didn't get I had to risk it and actively try to be friends. I learned I had to give and take, nor just wait there for someone to pick me.

There is a reason that some guys don't tell you the truth before you have feelings for them. It's because it works. He built a bridge of love so he could drag this trash across it. Maybe you've heard of the concept of ""red flags"". This would be a huge one. This is more than a red flag. This is a red flag you've draped yourself in on fire.

You're all conflicted now. You feel one thing, and maybe those feels are now busy trying to find a bright side to all this, to rationalize and be OK with this development, while you know another thing. You feel he's like the greatest guy, but you know he's not. What you know for a fact is that he's a liar.

If he actually truly was a good person he wouldn't have made up stories. You fell in love with someone that doesn't exist. You don't know this man. All you really know about him is that he is dishonest.

You know this, you just don't feel it. 

Nobody ever said love was easy, did they? The hardest part is always doing the smart thing when we feel it hurts, when we feel it is the wrong thing, but know it is right. Head and heart. Here's a tip for you, for the future. When something is truely good, head and heart actually agree with one another. There is no conflict there. That you don't know WTF should be all the warning you need to cut this off.

This is an adult skill, doing one thing while feeling another, hurting your own feels like that, but at 17, you should be old enough to put on your adult hat and do this right. 

Because this is hard is why we as a society, generally don't approve of older guys picking up on really young girls, even where I'm from, where it would be perfectly legal. Teenagers totally suck at this, making these hard rational choices, which makes them easy prey. They're easily manipulated by compliments and attention. That's what he's doing to you.

How do I know this? Because he kept up an elaborate lie until you were ready, until your feelings for him were strong enough to be stupid about it. That's basic manipulation. That's a creep in action doing what creeps do.

He knowingly lied to you. That's what he did. I'm hamming this home because it needs hammering home. He is a liar. He doesn't deserve your trust, and without trust you two have nothing at all. 

That doesn't make it easy, but it's the truth. What else is he still hiding, what else hasn't he told you, what else was just a fabrication? You can't know, because you can't trust him. 

If you decide not to end this right now, and stop talking with him for good, you are just another victim in for a world of hurt. 

Right now you have a chance, still, to learn this the easy way. How painful it might seem to you, you are still in ""easy"" territory. Go forward, and you'll find out what a hard life lesson in disappointment and betrayal can feel like.

True,PierceHarlan,,,"Your attempt to trivialize the victimization of the wrongly accused by blithely insisting there aren't enough of them to worry about is both troubling and hurtful. I run one of the world's few web sites that gives voice to the wrongly accused. You would do well to spend several months (that's how long it will take you to read it if you spend a couple of hours every day) reading the true life stories, and scholarly articles, collected at my blog, Community of the Wrongly Accused and its predecessor, False Rape Society. We can support rape victims without pretending the wrongly accused are a myth. We need to move beyond the '70s. 

First, as to your assertion that ""it is equally as horrible for someone to be raped and dismissed with their assaulter walking free, as for an innocent person to be convicted,"" you are simply incorrect. This sentiment flips on its head a long-settled principle of law famously expressed by the celebrated English jurist William Blackstone: it is ""better that ten guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer."" (Commentaries on the Laws of England, 1765.) 

In fact, the debate about whether it is just to punish the innocent in order to insure that the guilty are punished has been settled since the time of Abraham, as chronicled in Book of Genesis. When God was deciding what to do about the evil in Sodom and Gomorrah, Abraham put the question to him: ""Are you really going to sweep away the innocent with the guilty?"" After repeated probing by Abraham, God made it clear he would not destroy the guilty if it meant destroying the innocent with them.

In modern times, ""Blackstone's formulation,"" or as it is sometimes called ""The Blackstone ratio,"" has been imprinted on the DNA of our jurisprudence.  Our Supreme Court, in various ways, has underscored that it is one of the pillars undergirding our jurisprudence. 

Justice William O. Douglas, a liberal icon for much of the 20th Century, stated: ""It is better, so the Fourth Amendment teaches, that the guilty sometimes go free than that citizens be subject to easy arrest."" Henry v. United States, 361 U.S. 98, 104, 80 S. Ct. 168, 172 (1959). 

Justice Harlan once wrote: ""I view the requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt in a criminal case as bottomed on a fundamental value determination of our society that it is far worse to convict an innocent man than to let a guilty man go free."" In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358, 90 S. Ct. 1068, 25 L. Ed. 2d 368 (1970)(Harlan, J. concurring).

Somehow, this formulation has been cavalierly turned on its head in the current debate over the ""Dear Colleague"" letter. 

Is the pain of a rape survivor in seeing his or her rapist go free in any sense comparable to the injustice inflicted when the state deprives an innocent person of his liberty? 

""Terrible as it is for a victim to see a rapist escape punishment, it is far, far worse for an innocent person to be convicted of a sex crime."" Until Proven Innocent: Political Correctness and the Shameful Injustices of the Duke Lacrosse Rape Case, S. Taylor, K.C. Johnson (2007).

Take, for example, Dwayne Dail, who was convicted of a rape he did not commit as a teenager and spent the next 18 years in prison. While in prison Mr. Dail was repeatedly and brutally victimized by the same crime that he, himself, did not commit. His life was shattered, and it is fair to assume he will never be whole after his unspeakable ordeal.  Can anyone seriously assert that the pain of the rape victim in Mr. Dail's case was in any sense lessened by having this innocent man destroyed? 

Rape victims whose misidentification of their perpetrators lead to wrongful convictions often develop deep psychological trauma when they learn what they've done.  Actual rape victims have no interest in punishing the innocent and are often among the most vocal critics of false rape accusers because they know that every rape lie diminishes the integrity of every legitimate rape claim. I have put the question to one of the most prominent victims of clergy sex abuse, and his unhesitating answer was that he hates false accusers because of what they do to real victims.

While an individual is capable of doing terrible things to another individual, including rape, neither the state, nor an institution of higher learning acting at the behest of the state, should ever fall to the level of a criminal and reasonably risk doing a terrible thing to another human being. Convicting an innocent man of rape, or expelling an innocent man for rape, is not an acceptable risk in the name of nabbing more offenders.  

Punishing the innocent undermines public confidence about the way rape claims are handled.  Judges, juries, and the people who decide college disciplinary hearings, would be all the more wary of punishing men for rape charges, even those who deserve to be punished, if they believed that the system allows the innocent to be punished, too.

A wrongful acquittal is a terrible thing, of course. But a wrongful acquittal is never, ever the equivalent of a wrongful conviction -- morally, legally, or any other way -- and to suggest otherwise is nothing short of morally grotesque. 

Dictators throughout history have justified the ruthless imprisonment, torture, and murder of the innocent to insure that the ""guilty"" -- who always happen to be their enemies -- are destroyed.  It is a monstrously barbaric, and singularly un-American, practice. 

The reason Blackstone's formulation retains its validity is self-evident. It is the very hallmark of a civilized society.

Second, as to your attempt to pretend false rape claims are rare, here's the reality: FBI statistics show that false reporting of sexual assault is multiple times greater than the average for all crimes. (The Politics of Sexuality, Barry M. Dank, Editor in Chief, Vol. 3 at 36, n. 8.) While the percentage of unfounded claims for all crimes has been traditionally set at two percent, a scholarly law review article debunked the canard that only two percent of all rape claims are false by tracing this number to its baseless source. (E. Greer, The truth behind legal dominance feminism’s “two percent false rape claim” figure, 33 Loyola L.Rev. 947 (2000).) See also, Dr. Bruce Gross,False Rape Allegations: An Assault on Justice, Annals of the American Psychotherapy Associaton, Dec. 22, 2008.

Dr. David Lisak is highly respected in the feminist community. His landmark research for his 2010 ""Violence Against Women"" study found that 14.2% of all claims that could be classified one way or the other -- either as false claims, or that were referred for prosecution or disciplinary action -- were, in fact, false claims. Please understand that this figure represents only the claims we know are false. The majority of all rape claims can't be classified as either rape or non-rape, much less false claims -- so the exact percentage of false claims is unknowable, but we know the actual percentage of false claims is no less than 14.2% and almost certainly higher, and possibly much higher (among other things, it is reasonably certain that a portion of the claims referred for prosecution or disciplinary action are false, based on what we've learned from the Innocence Project and the National Registry of Exonerations). Do you know how many wrongly accused that works out to? Yet you cavalierly dismiss them because, presumably, they don't fit your preferred narrative.

As for perceptions, according to the National Institute of Justice's report measuring frequency of campus sexual assault, the Campus Sexual Assault survey shows that 2.5 percent of college men reported being perpetrators of completed or attempted sexual assault since entering college. Is it any wonder that the vast majority of men (and, I am certain, women) reject the hateful meme that ours is a rape culture where men, as a class, must be taught not to rape because rape is inherent in masculinity.

Finally, on perceptions, I note that just a few days ago, the director of the Ohio chapter of Innocence Project, Mark A Godsey, said: "". . . the risk of wrongful conviction is the highest when there’s public outcry. Most of the exonerations and wrongful convictions have occurred in rape cases.""",0,1364208934,,0,1364211140,1,c91zsms,t3_1ay1l8,t1_c91zsms,t1_c91whv7,,1431695533,31,False,MensRights,t5_2qhk3,31

True,IdunnoLXG,,,"There used to be this cute girl in my 5th grade class. I would notice she would come in wearing pajamas sometimes and I would wonder why since it was cold out and no one else did.

One day she walked in and had scratches in her face. Me and a girl asked her why and she said, ""oh me and my mom just got caught in a cat fight no big deal."" I remember the girl who asked her just cupped her hands towards the side to me and said, ""child abuse."" I felt bad because the girl was standing right there it's not like she couldn't hear you.

Anyways weeks go by and she seems to have rash marks over her face and some bruises on other parts of her body. She sits alone at lunch and girls make jokes about her mother beating her. Anyways I tried to reach out, since sitting alone in lunch in Elementary/Middle School is literally the *worst* thing in the world. All she responded with was, ""I'm fine thanks, I'm already finished eating my lunch anyways."" So she just sat there since a the time we couldn't have cell phones or any electronic devices, not even homework.

I told the teacher about it. The teacher was shocked and observed the girl the next day, sat down and talked to her. After that day I didn't see her again. The teacher said that she couldn't say what happened but we'd likely never see her again, however she was in a better situation now.

Apparently the police described the situation of the girl as a ""sorry state"" later in a police report on KDKA (our local news station). I always felt bad about the whole situation like it was my fault for not reporting it sooner or not seeing what was in front of me. Teacher told me not to feel bad and that I was doing the right thing. She even subtly called out the snobby girls who made fun of her, sad.

True,foolhardyfailure,,,"I'm not exactly a woman, and this particular girl wasn't exactly a stalker, but it's good to get this off my chest. Call me jaded or downvote me or whatever, but I will never date online again. I even warn people away from online dating. 

TL;DR is where it should be.

It was around September/October 2009. I met a girl in a different state through a good friend, Alex, over that stupid site myYearbook. He was ""dating"" an attractive girl, Skyla, who was supposedly a best friend of hers. And I started talking to her, started liking her. That lasted about a month before I dumped her because she was way too attached. She vilifies me and gives me some stupid pity story I don't remember, I pity her and decide to try again, and again I dump her in a month because things just didn't work out. I should have broken contact there, but nooo, I was young and naive. I'll call her B from now on.

I then start getting emails from a girl who apparently saw me in person one day while on her way home to Seattle and was too shy to say hi. She liked just about everything I liked, which was kinda creepy, but I was young and incredibly stupid and gaga over hot women who were friendly to me. She said her name was Tori, and that she thought I was kinda cute. She then said she went to B's state to visit, you guessed it, B. I didn't think anything of it at the time other than ""oh, what a coincidence."" 

We hit it off and three weeks later Tori says she's in love with me and I say I love her too. She says it's too bad I don't really talk to B anymore, that she's actually hella cool and some other stupid shit. So I start talking to B again. She says she actually misses me, and all this shit, but knows I'm faithful to Tori.

Fast forward through five months of mushy lovey-dovey shit and secret engagement planning that makes me sick to my stomach just thinking about nowadays, I come across a page on Myspace with every single one of Tori's pictures. (Alex had broken up with Skyla by then and was dating B by the way, that's important for something later on.) 

I called her out on it and dumped her because I detest fakes, she gets incredibly depressed and...kills herself. And that killed me inside at the time. I couldn't believe I'd driven a girl to suicide. And I believed that for about a week. My ex messages me saying how sorry she is, and how she wish she could make things better. She then starts flirting with me. That was the first red flag I actually recognized. As if two incredibly attractive women who were both her best friends and had nothing but awesome things to say about here weren't quite fishy enough. 

I did a little detective work and found out that since the day my friend broke up with her, Skyla's profile had been completely inactive like she'd disappeared off the face of the earth. No status updates, no changes or tweaks to her profile, nothing. And this was about a month. And she posted a lot when it was active. An email address that claimed to be Tori's parents' business's email address was mysteriously deleted, as was Tori's personal email address. 

B had been playing me and Alex with made-up profiles. Either that or she had some sort of weird split-personality disorder craziness. Meh.

Instead of going to him about this, I confronted her directly (they were still dating at the time). Worse comes to worst and I call her a crazy bitch among some other choice names, and then I get a message from Alex saying he was going to kick my ass. And instead of telling him what's going on for whatever reason I simply stopped talking to both of them.

Several months later, he visited me at my house, looking dejected. He apologized for threatening me and everything, that he'd found out she was a fraud the hard way just like I did. (I left him a voicemail like a week after all that went down telling him what was up; he must have listened to it and thought I was lying.) Anyway, we both had a good laugh at our expense and, of course, hers. The story wasn't quite over yet, though.

Over the next long time she molested my 'Other' message inbox on Facebook and created new profiles using her actual photos and info whenever I blocked her, until I had had enough. I contacted Alex and we called her, basically ripping her a new one and telling her to seek help. She made one more profile just to tell me she was going to have someone kick my ass ""and I hope he kills you, you fat fuck"", which I reported and then put out of my mind. Nothing has happened yet, so it was just a bluff.

I wish I could say I'm completely over that ordeal and fine now, but it seriously, and permanently, fucked me up. I can hardly even speak to a woman if I'm romantically interested in her nowadays, online or not. Just thinking of what happened pisses me off to where I can't stop shaking for several hours. Shit, while I was with Tori I turned down one or two better matches for me. I was not a smart man...but at least I learned from it, I guess. I don't even know anymore.

**TL;DR: A girl played me and a good friend, created fake profiles to keep in contact with us and start romantic shit. When I found out the particular ""girl"" I was dating was using fake pics, she ""killed herself,"" seriously fucking up my ability to be romantic from then on.

""But wait!"" you exclaim.  ""I don't have constant gaps in my vision, so I can't be blind during a saccade.""  Well, just like you have a blind spot that you can't normally see because your brain fills in the gaps, the brain is also ""filling in the gaps"" during a saccade.  The way it does this is by taking the first thing that you see when your eyes stop moving long enough to stabilize the image, and sort of backdating it in your memory so that you *think* that you saw it earlier than you did.  

If you want a quick demonstration, look in a mirror and quickly glance between looking at your left and right eyes.  You'll never once see your eyes move, because your brain is filtering it out.  Next, try doing the same thing with the front-facing camera on a smart phone.  The small delay in displaying the image on the screen means that you *can* see your eyes moving, and it's an eerie experience, since it's likely that you've never seen it before.

True,SaveNibbler,,,"2008, Maricopa County, Peoria AZ. I'm at a bar / club with my Air Force recruiter and 3 other servicemen in uniform. We are celebrating my last night as a civilian because I'm swearing in to the military in 8 hours. We walk out to wait for our cab. Police officers on bicycles approach us and chatter about serving our country, and basically pal around with us. We describe how we've had a fun night and can't wait to get back to the hotel for another beer. One of the cops was an ex grunt, so some general shit talking ensues. The cab pulls up.

During this exchange of esprit de corps I walked over to my truck to grab my backpack, which is on the front seat and the vehicle is literally next to the cab. As I do so, the officer asks whether it is my vehicle. I said ""Yes, sir. I drove it all the way from Yuma to swear in downtown tomorrow"". He asks if I can set down my bag and walk over here to a parked cruiser. I said ""Of course, officer. What's up?"".

Next thing I know I was administered a field sobriety test. I was kind of laughing and saying ""You know I'm too drunk for this, right?"" And the cop sort of laughed with me, too. People in the cab are getting impatient and hooting and hollering. Remember, this is in a parking lot in front of a club, so a lot of people are around gawking and making a scene.

4 more units pulled into the parking lot to join the bicycle officers and the cop giving me a test. When the handcuffs went on I realized I was being arrested for DUI, I became angry and called out for my Staff seargent. The officers informed him I was under arrest and demanded he stay back. I didn't see it, but I was later informed one officer reached for his weapon. He didn't draw it out, but he put his hand on it while motioning with his other hand ordering my friends to stop where they were.

After many hours of processing and drunk tank and blood work and endless humiliation, to include an officer farting then laughing about it while fingerprinting me, I walked out of Peoria jail into the lobby and there, sleeping on the uncomfortable chairs by the front desk, were my friends in uniform...waiting for their buddy to get out of jail. I couldn't help it...tears started running down my face. I felt so ashamed that I let them down. I was still very confused as to why I was in trouble at all. I didn't drive, I followed the rules, I was getting in a taxi - I just needed my bag so I could swear in, serve my country honorably and begin my brand new life as a PJ in the USAF. I looked down at my watch - the ceremony at MEPS was an hour ago...Shittiest 21st birthday I could imagine.

We fought the DUI charge for 10 months, but there is no way around the laws in Arizona anymore. Every time I went to court I had uniformed military officers around me, and every time my lawyer - which the USAF paid for - fought to get the charges dropped and my ass into the military we were met with fierce, angry resistance by the judge. She would quote things like how many people die in drunk driving accidents every year. ""But I wasn't driving"" I once exclaimed in open court. Her response? ""It doesn't matter""....

It sure as shit does, lady.

Before that night I had never had a speeding ticket, a late charge on a credit card, detention or a pink slip. I had never been late to an interview, to work, and what I'm trying to say is I've obeyed all the rules because I respect my country, my government, my fellow man and myself. And because I had ""control of my vehicle"" while under the influence of alcohol, I was found guilty of DUI, attended classes, had an interlock device for 12 months and was forced to serve a mandatory jail sentence in a place called Tent City. The worst part was that I lost my entire military career, which is all I wanted in my entire life. Now, as a convicted criminal, I have a very different life. 


TL;DR - I was arrested on my 21st birthday for DUI because a police officer saw me walk up to my truck and unlock the door with my keys and lost my military career as a result.

True,stealthzeus,,,"I was told by some pig farmers that those pigs were poisoned about 3 months before they are supposed to be slaughtered. The poison made the pigs eat a lot more than usually which usually leads to massive muscle gain, thus the pig farmers can get more money, and the effect of the poisoning usually does not kick in until about 5 months afterwards. However, with the new leadership in Beijing asking the local governments to tone down the publicly-financed dining in China, many of the Chinese new year celebrations (Feb 10th) events got cancelled, so the pigs stays in the farm for more than 5 months, where the effect of the poison kicks in and the pigs die of internal bleeding. The pig farmers cannot sell the dead pigs because ~~the meat became poisonous~~ a recent policy prohibits farmers from selling deceased meat, so they just dump them in the river to save money on burying the dead pigs. 

The Chinese government doesn't want their people to know about this, because the food inflation in China had been rampant for the last few years. A lb of pork is 10 times more expensive than it was few years ago. If this news gets wide attention, the smart ones will put 2 and 2 together and figure out that they've been eating poisoned pork all along. This may lead to social unrest on a large scale.

True,elektriknoize,,,"I'm a dermatology resident.  So much misinformation in this thread.

Dandruff is a form of seborrheic dermatitis, which is also classically found in the eyebrows and on the sides of the nose.  The condition itself is not fully understood, but is thought to be a reaction to varying types of Malassezia, yeast that resides in pretty much everyone's sebaceous glands (which cluster in the affected areas).  Although pretty much everyone has the yeast, only certain people seem to react to it regularly.  On the scalp this is known as dandruff.  

Importantly, there are also forms of psoriasis which can be isolated to the scalp and can cause flaking, which can be indistinguishable on clinical exam but respond to treatment differently as it likely is not secondary to the yeast implicated in seborrheic dermatitis.  Tar and salicyclic acid compounds (Tsal and Tgel) have shown mild relief in the improvement of psorasis, and can help people with mild scalp psoriasis.  These will have limited effect in seborrheic dermatitis.

Now as for seborrheic dermatitis, there are two treatment options.  One is to reduce the burden of the yeast and the second is to try to damp down the body's abnormal immune response against it (which is causing the inflammation and scaling).  Ketoconazole (Nizoral) cream and shampoo tend to work fantastically for this with limited side effects.  Prescription strength is 2%, over the counter is 1%.  People usually start 2-3 times weekly, leaving in form fives minutes, for a few weeks dropping to once weekly when under control.  This alone often solves the problem.  Alternating with selenium sulfide shampoos (ie Head and shoulders) can also help.  Alternatively, mild topical steroids can be prescribed (we usually give hydrocortisone 2.5% cream, although the 1% is over the counter) to reduce inflammation, but there can be long term side effects to its use such as skin thinning, hypopigmentation and telangiectasia so I usually stick with ketoconazole given the paucity of side effects.

Once you understand the condition, you might ask why cool water showers helps control it versus hot water.  Short answer, it likely doesn't.  Hot water can dehydrate our skin more, make you itchier and in particularly cause flaring with eczema, but does not plan a major role in the pathogenesis of seborrheic dermatitis.",0,1364228935,,0,False,1,c9245e4,t3_1ayubv,t1_c9245e4,t3_1ayubv,,1431697815,450,False,LifeProTips,t5_2s5oq,450

True,[deleted],,,"&gt;It almost seems illogical to spend such hard-earned money on expensive Criterion releases.

Not really. They come with a ton of special features that are much harder to find online, some of which were made or recorded (like commentaries) *for* Criterion, books / booklets with great essays and a myriad of wonderful information, and really interesting artwork. But most importantly, supporting them with hard-earned money helps them obtain the rights to more films, special features, and record exclusive audio commentary tracks. Some of these films have gone through massively extensive restoration jobs. A lot of Criterion releases have been supervised or at least approved by the director of the film, so you're getting the most true version of the film. Some of the films they've obtained have never been released on DVD or Bluray in the US before, and all foreign copies were in really poor shape due to a total lack of restoration. For example, the movie If... was never released in the US on DVD and I don't think it ever had an official VHS release. If it hadn't been for people supporting Criterion financially, it's hard to say whether or not the film ever would have been released.

But then again, I'm a huge fan of Criterion. If I were a millionaire, I'd donate to them annually. If every single person took the ""oh well, why waste money when you could just stream it"" approach, they'd go bankrupt and there would be no Criterion. And if that happened, then all the wonderful high quality streams of their library would no longer grow, and would disappear. No more great special features that otherwise would likely never be seen. No more exposure to rare films. No more quality restoration jobs. No more a lot of things.

Everything in the world can't be free, and just because you're unwilling to support something doesn't mean it's illogical, or could even be argued to be illogical, for other people to. It's their money, they can do what they want with it. I'm passionate about film, and Criterion is a wonderful company for people that are passionate about film. I'll support my passions the best I can. Besides, ""expensive"" is a relative term. I don't make a lot of money, but I don't think $30 is a expensive for a Bluray, considering what all you're getting and where the money is going.

Lastly, about Criterion, as you've said there *is* something to be said about physical ownership. Relying on streaming means you need to rely on an internet connection and permissions by numerous companies. If every single company stopped allowing Seven Samurai from being streamed online for free, and if you were unwilling to pay for it, all you do then is pirate the film. And you wouldn't be getting any of the special features. I could lose my internet forever and I'd still have my library of films that I love to keep me company for the rest of my life. That's worth something to me. I look at books the same way.

Having said all that, I'll address your actual question.

Yeah, I typically try to find if a movie is on Netflix first. But usually it's not, and if it is it's not in very good quality. If I can download a 1080p Bluray from a private tracker, or some restored Bluray, then I'd obviously rather do that. It's hard to really, truly justify pirating but it's what it is and it's not going away. I watch 1-2 movies a day, and I don't make that much money, so I really couldn't afford to keep up with my own hobby if it weren't for the ease of the internet. I'd never get to see anything. But, and this won't surprise anybody, if I like a movie enough [I'm going to buy it.](http://i.imgur.com/rx2bnVw.jpg) I rewatch movies a *lot* and I always watch whatever special features a film has. It's interesting to me.

I would use Netflix more but they seem to be more interested in obtaining as many titles as possible and not worry too much about the quality of the titles. Anymore browsing through Netflix is like sitting around with friends arguing where to eat. It takes fucking forever to find anything of value because the entire library they've accumulated is mostly junk.

What I think is most sad about the dawn of pirating and streaming is that it has now created the acceptance of entitlement and the opposition of support. People make the argument ""it's looked down on by older generations"" but it's not the act of doing it, it's the argument its creates. You've just made a great example of that with your comment about how illogical it is to *support* something.

You can listen to NPR for free, but without public donations there would be no NPR. You can watch movies for free online by pirating them, but if nobody paid for anything then it wouldn't be created.

While the genes are always present in the DNA, not all of them go through transcription and translation, which is called *expression*, at a given time.

1. Wear some MC Hammer style parachute pants to a subway station. Shout, ""Stop! Hammertime!"" and start puking while dancing until you are forced to stop by the transit authority.

2. Go to Panera Bread and order soup in a bread bowl. Consume the soup. Puke in the bowl. Tell your server: ""seems to be something wrong with my order.""

3. Find one of those hot dog cart vendors around lunch time. In full view of the people eating, puke on the sidewalk in hopes that they will start puking too.

True,Anal_Explorer,broncos,Broncos,"He would tear BB's ACL when he tried to bench him. In retaliation, Belichick screeches, opening a hole to the Void, and sucks him in, absorbing his force. But Pollard patiently waits, biding his time within the hell, breaking and repairing his MCL to pass the time. 

After experiencing what felt like over 10 centuries of imprisonment, training, he finally tears his way out of the Void on a whim, leaving a gaping hole in the Hoodie. The Broncos are playing the Patriots, at Foxboro, and he senses the presence of Wes Welker, but something has changed...a disturbance. He blindly charges toward the Broncos line, launching himself like a missile at Welker's knee. 

When his eyes fully adjust to the light, he can see through the tunnel vision that Welker is not, in fact, a Patriot, questioning whether or not his hit will take effect. This split second hesitation gives Peyton Manning an oppurtunity to throw his helmet off and drive his Fivehead in between Pollard's helmet and Welker's tendons and ligament. The resulting clash levels the Boston metropolitan area.
*fade camera away from a motionless Bernard Pollard, cut to black.*

*To be continued...*


whoa...

*...continued immediately.*

In the rubble of Gillette Stadium, pockets of survivors emerge. Peyton, unscathed, helps Wes up. Ryan Clady, after realizing the events about to unfold, expanded and shielded the entire Broncos' sideline. After the blast left nothing but a scrap of hoodie left, Belichick is already fully regenerated. Brady quickly activated his Ugg Battlearmor, shielding his sideline as well, but Gronk's arm is still broken again.

Should I go on? 

Fuck it, I'm bored enough.

Immediately, Peyton and Brady commence a battle, riding Ryan Clady and Vollmer, respectively. Brady launches a Patriot missile toward the Sheriff, but the gravitational rift created by the Fivehead stops it dead. A pizza materializes in front of Manning, acting as a sentry defending against rapid fire Ugg shots. The battle rages on, stalemated. Knowing he needs an edge, Manning spots the still motionless Polllard. 

He quickly awakens him, sending the Patriot Killer on a rampage, attacking Broncos and Patriots alike. Peyton locks eyes with Pollard, and begins to Audible him: ""READ ALPHA, ALPHA, 92 OREGON SET!"" Pollard's face slackens, and his jersey color begins to dim white. ""OUTLAW, OUTLAW, BUICK SET HUT!"" Slowly, his jersey color begins to change to Orange and Navy. Realizing his plan, Brady soars toward Peyton to interrupt the ritual, but is sacked by Von Miller. ""ORANGE JERSEY, REROUTE! PAPA BEAR, PAPA BEAR! HURRY, HURRY, SET!"" Pollard reawakens, and destroys every Patriot left standing. The Broncos win the AFCCG and advance to Super Bowl XLVIII.

They defeat the Seahawks 28-17.

True,leatherandcandy,,,"I worked at a convenience store and we had a similar policy. When I was hired my boss told me to give them half of the money and call the cops, I said screw that and decided I would give them everything. And if someone stole something, I asked them to pay for it but I never ran after them, I always called the police.

Anyways, I got pretty good at picking up when people were stealing stuff. ""Excuse me are you going to pay for that"", I would say 50% of the people turned around and paid and the other half ran. I have to say some people honestly did forget to pay and were really embarrassed, no big deal it happens. The cops would always show up about an 20 min later, do a report, get some free coffee and donuts. We gave out free coffee and old donuts to the cops.

Then a drug addict came in, I didn't know that at the time but I found out later. Anyways, this was at night, he pulls a gun on me. ""You wanna die honkey, give me da money""....I'm completely frozen....I start stuttering give him like $32 and he leaves. Call the police they are there right away, they calm me down and a report is filed again...while having free coffee and donuts....I always thought that was strange but I guess it's just a normal thing.

Anyways a week later the guy comes back in, ""remember me"". I told him I did but I wanted to say something before he said anything. I said something like this ""I make minimum wage, you can have all the money just don't wave a loaded gun in my face"". He replies, ""fair enough, give me all the fucking money"". I shake my head and give him like $48, 10 seconds late its over and I'm calling the police again. 

This happens 2 more times for a total of 4 times, then I'm fired. My boss told me I wasn't intimidating enough and that it was costing him too much money. Fair enough, I was getting fed up of being robbed and risking my life for minimum wage. I have PTSD now thanks to that fucking job, I can't even set foot into a convenience store.

So a week later I met the young gun he hired, really cocky attitude. He was shot dead for telling the robber ""you aren't getting any money, you'll have to shoot me"". The same guy who robbed me 4 times, shot him in the head on the spot. A cop told me how it all went down when they ran into me shopping at the grocery store. I stood in the store for 30 minutes before the stock boy asked if I was ok...I don't even remember standing there for that long but he said I was.

True,minnabruna,,,"It was complicated. 

There were some Austrians who believed themselves to be Austrian, a nationality separate from German, and who fiercely opposed the Nazis on nationalist grounds as well as political or ethical.

There were some Austrians who thought that they were ethnic Germans. Prior to 1871 (60 years before) there was no country called ""Germany."" Prior to 1918 (20 years before), Austrians were called the ethnic German, regionally Austrian people, one of many peoples who lived throughout the empire and not always in concentrated areas (they are the red areas in [this map](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/Austria_Hungary_ethnic.svg)). Throughout the past 100 years there was an idea of uniting all ethnic Germans, and Prussia/Germany and the Austrian Empire tussled to be the ones to do it. Many Germans also thought this - it is why they didn't have a big problem with Hitler being Austrian.

The ""German people"" people were themselves divided. 

Some thought that it was the natural progression of things that all German lands should ultimately unite and so, while they may have had reservations about the actual politics, were OK with ""national and ethnic unity."" Part of the deal originally was that Germany would take Austria into its polity, but wouldn't interfere in domestic affairs. They promised this to avoid the opposition of these popele until they had power, then broke that promise.

There were some who thought they were ethnic Germans, but who still opposed Anschluss for political reasons. Austria had an active and contentious political environment without much room for the brown shirts. In a way, the Nazi helped this situation improve after the war because the Austrian parties fought so hard and hated each other so much, but when the Nazis came, they were all put into camps. There, the survivors got some perspective and have governed in assasination-free coalitions ever since.

Then there were the desperate people. Austria had a depression to make the US one look like a little dip (hyperinflation destroyed everything, people lost everything, for example my shoemaker great grandfather had few customers because no one had money for new shoes, so my grandfather and his little brother would collect forest strawberries every morning and then sell them to get money to buy the family's bread, while my great grandmother's life savings, originally enough to buy land and a house, was not enough to buy furniture for one room when she got married), they had a low-grade civil war, and in Germany, Hitler's rise to power was accompanied by stability. In Austria he promised debt forgiveness and jobs.  With that in mind, some people thought ""hey, we're all ethnic Germans and he's making things better for ethnic Germans. Maybe this will be OK.""

Then there some real, true believing Nazis, although not as many in terms of percentage as in Germany. Membership increased to about 10% of the country following propaganda efforts and requiring membership for professional advancement, but there went that many at the time of the Anschluss. 

The real breakdown of who felt what when is hard to say - prior to the Anschluss politics were contentious but not as polarized or violent as in Germany. Jews were viewed as an ""other,"" but everyone was viewed through their ethnic group as a legacy of the Empire. For example, my Oma has memories of being small and being questioned why she didn't like marmalade by a Jewish houseguest because ""you Germans all love marmalade."" At the same time, her aunt married a man from Prague but no one considered him a foreigner because he was ethnically ""German."" Many people knew that the current political and social situation was untenable, but they differed greatly on how to fix it.

Once the Nazis took over they instantly started a major propaganda and education campaign. It was successful to some extent, but I can't say to what, as no statistically valid polls were taken that I know of and publicly criticizing it was very dangerous.  My grandmother said people liked it though - a lot of people, especially farmers, had crushing debts and they didn't have to pay them. They also like hearing that the problems weren't their fault, that society couldn't have fallen apart that quickly without some conspiracy, in  this case by the Jews (not part of the German ethnic group and therefore viewed as loyal to Jews Worldwide first instead of the ethnicity-based larger group that was now Austria) and Communists (internationalists who rejected looking after their own people/ethnic group because they were blinded by rabid fanaticism, who caused the bloddy Russian Civil War, who killed [Dollfuß](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engelbert_Dollfuss#Assassination), who killed the hostages in the [Bavarian Soviet Republic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bavarian_Soviet_Republic) etc!!!!!). My Oma remembers having to cut out the pages in her school book that dealt with those topics and paste in the new Nazi-approved version of events. In her case she said this made her lose faith in all authority, that since what she was told were facts weren't actually verified, unchangeable, facts. But she is a pretty tough and independent person.

There was a referendum on the Anschluss, with a giant **JA** and a little nein on the ballot, but it wasn't exactly held under free and fair conditions.

My grandparents were too young to have real opinions at the time, but my grandmother remembers her mother expressing opinions along the lines of, well, they are here so hopefully they can help fix this mess. She lived in the mountains, couldn't afford their own radio, and really wasn't sure what would happen next. 

A year after that that same great grandmother was in trouble for being overheard calling Hitler ""shit Hitler,"" but by then everything was very different and it was too late. The Anschluss and how horrible it all went down played a strong role in defining modern Austrian national consciousness.

Maybe 20 minutes after he left (he was only going to be gone for about 40 minutes) a pick up truck speeds into our drive way. Now it was getting dark, so we could only make out shadows, but as soon as the pick up stopped in our driveway about 6 guys all wearing dark hooded sweatshirts hopped out of the bed of the truck. One grabbed what was clearly an axe, another something that looked like a chainsaw, but we couldn't be certain. 

The 6 guys then fanned out around our house. My sister and I ran to opposite ends of the house reporting back where they are. ""He went through the gate... He's on the porch,"" I shouted. ""Two disappeared behind the garage. The others are by the front door,"" she screamed back.

Its action is probably going to quiet down any infection and inflammation in the cyst but it likely won't heal the cyst up completely because of how Thyroglossal cysts are formed...they are fibrous in nature and almost always removed by surgery at some point, usually before they get to the point where they pose a threat to breathing/swallowing or even speaking in some patients. They can become quite large and the location makes it an inconvenience at some point.

Cysts are highly susceptible to inflammation, which will affect how large they appear...swelling wouldn't always indicate an infection but due to the location, it's always wise to keep a close eye on it, work with your doctor to determine a time to have it surgically removed.

I'm one of the founders of Microryza, we're basically like, crushing it. I'm just kidding. Science crowdfunding is hard. But we love what we're doing so much that we dropped out of grad school to spend the past year doing nothing but coding and talking to scientists. 

We think it's important because when were working in labs, all these brilliant scientists and professors never spent their time in their lab doing research and spent all their time writing grant proposals. We decided that science isn't supposed to work like this. A recent survey by NIH saw that the average PI spends [12 weeks/year writing grant proposals.](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/126/314/3cd8a33a.png?1306264975)

I wrote a blog post about this and some of the other problems that young scientists face in academia: http://www.pressbuttongoboink.com/post/46098715071/academia-is-eating-its-young

So here's the lowdown, there are like 30+ crowdfunding for science websites out there. Some notable ones include:

* http://www.theopensourcescienceproject.com/
* http://sciflies.org/
* http://www.petridish.org/
* http://scifundchallenge.org/
* http://we-search.org/
* http://www.iamscientist.com/
* http://www.medstartr.com/
* http://www.raregenomics.org/
* http://sciencedonors.com/
* http://www.fundageek.com/
* http://eurekafund.org/
* and of course http://microryza.com
* ~20 others

We stopped keeping track a long time ago. As you can tell, most of the don't have much traction with projects or users and part of it is because its just so hard to build momentum in changing the sytem. Petridish was doing good work, but the founders quit to do a food delivery startup instead cause they weren't scientists. SciFund Challenge is run by some amazing people, but it's more of a derby style that is held in sprints. Also, more and more universities are trying to get into this space, but their in-house versions have really bad design and presentation.

So far on Microryza we've funded almost $100k in projects, ranging from bioengineering to computer science, ecology to just plain digging up dinosaurs. Our model is different from every other science crowdfunding site (besides not being a kickstarter clone) in that we don't do tangible rewards. No way. We felt that it isn't the best use of the funds, and it's not what science backers want. They want to see science move forward. So we built and are still building an platform that allows researchers to really share the science directly with you. No middle-man paywall publishing houses, no journalists dumbing it down. Straight, unfiltered, science research.

We're still growing (small team living in a house!) and we know we have a lot of work still to do (btw - we're trying to get /u/kn0thing to invest in us, we're in the current batch of YC), but all ideas start from somewhere and we're really dedicated to this.

Incredulous, my friend and I look at each other in disbelief and quickly come up with a brilliant scheme.

""As a gun owner, you have to be cool-headed, more-so than the police ever have to be. And you do not ever run around pretending to be the police while carrying a gun because then, shit like this can happen. You do not start shit, act aggressively, flip the bird, roll your eyes, talk shit, or even raise your voice. To anyone. Ever.

A combat instructor (who happened to be Buddhist and a Marine) once said to me: ""From now on, when dealing with (ed.) crazy / possibly violent people, you will lose every argument. You are always wrong. You are sorry for impinging on their day. You will apologize and apologize again. You will back the fuck down. You will put your tail between your legs. You will let them talk shit about your ladyfriend. You will let them call your mother a bitch and a whore and your dad a bastard. You have no ego. 

You do all this because if you are the one to start a fight, by default that fight now has a gun in it, and if you start losing, you're going to pull it and kill him. And even if you don't go to jail because you could convince the jury that it was self-defense, you're going to have to live with the fact that you could have saved someone's life and yet you let your ego kill someone.

You are not the police, so don't act like them. Though all of you [civilians] are better shots than the police, you do not have the training, the continuum of force policy, or a union plus free lawyers protecting you if you screw up.

But after backing down and trying to apologize, if at any time you then feel your life or that of a loved one is in danger, put three rounds into his [cardiothoracic] vault, call the police, give a statement, go home, and sleep like a baby. You did all you could for your attacker, and he was the one that made the final decision...

Hinting early on that he couldn't sing away the crown's influence.~~ ARGH my bad, I was misremembering this as being in the beginning, but the animation is inconsistent (in the lovable AT way that we all appreciate) right before Simon puts the crown on his head, just as he starts to hum the Cheers song again. His teeth are pointy, but they're kind of... rounded off at the ends.

I'm not sure what I think of his age. He definitely didn't look 47 in the tapes or in the photograph—there seems to be a huge gap between when he first found the Enchiridion/the crown and when the war finally ended. It may be that Marcy has never known what the world was originally like, especially since she didn't recognize the deer. Of course, the age declaration may have just been the crown talking, who knows.

It's been pointed out, but it's possible that Marcy wasn't really sick, that Simon was getting colder and just thought she was too warm. 

How much of the story was accurate, given that Marceline was telling it from far in the future? Did she make substitutions to any of it to soften the effect for her audience?

How much of a survivalist is Simon that he can field dress a deer? The newspaper article about him said he'd recently been to the Hindu Kush mountains, but also mentioned that he was a ""bon vivant,"" which would imply a life of luxury and wealth. How much was he unnecessarily shielding Marcy given that she had claws and pointy teeth as a child, and was at least willing to dig around inside a deer carcass for its guts? His pack seemed to mostly have books, not knives.

And finally, there's the interesting decision they've made to hint at the fact that Simon... as much of a badass as he was to have taken on the care of a demon child, I got the impression that he may have felt a subconscious urge to hide behind the crown's power. Living day to day in such a horrific landscape, it must have been relieving on *some* level to suddenly have power and aggression at his fingertips. I wonder how much his own fear and desire for escapism contributed to the way he retreated into the crown's power in the end.

When comedians (or at least good comedians) make jokes about controversial subjects, the punchline is not just a repetition of a hateful remark. It's a comment on the sentiment behind it, where the punchline is the type of person who makes that remark.

An example is Dave Chappelle's bit about if racist cops arrested him for robbing his own house. The joke is about race, and it does use harsh language, but the punchline is that the cops are fucked up. Redditors in general, on the other hand, make jokes where the punchline is ""black people steal things,"" which is not a joke so much as a repetition of an offensive stereotype that people then laugh at.

Another example is Wanda Sykes' bit about wishing she could leave her vagina at home to not get raped. The punchline is about the oft-repeated message that women should be responsible for avoiding rape. It's different from redditors mocking rape victims.

True,nedyken,,,"The story is rather tragic.  I do believe that had the internet existed in 1994 in it's current form, Jackson would still be alive today.  Jackson was very much the victim of public perception.  Yes, he was clearly an eccentric with many quirks, but the ""child molestation"" thing was hogwash.  GQ published a non-bias article in 1994 entitled ""Was Michael Jackson Framed?"" that you can find all over the net.  Here's one link:  http://floacist.wordpress.com/2007/08/22/gq-article-was-michael-jackson-framed/ ...    It's a pretty fascinating read that details exactly what happened during that first accusation.  Most people haven't read it, though... because it's easier and more ""interesting"" (and at the time, ""funnier"") to imagine him as some kind of freak.

Anyone unfamiliar with what actually happened there, I'd really recommend reading it. The **TL;DR:** version is pretty god damn fucked up.  He befriended a young boy, his mother and step-father.  The biological father wanted money to produce ""Robin Hood Men In Tights"" so he brainwashed his son with sodium Amytal in an attempt to extort money out of Jackson... knowing full-well he wouldn't want to go through a long career-tarnishing trial.  There's taped conversations between the father and step-father where the father lays out his entire plan.
&gt; “And if I go through with this, I win big-time. There’s no way I lose. I’ve checked that inside out. I will get everything I want, and they will be destroyed forever. June will lose [custody of the son]…and Michael’s career will be over.”

It's whack.  Seriously... read it.  FYI, the father ended up killing himself in 2009 only 5 months after Jackson died:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Chandler

My point is, public perception in 1994 was so heavily dependent on shock media, magazine covers, radio, talk show monologues, etc.  Had Reddit existed back then, we would have seen the smoking gun.  People would be chatting over the details on a daily basis.  It would have been very difficult for the public to remain that misinformed and warped by rumor and heresay.  

But the perception stuck.  And clearly it weighed heavily on Jackson... someone who had dedicated his life to helping children in need.  He was clearly depressed.  He turned to drugs.  As we later found out, he needed to be medicated to even sleep.  I can't imagine what that had to have been like..

That was the only time anyone ever accused Jackson of wrongdoing... until 11 years later in 2005, but this time it was CLEARLY bullshit and a clear attempt at extortion.  Anyone following that trial was aware of how ridiculous the claims were.  I'll summarize.  It was right after the huge documentary [""Living with Michael Jackson""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_with_Michael_Jackson) that Martin Bashir did.  Jackson was all over the news for the ""baby dangling"" incident.  In the documentary, it showed that Jackson took in a young cancer patient, his mother and sister and was paying for the boy's treatment (last I heard, he's now cancer-free).  He was close with the boy and the family.  It made the news, because of the scene where Jackson says, ""What's wrong with sharing a bed with someone you love?"" in reference to the young boy.  The public took it (or twisted it) to be a sexual thing... Jackson intended it as an innocent remark... hanging out late playing video games on a massive bed and someone passes out.   Inappropriate?  Maybe.  Molestation?  No.  Anyways... the mother of the boy had been in and out of mental institutions and had attempted to con money from celebrities in the past (the reason for Jay Leno and George Lopez being at the trial).  She also claimed her family had been ""sexually fondled"" by JC Penny security after her punk kids shoplifted... [she settled out of court for $152k](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_of_Michael_Jackson#J.C._Penney:_alleged_assault.2C_litigation_and_psychiatric_analysis).   So anyhow, the Bashir documentary was a shitshow, people like Gloria Allred were petitioning to have Jackson's kids taken away... and Jackson's handlers told him to distance himself from the young boy and the family... so he cut them off.   It was only after that, that the woman and the boy accused Jackson of misconduct.  The funny part was, they literally claimed the molestation started AFTER the documentary aired.  As if Jackson hung out with the kid, let them live at Neverland, passed out playing videogames, filmed a documentary admitting that it was innocent... and then when the entire world started looking at the relationship with a magnifying glass and wanted to take away Jackson's kids (and apparently the family had already been interviewed by police)... THAT's when Jackson decided to start molesting the kid.   Come on...   Whole thing was a crock of shit.  The woman also claimed they were held hostage at Neverland... to which they pulled up the creditcard receipts showing all the shopping sprees she was doing with Jackson's money during the ""kidnapping"".  At one point they point out, ""How could you be kidnapped if you were shopping at Nordstroms, Tiffanys... here's a receipt for a body wax"".  The woman snapped back , ""IT WASN'T A BODY WAX!!! IT WAS A LEG WAX!! HE'S LYING TO YOU!!!"" ....  Total shitshow.  Read up on it.  It's was fucked.   You can read most of this on wiki:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_of_Michael_Jackson

That 2005 Trial doesn't happen without the 1993 situation.  It was the same DA (Tom Sneddon) who tried to get Jackson in 1993 that was pushing for the 2005 thing.  It was only mildly plausible, because of the 1993 thing.  They tried to find other boys to step forward (out of the thousands who Jackson had been in contact with over the years) and nobody stepped forward.  They had a former body guard (who had sold his story to National Enquirer and had previously been arrested for armed robbery) claim he saw Jackson blowing Macauley Culkin in a shower... they brought Culkin up there to respond and he's like, ""WUT?"" ... As one journalist put it:  

&gt;""the trial featured perhaps the most compromised collection of prosecution witnesses ever assembled in an American criminal case...the chief drama of the trial quickly turned into a race to see if the DA could manage to put all of his witnesses on the stand without getting any of them removed from the courthouse in manacles.""""

Nobody following that trial was surprised by the outcome.  

It's some sad stuff, man.  Despite this, the perception stuck.  People continued to hate him and paint him as a monster.   People continued to take the rumors and tabloid gossip as truth... and I think ultimately it killed him.  

**Edit: I should admit I'm slightly bias... my cousin spent a lot of time at Neverland hanging out with MJ when she was a kid and she said it was ALWAYS filled with children (mostly underprivileged kids, children with disabilities or sickness) and that Jackson was a fucking saint.  She's still depressed about his death and doesn't like talking about it.**

**Edit 2:  Someone forwarded this to me.  A short interview from 2003 with the author of that GQ article (Mary A Fischer) right after the second allegations broke:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIxU3cWkqW0 ... In the interview, she points out a detail I forgot.  In both the 1993 and 2003 allegations, the parents' first instinct wasn't to go to police... but to lawyer up.  In both instances, they went to the same lawyer (Larry Feldman) who specializes in civil litigation.

True,Steve132,,,"&gt;I'm a networking major and have no idea why I have to do a computer science class

So lets say you work in networking and data transfer for a science research facility. Lets say they complain that your network topology is fucking up their data. They get a test case and show that everything seems to be working correctly, but sending a particular data stream down the pipe seems to be getting very bizarre results. In particular, if the data passes through a particular network node, all the negative floating point numbers become positive, and some of them change slightly. (the numbers are a combination of 7-bit ascii and floating point data from a scientific research station on antarctica)

So, what could possibly cause this behavior? What the fuck is going on?

Well, you try to reproduce the bug with their test case. You send the following data using the api your company uses: ""send_ascii_string('hello')"" and it comes back 'hello'

That seems right.

You send a number ""send_ieee754_number(43.0f)"" and it comes back '43.0f'

That seems right too.

You send a negative number...""send_ieee754_number(-43.0f)"" and it comes back '43.0f'. Uh oh....

You try some other numbers from their test case...weird, you also get slight precision errors, and some of the numbers change DRAMATICALLY.

There is obviously a pattern, as in, the numbers always get the same result, but its so strange.

Your 'eureka' moment comes when a spanish researcher also complains that he can't seem to send email. His email address is 'abâre_ñame@gmail.com'. You put it through the system:
send_ascii('abâre_ñame@gmail.com')=&gt;'abbre_qame@gmail.com'

WHAT!?

Lesser networking engineers would give up.  However, because you took a computer science class (specifically, this class), you remembered something: the ascii table.  Looking it up, you realize that, in ascii, 'â' is 11100010 in binary.   'ñ' is 11110001 in binary....   You look up 'b' and 'q' and find, b=01100010...HMM...its the same as 'â' but with the first bit set to 0...strange.   'q' is 01110001, which the same as 'ñ'...but with the first bit set to 0...weird.

You start to get that scratching feeling at the back of your neck that means that some inspiration is about to hit. What would happen to a 32-bit floating-point number if the most-significant-bit of every byte was set to 0? Well, because you took this class, you remember that the first bit of the floating point number is... HOLY SHIT! Its the sign bit! Every negative number would become positive!!

What about the other first bits of the 4 bytes? well, they hit the mantissa, which causes the precision errors, and the exponent, which causes the weird fluctuations in values.... holy crap.

You ping the machine to find out what OS its running...Solaris 8. You google ""Solaris 8 7 bits bug"" and ""Solaris 8 clear most-significant-bit"". After browsing around, you hit it: a bug report from 2001 on the solaris mailing list that, if you install a certain networked printer driver, it overwrites the ftp server config file, to use 7-bit ascii text mode only for ALL data transfers, even binary data ones.

You check the server logs. Sure enough, someone (IDIOTS) was having problems in the research center printing some data, and logged in an ran (WITHOUT ASKING YOU!!!) 'sudo install all-printer-drivers-extra"", which downloaded and ran the relevant code, bugs and all.

You revert the ftp config from a backup copy on another machine, blacklist that printer driver, then call your boss and say the issue can be fixed, but you'll need 12 more hours to work on it. MINECRAFT TIME!
He is incredibly grateful, and says that you are an invaluable asset to the company, and wants to offer you a bonus for saving all the data that is absolutely vital to this project.

And all because you had to take this stupid computer science course.

&gt;this math stuff is well above anything I ever touched on in high school.

If you didn't learn multiplication and exponentiation in high-school, then I'm really sorry for you. Since you probably did, however, I'm fairly certain that you are just being dramatic. Literally, all this is just scientific notation, which you DID learn in high school.

I'll show you an example: 'convert 100101110010 to a floating-point number assuming 6 bits of mantissa'

Well, the first bit on the left is the sign bit. It is either 0 or 1. call it s. In our case, s=1

The next 5 bits are the exponent bits. 5 bits in binary is a number between 00000 (which is 0) and 11111 (which is 31). In this case, e=00101. In binary, thats 4+1=5. so, e=5

The next 6 bits are the mantissa bits. 6 bits in binary is a number between 00000 and 111111 (64-1=63). In our case, m=110010. That is 32+16+4=52

So, the way the floating point format works, is that you have the sign to determine if its positive or negative...so we write (-1)^s, where s is 0 or 1.  (-1)^0=1, so positive, and (-1)^1=-1, so negative.

The next thing is a number, greater than 1 but less than 2.  This is just like scientific notation in base-10.  In base 10, you write (+/-) M * 10^e, where M is a decimal fraction between 1 and 10...like, 324000 in scientific notation
would be 3.24x10^5, but 0.324x10^6 would be considered invalid.  It has to be greater than 1, but less than the base you are using...if it is more than the base you are using, you increase the exponent...  In base-2, this means 
our fraction is between 1 and 2...this means that we just have to write down the fractional part that is more than 1.  

In our case, since we know that the fractional part (mantissa) is 6-bits wide, that means it is a number/64.  In our case, we have m=52, so our fractional part is 52/64.  Since it has to be greater than 1, we add 1.

So, we have (1+52/64), or, (1+m/2^6)

Lastly, we want to store the exponent.  However, we want to be able to represent very small numbers (like .000013 would be 1.3x10^(-5) in decimal scientific notation).  We also need to be able to represent big numbers with large exponents.  That means the exponent needs to be negative or positive as well.  However, a string of 5 bits is just a positive integer between 0 and 32....   So how can we make it into a negative or positive number?  we subtract 16, so that its a positive number between -16 and 16.    So, in our case, e=5.  e-16=-11 . 

So, we have an exponent of (5-16)=11, or,generally, (e-2^4)

So, putting it all together:   We want to form our scientific notation and calclate what number it represents:  We know that we have a negative number


v=(-1)^1 ....

v=(-1)^s ....

We know that we have a leading coefficient of (1+52/64)

v=(-1)^1 (1+52/64) ...

v=(-1)^s (1+m/2^6 ) ...

We know that we then multiply times a power of 2, with an exponent of (5-16)

v=(-1)^1 (1+52/64) 2^(5-16)

v=(-1)^s (1+m/2^6 ) 2^(e-2^4 )

So, plug this all into your calculator, and you are done.

v=(-1)^1 (1+52/64) 2^(5-16)

v=-1 (1+52/64) 2^-11

v=- 2^-11 - 52/64 2^-11

v= -0.00088500976

So, the string 100101110010 is -0.00088500976 in a floating-point format.

True,Fuego_Fiero,yorickbrown,Yorick Brown,"Adding to what Whodabagel said, I think it's because we see the X-Men as a really tight knit group who all know each other really well, as opposed to the Avengers who are basically strangers who get together to save the world occasionally. So when the X-Men rip on each other and have snappy dialogue, it makes sense. They know each other's personality quirks and idiosyncrasies so well because they are more than just teamates. Also, the only member of the Avengers who can crack a joke is Spider-Man, and he was only added recently (The idea of Tony Stark as a snarky wise cracking son of a bitch is pretty new with the RDJ portrayal colouring his character nowadays; Think back to Civil War era Iron Man, was he flippant or gregarious?) Sp the members of The Avengers having snappy witty dialogue is somewhat out of character. But the X-Men have always had a sense of humor. Whether it was Bobby and Hank in the original team, Nightcrawler and Collosus in the Byrne/Claremont era, or even the new student like Quentin Quire and the Wax guy (can never remember his name), the X-Men have always taken themselves a bit less seriously. 

This probably comes from their outcast nature .Outcasts of anytime have been far less serious about life than the normals. Think about the Beatniks, the Romantics, The Dadaists, the Hippies, the Punks, the godforsaken Hipsters. They all approach life from a more nonchalant, ironic stance. Whereas the members of the Mainstream take everything far too seriously. 

tl;dr Bendis is a fantastic fit for the X-Men.

True,bublz,,,"Hey bro, I think I get exactly what you're saying.  I weigh 320lbs, and this is my life:

I can pretty much do anything.  If my friends want to walk a mile or two to get some food, I can do it pretty easily.  I have a college class that is on the third floor, and we have to take the stairs.  I can do that.  It sucks, but I mean, it sucks for everybody else, too.  I can wear good-looking clothes, but our options are limited, and it makes finding the best clothes a chore.  I can hit on girls, but it's usually just a game, nothing more; all forgotten by the next day anyway.

I am pretty fat, but I can do whatever my friends can do.  It helps that I did karate classes for 8 years while I got fatter, so I have strong muscles and am fully capable of doing a kickass cyclone-kick.  It's just that I'm fat.  Now, let's be honest here.  I can do anything that my friends can do, but certainly with less pizzazz.  That's why I want to lose weight.  I want to be able to run to catch the bus and not be a sweaty mess; even though I'm fully capable of catching that bus.  I want to be able to play baseball with my kids, and not just show them how to play catch.  **We can function, but dammit, we can do better than this.**

So I think I know exactly what you mean.  I should also point out that I am incredibly grateful for the way I am right now.  I am very heavy, but there's so much that's positive.  I am healthy, or as healthy as someone my size could ever be. I don't have shit-stains coming from my pants, nor do I hide candy bars in my love-handles for when I'm feeling down.  I've been thinking a lot about my life, and I honestly feel that if I never struggled with obesity, I wouldn't be the responsible, caring, strong, and awesome person that I am.  

But here's what I have to say.  You and I, we need to get our shit together.  This is our only life to live, and I'll be damned if I'm gonna live it as a fat guy.  I hope you feel the same way.  Imagine a sunny, warm, spring day.  About 68-72F, maybe even a bit warmer.  Beautiful.  If I want to go for a run, I'll do it.  If I want to go to the local pool and hit on the bikini babes, I'll do it.  If I want to go motherfucking skydiving, what am I gonna do?  I'm gonna do it.  But we can't do it with a 46in waist and man boobs that rival Jennifer Love Hewitt's.

So, here's the deal.  I'm gonna eat better, I'm gonna do some cardio, and I'm gonna drink more water.  But you gotta do it with me.  Those progress pics that you see everyday?  That's gonna be you and me, friend.  It's easier to do the journey together, and although we have quite a large gap in our starting weights, I think we can really help each other out.

True,Azmodan_Kijur,,,"Hmmm ... the article indicates that the companies that test for drug use are behind keeping these drugs generally illegal to make money. The companies point out that legalization is, in fact, good for their bottom line and that they are against it for ""ethical reasons"". Which one do we believe, is the question.

On the one hand, these people **are** profiting from the war on drugs. In this specific case, these are businesses that specialize in the production of tests that allow employers to determine if their employees are under the influence of a drug while on the job.

On the other hand, legalization is effectively meaningless for the application of their products. They sell these tests to employers to test their own employees. Whether the drug is *legal* is irrelevant - the employers rules of conduct can still very legally restrict the use of and influence of drugs while on the job. In actuality, there should be no real effect from the legalization on their business. There might be a small bump, but the same businesses that restrict the use now will not suddenly stop restricting it should any of them become legal.

The same argument stands for the other examples as quoted in the article. One woman was singled out because she operated a drug treatment centre. The claim is that legalization would cut into her business, but this seems to downplay the very simple notion that *legalization* does not mean *required use*. 

Let me explain. I am all for legalizing benign drugs - weed is one, but there are a host of others. No harm comes from the use - no more than from tobacco or alcohol. If the drug does not cause any greater harm than either of those two, then there is not much grounds for you to restrict it (past some prudish sense of morality). That said, I still would not use most of these substances regardless of their legality. I don't smoke weed, but not because it is illegal or restricted. I just don't smoke in general. I find no need. Removing the restriction will not suddenly force me to go out and get some weed. I would be no more inclined to do it then than I am now.

In much the same manner, there will always be people that will dive too deep into their drug use. You know the type. Same ones that can't have **a** drink - they *need* to get shitfaced. 0 or 100 with no inbetween. In the same manner, there are those now that smoke weed that don't have a problem with it. Yet, there are others that do drugs that allow it to consume them. These people allow it to dominate their lives such that they need therapy ... therapy in the form of addiction treatment. Programs like this woman runs will still get clients - probably at the same rate as it did during prohibition.

The upshot is that the arguments that the article makes to ""follow the money"" would likely be incorrect, but are *applicable* only because the ones they are arguing against probably believe it too. Maybe the woman has a moral reason to oppose based on some religious or personal element .... or just maybe she actually believes that legalization **would** ruin her business and is seeking to protect it. If that is the case, she and the people like her are simply mistaken.",0,1364305451,,0,False,1,c92onzw,t3_1b12vn,t1_c92onzw,t3_1b12vn,,1431707684,7,False,politics,t5_2cneq,7

True,ianmckaye,,,"I repost a comment I made regarding the war a long while ago because it fits in here. Please note, I am a German from Berlin, so maybe my perspective helps the discussion.

Why single out the Russians? Yes, they did commit atrocities. And in the end it doesn't matter. War crimes were commited by all parties that were active in the war. The british / US (fire bombing of civilian cities / targets on a massiv scale - Hamburg, Berlin, Dresden), the Russians (plundering, raping, mass killings of civilians). But as a German myself I have to say: It was the German Reich that started the war, that started to declare ""total war"", that started to make no difference between civilian and military targets, that started to rape and burn down the Sowjet Union. That starved people to death on a massive scale (read up on the Leningrad blockade). 

Do I wish that the allied forces would not have used the means they did? Yes. Do I wish that so much nice architecture, history and of course human lifes was not destroyed(including my home town of Berlin)? Yes. Do I wish that my grandmother wasn't raped and half of my family killed in the war? Of course.

My [grandfather](http://imgur.com/0SP1U) fought on the russian side in the [NKFD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Committee_for_a_Free_Germany). He was a Wehrmacht Offizier that went over to the other side in Stalingrad because he hated Hitler (He was sympathizing with the communist, starting in the 1920s) and didn't want to be in this war anyway and probably because he was scared shitless. He never questioned his decision though, because he feels he played a part in bringing Hitlers regime to its knees. He knew of the Russian atrocities. And all he had to say about it was: ""Revenge is very human, and if there is something the russians deserved more than anything, then revenge. I wish it wouldn't have happened, but after I saw what the Wehrmacht did to them, I understand what they did to us.""

(Sorry, if my comment was too emotional or doesn't fit in this subreddit. Please delete if not. My family history is very much impacted from the war and the 3rd Reich so I tend to go into the subject with a little too much personal bagage.)

And as a follow up my answer to a comment that my grandfather considered the atrocities as ""fair"":

&gt;He didn't think it was ""fair"". Neither did he like it. But war isn't fair and the 2nd world war was an atrocity on all sides. As you can read in my original comment, he lost family members in the war. But he probably considered the violence as understandable retribution. The russians didn't rape and kill every man and woman on the way to Berlin, neither the other way around.

&gt;But as I said above, if you read up on the siege of Leningrad as an example, with an estimated 1.000.000 civilian victims alone, you know that the Wehrmacht didn't care about the death of Russian civilians. Why should the other side care? If I try to put myself in the shoes of the people who went through this, I probably would have a hard time, thinking about morality while fighting the people that did that to my people. As I said, there are so many different things to consider when talking about this. The rapes, the killing etc. were an atrocity. The war was an atrocity. As war is. I believe what he meant was: Germany reaped what it saw.

&gt; I find myself facing the same conundrum when thinking about the firestorms of Hamburg, Dresden, Tokio etc. or about the nuclear bombs. It's pretty easy to say, that those were war crimes (as they probably were) but I have to consider the surroundings, the stage of the war and everything else and might come to the conclusion that not everything is as black and white as we wish it would be.

True,sidneyc,,,"If a website asks for a password, it is bad practice if they store the unencrypted password on their server; if their server got hacked, all usernames/passwords would be readable, and since many people use the same username/password combinations on multiple websites, that means their accounts are now not safe anymore.

So what good websites do is the following: instead of storing the password, they *garble* the password. They do this by means of a mathematical function that turns the password into a mess; but with the added twist that the same password will garble to the same mess everytime. Such a mathematical function is called a *hash function*, and a well-known one is called 'MD5'.

Suppose your plaintext password is ""hellothere"". The MD5-garbled version of this looks like this:

c6f7c372641dd25e0fddf0215375561f

And the server stores this:

user = ThisShitIsDopeYo, md5 = c6f7c372641dd25e0fddf0215375561f

Now if you want to log in again to that specific webserver, your password is not checked directly; instead, the *garbled version of the password you provide* is checked against the one on record. Ideally, the ""garbling"" happens in your web-browser, which prevents the 'readable' passwords from ever crossing over the internet.


The cool thing is that it is very difficult to get back from ""c6f7c372641dd25e0fddf0215375561f"" to ""hellothere"", so if (for some reason) the garbled version is compromised, it is still of very little use.

One problem with this approach is that if two people use the same passwords, their hashes map to the same garbled number. Furthermore, it is possible to make a big ""dictionary"" that pre-calculates, for many plausible passwords, what the garbled version is.

For that reason, properly set-up servers don't actually work like this; instead, they ""add a bit of salt"" to the password in the form of random characters, for example:

""hellothere"" --&gt; ""hellothere876234dcbjf834576""

... before the garbling is done.

The garbled version now looks completely different, and it is stored in the database along with the ""salt"":

user = ThisShitIsDopeYo, md5 = a7c1f9f354e62f8961dcbb44f0a48f26, salt = 876234dcbjf834576

The ""salt"" prevents a number of possible problems. For one thing, two people who have the same password probably won't have the same garbled MD5 value, since the salt added to them will be different.

Now as to the question why OPs claim is very improbable.

First, a bank that is worth its salt will know that you should use salt (sorry about that). OP claims that the bank in question did not ""add salt"" to the password.

But second, the MD5 function is *specifically designed* to have a low probability of collisions (a ""collision"" is when two different strings garble to the same hash value). In particular, as OP indicates, the probability of two DIFFERENT strings mapping to the SAME hash are 1 in 340282366920938463463374607431768211456.

To put this number in perspective: If you would try a BILLION random pairs of strings per second, you'd expect to find a collission only after 500 years of trying.

OP claims his friend hit such a collision by chance, and not only that, but that the strings entered were short (passwords), thereby adding extra improbability.

(Nowadays certain weaknesses have been found in the MD5 algorithm that allow collisions to be generated with higher probability, but these do not work by chance. That's why you see some people here claiming that it's a bad idea for the bank to use MD5. However, that is an oversimplification of the issue that I can't explain here).

Hope that helps.

My kids don't get much because we're always behind on some hospital, or doctor's bill.  We were out with my sister one weekend, and I knew we were going to pass buy this place called Ridemakerz.  It's like a Build-A-bear, but you build remote controlled cars.  I asked her if we could avoid the place because I knew her kid would make a bee line for it.  He already had a half dozen of the things, and I new I couldn't afford it.  Sure enough, as soon as we get close to the place he starts throwing a fit because we aren't going there.  She's never been able to say no to the kid, so we go in.  The cars start out as an empty shell, with some basic wheels on it, and costs about 20 bucks.  You can add all sorts of crap to it, an engine, wheels, special tires, chrome hood scoop, etc.  Her kid goes nuts and starts grabbing all sorts of shit to add to his car, at least a hundred dollars worth of stuff.

It was the first time I realized he knew we were poor, and even though his cousin was getting all the extras for his car, he'd be OK with whatever he could have.  It might not sound like a big deal, but it meant a lot to me.

EDIT:Hell, sorry. I did a shitty job of story telling. Let me finish.
Of course I was all weepy when he said that, and I told him he could have the car, but that's all we could get. He'd picked the cheapest one in the whole damn place too. My sister noticed me over there wiping my eyes, and she asked what was going on. When I explained it to her she let him get the engine and the remote, so while it didn't have all the flash, he ended up with one he could drive around. He still has it. This was about four years ago, and my son is still the same. He never asks for more than I can give. If I tell him we're broke, he just says, ""OK, maybe later"", and goes on.

Edit:  I should also say my nephew has matured in the last four years.  I was sure he'd grow from a spoiled little brat into an entitled young adult.  He's become a very pleasant young man.  Very generous as well.

EDIT  EDIT:  This has been a remarkable experience.   An opportunity to brag about my son has turned into something pretty amazing.  I never expected all this kindness.  You guys have been very generous, more than I deserve.   I've also picked up a few suggestions on where we can cut costs.  Some of what I thought was necessary really isn't.

True,CptPatches,,,"Due to extensive research done by the University of Pittsburgh, DragonForce has been confirmed as the hardest metal known to man. The research is as follows. Pocket-protected scientists built a wall of iron and crashed a DragonForce car into it at 400 miles per hour, and the car was unharmed. They then built a wall out of DragonForce and crashed a car made of iron moving at 400 miles an hour into the wall, and the wall came out fine. They then crashed a DragonForce car made of 400 miles per hour into a wall, and there were no survivors. They crashed 400 miles per hour into a DragonForce traveling at iron car. Western New York was powerless for hours. They rammed a wall of metal into a 400 mile per hour made of DragonForce, and the resulting explosion shifted the earth’s orbit 400 million miles away from the sun, saving the earth from a meteor the size of a small Washington suburb that was hurtling towards mid-western Prussia at 400 billion miles per hour. They shot a DragonForce made of iron at a car moving at 400 walls per hour, and as a result caused two wayward airplanes to lose track of their bearings, and make a fatal crash with two buildings in downtown New York. They spun 400 miles at DragonForce into iron per wall. The results were inconclusive. Finally, they placed 400 DragonForces per hour in front of a car made of wall traveling at miles per iron, and the result proved without a doubt that DragonForce was the hardest metal of all time, if not just the hardest metal known the man.

True,thrilldigger,,,"This might be oversimplifying it, but in my limited experience it seems that a picky child simply wants something one way - they could tolerate having it another way, and would eventually be happy with that, but they are either expressing a strong preference or are trying to express their own individualism (often by simply doing opposite of what they are told).  

An autistic child often has difficulty understanding how something could *be* the other way - it doesn't fit with their basic understanding of *the way things are*, and it can cause a large amount of distress and anxiety for the child.  

Imagine if you ordered a cheeseburger and were brought a salad; you would be understandably frustrated, and would insist on having it returned.  Now imagine they insisted that your salad *is* a cheeseburger - or they take the salad back, then bring out another salad and tell you that it's a cheeseburger.  To you, it's obvious that it's not a cheeseburger, and you're going to get upset no matter how much they insist that your salad is a cheeseburger.

True,PcolaQuaker,,,"Long story. Apologies.

My 7 year old son has always been a kind and loving child, accepting of everyone and never one to say anything bad about a person. He's in first grade and has these two really great friends he always hangs out with (both boys). Keep in mind we live in a highly conservative religious area in the Bible belt so our family values are different than the majority. One day he comes on the verge of tears and just walks into his room. I follow and find him under his bed crying. I cuddle next to him and ask whats wrong. He says, ""You know my friend S? We were playing with R yesterday and S told R that he really likes him, like a GIRL likes him! R said that was gross and stopped playing with us. Today, R told everyone that S was a 'faggot' and 'evil' and was teasing him, so S started to cry."" Now my 7 year old is sobbing and I can barely understand him. He goes on to tell me how he stood in the middle of a crowd of first graders, hugged his friend S, and yelled at R that the only evil person here was him, how horrible a person he is to be so mean to his best friend, and how he rather be friends with ""someone who likes boys instead of a bully."" Then I guess he tells all the other kinds who were taunting that they are also evil children and they should be ashamed of themselves. Now as hes taking his friend S away from the crowd, he screams back at them that ""People like you make Jesus cry.""

His teacher at this point was coming to see what was happening and R got in trouble, but to this day my boy is still great friends with S, and has only agreed to be friends with R ""if he apologies for being such a big bully.""

I have never in my life been prouder of him.

True,DiabloConQueso,,,"Also, ""the customer"" is not referring to any singular, specific customer, and ""is never wrong"" is not referring to the current, immediate situation at hand, whether that be a specific refund transaction or a haggling of price or anything.

The saying means that the customer***s*** will be the ultimate determining force in whether your business succeeds or not.  It means listen to their feedback.  If you're selling purple widgets and customers want red widgets, you're better off switching to what the market demands instead of trying to force the market to like what you're selling.  It means it doesn't matter if you, the seller, likes the purple ones better -- the customers like the red ones, and it's easier to sell them red ones than it is to force them to accept and like the purple ones.

It's such a commonly misused and misinterpreted quote that people assume it means ""I'm a specific customer, and this particular impasse or disagreement we find ourselves in should conclude in my favor.""

It doesn't.

*Edit: There isn't a better example of ""The customer is always right"" or ""The customer is never wrong"" than when Coca-Cola ""improved"" and reformulated Coke and sold it as ""New Coke"" -- it doesn't matter how ""right"" Coca-Cola thought they were, nor how much evidence they had that New Coke was better than the original Coke, nor does it matter how much better Coca-Cola thought ""New Coke"" tasted, or anything -- the customers wanted the old Coke back, and that's what they wanted to buy, and that's what they were willing to spend their money on.  The customer is always right, and Coca-Cola pulled ""New Coke"" from the shelves (no matter how much ""better"" or ""tastier"" New Coke was, nor how many magical healing and strength-boosting powers it had) and brought back the old Coke.*

True,ElPolloRico,usa,"Washington, DC","Over the past 4 years, I've been lucky enough to travel to quite a few countries... over 20 at least... some of them many times over! Of those, I've visited twelve of them by myself, all alone, solo.

Despite what you may think, if I had my druthers, I'd probably prefer a travel companion, but I didn't want other peoples' issues to get in the way of me living out my own desires. I'll be the first to admit, it does get lonely at times. Especially sitting down to a meal. 

What I do is give myself a mission. I do a little research into the must-see attractions, must-taste food/beverage, and must experience activities in order to plan out an itinerary. Without it, you'll be aimless and probably do nothing. More likely to dwell on the negative. Trust me, I know all too well. 

I rarely take taxis or buses if I can avoid them and walk 90% of the time. It's takes up time, allows you to soak up the environment, and gives you a workout that makes you happy to be back in your room at the end of the day, less likely to harp on the loneliness, and more likely to be happy to be relaxing.

I **LOVE** photography, and most especially travel photography. I certainly hope you brought a camera. Traveling alone is really the best way to do it.  When traveling with others, I always find myself worrying about holding them up while I set up, fumble with my gear, or want to wait for the perfect shot. It also allows me to aim at performing yet more ""missions"" like I was talking about.  I look up professional photography of the places I'll be to see if I can capture a similar images or add my own twist... to be creative. After all is said and done, those pictures mean the world to me and I feel more fulfilled for having them and experiencing the process of capturing them.

Good luck!... and think about how lucky you are to be on the trip instead of the same ol' mundane routine you likely left behind for a while.

I think Modest Mouse does a really great job at creating albums, not just songs, so I would recommend listening to albums as a whole if you want to get into them.  Each album has a slightly different flavor.  Here's a list of their best/most popular albums:

* **The Moon and Antarctica**:  Usually considered their best.  It's pretty relaxed at times, but also includes some really strange branching efforts (Tiny Cities Made of Ashes and Wild Pack of Family Dogs come to mind).  The first three songs I listed above are all from that album.

* **Good News for People that love Bad News**:  This is the album with ""Float On"" as it's single.  There's a lot of other really great stuff on this album, and as a whole it's one of the *rougher* albums.  They used the Dirty Dozen Brass Band as their horn section throughout the album, so there's a good deal of different instrumentation that isn't seen on other MM albums.  Bukowski, The View, Good News, and Satin Coffin are probably my favorites off this album.

* **Lonesome Crowded West**:  A bit older, this album fluctuates a bit.  Harsh stuff like Shit Luck and Doin' the Cockaroach are there right next to incredibly sad slow song Bankrupt on Selling, and everything in between.  If you like variety and a band willing to experiment, then this one is awesome.

* **We Were Dead**:  Their newest full album, this one featured Johnny Marr from The Smiths as a temporary band member.  And I (personally) think it shows.  Lots of background vocals and smooth bass lines.  The whole album has a sense of other-worldliness.  It's either a lost-at-sea or wizard of oz vibe throughout.

True,foretopsail,soc,Maritime Archaeology,"This is a cool question!

And there's even an easy answer.  So if you eat 2,500 Calories in a day, that's 2,500 kilocalories (energy calories rather than food calories).

Conveniently, one gram of TNT has been set to equal one kilocalorie (even though a gram of TNT has a slightly variable yield, there's a standard ""TNT equivalent gram"").  That means your 2,500 Calories are the same as 2.5 kg of TNT.

Which is a lot!  That's the same as almost 44 WWII hand grenades!  

Now, how much damage would it do?  That's a complicated question.  There's a lot of experimental data on 1 kg TNT explosions. Fortunately, it's easily scalable.  I'm going to use the Sadovsky formula for the blastwave formula for a TNT explosion on Earth's surface at standard atmospheric pressure.

That formula is: 

    Δp=0.95((m^1/3)/r)+3.9(((m^2)^1/3)/r^2)+13(m/r^3)

Where m is mass in kg, r is distance from blast in m, and overpressure (Δp) is in atm.

At one meter, the Sadovsky formula gives us a peak overpressure of 41 atm ~ 41 kg/cm^2  That's enough for instant death.  At 2 m, that's about 6.7 atm, which is still lethal.  At 3 m, 2.5 atm is not likely to be lethal.  It continues from there, getting progressively less lethal.

**BONUS FACT:**

A 200 pound man might have 30 pounds of fat (more if you're fat, less if you're fit).  This is 122400 Calories: 122.4 kg TNT equivalent.  At that amount, you'd have to go out a whole 11 m before you get down to that 2.5 atm non-lethal level that you get from a day's worth of calories at 3 m.

**EVEN MORE BONUS:**

[CanaMcPain](http://www.reddit.com/user/CanaMcPain) asked: *So how big would the explosion be if we took all the energy in an average human life?*

Using the recommendations for a male child up to the age of 18, and then assuming he lives until the age of 80, eating 2200 calories every day, it's 60517000 calories, or that same number of g TNT.  Which is enough to run a clothes dryer for 80 years, coincidentally.

Assuming it was a female child who grew up to be 86 and ate 1800 calories/day as an adult, that's 54020000 calories/g TNT equivalent, or 70 years of dry clothes.

But still only the total relativistic energy of 2.5 milligrams of matter.  An average mosquito, turned into energy, could power you for your whole life.

**LET'S KEEP THIS GOING:**

What about the entire world?  The UN estimates somewhere around 2750 kcal/person/day globally.  Multiplying by population, that means every day the world consumes 19,177,780,690,750 kcal: 19 trillion calories.  Which as we know, is 19 trillion g TNT equivalent.  That's a largish atomic bomb, or half a Krakatoa eruption. On the other hand, we're up to the relativistic energy of just under a kilogram of matter.  Not too bad!

In a **year**, the planet eats close enough to 7 quadrillion calories as makes no difference.  Which is a whole lot: 7 gigatons TNT!  But that's only a quarter of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake's energy. We're puny!

**THE FINAL COUNTDOWN:**

*It's about to get arbitrary in here.*

How much energy have all the people who have ever lived consumed?

This is going to involve a lot of assumptions.  The fine folks at the Population Reference Bureau estimate that there have been 106 billion people.  Assuming their average lifespan is really hard, but we'll set it arbitrarily at 55.  And we'll also say (arbitrarily) they ate 2000 calories a day.  Those numbers might be high or low, but they're probably not *super* far off.

That's 4,255,900,000,000,000,000 calories: Four and a quarter quintrillion g TNT.  That's a lot!  Half the world's fossil fuel reserves!  More than the whole planet's total daily solar energy intake.

We're up to 200,000 kg relativistic mass, too!  Which is... a half-loaded 747, entirely turned into energy.  And only a tiny tiny fraction of the sun's total output every second.  In the scheme of things, we're still insignificant.

As an aside, [Ph0ton](http://www.reddit.com/user/Ph0ton) asked how many people the sun could support.  The Sun's total output for a year would support 3.274×10^24 people, if all of that energy was convertible to food calories, and we needed 2500 Calories each.  Which it's not, not even close.  But let's say it was.  And let's say we built a Dyson sphere around the Sun to support all these people.  A sphere surrounding the Sun at Earth's distance from the sun is massive, obviously.  But that many people still come out to a population density of 11.64 *million* people per square kilometer, around the entire sphere.

A couple more people have asked about the total mass of food produced.  The [FAO](http://www.fao.org/docrep/014/mb060e/mb060e00.pdf) estimates that we eat about 2 billion tons annually, with another 1.3 billion tons or so wasted.

True,World_Globetrotter,,,"I am afraid it is not quite this simple. Not all types of discrimination are unconstitutional. There are many constitutional laws that discriminate on their face.(Rich people pay more taxes than poor people, People under 18 can't vote/People under 21 can't drink alcohol). Discriminatory law =/= Unconstitutional. The question isn't whether the law discriminates. The real question whether or not the law ** unconstitutionally** discriminates.

The Constitution treats discrimination differently based what class of people are being discriminated. Race, Gender, and Age/Income discrimination are all treated separately when analyzing the Constitutionality of a law. There are three types of analysis of a discriminatory law:

Strict scrutiny (if the law categorizes on the basis of race or national origin or infringes a fundamental right): the law is unconstitutional unless it is ""narrowly tailored"" to serve a ""compelling"" government interest. In addition, there cannot be a ""less restrictive"" alternative available to achieve that compelling interest.

Intermediate scrutiny (if the law categorizes on the basis of sex): the law is unconstitutional unless it is ""substantially related"" to an ""important"" government interest.

Rational-basis test (if the law categorizes on some other basis i.e. Age/Income): the law is constitutional so long as it is ""reasonably related"" to a ""legitimate"" government interest.

Thus, a law CAN discriminate on the basis of gender as long as it is ""substantially related"" to an ""important"" government interest.

**TL;DR Laws aren't unconstitutional solely because they discriminate. The legal analysis requires a more thorough analysis.

Edit: Thank you for the gold!

To expand a little more on the Rich / Poor tax thing. The tax code on its face treats people differently based on their income. People's incomes are taxed at different rates solely on the basis of how much money the make plain and simple. Because the law treats one group of people differently than the other, it is ""discriminatory"" in the legal sense (but not in the sense of the use of the word used in its everyday context). But this is an example of a perfectly acceptable form of legal discrimination under the Constitution because socio-economic status is not a protected class for the purposes of Equal Protection and is certaintly rationally related to a legitimate state interest.

 So the manager at my store that told me no, is the store manager. I tried everything I could at a store level to get the ok to take it....but to no avail. So now the gloves are off. Im not letting him pull the plug on my nintendo baby that is on life support, hidden from bad corporate policy.

So far i've hidden it in the warehouse behind some shelves. This will buy me a couple days. My next steps are first...tomorrow im going to ask to take home the box. None of the components...just the box. 

Next...im calling corporate. I don't have a good script yet but im working on it.

When that doesnt work, im going to hide it better. I have a nice spot picked out already. Basically behind a wall in a plain cardboard box. 

In a few days time im going to try to just walk it out in plain sight making an excuse that I bought it off craigslist and the kid met me on my lunch. Or similar excuse involving somebody dropping it off for me.  

If that doesnt work its going back into its hiding spot til my last day when im just going to take a shit in every one of the sinks in both bathrooms and walk out hand in hand with r.o.b. 

At this point this mission is a must. Im doing it for everyone thats ever had a rob. Im doing it for nintendo fans. Im doing this for reddit. Hell...im doing this for the ahole that didnt open the fucking safe. Im even doing this for the people that happened upon this post and are thinking ""this guys a fucking idiot"" I wont let you guys down.

True,fenwai,,,"Sure!  It's long, so buckle up!  My dad left my awesome, beautiful, kind-hearted, stay-at-home mom to be with a woman 25 pounds lighter and 10 years younger.  Thanks, Dad!  I was an instant latchkey kid at age 7, and my saintly mom worked her ass off to support the two of us and put herself through school (she had been out of the workforce for 7 years and needed to make a career change) to get a medical certification that would afford a better life for us.  Princess Bigtits, meanwhile, got to travel around the country with my dad as he built his business (which is now extremely successful, worth several million dollars and boasting many employees) giving extremely '80s blowjobs and generally being gross.  My folks had that ""every-other weekend at Dad's and then a few sad weeks during the summer"" custody agreement, but I actually loved going over there because they had stuff like, you know, electricity and brand-name cereal and Nintendo (did I mention things were rough while Mom was in school?)

What was *not* cool about those every-other weekends, though, was what bookended them; Princess Bigtits had a son from her previous marriage who lived with his father about 3 hours away from the big city where my dad and she ""lived"" (still traveling a lot for his burgeoning business, they were really only there during the weekends they had kiddo custody) and so, after I was dropped off at the dingy apartment complex by my extremely steely, goddess-like mom Princess Bigtits would stuff me into her shit-colored Subaru and we'd begin three of the six bi-monthly worst hours of my life.
Trapped in a car the color of a malarial turd, listening to either Billy Idol or The Cure (Show me show me show me how I WILL FUCKING RIP OFF YOUR FACE AND WEAR IT LIKE A FANCY HAT, YOU CUNT), she would drive me three hours North to pick up her son.  And for those three hours, bitch would proceed to tell me, in great and passionate detail, what a fat, ugly disgusting, pathetic, useless, stupid, trashy little fuckup I was.  She'd narrate the fights that she and my dad had had the previous week, feeding me the delicious little morsels of horror such as, ""...and then I told *your father* that you were a liar, but he wouldn't believe me!  Because he *loves you*.  Isn't that *funny*?""  She told me my mom was a money-grubbing, lazy, fat slob.  She told me that I was a greedy, manipulative bitch for doing things like *asking for Christmas presents* when I was little.  And on and on, for three hours up and then, Sunday evening, when it was time to go home, three hours back.  My mom always picked me up Sunday night, so I was treated to six hours, twice a month, of this fucking lunatic's madness.

My dad worked long and hard to get his business off the ground, so during the weekend proper, when I was supposed to be spending time with him because, you know, custody agreements and whatnot, I was instead curled up in a ball in the corner of the attic trying not to listen to Princess Bigtits talking - and LOUDLY - to her friends downstairs about her ""fat, disgusting"" stepdaughter.  One weekend, she took me along to the grocery store when I was about 10 and described, in detail, as we sat in the parking lot (she had locked the car doors) the first time she and my dad ever had sex (in the bed of a Datsun pickup truck after a Bryan Adams concert, in case you're curious).  She told me about my dad's penis, for fucking fuckable fuck's sake.  I.  Was.  10.

And on and on, for many years.  I learned how to secret-eat ice cream by the gallon.  I learned how to viciously hate my body.  I started to believe the vile bullshit that Princess Bigtits threw in my direction every chance she got, and what should have been an only slightly-distorted because of divorce childhood eventually evolved into Genuinely Fucked-Up Kid-Years (that bled into a Holy Shit, This Girl Is Insane Young-Adulthood, but that's another story).

True,markizzo7,,,"**Here is the full story in depth**
EDIT:(For those who don't know what an arrhythmia is, it is a strand of heart beats that can last any amount of time, that are irregular to the heart's normal beat rhythm) In most cases they are not lethal and very short. This is not the case for someone like myself who has Type 1 Brugada Syndrome... There is no cure. It is diagnosed with a simple EKG, but often lies dormant and goes undetected. But with a little 'luck' it will show up on an EKG. The only treatment is the immediate placement of a Cardiac Defibrilator.

**WIKI:** http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brugada_syndrome I want to start by saying that with this story I do not mean to frighten anyone or create a sob and a pat on the back for myself. But I do hope that maybe I can shed some light on a condition that we never hear about. One that is growing in America and we should acknowledge and research.

**HERE GOES:** On September 17th 2011, I scheduled a routine check up at my family practice, with my regular physician. This is a routine check up that must occur every 3 months in order for me to be prescribed the Adderall that I, and I'm sure many of you fellow college students take. I mentioned to my doctor that every once in a while I feel faint when I take my pill in the morning. Which for him is an automatic red flag... Although, I later found that this had nothing to do with my condition, and was the result of me not eating before I took the drug, this decision to tell my doctor saved my life. He quickly noted that he was going to take me off of Adderall until I saw a Cardiologist at Swedish Medical Center. I was irritated by this immediately, because for me this meant more time at work missed, and more school work pushed back.

He ran his own EKG (Electrocardiogram) on my heart and found nothing wrong, but insisted that I go see the Cardiologist. I reluctantly wean't to the appointment 2 weeks later, at which point a nurse screened me through a series of tests that did not include an EKG. This was due to the fact that she had the EKG results from my prior visit to my normal doctor. 

On her way out to grab the cardiologist she decided that because I said that my grandfather had a brother that died at birth from a heart malfunction, that she would run another EKG ""Just because.""
She ran the test, and walked out of the room after looking at my results and saying ""Huh, thats weird."" To go fetch the Doctor.

**I WAITED 45 MINUTES..**. The doctor came in and said words that I will never forget. ""Mark, I believe you have a condition that I am going to take very seriously. It is called Brugada Syndrome. I know you have never heard of it before, but get used to that name because you will never forget it from this day forward."" He was right. This scared me. I stood up and asked for a drink of water. The doctor opened the door, and immediately I had 8-10 nurses staring darts at me as I looked out of the room, white as a sheet. He asked one of them to grab a cup of water, to which 5 of them jumped out of their seats to say ""Oh, I will."" They were aware of my diagnosis before I was. The doctor told me that I would need immediate surgery to implant a ICD (Implantable Cardiac Defibrillator) into my chest to ""Shock you back to life, when you go into Cardiac Arrest."" To be told at 20 years old that you can/will die suddenly without warning, at any moment, is a lot to handle to say the least.

After two weeks of wearing a device that tracks my heart rate at all times, 24 hours a day, by a few people who is payed to watch it constantly in shifts across the country in Virginia somewhere. I had heart surgery to implant my defibrillator. What I was happily not aware of, was that this procedure required me to be awake and that they would have to stop my heart twice and allow the defibrillator to revive me in order to test the machine. The doctors told me that the severity of the condition was going to be based upon how easily they could stop my heart. This was after they had confirmed that I had type 1 Brugada (The most severe). When I came back to reality after the drugs wore off from surgery my doctor told me, that my first episode was likely to occur ""within the next two years.""

To this day, I am shocked at the sequence of events leading to my diagnosis. But what is most shocking, is that no one knows about this condition. I will live each day knowing that at any moment I can die. I also live each day knowing that because of Science and because of God/luck or whatever you want to call it, I have a device in my chest that will bring me back to life. This condition is REAL and it reeps in my thoughts everyday. It is time that we brought awareness to this condition.

True,Selik,,,"This ""story"" was all I could think of.

A liberal muslim homosexual ACLU lawyer professor and abortion doctor was teaching a class on Karl Marx, known atheist.

""Before the class begins, you must get on your knees and worship Marx and accept that he was the most highly-evolved being the world has ever known, even greater than Jesus Christ!""

At this moment, a brave, patriotic, pro-life Navy SEAL champion who had served 1500 tours of duty and understood the necessity of war and fully supported all military decisions made by the United States stood up and held up a rock.

""How old is this rock, pinhead?""

The arrogant professor smirked quite Jewishly and smugly replied ""4.6 billion years, you stupid Christian.""

""Wrong. It's been 5,000 years since God created it. If it was 4.6 billion years old and evolution, as you say, is real, then it should be an animal now.""

The professor was visibly shaken, and dropped his chalk and copy of Origin of the Species. He stormed out of the room crying those liberal crocodile tears. The same tears liberals cry for the ""poor"" (who today live in such luxury that most own refrigerators) when they jealously try to claw justly earned wealth from the deserving job creators. There is no doubt that at this point our professor, DeShawn Washington, wished he had pulled himself up by his bootstraps and become more than a sophist liberal professor. He wished so much that he had a gun to shoot himself from embarrassment, but he himself had petitioned against them!

The students applauded and all registered Republican that day and accepted Jesus as their lord and savior. An eagle named ""Small Government"" flew into the room and perched atop the American Flag and shed a tear on the chalk. The pledge of allegiance was read several times, and God himself showed up and enacted a flat tax rate across the country.

The professor lost his tenure and was fired the next day. He died of the gay plague AIDS and was tossed into the lake of fire for all eternity.

My father, usually a very quiet and gentle man, surprised me by saying rather gruffly to stop pointing, which I did. He then asked, ""How do you think that man feels?

Well, I think you probably made a good call by not busting in and scarring both of them for life. At this point, the only thing you can do is have a talk with your daughter about your expectations for her behavior in your home. It would be pretty unrealistic to expect her to just stop having sex because you told her not to, though. You can't really *un*ring that bell. Maybe just concentrate on making sure that she's at least practicing safe sex. Don't shame her, she won't respond well if you do that.

**EDIT:** I just want to say that it's pathetic how some of the commenters are offering advice that is basically just them living vicariously through OP's 15 year old daughter. ""Let her have all the sex she wants, stop being such a prude!"" OP is expressing a perfectly reasonable desire to see his teenage daughter avoid high risk behavior, and all some of you can do is shit on that idea because *why*? Because *you* didn't get to have sex at that age? Grow up. He's trying to actually be a parent.

**EDIT 2:** Since some people seem to be confused, I'll elaborate on why I think it's perfectly acceptable to tell your 15 year old daughter that she shouldn't be having sex in your house, and probably not at all at that age. Every teenage expert on Reddit has chimed in with an authoritative, ""well if she knows about condoms and birth control, what's the harm?"" Jesus Christ, people, *no shit*. The physical issues are the easiest to deal with *by far*. I'm talking about the *emotional* toll of trying to take part in adult relationships when you're still just a child. Just look through this post. You'll see women saying that they wished they hadn't jumped into the deep end of the pool so soon. Men just aren't going to say that kind of thing as often, because hell, we got what *we* wanted when we were 15. It wasn't an emotional thing. We wanted to put our penises in girls.

A lot of liberals, especially younger male liberals raised on raunch culture, are fairly intolerant of conservatives.  But why shouldn't they be?  Ever since the civil rights era, when the conservative movement really began, conservatives have been bashing anyone who disagrees with them as communists.  I mean hell, you basically just did it in your comment here.  Marx has jackall to do with liberalism, and if you made a Venn diagram of Marxists and liberals, the overlap would be pretty insignificant.

In addition to being communists, conservatives have railed against liberals as liars, perverts, devil worshippers, baby killers, race traitors, man-haters, welfare leeches, idiots, imbeciles, wanna-be tyrants, and all manner of evils.  Things really got bad when Clinton got into office and Newt Gingrich and Frank Luntz conspired to make liberal the dirtiest word in American politics, and reached a fever pitch during the Bush administration when questioning the neo-con agenda was called an act of treason and proof that liberals hate America.

I mean, even if you're a right of center moderate -- a Eisenhower republican, or even a Reagan democrat -- you get treated by conservatives like you're the Handmaid of Hitler and worship the ground Stalin walked on.

Is it really any surprise that so many people **hate** conservatives?  That so many hate these exclusionary, antagonistic, holier-than-thou hypocrites?

True,theartfulcodger,,,"Fashion often changes in broad, pendulum-like swings, and this is a good example of the phenomenon. But while the question is deceptively simple, the answer is complex, because it involves explaining several social and historical convergences. Bear with me, if you will, and I hope all will become clear:

In the early 70's, there came about, pretty abruptly, a strong visual backlash against the electric, high-chroma,""psychedelic"" colour palette that was such an iconic feature of the late 60's hippie culture; in short, the style got old *very* fast. The reasons were multiple: America was now deep in a quagmire of war; thousand were being drafted and returning home in coffins, mere weeks after their induction; protesters were being beaten and jailed; every day, the newspapers (!) revealed our leaders to be ever more egregiously stupid crooks, liars and fools. Madness and anarchy seemed to lie around every corner. Somehow all that celebratory, fun, acid-saturated colour now seemed ... silly and self-indulgent. It became as inappropriate as wearing a ""Smile"" t-shirt to a schoolbus rollover. And all the gentle social upheaval and genial questioning of institutional values that those bright colours once cheekily promised? Well, they no longer carried much appeal. In fact, they seemed frightening - just more uncertainty and conflict, in already uncertain and conflicted times. 

People were suddenly in the visual mood for something more muted, contemplative and restrained. The faintly mournful ""autumn"" colour palette - dark orange, oxblood, copper, brown, harvest gold, avocado green - filled that need so well that, as you point out, it literally became symbolic of the decade. Perhaps simply because it reminded folks of a less complex time, when subtle, visually digestible, vegetable-based dyes coloured our surroundings, rather than incomprehensible, knock-your-eyes-out chemical pigments (whose colours were actually meant to approximate the livelier visual effects of a hallucinogenic experience!).

Concurrently with the shift in colour preferences, smaller, meticulously repeated patterns once again began to appear on fabrics and wallpapers, as sharp stylistic counterpoint to the free-form, *Yellow Submarine*-esque, ""supergraphic rainbow"" visuals that had overwhelmed every available wall surface during the previous decade. 

Those autumn colours also thematically supported, and were cross-fertilized by, the decade's nascent ""natural"" movement. Still inspired by the lofty ideals of their older siblings' recently failed hippie paradigm, and boosted by the first vague stirrings of the modern ecology movement,  '70s boomers forsook (at least temporarily) their parents' blatant consumerim, and instead embraced the generationally dormant, homespun handicrafts of their grandparents: macramé, crochet, bargello, weaving, leatherworking, cutting down old beer bottles into drinking glasses. The handicrafts they created and proudly decorated their homes with were mostly made from organic materials, so they just *looked* better when surrounded with earth-tone colours. Chromatic colour was out, because it detracted from the *workmanship* - which was, after all, what differentiated handmade-and-unique from factory-extruded and common.

This attitudinal shift towards muted, ""homemade"" colour and texture, and away from slick, obviously *industrial* colours and finishes was, at least in part, probably a subconscious side-effect of the 70's generation's fast-growing resentment of both the politician-buying industrial complex, and its ongoing material support for a war they despised. (Yes, the war ended in '75, but resentments lingered.) It was, if you will, a form of protest, or boycott: a generation's tentative, somewhat pathetic attempt to re-exert control over their own visual destiny, and to wrest whatever tiny part of their environment they still could, away from the overbearing and apparently malignant industrial and commercial forces that were threatening to overwhelm them socially, financially and politically.

At the same time as these colour and design changes took hold in home decor, people began gradually shifting their wardrobes back to natural wools and cottons. After a decade and a half of collecting increasingly slinky, shiny, uncomfortable, odiferous and obviously synthetic garments - which were *themselves* a pendulum-swing away from the ossified white-cotton-shirt, gray-flannel-suit ethos of the two decades following WWII, the fabric-choice pendulum was again swinging back.  And in clothing, as in interior design, autumnal, natural colours were generally seen to be more complementary to natural materials than chromatic colours.

That all being said (whew!), the prevalence of the autumnal palette wasn't *really* as all-encompasing as retro media like *That 70's Show* would have us believe. (Btw, what was up with the anachronistic, so-90's, industrial loft-tech, cheese-grater kitchen lights? Obvious clanger.) Designers frequently go kind of over-the-top when they try to recreate a period look, a generation or more later. Frankly, even *Mad Men*, though certainly very well researched, is visually a little overbearing in its representation of the period; after all, not everything *in* the Sixties was *of* the Sixties; some of it hailed from the Fifties and Forties, even the Thirties. Just as we still occasionally see an 80's wood panelled Buick land-shark station wagon in the Walmart parking lot, or a suitcase-sized VCR parked under a friend's tube TV, I long to see a cheap postwar suit on some poor agency schlub who supervises the steno pool. Instead, *everybody* wears Brooks Brothers. All the time.

It is also instructive to realize that within any fashion era ""look"" you'd care to examine, competing visual ideas constantly jousted with one another for dominance. Visual style is a roiling river, not a still pond. Remember that the ""natural, homespun"" 70's were also the era that gave birth to platform boots for men, polyester lounge suits, ""designer"" jeans, disco, the New York Dolls, foil wallpaper, smoked glass coffee tables, naugahyde sofas, spherical stereo speakers, shag carpet, gold-veined mirror tiles, chrome overhead lamps, and pink Christmas trees; and may God forgive my generation for *those* particular stylistic trespasses. For further proof, take another look at *Goodfellas*, with an eye to the set decoration and costumes; it is a veritable omnibus of questionable 70's design. (And a showcase for some very clever designers!)

Next instalment: why the theme colours of the late '50s and early '60s were red, pastel green, chrome yellow and teal, and why commercial printers suddenly stopped putting type into straight lines.

Yes, false rape accusations are bad, but I don't think 2/week is an especially high number, and the vast majority of those two would not be convicted (I assume, too lazy to do the research right now).

Thank you so much for writing to us, and for your patience in getting a response!  We received thousands of emails when Curiosity landed, and interest is still pouring in.  We are gradually making our way through the list of emails.  We want to send personal responses because we and the mission team really appreciate your interest and support.

 

Thanks for your interest in images from Curiosity! The mission's engineers and scientists are gratified that so many people are exploring Mars by examining the images, but are unable to check into questions about specific images.  However, it sounds like you are asking about the object that is described at http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/multimedia/images/?ImageID=5078 and http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/files/mep/ventifacts.pdf

 

Please note that all data products from the rover will eventually reside in NASA's Planetary Data System (http://pds.nasa.gov/). You may be particularly interested in the PDS Imaging Node, which received its first release today (February 27:) http://pds-imaging.jpl.nasa.gov/volumes/msl.html 

 

We're in a great age of Martian discovery, and we hope everyone around the globe feels a part of it! Please keep following all of our missions at http://mars.nasa.gov or Curiosity's journey at http://mars.nasa.gov/msl.

 

Thanks again for your message and your interest in Mars exploration!

I shit my pants when I was a teenager.  
We were on a fishing trip and at the end of the day a few groups of campers got together for a big drinking session.  Everyone was very drunk and one guy was showing me and a friend the illegal aniseed oil they were using.  In my confused state I equated aniseed oil with ouzo and had a big skol.  Literally within about 30 seconds I had passed out cold.  (We rang the poisons information line when we returned and were told even mouthful of pure aniseed can kill you.)

I came to sometime the next morning by lifting my face out of the dirt and looking around; my best mate had claimed my sweet camp stretcher and I had been dragged alongside the tent and dumped there.  I could feel something horrible in my pants; basically my body had voided *everything* that had been in my intestines.  This was now caked inside my undies like one massive solid piece of clay.

I staggered to my feet intent on cleaning up before anyone else found out.  The amount of shit in my pants was enough to unbalance me and I nearly fell over again.  I got to the really basic outhouse and took my undies off, and with it the massive block of shit that had molded itself, within my undies, to the shape of my ass like plasticine.  I looked round for somewhere to dispose of it but there was no bin and it was way, way too big to even try to flush.

Then I heard someone approaching and in my panic I ended up swinging the whole package up onto the roof outside the door, just as this older guy came round the corner.  Relieved at how lucky I'd been with the timing, me and this guy had stopped and were exchanging pleasantries just outside the door.  Then to my horror I heard a noise above and looked up just as this godawful package rolled back down from the roof and over gutter, landing with a heavy *splat* right between the two of us as we were talking.

He obviously hadn't seen me throw it up there in the first place, and I remember feigning disgust and saying something about ""what sort of filthy bastard would have done something like that"" and making a pretty quick exit.

* The original school colors were blue and yellow, as voted on by students.

* The field is named after former baseball/basketball player and A.D. C.M. Newton. Newton is a Naismith Basketball Hall of Famer, and the fact that the football field is named after a former UK basketball player is an irony that is not lost on many long-time UK football fans.

* The nickname ""Wildcats"" was given by Commandant Philip W. Corbusier, then head of the military department at old State University, when he told a group of students in a chapel service following a 6-2 victory over Illinois that the team had ""fought like Wildcats.""

* The 2013 Coaching Staff will feature coaches who led their previous programs to #2 rankings in offense (Neal Brown) and defense (Head Coach Mark Stoops) -- impress your fellow sports fans with that bit of trivia.

* Alabama coach Bear Bryant wore a blue sportcoat to Lexington on his last trip to coach in the city, as a show of his love for his previous home.

* Kentucky claims the SEC record for fewest yards allowed in a game, holding Kansas State to -93 yards on September 19, 1970.

* Kentucky was the first SEC school to sign a black player, Nat Northington, to the football team. He later became the first black player to play in an SEC vs. SEC game, UK vs. Ole Miss in 1967

2012 sucked. Period. Joker was joking when he said on a call-in show during the 2011 season, “Call me when we are 2-10,” but then UK went 2-10. It was just abysmal. After embarrassing blowouts to Louisville, Florida, and Arkansas as well as an overtime loss to in-state opponent Western Kentucky, UK fans talked with their wallets and forced Joker out following [this scene](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRlAhwcumcdPFy30H-OB1EVY92oOvqqVBQRN3ZO7MTALwGAIUvH) in a 40-0 loss to Vanderbilt (No, that is not a typo). Joker was absolutely one of the nicest guys ever, but he just wasn't cut out for a HC position in the SEC.

The Kentucky fanbase is as excited as it has ever been in the modern era, however. UK has already sold over 35,000 tickets for the April 13 spring game, more than doubling the actual attendance for the previously mentioned Vanderbilt debacle. UK’s recruiting class finished ranked 29th in the country by Rivals (though still 13th in the SEC), a remarkable improvement for Mark Stoops with only about two months on the job prior to NSD. There are several recruits who are expected to come in and play from Day 1, including JUCO DE ZaDarius Smith and Frankfort, Ky. WR Ryan Timmons. Kentucky fans have shown in the past they will support the team when competitive, having finished in the top 30 in national attendance as recently as 2010. This season should be a return to that.

In addition to this, Kentucky will also be returning to the “Air Raid” offense the school was known for back in the late 1990’s with HC Hal Mumme and QB Tim Couch thanks to the hire of former UK player and Texas Tech OC Neal Brown as Offensive Coordinator. Brown was rumored to be a candidate for the UK Head Coaching position, to help paint a picture of how excited the fanbase is for his hire. With this in addition to returning QB Maxwell Smith as well as sophomore backups Jalen Whitlow and Patrick Towles, there is a lot to look forward to for the Kentucky offense. The defense will leave a lot to be desired, despite returning a great number of players; they were simply bad last season.

I’ve never been this excited for an upcoming Kentucky football season. We have the best recruiting class in recent memory. I feel like this team will be able to go at least .500 on the season. A lot of this season isn’t going to be about wins as much as it will be showing how the team has progressed, in their ability to compete with teams like Alabama and Georgia as well as coming back to defeat teams such as Western Kentucky. The true test for Mark Stoops will likely come next offseason as he and his staff are no longer able to recruit on what they did at other schools, but rather their accomplishments at Kentucky. So far, the 2014 class seems to be shaping up nicely with a few early commits and many big name offers and interests.

I didn’t want to mention it in the post above, but Kentucky football is sadly known for our continual history of failures. From the Bluegrass Miracle to a 26 year losing streak to Tennessee (mercifully broken) and currently still active 26 year losing streak to Florida, we can’t get out of our own way. The University is currently designing a [$110 million](http://kentuckysportsradio.com/?p=130460) facilites upgrade for Commonwealth Stadium, as well as giving Mark Stoops an unlimited recruiting budget. My pipe dream is to see Kentucky play in an SEC Championship game, but right now I’ll settle for the Music City Bowl (again). Rome wasn’t built in a day, and no matter what Kentucky Football at least gives me a hell of an excuse to drink bourbon. Go Cats! - MrKentucky

True,doppelmoppel,,,"&gt; I am very much unsure you can equate sheep homosexuality to human homosexuality, and equally sheep heretosexuality to human sexuality.

I am not equating them. I am merely using them as an example that atypical sexuality exists in the natural world and it is not sexuality that arises due to circumstances (artificial zoo enviroment) OR due to evolutionary reasons (passing down the genes by protecting offspring of your borhter). The entire argument that being gay is unnatural is frankly patently stupid. Humans are not outside nature, they are natural, and everything they do is natural, ergo, homosexuality is natural. 

What they are actually thinking is, it's unnatural (science) therefore wrong/second class (moral). I don't see anyone looking down on people with contact lenses (unnatural). Everybody is happy with our entirely artificial medicine making us live longer happier lives. As for wrongness, the absolutely same argument was used for interracial couples. It's UNNATURAL, wah wah, it's not what God intended blah blah blah, it should be illegal.


&gt; My problems with the 'gay uncle' studies are also based in their attempt to argue for homosexuality as a selected-for trait, which I find unlikely. I think there are human social and psychological traits that are not evolutionary. I don;t think being gay is a choice but neither do I think its an evolutionarily conserved trait.

I frankly couldn't give a rat's ass if it's a selected for trait. I'm a pragmatist. Homosexuality, inherited or not, natural or not, exists, and it does not adversely affect people having it. It's not something that can be changed (see the horrible effects of so called sex orientation change) and it cannot be ignored as it is a large part of someone's identity (see how many gay people kill themselves for being forced to hide). It's also not something you develop. I've actually tried doing mental execises, trying to see if I could make myself be attracted to women. Well nope, I'm as straight as can be. 

Be religiously opposed to it all you like, as long as you invoke faith. But start making wild statements about reality and getting involved in how society works and you're just a douchebag.

At any rate, it's true; bling pigs are often too focussed on acquiring hoes, clothes and dough to concentrate on what really matters in life.]

Man what a great question. 


A little bit of a disorganized braindump follows; you might or might not consider this an answer. :)


I don't believe anyone who says things like ""Honestly, that stuff doesn't bother me"" when referencing the types of comments that I've seen on my sister's YouTube videos, on the 4chan board someone linked in this thread and yes, even in this IAmA. 


Frankly, I have no sangfroid when it comes to things like that, given that it's purposeless animus directed scattershot at my own sister by people who don't know jack shit about her and are essentially nobodies. They write a lot in that infuriating adolescent, eye-rolly tone about White Knights (as if being a Black Knight represented some sort of apotheosis!). Can we agree that I have the credentials to be a White Knight on this particular subject?


It's incredibly difficult out there for someone who creates original, positive work product that adds value, especially when she works within the medium of the Internet. When she puts herself in that position, she offers up the products of her inner muse, her ""genius"" to a heterogenous group of anonymous people, with absolutely zero bar to entry. 


Combine this with the fact that there is another group of content creators, the kind that are probably at least mildly sociopathic and have little to no empathy because their primary outlet for communication tends to strip much of the emotional component from human communication, and you have a perfect recipe for a shitstorm.


Yes, I do consider 4chan trolls to be content creators, even in this aspect. Hell, some of the stuff they have come up with is positively brilliant. If they only focussed their efforts towards doing something positive that built themselves or other people up, they would accomplish incredible things (It's worth noting that even a bling pig finds the occasional truffle; their compatriots have hunted down pedophiles, animal abusers, etc). 


The problem is that they've honed their content creation with an eye towards perfecting their cruelty, their ability to get inside peoples' heads and their ability to tear other people down and destroy. They're remarkably efficacious at it too; especially since they target people who are inherently sensitive about their output (they only go after easy targets), and rightfully so given how much work and effort go into creation and how much courage goes into offering it up for public consumption.


For me, part of dealing means understanding what's happening and why I feel angry when I see it (It doesn't *make* me angry; after all, I'm the only one responsible for my feelings. That is my first mental exercise). I feel angry when I see injustice, cruelty, wasted resources and bullying; when I see the strong leveraging their power and numbers against the weak with no redress possible. A typical 4chan hivemind swarm has all of those attributes in spades. I feel my anger is a good thing; if I didn't care when I saw so many negative aspects of humanity on display anywhere, let alone aimed toward my sister, that wouldn't speak very highly of me as a person. I would hate a version of me that felt nothing.


What I *don't* do is raise my fists and look up to the heavens and scream ""why?"". I don't think that the ""why"" matters; it has no endgame; there is no productive action that I could possibly take that would remedy the situation; There's no probability that I'll ever be able to change the hearts and minds of the people who spew all of this bile; There's no probability that anything that I say or do will result in some sort of touching after school special moment where the villain/bully rethinks their life's path while mawkish, sparse keyboard tones tinkle in the background. 


I typically read the ""bestof"" subreddit quite often, and one profound thing I saw on there applies here: ""People who are mad are often sad"". The more that I thought of it, the more it rang true for the vast majority of situations in my life where I've felt implacable anger. When I read that, I realized that I really am sad that people feel the need to say hateful and destructive things and that they don't have enough empathy to care that they are affecting someone with what they're doing. It made me wonder what they themselves are sad about or which of their own needs aren't getting met.


But none of that is my problem and therefore I don't care. I have my life, and they have theirs, and it's not my problem that they are choosing to spend their lives in a way that I wouldn't. What I do to deal with these situations is the same thing that my sister does; keep too busy to focus on the negative and instead work to realize the vision that I have of the best possible version of myself and my life. I have precious little time on this planet, and when I spend it worrying about when people over whom I have no control do things over which I have no control, that's time that I'm not using to perfect my Jiu-Jitsu game, focus on my own writing, honing my craft at work, enjoying time with my own friends and generally trying to be a positive force in my life and the lives of my friends and family. 


And that's the trick to solving most problems in my life where I haven't absolutely needed assistance from other people to get over a hump. I just look at what I want to have happen and figure out the incremental steps that I need to get there. Whenever I've allowed the doubts and negative feelings of other people to get in the way of what I think is right for myself, I've ultimately regretted the outcome. My enemies, your enemies, those 4chan trolls; none of those people have their target's best interests at heart. Their mission isn't to offer helpful course corrections or to nurture or to foster.

True,OldManMarsh,,,"I'm betting I'm a bit older than you, my friend, and I'll admit I was one of those attention-seekers in my younger days. 

I'm sure things are different now as broader cultural acceptance of gays makes this less necessary, but back then, (in the 80's and early 90's) it was something I felt like I had to do.  

During the Civil Rights movement of the 1960's, blacks could draw attention and visibility to their struggles by quietly sitting down, be it at a lunch counter or the front of the bus. Their statement was in their skin. They were black in a ""whites only"" environment. 

At that time, we (I) felt very much like a gay person in a ""straights only"" environment, but the symbols of my resistance were not in my skin. Other than my actions, they were things I could put on and take off, like a pink triangle pin or a Silence = Death tshirt. 

In order to confront mainstream society, for whom it was very easy to pretend gay people didn't exist, we were public, and loud, and swishy. 

Looking back on that time now, it's a little cringey. But I'll tell you what I take from it now -- I was fearless. I was in a hostile environment, and refused to be quiet and under the radar there. Some of it came naturally, and some of it was exaggerated, but it was all about the fact that I was **not hiding** anymore. In fact, the first few times I tried to come out, my friends refused to hear it. I was acting in a way that they couldn't silence or ignore. 

In my opinion, it is from this cultural statement that modern gay stereotypes are derived. 

Perhaps you've been fortunate enough to never feel like you're hiding. If you ever have felt the need to self-censor and repress though, there's nothing liberating about just acting ""normal."" Liberation comes in giving those things that you've been forced to hide their maximum expression. 

Even though gay people are more visible and accepted than ever, the dialogue about gay people and gay rights is still one of contention and adversarialism. Gay kids are still nervous about coming out to their parents and friends. They're still hiding on some level, and so even though it's annoying to you (and me, these days), remember that they may feel like they are really living authentically for the first time ever.

True,chickenmeister,,,"OK. Generally, when working with images in java, you want to almost always use BufferedImage when you can. It has a lot of power/flexibility that you can't get with the other Image classes. 

To save your image to a file, you can use the [javax.imageio](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/imageio/package-summary.html) package. The ImageIO class has a lot of convenience methods of reading and writing image data. You can use the [write(image, format, file)](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/imageio/ImageIO.html#write\(java.awt.image.RenderedImage, java.lang.String, java.io.File\)) method. 

So, first create a BufferedImage: 

    BufferedImage img = new BufferedImage(200, 200, BufferedImage.TYPE_INT_RGB);

Draw on the image as I described above: 

    Graphics2D g2 = img.createGraphics();
    // Draw a black X on a white background, for example
    g2.setColor(Color.WHITE);
    g2.fillRect(0,0, image.getWidth(), img.getHeight()); // paint a white background
    g2.setColor(Color.BLACK);
    g2.drawLine(0,0, img.getWidth(), img.getHeight()); // draw the X
    g2.drawLine(0,img.getHeight(), img.getWidth(), 0); // draw the X
    g2.dispose();

Then, save the image to a PNG file using the ImageIO.write() method: 

    File destFile = new File(""test-image.png"");
    String format = ""PNG"";
    ImageIO.write(img, format, destFile);

Just so you know what I got gold for:

* I said essentially that people wanted to be corrupted, which was a case for why only two Sith were needed to run an empire into the moral ground
* I used Hitler and Himmler as an example, comparing them to Sith lords
* I said that Germany wanted to be corrupted because they had a history of being a nation that every army had to go through in order to ransack Europe, and that had hardened the Germans/Prussians against outsiders
* That's really the extent of my argument

But people keyed in on stuff that I feel was out of the real frame of what I meant, so for the sake of argument I'm going to retract all of that and apologize if any of it offended you -- it was not what I meant.

Hitler was indeed evil, but I feel he was more lusting after power with Himmler and they found willing accomplices in the German people.

True,bitwiseshiftleft,,,"I see your point, but at the same time, these numbers are so huge that ""ever"" seems like a pretty reasonable rider.

Cryptographers regard 2^256 as un-brute-forceable with conventional computers, because that many operations on an ideally efficient (non-adiabatic) computer would exhaust all the energy in the galaxy as heat.  There are more than 2^256 primes which are 33 bytes long, so unless your illegal program is really short (written in APL?) you will need something fancier than a conventional computer.

Suppose we surpass this limit somehow, with free energy or adiabatic computers or something.  As I said to the other guy, the number of 200-digit (83-byte) primes is far greater than the number of times two particles will interact in the universe in a trillion years.  (That ""trillion"" has some head room, you can bump it up by several orders of magnitude, or bump the 200 down a little.)

So as long as your ""brute force"" method involves particles interacting for each calculation, even if the interaction doesn't use any energy, you aren't going to get more than a one-line illegal program.  If it *doesn't* involve two particles interacting -- if the illegal prime only comes up as an *amplitude* for a state in the execution of a quantum program, while the state of the program also contains amplitudes for googols of other primes which are not illegal -- you'll have a pretty good defense in court.

True,PrematureJack,,,"This is going to be long, kudo's if you stick with it, basically I'm just going to point out all of the logical faults of your post, so you can recognize them and move on. I'll include my own thoughts on the matter afterwards.

&gt;First: I grew up in a home where man + woman = good and man + man or woman + woman was bad. Morally wrong on grounds of religion. And I'm perfectly okay with that. Aside from that, it makes sense to me, in a biological sense, anyway. A man has a penis, it goes into the vagina, babies are born (generally speaking).

Appeal to nature. Essentially, saying that for some reason, the fact that something is natural makes it better. By this logic, not only does any sex that isn't for the purpose of procreation also falls short of being ideal, but ANY sexual act at all that doesn't lead to a child is equally wasteful. 

&gt;So what IS it with gays? How can they be attracted to the same sex at all? It seems like all of the gay people must have a hormone imbalance. ""I was born this way, so I can do what I want!!"" Sure, if you believe that, people with six fingers and five toes in total should also get married to the ocean. Seriously, wtf. It makes no sense.

Slippery slope. Jumping from step 1 to 2 to 10. To think that allowing gay marriage would somehow immediately validate marriage to inanimate objects is patently absurd.  It's also technically a strawman argument, as instead of arguing about whether or not gay people should be allowed to marry, you're making it seem as if they are only interested in destroying the sanctity of marriage.

&gt;And frankly, the only difference I can see between gays/lesbians and straight people is the fact that straight people get it on with people of the opposite gender and the other party gets it on with the same gender. Which... honestly sounds more like two people jerking off together. Which sounds kind of gross.

Any sexual act that doesn't immediately result in a pregnancy can be essentially reduced to mutual masturbation, regardless of sexual orientation. You aren't arguing against gay sex here so much as displaying a disdain for all sexuality. Also, simply saying that it's gross is an ad hominem, and hardly relevant at all. I personally think that two elderly people having sex is disgusting, but I don't go campaigning about denying them the right to be married.

&gt;Furthermore, with this huge push for gay marriage... why? Just why? I don't understand. Marriage is for creating families, creating a safe haven where children can be reared. Married people (generally, depending on where you live) pay taxes! And if you're in America, married people are still getting the stiff end of the stick on healthcare. There are other things that go along with marriage besides the whole, ""oh, we're so in love let's get married!"" there's finances... time-management... tons of other things! Do gay people really want to change federal law and take on that kind of responsibility? Sure, this generation might get that passed, but have the gays of this generation even begun to fathom what it will do 5, 10, 20 generations from now?

I'll be honest here, I have literally no idea what purpose this paragraph serves in forming your argument.  If marriage didn't have benefits for the parties involved, then no one would get married, regardless of orientation. In response to the family creation, I believe that's the whole point. Many gay people still wish to adopt kids, but until their marriages are recognized, it's enormously more difficult for them.

&gt;Also, I have observed that most gay couples with children tend to have less stable relationships. They change partners often. They tend to be more violent. And yet these people want to adopt children? Yikes. That's no place to rear an innocent child, imo.

Appeal to emotion, texas sharpshooter, composition, and anecdotal. Impressive on managing to stick four different logical fallacies into one little blurb. However, none of this passage is based on actual facts, it's only based on your own personal bias. If you think gay people are incapable of rearing children, your going to observe things that support this. It isn't your fault, its part of being human. However, your personal experiences with a few gay people should not serve as a benchmark to anyone, even yourself.

&gt;Also, what's with gay people being so easily offended? I understand they've probably been made fun of their whole lives... but the gay folks I know are either super nice (and highly intelligent) or they act super nice but if they feel like you've made a jab at them, even if you didn't, they JUMP all over you and metaphorically rub your face into the ""piss"" that you wrote about them.

Again, anecdotal evidence here. Also, it makes sense coming from a minority. You wouldn't call a black person the N-word, would you? It's exactly the same with homosexuals. No one likes being discriminated against, regardless of why.

&gt;They make their gayness seem like it's the #1 important thing in the world. And it's not. Just because I have an opinion on something does not automatically make me wrong. It's an opinion. A voicing. But to have a gay person do that repeatedly makes the rest of the ""gay party"" look like a bunch of misled, masturbating hipsters.

Ad hominem here, clearly. Also, I'm again not sure as to the purpose of this passage. You don't really make a claim, or say anything much at all. Having an opinion doesn't make you wrong, but it certainly doesn't make you right. There is a difference between an off the cusp, 0 thought put into it opinion, and a well founded opinion based on facts. Not all opinions are equal, and not all viewpoints merit respect.

&gt;You, as that type of gay person, how the hell do you think I feel as a female? Sure, someone called you out on your tight pants, or shoved you on the train just to be rude. Whatever. I have a vagina. Vaginas have been pushing out mankind for hundreds of thousands of years. We've been vandalized by men for centuries. We're still getting vandalized. Hell, women in 3rd world countries still are struggling for basic rights. Oh, your penis had a bad day? It is mandatory for me to feel sorry for you and take up your cause? Hell no. Didn't think so.

I don't really understand what you're saying here. It seems as if that your saying because straight women suffer, somehow the suffering of gay people is lessened? The suffering of women has nothing to do with gay people. It isn't relevant in the least, so there's no real reason to bring it up. Also, does this mean that you are sympathetic to the plight of lesbian women more so than gay men? I would really appreciate it if you cleared that up, as I'm mostly just confused at this point.

&gt;It seems like men + men relationships are taking the nurturing responsibility away from women. Their touting of themselves and their ability to nurture takes away from the female as being the nurturer in the home for a hell of a long time in mankind's history. And that seems wrong. Sperm and sperm don't make babies. Eggs and sperm make babies. You would still need a woman to give that gay couple a child. And what does that leave the mother? A childless mess. Stop taking my ability to nurture away from me and other women.

You pointed out the logical fallacy for me this time, thanks! Anyway, something that ""SEEM""s wrong isn't necessarily wrong at all.  Also, slippery slope here. No one is suggesting that gay people steal away the babies of straight women, and I can't possibly imagine where you got that idea from.  Another appeal to nature thrown in there with the egg and sperm thing, which I might add also validates polygamy since it's directly lined up with the goals of more children. It also comes off as another strawman, with the whole baby-snatching gays thing.

&gt; And the media? They're sensationalizing your cause now, but they will eventually move on and find something more interesting. I'm pretty sure of it.

Not really an argument here, but it is pretty spiteful.  I'm guessing you don't misunderstand gays so much as actually come fairly close to hating them at this point. If this is the case, you may want to rephrase the title of your post, so that people actually know what they're working with.

&gt;I probably sound insensitive, or like a troll. But no. I'm a human with feelings of pent-up frustration because I do not understand and it seems gay people just don't want to hear the other party's side of the coin because they're gay. Which is stupid, too.

Well, at least your getting it off your chest. But can you imagine if there were black people against the civil rights movement? Or women against their right to vote? Of course gay people are opposed to anyone that threatens their rights, and that's what this is all about. You can't honestly say that gay people are equal if they don't have the same rights as other groups.

Well, that about sums up what I had to say. Honestly, the whole passage more or less comes off as a strawman attack on gays, which doesn't seem like misunderstanding to me. If you actually hate gay people, maybe you should ask yourself why, and then ask if it's really justified.

True,Vinin,,,"Since nobody has actually given you a real answer, this was once brought up in one of my morphology classes in college while getting my linguistics degree. It seems that the flipping of end sounds like that is actually fairly common in the evolution of language. 'ask'-&gt;'aks' really isn't that far of a leap much as say 'little'-&gt;'liddle' in terms of linguistic change. Language changes slowly over time, and this is one of those changes that slowly takes hold.

It just so happens that people in lower socio-economic groups tend to get less formal education that adheres to the 'standard' that is set forth. Thus, their use of the language drifts more naturally than those that are seemingly more well educated. Without the standardization of languages we see now, much more drift would be present than we see now. It is much along the lines, basically, of how latin turns into 7 different languages. If drift were allowed to happen, I can see American English morphing into multiple regional languages that are vaguely comprehensible to each other.

EDIT: I also wanted to add something else that I remembered. This class was also specifically taught by a charming woman from west africa that spoke Yoruba as her first language. She also said 'aks' quite often instead of 'ask' as the tongue movement from 's' to 'k' was difficult but 'k' to 's' was much easier and present in Yoruba. So there is also that reasoning. You can chalk that up to morphological dictionaries that people retain from their first languages. This is the same reason why East Asians often have troubles with 'L' or 'R' depending on their first language (these two sounds are liquids and extremely similar in a lot of languages, many do not differentiate between the sounds like say English does).

True,pwnographic,gilded l-1b42kr c-c93g8qw,Pulled a Gandhi for this,"North Korea's trying to pull a Gandhi but they're just barely into the atomic age thanks to all those research agreements with china. Lately they've been spouting off a lot of ""Just thought your army looked a bit on the weak side, better watch your back"" to America, who puppeted Seoul fifty or so years ago and currently has the majority of the world's army and definitely the highest tech advantage. The problem is North Korea took Autocracy, doesn't have any luxury resources left, and all their gold is going to military upkeep. That policy choice has basically alienated the entire world, most of whom have gone Freedom. They've been swimming in unhappiness for a long-ass time so Pyonyang hasn't exactly been growing. Especially since they made the rather daft decision to replace all their farms with mines and forts, some of their smaller cities have starved down to less than 5 population.

Still, Russia and China have been propping them up a little bit over the last 50 turns or so just to keep America on its toes. Lately, North Korea has been throwing out denouncements like confetti and basically trying to demand luxury resources from America, hoping to offset its unhappiness.

Militarily, their threat is rather dubious compared to America's. While America has a sizeable combined force of Navy, Mechanized Infantry, Modern Armor, Jet Fighters, Stealth Bombers, and cruise missiles parked all over the pacific either in puppeted South Korea and puppeted Japan, North Korea mostly just has Great War Infantry, (very few) infantry, and some landships, but almost all of their oil resources are being bought from China and Russia, leaving them with no gold to upgrade many of their obsolete units.

Still, America can't just declare war and make it over quickly. Firstly, Seoul is in firing range of a fuckton of artillery that is set up and just waiting for the mark. They, combined with an unknown number of bombers also in range and infantry nearby mean that Seoul could fall in the first turn of combat if North Korea declares, with some luck, given the numerically, technologically, and training-ly (?) superior American force stationed at the border. Unlike America, North Korea has nothing to lose. They have numbers and a lot of very weak units (artillery that can be killed in one attack by a Mech Infantry or Modern Armor), but together can focus down a unit that gets too far into North Korean lines and kill him in a large number of low-damage barrages.

Also, America is teetering on the brink of ""warmonger"" diplomatic status due to a lot of ill-advised invasions in the middle east. North Korea has mostly alienated its former friends in China and Russia, but their reactions in case of a preemptive American attack are anybody's guess. A combined denunciation from these two relatively strong powers could lead to more from other nation-states with whom America has spent way too much time and money building relationships these last twenty turns. Worst-case scenario is that China and Russia declare war on America in retaliation and push against its holdings in the Middle East and Europe. This would mean nothing short of planet-wide war as America's defensive-pact allies would also be forced into the conflict. With its military force spread thin, America could be forced to use its nukes against the enemy's advance.

North Korea has researched Atomic Theory and completed the Manhattan Project, but we know they haven't researched Nuclear Fission and they don't have uranium resources in their territory, but they could be being supplied by their ""allies"". An unlikely, but possible move would be to gift them sufficient uranium and gold to purchase an atomic bomb in case things go REALLY south diplomatically, which would spell disaster for the concentrated American force defending puppeted Korea.

Lastly, America is teetering on the brink of unhappiness, too. Taking over the remainder of North Korea's cities would be the only way to stop the madness, but would also push America into ""very unhappy"" mode, reducing growth and production in all cities and giving all units a combat penalty. Annexing and purchasing a courthouse in every new city would simply stretch America's gold far beyond what it can support, given that America is barely in the green with its large unit upkeep costs.

The best thing that could happen at this point is for China and Russia to denounce North Korea and stop their trade deals. With no more strategic resources to power its army, North Korea would be forced to disband its units. They would have to abandon their nuclear program due to a lack of uranium. Another option would be for unhappiness to reach critical mass, at which point they would have no other choice but to switch policy trees from Autocracy to Order, which would completely remove those military buffs they got and increase their upkeep to a detestable amount. At this point they'd probably sell off their entire army, replace their forts with farms, open their borders, and try for a diplomatic victory by spending all their money on city-state influence.

Also, [mf2212](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeIAmA/comments/1b42kr/explain_the_possible_north_korea_vs_usa_conflict/c93qwyr) has raised the point that North Korea actually DOES have uranium resources on its territory. Oops. That changes the dynamic completely. If they research Atomic Fission and gain the ability to build Nuclear Bombs, they won't need any more support to put the nuclear smackdown on America. In a faraway land called ""real life"", an airplane-based nuclear bomb will probably be shot down before it can be deployed, but in Civ V there is no way to intercept a nuclear strike. Still, they're a long ways away from making nuclear missiles, which require 2 uranium (instead of 1 for the atomic bomb), but have longer range and are generally scarier. The other thing we need to be afraid of is that North Korea and Persia (currently known as Iran) have been exchanging declarations of friendship a lot lately, and definitely denouncing the same leaders. It's a well-known fact that Persia is looking to expand its nuclear program, but lacks access to and the ability to make weapons-grade enriched uranium, something that Korea could help them out with in exchange for economic aid.

True,GreyCastle,,,"My great uncle was an excellent prankster. He got me really good one year.

0600 old, uncle Drew Ericsson knocked my bedroom door clean off its hinges. And, by ""clean"" I mean in a splintering crash. In full army uniform - from his combat boots to his helmet - he strode over to my bunk with lightning speed before I could even wipe the eye-boogers from my groggy face. As I reached to rub my eyes to wake, he tugged at my blanket and clutched it between his fingers, as if holding a shirt in his sweaty hands, he stared just above my head, eyes blank and soulless. Then uncle Drew pulled my face closer to his, and I could smell chewing tobacco, black licorice, and gingivitis as he screamed:

""GET YOUR ASS UP, SOLDIER! You're not gonna wanna sleep in and wait for the Vietcong to come serve bullets in bed, are ya'?""

""Um... I guess not.""

My uncle then galloped out my now empty door frame, with his M16 swinging wildly on his back with me in close pursuit behind it. On my way out I snagged some slippers and a jacket. At this point, I was throwing on clothes and running past my father in a deep drunken slumber on his La-Z-Boy. I thought to myself *fuck it, I'm just gonna roll with it.*

We got outside into the cold and stood in the driveway. We stood quietly for a while, and I could feel my testicles rescinding into my stomach with each passing second. Drew stood before me shivering and clasping his hands together. It looked like he was waiting for something to happen, but I couldn't put my finger on it. Then it hit me. My uncle's fist connected to my face.

""You gave away our position to the enemy, didn't you? You damn commie bastard, I'll kill you!""

I tried to calm him down and reassure him that I'm neither a commie nor a traitor.

""That's redundant,"" he said, ""every commie is a traitor. Anyhow, I trust that you didn't compromise our mission... follow me.""

We hopped in his jeep and rode off. Now, you're probably thinking: why didn't you say anything and why were you acting like this was a normal occurrence? Well, I guess you could say - I was just along for the ride. Honestly, it isn't an everyday occurrence, but I followed because I thought it might be fun, a neat experience, or a break from the monotony of life. 

After driving for a bit, we come to a stop outside an abandoned, decrepit factory.

""Get out."" He said.

The two of us walked up to the double doors at the front of the factory. There was a padlock on the doors. Uncle Drew revealed a key from his pocket and unlocked the doors. I was not surprised. Uncle Drew became a janitor after the war. I wouldn't be surprised if he had a key to Area 51 on that chain of his. We swung the doors open to a rather large, rather empty room - aside from a few lonely tables. However, one table stood out because of the object on it, uncle Drew picked up the dusty radio fromm atop the table. 

*KKKKKSSSSSHHHHHHH* ""Target has arrived."" He announced flatly into the radio, ""Hold this..."" he handed me the radio, ""...wait here...""

The next moment uncle Drew exited the factory, leaving me holding a radio and looking dumbfounded. Again I thought to myself - *what the fuck?* I decided to wait for him to come, so I sat and inspected the radio. I noticed two things about it (1) that the radio was out of battery - it had probably run out of battery in the 1980's judging by its age - and (2) the radio had a name and address taped on the back.

    1124 Cherub Drive, Midtown

I went outside to ask uncle Drew to drive me over there but, as you can probably guess, he was gone. I'd been duped and would have to resort to legging it. I walked a few miles down the busy sidewalk. I noticed that all the telephone poles on the sidewalk had ""1124, Cherub Drive"" carved into them. I stopped into a gas station and asked for a map. The cashier gave me one ""free of charge,"" she smiled slyly and gave me a wink. I thanked her and thought to myself that was nice of her. When I opened the map ""1124 Cherub Drive"" had been circled. I quickly stepped inside to ask what was up, but the cashier was gone. Whatever.. I followed the map. 

20 minutes and a lot of walking, I stood in front of ""1124 Cherub Drive.""

It was a disappointing site. Not quite what I had anticipated. A small, wooden shack stood alone in a lonely field. Naturally, I approached the shack, because it would be a rather lacking story if I didn't knock the next domino down in my uncle's ultimate prank plan. 

Inside the shack was insulated with layers and layers of calenders. Calenders covered every inch of the walls, ceilings, and floors. Each one had a big, red circle on the first of April, and all of them had a large 'X' through them. All but one. This year's calender was the one empty circle. I was intrigued. But, I was more intrigued by the muffled grumble coming from outside the shack. 

I walked outside to spot ol' Ericsson riding a bulldozer. The crazy bastard was headed right for me. Luckily, the impending doom didn't have me frozen like a deer in the headlights and I was able to take two steps away from the oncoming snail-like dozer and avoid death. He demolished the rotting building and firmly pressed the termite-infested boards deep into the mud. All the while laughing maniacally and stroking the dead squirrel on his shoulder.

""Whu- huh? What? Did you just try and **kill me**!?""

""Nope, I just really hated that shack.""

""Why did you need an extravagant and completely insane charade to do that?""

""Because I didn't want you to find the treasure yet. The next clue was in there, and you were working too fast for this to be a fun game.""

I asked about the treasure, and the game, but he was reluctant to answer and said I'd have to keep playing to figure it out. On I played. I didn't have that clue, so - like the speech I forgot to write for my grandmother's funeral - I was going to have to improvise.  

I headed home to recuperate and think things over. Luckily, I found uncle Drew there. Sitting in front of some board game. I say ""some board game"" because it was the best vague way to describe the monstrosity before him. He had taken the Clue, Risk (regular/LotR), Monopoly, Balderdash, Chess, etc., boards and used an exacto knife to cut and rearrange them into a large map that spilled out over the edges of the table. The board contained mostly Monopoly and Risk pieces (characters and buildings) and the secret/classified envelope from Clue.

""Join me."" He said motioning for me to have a seat opposite him, ""The answer to all your questions lies inside this envelope.""

I sat across from him. He then explained the game to me in the words of a true wise man:

""Find the treasure, retard."" He snatched the envelope and flipped the table onto me using a jumping kick. In a flash he was gone again. 

I walked outside, once more. It was past noon, and the sun was glaring down. It was no longer a bitter, cold morning. I really had no idea what to do at this point. I trudged on, it was going to be a long, hard road ahead of... oh, wait. Uncle Drew is still in the driveway trying to start his car. He sees me and frantically tries to start the engine.

I didn't want to drag this out any further, so I opened the jeep door and ripped the envelope from his hand. I opened it up and read:

    You are no longer in my will, LOL! Suck it!

Hmmm. 

Coincidentally, that was the year uncle Drew was admitted to a nursing home. I did end up finding the treasure, too. It was under a floorboard underneath uncle Drew's bed. I pulled out a chest that contained: money, valuables, clothes, old photos, and his will, which I wrote myself back into.

[Here](http://dc.gov/DC/CJDT/Public+Actions+and+Publications/Determinations/Determination+-+Judith+E.+Retchin) is the full text of an investigation into this whole thing.

* The did not recommend against the jail time due to medical reasons, the prosecutor recommended against jail time due to the nature of the crime.

* The defense attorney did not mention any medical issue besides the fact that Magbie is catheterized. The only issue was that his Foley bag needed to be periodically emptied. He did not inquire about the jail's ability to handle such a problem and his only knowledge about this fact comes from a 15 month old recollection of something a cop told him.

* The defense attorney filed a Medical Alert but only mentioned the catheter issue. The presentence report also did not mention anything about the ventilator. Nor did a letter from the prosecutor.

* The Judge did not know about Magbie's need for the ventilator until after sentencing. Magbie never used the ventilator in court and no one mentioned that he needed it at night.

* The Judge inquired about the jail's ability to medically accommodate Magbie. She received a reply indicating that the jail would be able to accommodate him.

* Magbie was sent to the jail, exhibited respiratory distress and was taken to a hospital. The hospital rectified the situation and sent him back to the jail.

* Upon receiving Magbie, the Medical Director (or some such important titled person) took notice to all of this going on. Recognizing Magbie's vulnerable health condition he wanted Magbie to be transferred to a security wing in a hospital instead of the jail. He called the Judge's law clerk and proposed as such. The law clerk spoke to the Judge and she responded that this was an administrative matter within the purview of the correctional system.

* The Director concluded that he could not get an administrative transfer and instead decided that if Magbie experienced any further distress that he would be transferred immediately to emergency care

* Magbie was fine and stable for a while, wheeling himself around and eating just fine for a few days..

* When Magbie did start experiencing respiratory distress on the day of his death, he was immediately transferred to the hospital and he was awake and responsive for hours before he finally died. 

At this point you can see that this is all out of the hands of the Judge. She took all due care necessary but the problem was a lack of information, not some kind of malice. The people in this thread hypothesizing about the judge being a shareholder of a private prison, wanting to dominate people, or being a sadist, are fucking despicable.

Edit: Big ups to whoever golded me! Some people have commented that my last sentence is too harsh.

True,RamsesThePigeon,,,"As much as I'd love to take credit for being the prankster in my family, that honor belongs entirely to my father. He has a reputation for enacting fiendishly clever capers, like the time that he whittled a block of cheese into the shape of a bar of soap (complete with the Dial logo) and left it in the shower for my stepmother to encounter. I know *I'll* never forget the time that he started covering the entrance to my room with newspaper, and then - after I'd gotten into the habit of bursting through it head-first - nailed a sheet of plywood up behind it.

Still, my father's best-ever prank (at least by his own description) occurred during his college days, when he lived in a dormitory reserved for engineering students. There was one tenant who didn't quite fit in with everyone else, as evidenced by the way that he would come home drunk every night, stagger through the halls, and scream profanities at anyone unlucky enough to encounter him. He was also, it was discovered, the only non-engineering student in residence, and nobody was entirely sure how he had come to be housed in the building. One way or another, he was a nuisance.

So, on April Fools' Day, my father and his friends decided to teach that guy a lesson.

With the cooperation of the entire floor, they strung a series of speakers together in sequence, so that adjusting the L/R balance on a stereo unit would make the sound move up and down the length of the building. Then, they removed all of the lights in the hallway, leaving only the sinister red glow of the exit sign as illumination. Finally, they acquired a novelty record, which they queued to play a very special sound effect.

When the drunkard returned home that evening, he was greeted by a long, dark hallway and an ominous, eerie silence. According to my father, the guy mumbled to himself in confusion for a moment before beginning to stumble in the direction of his room. Then, from in the distance, there came a barely-audible sound. As it increased in volume, it became recognizable as a train, blowing its whistle as if in warning of some dire calamity. The inebriate faltered in his course, wondering aloud (and with obvious concern) what exactly was going on.

The sound of the train grew further in volume, to almost deafening levels. The drunk - now visibly panicking - began to shout for help. Finally, just as it sounded like the train was bearing down... my father's friend came running around the corner with a flashlight taped to his head.

Legend has it that the drunkard awoke in the hallway the next morning, unaware of why he had soiled himself, but intensely suspicious of the toy locomotive that was clutched in his hand.

- Compliment him: “You [your cock/fingers/tongue] feel so good/amazing”, “I love your hard/thick/fat cock”, “You taste so good/amazing” (if you're going down on him).

- Tell him what you want to do to him: “I want/am going to make you cum so hard”, ""I want to suck you off"", ""I want your cock in my mouth"".

- Begging for him to fuck you: ""Oh please"" Him: ""Please what?"" You: ""Please, I want you inside me/I want you to fuck me."" Gasping/whimpering out his name (make it a desperate plea). ""I want this so badly."" (while feeling his erection through clothing).

- Ask if you are pleasing him enough (works nicely during blowjobs): ""Am I satisfying/pleasing you, master/sir?"" ""What can I do to make you feel better (please/satisfy you better)?""

- Beg to please him: ""Please, I want to suck you off"", ""Please let me suck you off"", ""Please, will you cum in my mouth/face/chest/stomach/pussy/ass?""

- Give him ""control"" of your orgasms: ""Please let/make me cum."" ""I need to cum so badly, please."" ""I need you to make me cum, please I'll do anything."" While saying this, show how desperate you are, rub your wetness against his cock or fingers, spread your legs wide for him.

True,[deleted],,,"Edit: Thanks for the gold whoever you are! I really liked learning about Indonesian music in college (even though I didn't get that good of a grade) so I'm always excited whenever the kecak video surfaces on Reddit.

Edit 2: I think my connotation of ""tourist bait"" is less negative than other people's. When I say ""tourist bait"" I am mostly referring to the fact that Kecak (both music and theatrical performance) is developed with Western audiences in mind. I'll leave my comment unedited just for context.
___

From Bali in Indonesia

It's actually called [""Kecak""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kecak) (ke-chak). The syllables they use are ""chak"" or ""chek"" depending on your pronunciation. Fun fact, the chant and performance was actually developed by a German who visited Indonesia(Bali) in the early 1900s. There is actually a fairly long story and theatrical performance that goes along with Kecak that revolves around the the ""Monkey King"". Though it's chant-style was based on already existing chants, the Kecak was specifically developed as tourist bait for Western audiences. ...Which it is still used for today :)

The chant is made by assigning different groups specific patterns. When layed over each other, there is a constant stream of ""chaks"". For a simple example:

* Group 1 - chak, chak, (rest), chak, (rest), chak, (rest) chak

* Group 2 - (rest), chak, chak, (rest), chak, chak, (rest), chak

* Group 3 - chak, (rest), chak, chak, (rest), chak, chak, (rest)

Essentially when all 3 groups are put together there is a steady stream of uninterrupted notes despite all the groups having completely different rhythms. For a completely different ensemble using a similar technique, here's the [1994 Blue Devils drumline](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITjeEGWtW5E#t=2m53s) utilizing similar groupings to achieve a constant eighth note rhythm with no breaks despite different groups playing at once. (the relevant section only lasts about 10 seconds, but the whole thing is awesome too) The very short few measures starting around 3:04 really shows this well.

...anyways... back to Kecak!

There are also solists in Kecak.

* Soloist 1 - Pulse. You can hear this soloist keeping a steady metronomic beat for the ensemble. ""tut"", or in your video, ""bi, bom, bi"". This is extremely similar to the famous Indonesian Gamelan which utilizes a similar metronomic voice.

* Soloist 2 - Voice. Repetitive sung pitches that accompany beneath the chant.

And last but not least, you may recognize the style of Kecak from [The Secret of Mana's Dark Lich theme music](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHqy0n_VQJc)",0,1364439849,,0,1364502622,1,c93sy5e,t3_1b4xxf,t1_c93sy5e,t1_c93pzwn,,1431727207,170,False,videos,t5_2qh1e,170

When you show your support with something like this, you're inadvertently telling closeted folks that they have at least one ally in this cruel, cruel, cruel world.

True,ashmaht,,,"There are two options in front of you. Option 1 is to start reading the #1 issues in order (the New 52 started in 2011 so no book is beyond issue #18 yet). While you can choose any book you want, I'd recommend any of the following:

- Action Comics

- Animal Man

- Aquaman

- Batman

- Batman Inc (not exactly new reader friendly)

- Demon Knights

- Dial H

- Green Arrow (starting with issue 17)

- Green Lantern

- Justice League

- Red Hood &amp; The Outlaws (wouldn't recommend starting here though)

- Swamp Thing

- Wonder Woman

Batman and Green Lantern have had their pre-2011 continuity carry over but they're still semi-accessible (and very well written). Everyone else has been rebooted.

Option 2 is to choose characters you're interested in and get a good feel for who they are by reading some classic-but-out-of-continuity stories before diving into the mainstream DCU.

So, I'm going to recommend some stories I think you should be okay with knowing almost nothing about the characters:

- The Dark Knight Returns

- Batman: Year One

- Superman: Birthright

- Kingdom Come

- Red Son

- All-Star Superman (even if you hate Superman, read this)

- Arkham Asylum

- The Killing Joke

- Batman: Lovers &amp; Madmen

- Green Lantern: Secret Origin (follow it up with Emerald Twilight and Green Lantern: Rebirth for a fantastic trilogy)

- Superman For All Seasons

- Flash: Born To Run

- Lex Luthor: Man of Steel

- Action Comics 775 ""What's So Funny About Truth, Justice, and the American Way?""

- Identity Crisis (there's a bit of backstory but it's all more or less explained in the story itself)

- Green Arrow: Year One

- Teen Titans: Year One

- Robin: Year One

- Batgirl: Year One

- Nightwing: Year One

- DC: The New Frontier

- JLA: Year One

- Formerly Known As The Justice League

- 52

If you're looking for a good Wonder Woman story... Watch the animated movie or start reading her New 52 series. Everything else is... meh. If you need a good Martian Manhunter intro, check out the first couple episodes of the Justice League cartoon.

Honestly, if you're just looking for an easy primer to get you into the DCU, watch Batman: The Animated Series, Superman: The Animated Series, and Justice League/Justice League Unlimited. Yes, they're cartoons. But they're some of the best cartoons ever made.

I used a product that removes the finish first (called Formbys):

Then sanded:
http://i.imgur.com/mzXqXqe.jpg

The table in image 10, for example, I just painted over it using 'Annie Sloan Chalk Paint.'  

http://i.imgur.com/3bC8G4T.jpg

It isnt chalkboard paint, but a chalk paint.  The whole hook to it is that you dont have to sand, it adheres to anything.  Its really powdery feeling, so you have to apply a wax over it that hardens overnight.  You can then buff it to add shine.

To distress, I just take a piece of sandpaper and sand the shit out of it until I think it looks good.  This is what it looked like after painting and sanding, but before waxing.

http://i.imgur.com/PBWgFb4.jpg

Annie Sloan paint is REALLY expensive, but I wanted to try it.  Its great.  But a secret is that you can make your own by mixing plaster of paris with paint.

True,beancounter2885,,,"For some context, I was in Egypt  in 2010. I did the Pyramids on my second day there, which was also my second day overseas in my life. The cab driver who picked me up from the airport (George, awesome guy, no inside voice) knew a locally owned tour company. I'm sure they had some deal going, but it was Ramadan, so any tour company that wasn't completely westernized and was working was okay with me. It cost about 1,000 LE for the whole day. 

They knew I was American, but that was okay. Everywhere I went in Egypt, when I said I was American, someone would raise a fist and shout ""Obama!"" They gave me a magnificent steed they dubbed [Mickey Mouse](http://i.imgur.com/hDHUUGd.jpg). I don't know how many of you have ever ridden a camel, but for a first time, it's a terrifying experience. Your ass is 6 feet off the ground, and you sway a couple feet to either side as they walk. Getting on and off is a nightmare.

The first thing that I noticed is that there is a *lot* of [other shit](http://i.imgur.com/ZWH9qRx.jpg) out [there](http://i.imgur.com/y5KbfuP.jpg). These were active cemeteries back then, and still are today. The next thing I noticed is that the pyramids are [fucking huge](http://i.imgur.com/qC1znpx.jpg) like I never imagined. I've seen things taller, no doubt, but I've never seen anything so *massive*. That picture is from the Pyramid of Menkaure, the smallest of the major three. 

As I rode up to the [Pyramid of Khafre](http://i.imgur.com/D78Wu6j.jpg), a tourism police officer rode up to me on horseback. He rode next to me at the same pace, then looked up at me and smiled. I said ""hi"" to him, and he said ""you want to climb? baqshish"" with a gesture toward the pyramid. I called out to my guide, who was leading my camel on horseback. Without breaking pace, he said ""Say yes and give him money."" I pulled out a [100 LE](http://www.creativeroots.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/egyptian_pound100.jpg) note, handed it to him, and he became my second, silent tour guide.

There are a couple things that you don't really grasp when you want to climb the pyramids. They're [*fucking* tall](http://i.imgur.com/YaLylZd.jpg), the bottom levels of blocks are [really fucking high](http://i.imgur.com/Px1xqu7.jpg) (this is four levels or so up), and the base is [covered in debris from the old shell](http://i.imgur.com/HDDwADM.jpg) (this is looking out from the base of the pyramid; the rope you see surrounds the pyramid about 50 feet out).

I only made it up about 60 or 70 feet before I gave up. I hate heights. Coming down was the worst part, though, because, even though those base blocks are 6 or 7 feet tall, they only have about 4 or 5 feet of topside to hit without falling. If you fall, you probably die. Though if I were to go out, [shit](http://i.imgur.com/7fQ2vcP.jpg) like [this](http://i.imgur.com/IPPY7L2.jpg) isn't a bad last sight.  

[It was amazing.](http://i.imgur.com/cB0rFUN.jpg)

True,Odusei,,,"Well, let me tell you a story. In 1987, Senator Budd Dwyer (R-Pennsylvania) held a press conference. A snafu the year before had caused state workers to overpay their taxes, and a bunch of accounting firms were competing for the (very lucrative) contract to investigate the oversight and sort out who was owed what. Budd Dwyer was found guilty of accepting huge bribes from a California accounting firm, and was about to receive sentencing.

During his live broadcast press conference, the senator took out a brown paper bag and pulled out a revolver. Everyone freaked out, but he told them all to remain calm and not worry. Then he put the gun in his mouth and pulled the trigger. On live television.

Now the reason this is relevant is there was an odd quirk in how this news was delivered to the public. People living on the east coast saw the live feed, uncensored, but people in other markets only saw censored re-broadcasts. A professor named Bill Ellis took advantage of this quirk to investigate the sort of jokes that people told about the event.

As it turns out, people who saw the uncensored feed wound up making a lot more Budd Dwyer jokes than the people who saw censored versions, or only heard the story related to them. The people who had actually witnessed the event were far more likely to make crude jokes about Dwyer than those who could only imagine the carnage (some example jokes: ""What was the last thing Budd Dwyer's wife said to him? 'Don't go shooting your mouth off.,'"" ""What was Budd Dwyer's favorite toothpaste? Aim"").

It's been argued that people who've been directly exposed to something traumatic turn to jokes to cope with what they have seen, whereas those who only imagine the trauma are actually more sensitive to it.",0,1364464353,,0,1364495718,1,c93xwdt,t3_1b5kw9,t1_c93xwdt,t1_c93w8ti,,1431729578,1492,False,WTF,t5_2qh61,1492
True,Most_Everything,,,"My circle of friends includes 5 teachers and I know that some of them are better teachers than others but when its midnight on a Friday at a bar and I am bored because every teacher present is shouting over the music about what they are doing in their classes to reach the students and at the same time I also know all of their stories of students reacting to their efforts with disdain or disrespect it really does break my heart.

These people care very deeply about whether students learn or not.  

To all of you students reading this:  Just because a class is hard does not mean the teacher sucks.  And guess what, often there isn't time in the school year to make every lesson fun.  Sometimes you have to buck up and pay attention even when it's boring.  The lessons you hate are the exact same lessons they hate.  In short, give your teachers a break and know that some times you have to just get your shit together and fucking learn.

EDIT: Here's something I think you guys should check out. It goes into the explanation of equality in Islam. 



Never have I witnessed such sincere hospitality and overwhelming spirit of true brotherhood as is practiced by people of all colors and races here in this ancient Holy Land, the home of Abraham, Muhammad and all the other Prophets of the Holy Scriptures. For the past week, I have been utterly speechless and spellbound by the graciousness I see displayed all around me by people of all colors.

I have been blessed to visit the Holy City of Mecca, I have made my seven circuits around the Ka'ba, led by a young Mutawaf named Muhammad, I drank water from the well of the Zam Zam. I ran seven times back and forth between the hills of Mt. Al-Safa and Al Marwah. I have prayed in the ancient city of Mina, and I have prayed on Mt. Arafat.

There were tens of thousands of pilgrims, from all over the world. They were of all colors, from blue-eyed blondes to black-skinned Africans. But we were all participating in the same ritual, displaying a spirit of unity and brotherhood that my experiences in America had led me to believe never could exist between the white and non-white.

America needs to understand Islam, because this is the one religion that erases from its society the race problem. Throughout my travels in the Muslim world, I have met, talked to, and even eaten with people who in America would have been considered white - but the white attitude was removed from their minds by the religion of Islam. I have never before seen sincere and true brotherhood practiced by all colors together, irrespective of their color.

You may be shocked by these words coming from me. But on this pilgrimage, what I have seen, and experienced, has forced me to rearrange much of my thought-patterns previously held, and to toss aside some of my previous conclusions. This was not too difficult for me. Despite my firm convictions, I have always been a man who tries to face facts, and to accept the reality of life as new experience and new knowledge unfolds it. I have always kept an open mind, which is necessary to the flexibility that must go hand in hand with every form of intelligent search for truth.

During the past eleven days here in the Muslim world, I have eaten from the same plate, drunk from the same glass, and slept on the same rug - while praying to the same God - with fellow Muslims, whose eyes were the bluest of blue, whose hair was the blondest of blond, and whose skin was the whitest of white. And in the words and in the deeds of the white Muslims, I felt the same sincerity that I felt among the black African Muslims of Nigeria, Sudan and Ghana.

We were truly all the same (brothers) - because their belief in one God had removed the white from their minds, the white from their behavior, and the white from their attitude.

I could see from this, that perhaps if white Americans could accept the Oneness of God, then perhaps, too, they could accept in reality the Oneness of Man - and cease to measure, and hinder, and harm others in terms of their 'differences' in color.

With racism plaguing America like an incurable cancer, the so-called 'Christian' white American heart should be more receptive to a proven solution to such a destructive problem. Perhaps it could be in time to save America from imminent disaster - the same destruction brought upon Germany by racism that eventually destroyed the Germans themselves.

Each hour here in the Holy Land enables me to have greater spiritual insights into what is happening in America between black and white. The American Negro never can be blamed for his racial animosities - he is only reacting to four hundred years of the conscious racism of the American whites. But as racism leads America up the suicide path, I do believe, from the experiences that I have had with them, that the whites of the younger generation, in the colleges and universities, will see the handwriting on the walls and many of them will turn to the spiritual path of truth - the only way left to America to ward off the disaster that racism inevitably must lead to.

Never have I been so highly honored. Never have I been made to feel more humble and unworthy. Who would believe the blessings that have been heaped upon an American Negro? A few nights ago, a man who would be called in America a white man, a United Nations diplomat, an ambassador, a companion of kings, gave me his hotel suite, his bed. Never would I have even thought of dreaming that I would ever be a recipient of such honors - honors that in America would be bestowed upon a King - not a Negro.

All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of all the Worlds.

**The Big Picture**

Mining increases the bitcoin network's security and fights fraud by calculating what's effectively a checksum for transactions. By contributing their computing power to the bitcoin network for mining, individuals are rewarded with newly minted bitcoins by the community. This also provides a way to distribute new bitcoins in a fair manner.

**The Details**

Hash functions are at the heart of mining. A hash function is basically a complicated math formula that takes in some arbitrary input and gives a reproducible output. However, changing the input even slightly will completely alter the output. For example, using the SHA-256 hash function:

    SHA-256 of ""Test"" always outputs a hash of ""532eaabd9574880dbf76b9b8cc00832c20a6ec113d682299550d7a6e0f345e25""
    SHA-256 of ""test"" (lowercase t) is ""9f86d081884c7d659a2feaa0c55ad015a3bf4f1b2b0b822cd15d6c15b0f00a08""

Now, let's say Alice decides to pay Bob 10BTC. The bitcoin network basically records that in the public ledger of transactions as ""Alice -&gt; 10 -&gt; Bob"". However, right now someone could change that 10 to a 20 without consequence. The network has to have some way of checking if the recorded transaction is valid or fraudulent. That's where mining comes in.

When Alice pays Bob those 10BTC, miners in the bitcoin network will try to hash the transaction ""Alice -&gt; 10 -&gt; Bob"", resulting in ""aa314e08a642f5be3857276ecb4a4085a33b916f84aebef32a077df9c29949b3"". However, mining has a requirement that the resulting hash must start with a certain number of 0's (depending on the network's hash speed). Thus, miners will slightly alter the transaction by adding a random number to the end like so: ""Alice -&gt; 10 -&gt; Bob 12345"". The miners will then hash it again and see if it has the required number of 0's. If not, it'll change the random number and hash it again. This is repeated until an acceptable hash is found.

Once the correct hash is found, the transaction and the hash are permanently stored in the public ledger of transactions, and if anyone tries to change the transaction (i.e. changing the 10 to a 20), the hash will naturally mismatch and the network will know that that transaction is fake and will reject it. The miner who calculated the correct hash is rewarded a certain number of newly minted bitcoins and transaction fees for his contributions to the security of the network.

Thus, ""bitcoin mining"" is actually a slight misnomer. Its other equally important purpose is ""bitcoin transaction securing.""

Hope that answered some questions!

True,Popsumpot,,,"It's almost impossible to find what this number would be. First of all, there were multiple armies in this theatre - the Japanese, the Nationalist (GMD) and the Communist (CCP). Now, the CCP and the GMD used to be together in one big nationalist party, however the Nationalists purged and executed a large number of the Communists within the part in 1922 - this is the start of the CCP split from the GMD. As such, these 2 forces some times changed loyalties back and forth. Furthermore, as you could imagine during a civil war, the central government (GMD) lost control of large areas in China, which became under the de facto rulership of warlords. This is the background to the conflict - a large number of autonomous factions all fighting against the Japanese, but were hostile to each other and did not cooperate.

As you can see, the logistical problems were nightmarish, and reliable documentation were hard to find. This is further complicated by the Communist doctrine of allowing high autonomous control to their commanders, who would often operate independently out of a base, and would be in charge of their own supply and recruitment at even a battalion level. 

Also, you must remember that this war was *total war*. It's much much different from the United States' part in WWII, where they were able to send in units than rotate them out. In China, there was no 'reserves' - they were all thrown into the fight. Most outstandingly is the 'civilian' part within this conflict. Much of the guerrilla fighting was done by militia units, not army regulars. It's much like the Viet Cong - a huge number of Chinese fighting units were made up of ordinary people like villagers, refugees etc. 

As to the casualty suffered, China took a massive blow. In fact, the Japanese occupation was so brutal that China lost around 15-20 million *known* civilians. This was more than what Russia suffered! As we've already gone through, poor documentation and the chaotic background to the Japanese invasion would suggest that the real number was in fact much much higher. As to military casualties, most estimates place the losses between 3 to 4 million - the second highest (by far) out of all participants, only behind to the Soviet Union. 

It is fairly evident that the Japanese occupation in China was a bloodbath. It is often under-looked in history as a theatre of war. The reality is, China is to the Pacific theatre as Russia was to the European theatre. Both these countries paid enormous tolls in blood and soil in order to tie up the vast majority of German and Japanese forces respectively. It is estimated that Japan lost 2 million fighting men in China alone (At the height of its size, the Imperial Japanese Army did not number much more than 5 million), while the Russians fought around 80% of German forces for extended periods of time.

And that woman is lucky she wasnt slapped. Who says things like that!?

Last week, I had a woman in the grocery store ask me how far I was. I told her nine months. She asked for the due date, I told her April 12. She then backed away from me saying, ""but that is so soon! Why aren't you home resting?! You could go at any minute!"" 

Yeah, lady. Because the second I go into labor I'm going to shoot my kid out at you like a wild vagina cannon. 

A few weeks back, I went to the mall alone while SO was working. A middle aged woman and her daughter(maybe 5 or 6 years old)  was coming over to share the bench I was on. After noticing my huge stomach and obvious staring at my lack of wedding ring, the woman jerked her daughter away and told her something along the lines of, ""we don't sit near people like that."" 

Not sure if it was that I was **super** pregnant or super unmarried. Either way, I was pissed. 

Last one, I swear! I had a group of teenagers, maybe 14-15, pass me in the same mall day. I was wearing yoga pants(the only passable pair of pants when your maternity ones are dirty, of course), a cute pullover, and my hair up. The group of giggling whores(because everyone who is mean to you is obviously a whore) passed me while saying, ""wow. I definitely think *someone* should be at home."" ""I wouldn't go out like that.""

True,CharlieMay,blue,VB.Net Intermediate,"First, you're using intCount before you have even declared it for your arrays. Not sure if it actually matters in this case though.

Your main problem is that you are not **redim**insioning your arrays with each loop.

If you knew how many elements you would have, you could specify it when you Dim strName() but since you don't know, you need to increase its size with each iteration.

Inside the loop, before you try to set your arrays(element) to a readline, you need ReDim Preserve strName(intCount). for each of the array variables.

Then as the intCount increases, it will allow the next element of the array to be set to it's value.

That will get it working 

A problem, when you instantiate the objReader you specify a File_Name but what if that file doesn't exist? You have no control at that point of If IO.File.Exists.

True,CJ_Productions,,,"Haha thanks. Hopefully I can explain this alright, but I'm not going to go into extreme detail:

1. Get Video Copilot's action essentials (there is a lot of pre-keyed footage like dust explosions, impacts of all sorts, and good textures like cracks.


2. Find a good dust element or dirt explosion and import the video as frames (cs6) or if you have cs5 or lower try to drag and drop the video file into your project and open the animation window so you can drag the timeline until you find a frame you want to use. Once you have a frame, you may need to rasterize the layer so you can erase some parts.  (And if you import the video as frames like I had to, when you find the layer you want, just drag and drop that layer into the main project)


3. Adjust the size to what looks appropriate. The first frame I modified was a powder hit. Only part I erased on that was around the center person. I think I adjusted the color as well but I'm pretty sure it already matched.


4. I repeated the process for other elements like a dirt explosion, only this was colored brown so I lowered the saturation quite a bit in order to match the concrete color. 

5. I added the ground crack and applied a 'vivid light' blend mode to get rid of the gray background and leave the black color, and then gave it a little Gaussian blur to better match the rest of the image.


Basically it's a lot of importing and adjusting/erasing with some color correction. ",0,1364496348,,0,1364497851,1,c945npe,t3_1b6kt6,t1_c945npe,t1_c945iw0,,1431733339,274,False,pics,t5_2qh0u,274

True,bigdickfox,,,"I was intrigued, at first.  As with all of my victims, there is a peripheral layer of curiosity, and some jealousy hidden between the cracks.  She was pretty, as most of them are, and she looked, ever so subtly, like an actress in a noir film.  With porcelain skin and cherry lips, I was drawn to her beacon of youthfulness that brought me towards shore, away from the vast oceans of my mind.  I hated her from the moment I saw her… in ways I had never hated before.

She stood at the corner of Lexington and Fifth Avenue when I saw her.  I, across the road waiting for my prescriptions to be filled, peaked out of the glass window as my eyes rose to meet the street lamp that intersected the avenue.  And below that light was my Grace Kelly.  As she stood with pursed lips, her eyes rose to meet mine then, abruptly, looked away again.  She thought nothing, I supposed.  My eyes wandered around her, sliding into a shallow trance.   I wondered what a woman so lovely was doing in this part of town.  I wondered how many broken hearts she had caused.  I wondered if she kept a spare key under the mat.

She began to move.  Her legs flicked out beneath her long skirt in handsome stride, and her body swayed like the heads daffodils in a gentle breeze.  A tap at the counter broke my concentration, and I quickly grabbed my bottles and headed for the door.  I followed her down Lexington in breathless anticipation.

As it was, this process was not veering of from my typical modus operandi just yet.  Find a young woman, follow her for week or so, and then rape and kill her.  Not any thing unique, but, at the time, I didn’t care about anything being unique.  The semantics were a non-issue; it was about satisfaction, and, perhaps, the power.  And, as she moved onwards in step with each cement block on the sidewalk, I imagined doing what most people believed was unimaginable to her petite frame.  I slinked along the opposite street, careful not to be seen.

To my surprise and disappointment, she headed into a coffee shop, and I followed her in.  See, this is where I started to depart from my previous set of rules; I couldn’t lose her.  At least I waited for her to have been in there a few minutes before I walked in and sat at a table far across from where she sat.  I looked towards her as she ordered, noticing the subtle sculpture of her collarbones and how her breasts and throat warmed to her blood.  A waitress approached me.  “Just a water,” I murmured.  “C’mon,” the waitress glared. “And a ham sandwich.”

The waitress departed and it was about that time that my Grace Kelly caught my gaze.  She looked back at me with those spectral blues and then, abruptly, gave me a small, qualified, smile.  It was in a way that I couldn’t help but smile back, obviously less radiantly, of course.  And there was another rule broken.  I quickly realized and looked down to my wallet, ruffling with it cash.  I had no money so I stood up.  She was standing in front of me.

“Are you going to eat?” She asked.

“I was just leaving.”

“I saw you come in,” She paused as I didn’t say anything, “you don’t just use a place for its seating and leave without giving it something in return.”  She smiled and sat down.  I contemplated and followed suit across from her, looking towards the limp filaments of blonde that nestled by her cheeks.

“Do you know me?” She asked.  Not in an interrogative sort of way, but in a warm familiar sort.

“No.  I don’t think so.”

“Oh.  I thought I saw you at Waltmire’s Drug earlier”

“I wasn’t there today.”  I lied.

She was sitting at the front most quarter of the chair with her back beautifully straight, wrists crossed on the table, playing with her watch while I, slumped over, fumbled for words.

I divulged that I had never felt so defenseless.

Her eyelashes flicked upwards from the watch.  “What do you mean?”

“Well, it’s odd being caught off guard like this.  I’m not very good with small talk.”

“Me either,” My guest said, “What’s your name?”

I made something up.

“I’m Marie.”

I saw her go for the watch again… I felt compelled by some strange conviction of socially normality to stop her.  “What do you do?”  I asked.

“I sing.  I was trained in opera, but now I’m looking for something less time demanding, although, there’s nothing in singing that really is.”  She laughed.  “I might just have to settle down, but I really do love singing.”  She paused for a moment, again.  “Are you married?” She asked with a soft demure.

I told her that I had been.  She asked why we were no longer together.  I said that she had died of acute liver failure, which was a lie.

“Oh I’m sorry for being overly cordial,” she said, “but you look terribly lonely.  You have sad eyes.”

She was right.  I was rather lonely.

“You know, my husband died overseas a year ago,” she looked at me with a fresh acuteness, “It never really goes away, but I feel like my children live on through him.”

She gave me a sad smile.  The waitress came with my ham sandwich, and she placed it down in front of me.  As my eyes moved up from Marie’s chest to her face, I noticed a glint of light.  An almost indistinguishable cross hung from her neck.  I asked her if she was religious.

“I am, I think.” She said. “I love Christ and I love life… I love life.”  She repeated in a sweet vacant melody… Almost as if she was saying it to no one in particular, trying to convince herself.

She stared out of the window into the street beside us.  She looked as if she was imagining herself there, waiting to be rebirthed by a passing car.  I had never noticed the sadness in her eyes before that.  It reminded me of my own mother.  I hated her for those eyes.  My brother told me that before my father died, my mother was never sad like that.

I asked her if God loved evil men.

“I’m not sure.  Maybe it’s true what they say about him,” She said, still looking out, “that he forgives no matter what.  That’s why I choose to believe it, but who knows what’s really out there.”

We exchanged a few other words.  She apologized at the end of all of it.  I told her that it was my pleasure, and I apologized for not being able to help her.  She looked confused as she strolled out of the shop, but smiled at me through the window as she passed.  I didn’t follow her.  I noticed the bag with “Waltmire” stained against the front on the side of my chair and chuckled.

When I got to my apartment, I didn’t think, I just swallowed all of the pills in the bottle.  Stepping across the puny, servant sized, room, I went to sit on the stiff leather sofa.  Full of vexation, I stared at the sharp curved edges of my knives.  I liked them.  I don’t think I will ever not like the feeling of the first incision.  I pulled the blade by the handle out of the satchel.  The cool handle felt familiar in my hand, homey.  I rolled it between my fingers before gripping it in a clenched fist and raised it up to my wrist.  I didn’t feel it, really… other than the blood dripping onto my hand.  It had this warm, marvelous feeling.  Maybe this was what I’d been waiting for; maybe this was my rebirth.  All of those girls were sad substitutes.  I wanted to tell them that I am sorry.  I wanted Marie to know that I was doing my best to give back, but she’ll never know, and it’s better that she doesn’t.

I’m getting very tired now.  Maybe it is true what they say about Him.

I was basically raised with the broken thought process that everyone else's needs are more important than my own, and the fastest way to resolve conflict is to immediately capitulate and let everyone else have their own way as fast as possible.  I doesn't mean you agree with them in an argument.  It merely means letting them think they've won as quickly as possible to get them to shut up and go away.

Beta?  More like Gamma.  I totally get it.  Doesn't matter, man or woman - if you're emotionally abused early in life, you're not going to walk away from it unscathed, and simply telling that person to ""grow a pair"" accomplishes nothing aside from re-inforcing the idea that they are flawed or somehow inadequate as people (although from what you're saying - that means they're getting the right message?).

I guess having come from that background I have sympathy for it.  That gets me into trouble around here too (and in related intarweb-places where these same people wind up being as well).

Long-winded way of saying I don't disagree with you, but namecalling fixes nothing, and never will.  /r/MR somehow expects the world to fix itself on their account from what I'm seeing, and that's never happening either.  The right answer is to address why they are capitulating, and then adapt to the world they're stuck living in whether they like it or not.

True,[deleted],,,"Free to have opinions, and you might not like his stuff, but he is incredibly talented at what he does. From a hip hop perspective, he has several classic albums already. Just read this

""Whaamo summed it up decently, but I'm just gonna add some stuff anyways, cause as a hip hop fan I always enjoyed his music, but it took me a while to come around to why Kanye is going to be remembered as one of the greatest artists of this generation.

Every time he puts out an album he literally changes the face of hip-hop, and to an extent popular music as a whole.

The College Dropout, his first album, was one of the first to unify the underground and mainstream hip hop sound since the days of De La Soul, or Wu-Tang. It appealed to everyone, pop fans, hipsters, the ghetto, the middle class. At the time of its release, the music dominating the charts was the kind people think of when they talk about how they don't like rap...50 Cent, Eminem right at the time he was getting really bad, and the like. College Dropout helped change a lot of that and brought rappers like Lupe Fiasco and Common into the pop charts. It's poppy yet still personal, along the lines of a mid-period Beatles album. Stuff like that doesn't come around very often. Compare this and this and tell me they're the same thing. Late Registration started bringing in more orchestral sounds, making his music grander and more important-sounding. It's also really good, but as you're about to see, it's more of a transition album for him. Graduation is where we really start to see direct influence on today's music. ""Stronger,"" (you know, the Daft Punk sampling one) really kicked off the trend of mixing hip-hop and electronic which is all over the charts today. David Guetta, that Flo Rida song, all that stuff is directly from Graduation, and I'm of the opinion that a lot of EDM's mainstream popularity today is in part due to that album.


""Now hold up, cranestyles,"" you might say, ""all the stuff you're mentioning is crap. Kanye is indirectly responsible for David Guetta? Fuck that noise. Why is this good?""


Yes. All this stuff I'm mentioning is pretty crap, but Kanye does it really well and the amount of imitators something has often tends to be proportional to how good it is. A lot of shitty bands tried to copy the Beatles, a lot tried to copy Neutral Milk Hotel, and a lot of it was crap but it doesn't make the original any less genius. Kanye's first three albums are seriously solid pieces of hip hop, chronicling the rise of him as a rapper in a very personal way. I guess I neglected that, but seriously, Dropout is about being younger, poor, and struggling, Late Registration is the celebratory album, with darker hints creeping in at points like ""Diamonds From Sierra Leone,"" a song about the bling rappers sport so proudly coming from African oppression and genocide. Graduation gets even more soul-searching.

But strap the fuck in, cause you ain't seen nothin' yet.
808s and Heartbreak is a weird anomaly. It's probably his weakest album, but by far his most influential. Released after the death of his mother and a bad breakup with his longtime girlfriend, it's a stark, minimalistic affair to a degree not usually seen in pop music (noticing a trend here?). The sad R&amp;B rap thing you see today? Rappers talking about their weaknesses, their flaws? All of that, all of that, is straight from 808s. Drake? Post-808s. Kid Cudi? Wouldn't be possible without it. The Weeknd, Frank Ocean, all of that is post-808s music.

And then he released My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy.
Seriously, if you take one thing from this long and completely unnecessary diatribe, go listen to that album all the way through. It's an amazing reflection on celebrity, loneliness, drowning yourself in drugs and women to numb the pain, all that fun stuff. It is, for my money, going to be remembered as the definitive album of the last decade. It's not just good for pop music, it's good music, period. Who else would do a 9-minute long song where 3/4 of it is just piano and vocoder moaning? Or sample aphex twin? On the biggest, most hyped rap album of the year? You don't get innovation and pop success like that unless you're someone truly special.
And i realize this is long as fuck, but here's a short other thing. If he didn't rap, he would still be remembered among hip hop fans as one of the greatest producers of the decade. You ever hear songs with those sped up soul vocals? That's all him and once he started doing that, so did everyone else. Electronic/rap fusion, as stated? All him. Giant orchestral epic raps about fame sucking? Kanye did it first and best. And this is just what he did on his own albums. Before he did that he produced half of The Blueprint, Jay-z's most critically adored album, as well as Beyonce, TI, Ludacris, Alicia Keys, countless others.""

True,basquefire,,,"&gt;If I acquire the signatures and obtain substitute credits are they listed individually on the Reed transcript?

No. You will get transfer credits, and they will be listed at the bottom of your transcript as in the image I posted, and your requirements will be fulfilled - that is, you will not have to take an equivalent of that class.

Auditing works as follows: Ask a teacher to audit a course. Most teachers are game, as long as the class isn't packed already. You'll be expected to attend all classes, do all homework, and otherwise behave as an enrolled student - but you will earn no credit, and it will not be listed on your academic transcript. Non-Reed students can audit courses for a small fee: $100/semester. 

If you're already enrolled and paying tuition, there is little advantage to auditing a course. It does, however, offer really hardcore students the opportunity to do in-depth learning in a hobby subject. If their enrolled workloads get too hairy, they can bow out late in the semester without a ""withdraw"" mark on their transcripts. It also offers non-students the chance to take Reed courses for cheap.

If students demonstrate proficiency in audited classes, professors are quite likely to waive prerequisites for higher-level courses. For instance: I audited Chinese 110 during, and I was granted enrollment in Chinese 210 the following year even though I have no credit for the prerequisite class (CHN110). I audited during my gap year: I had been accepted, but I didn't plan to matriculate until the following year. I paid only $200, and for an entire year I learned Chinese at the same pace as everyone else. When I matriculated the following fall, my professor ran me through a placement test as a refresher, but it mostly a formality - he knew my skill level because he'd taught me for an entire year.

In your case, auditing would be incredibly useful. In fact, I think that learning to do things ""The Reed Way"" is so critical to being a good conference participant that I'd encourage you to formally enroll in foundational courses rather than just auditing them. You might as well earn the credit.

I'm under the impression that graduating ""on time"" is far less common at Reed than it is at other universities. Burning out, fucking up, and freaking out are well within Reed's bounds of normalcy. Pretty much everyone I know who has graduated from Reed experienced some sort of setback or crisis, usually during Junior or Senior year when shit gets tough.

True,darnok123,,,"Just to clarify, I use a Sidereal zodiac and ancient techniques.

Your chart does show problems in relationships in general due to the nocturnal malefic, Mars, placed in the 7th house.  The lord of the 7th, Jupiter, isn't too badly-placed in the 9th but Mercury is carrying the nature of Mars towards him.

Mars in the 7th shows the immediate manifestations of your relationships and him being out-of-sect in the 7th suggests that the men (or women) you seek or seek you are Martial in nature.  This can range from being athletic, working for the police or army or just having red-hair and square face.  It really is that broad.  With Mercury opposed to him, it does show cross words and arguments.  Mars also rules the 3rd house which, in ancient astrology, generally shows those people close to you but who are not immediately related (like neighbours and friends), so yes, it is suggested in your chart that you will have trouble in your relationships with friends.

Jupiter lords the house, so the outcome of this aspect of life is his responsibility.  He is placed in the 9th and without any difficult aspects from a malefic.  He suggests you would be better focusing on foreigners, or particuarly learned people, perhaps religious, rather than the Martial men, as he will give you more joy.

It is not as clear-cut as this though, and both planets will colour the people you are in relationships with.

This will prove to be a theme of your life in general but there will be times where it is intensified and this is due to which planet is taking over the rulership of your life at certain times.  Basically since March 2009 you have had Mercury as main time-lord with Saturn, then Mars, then Moon, then Jupiter and then Venus partnering.  Mercury is your ASC lord and each of these planets has some say in your relationship matters hence this intensification since then.  Added to this, the profected DSC has been in the signs of Jupiter and Saturn for the last 4 years (Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius and Pisces) further intensifying the situation.

So, as I said, the theme will be a constant one but it just so happens that this period is extra intense due to the broad time-lords and the annual ones agreeing with each other.  I did not look at the Solar Revolutions as this would be too time-consuming for me but I would wager that Mars will be doing something either with the profected DSC or the lord of that sign.

EDIT:  Sorry, I should have mentioned that this should ease off now as you move towards your next birthday since the broader time-lords are changing.  Be aware though that Mars is taking up the annual time-lord for your relationships.  Be careful of those Martial people.

EDIT: I realized I never actually explained what a bioethicist actually is. It's not a very defined title as far as I can determine and the work is performed by people with a multitude of backgrounds. You are the person that helps people make living wills or help hospitals/families determine what the will actually mean. Imagine this scenario: Man is admitted to the hospital after an accident and he's in a coma. The wife says that he wouldn't want to be kept alive if he was overly dependent upon machines and/or there was a good chance of recovery. Here are the issues you would help answer: How can you be sure those are is wishes, what is meant by overly dependent, and what is meant by good chance of recovery. Each of those leads to other questions that neither families or hospitals are comfortable making. There are also many other issues that arise as technology grows faster than medical law. The implications for genetic testing and reproduction alone are staggering.

To Actually answer the OP's question.

When you have a decade of warfare against a superior force (USSR), and someone(USA) starts sending guns and STINGERs to religious warriors, you kinda set the stage for religious warriors to be in power.

Once the superior force has been defeated by the smaller, but heavily armed, guerrilla force of religious zealots, when you refuse to spend *just a tiny bit more money* to build some fucking schools, you leave a generation in the hands of extremists.

When the youth are growing up without a stable government, without an education beyond religious education, when they are hero-worshiping religious warriors and martyrs, and when their greatest ally consigns them to poverty and ignorance, they leap to install a government of their religion. Any chance for peace and stability, any chance for an escape from poverty.

And now because a nation decided to wage a proxy war and damn the consequences, you've set the stage for a corrupt and extremist theocracy.

This would have happened with any religion, the symptoms would have been different, but the shattered country would have looked much the same. Afghanistan is what happens when you put political games before people.

True,InfinitelyThirsting,female,,"Ah, okay. You first asked a why question, didn't realise you switched to a how.

""Oh that sucks"" and ""I'm sorry"" and similar things are good to repeat while they're telling the story of whatever is wrong. Try not to get them to leap ahead. While venting, tangents on minor details can help, because verbalizing can make you realise what is and isn't inconsequential; thinking out loud is definitely a thing. So don't be surprised or grumpy if it doesn't seem to make sense and she's jumping around in time.

And then, most importantly, instead of suggesting what you think she should do, ask her what she's going to do about it. Affirm anything that makes sense. If something seems really out of whack, ask if she's sure that would be a good idea. But don't make any suggestions unless she asks, or says she's unsure. And if you do make a suggestion, phrase it as a suggestion, a possibility--""Maybe you could x?"" rather than ""You should x."" That implies a respect for her ability to make decisions and think of solutions, if you suggest it as a possibility. 

And if it is a problem with no real solution, just say you're sorry for her, that you're there if she needs anything, that you wouldn't know what to do either, etc. An example would be... a really mean boss. She can't afford to quit. She can't make a scene at work. Hopefully she's looking for a new job, but she can't just pull one out of her ass. So in the meantime, she'll need to vent about her mean boss, so that she doesn't get herself fired by exploding at work. Until she finds another job, there's no solution to be had, and the feelings don't go away just because she's still looking for one. Telling her to get another job doesn't help anything; listening to her and validating her does, because it settles the emotional state and vents off stress.

I'd love to see more men deal with emotional stress like women do, honestly. The male suicide rate is four times higher than women's for a reason. Just ""manning up"" and pretending it doesn't exist doesn't work for a lot of people. I don't think women are superiour, but I think venting is psychologically healthy, for the most part. So long as it's venting, and not dwelling or obsessing; that's just as unhealthy as ignoring it.",0,1364526056,,0,False,1,c94f6ho,t3_1b7ap0,t1_c94f6ho,t1_c94exhb,,1431743922,46,False,AskMen,t5_2s30g,46

I was what you'd call a ""problem child"", always in trouble at school, literally in the principals office every single day. I did exceptionally well in my work, but I quite simply did NOT like being told what to do by the teacher. 

""Why are we doing fractions AGAIN today? They're so easy! I'll just draw or fiddle with my pencil or something."" Of course, this lead to me being reprimanded, which almost always triggered tears or a temper tantrum from little 8-year old LoneLobo. I didn't WANT for things to be this way- I was a bright, curious, but also sensitive and misunderstood little boy. Teachers flagged me as ""ADHD"", and ""Behaviorally challenged"". I had very few friends, and was, for the most part, a miserable little child.

Until I got that N64. Oh man. Ooooh man. The feeling I got that Christmas morning; my family tells me now that it was just like the video where the two kids frantically open an N64 whilst screaming. Suddenly I wasn't talking in class. I wasn't bored in class. I was thinking how I'd beat StarFox64 for the hundredth time that night, how I'd get the last  music notes from Rusty Bucket Bay, but mostly, my mind was consumed by OoT.

We moved the summer before I went into 5th grade. I had no friends. I was alone and scared and even more miserable than before. Looking back, I remember now being a 5th grader and contemplating suicide, pretty fucked up. Anyway, school starts, I meet people here and there, but overall I just felt out of place. But one day, I hear a conversation.

""Yeah man, I spent like 4 hours trying to beat it last night, it's just too hard""
""You have to change the water levels a bunch or something, I can ask if my brother will look up cheat codes for it?""
""Its just a stupid water temple, why is it so hard anyways?""

True,rorydaniel,11,,"Rob Kerr had an interesting rant on the FAN960 this morning about how the Flames are percieved by media outside the city. Anyone who watches TSN can see that we're not exactly the favourite team over there. Apparently it in part has to do with the fact that we have a history of not leaking things to sources. Now if you put that in the context of what happened yesterday there's no surprise they're trying to throw Feaster under the bus. Honestly? I'm glad he doesn't back down to media pressure. It's aggravating as a fan to not know but it shows he has some balls. 

Now as for if we got robbed. No matter what we got for Iggy its not going to be enough. I would never suggest we won the trade, and nobody would. However as you said Iggy is a pure rental player. Teams are reluctant to give up their first picks because its such a deep draft. Lots of comparisons to 2003 when Corey Perry was picked at 28. I also speculate that nobody on the TSN staff has seen these guys play, and neither have I. I've been reading about them all day and from what I gather it's an okay move. Hockeys future says Agostino reminds them of Ryan Callahan, and will at the worst be a third pairing guy. This Hanowski is a bit of a wild car but he's a bit older and has great size. Even if one of these guys reaches their potential I'm more then happy with a Ryan Callahan + First for Iggy at this stage. They're being written off cause they're ""a couple college kids"" and aren't well known. Well Curtis Glencross wasn't well known either and followed a very similar path.

I deployed in 08' to Iraq and not too big of a deal hit a couple IED's but made it home safe. then in 10' I was deployed to Afghanistan, I made it to month 10 and hit a dismount IED and woke up mid-medevac. I had to have back surgery and do a lot of healing all over and still  in quiet a bit of pain. I frequently have night terrors(talking screaming in my sleep) and driving and large groups send me in to fight or flight mode so I do my best to avoid them. I'd have to say my worst memory was seeing my squad leader die, he was always the man I strived to be. Seeing him die really hit home that no one is invincible and if he could die than I could too at any time. What made it worse was as the senior team leader I had to take his place.

True,[deleted],,,"If you want this change to become permanent, I suggest counseling. Your university probably has a free counseling center and I am so, so recommending you go to them. There is a root cause to your drinking. Psychedelics have given you a push in the right direction away from whatever was causing you to drink habitually. However, negative thought processes can reel you back in with enough time, so it's very important to talk to a counselor so that they can stabilize this change in your mindset! 

It's kinda like being on a diet. A lot of people try crash diets and they do lose weight, they get on the path to being healthy, but whatever was causing them to overeat or lead an unhealthy lifestyle eventually reels them back in and they lose all the progress they made. What helps people lose weight permanently is a total change of mindset--totally changing the way they look at their lifestyle, what they're eating, how much they're exercising, etc. And this, my friend, takes a lot of work, a lot of self-reflection, which is what counseling can provide.

A little push in the right direction is not enough for a permanent change, but it's enough to get you to see what you're doing to yourself and to give you the freedom *to make* a permanent change. Take this opportunity that has been granted to you and visit a counselor so you don't fall back into old habits. A counselor will give you the tools you need to keep yourself from relapsing.

True,jaki_cold,,,"Alcohol is a shit-tier drug, for a variety of reasons.

You can't gain anything from the experience, except perhaps the social capital that comes from socializing or getting laid when intoxicated. There are no revelations, no introspective thoughts, no altered perceptions. It's ultimately benign, completely non-threatening to the current social order. 

In addition, when compared to other drugs that heighten the social experience, such as MDMA, it still doesn't stand out. The social atmosphere of a party where most people are intoxicated with alcohol is brutish, dulled, and antagonistic. You're all individuals, but you're all in competition. Your ego takes over, you're acting on behalf of your Self, furthering your own interests. It takes a social situation and turns all of the participants into anti-social sycophants. MDMA, on the other hand, increases your self-awareness. You know how you're affecting others emotionally and physically with your actions. You become more mindful, more empathetic, more pro-social. The social atmosphere is one of cooperation, of serving everyone's needs rather than just your own.

Once you've tried LSD, a drug that allows you to tear down your assumptions about reality, society, social hierarchies, everything that affects you, all of your systems of thought - you can't really find as much enjoyment in alcohol. It just seems like such a hollow drug. No substance, just impairment, almost a de-evolution to an egoistic, primal state.

Just like a talented Highschool Baseball player would be traveling to Japan and teaching baseball to corporate adults.  Meanwhile, back home a professional baseball players would be like,  ""WTF?""

True,khalidalakoozi,,,"Quick summary of what happened, by an Afghan

1960's Zahir Shah: king of Afghanistan, great ruler, modernized the country, had enmity with his cousin and brother-in-law Dauod Khan. His reign is regarded by Afghans as the best government we've had in modern history

1970's Daoud Khan: Daoud overthrows Zahir Shah with the help of the PDPA (People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan, bloody communists). Daoud Khan begins to distance himself from the Soviet Union and realign the country to become a Western-style republic. (Free trade, capitalism, representative democracy etc.) Communists don't like this and begin to put the pressure on Daoud Khan. Daoud Khan uses his intelligence service to kill leading communists, including Mir Khyber, one of the leading ideologues of the PDPA. This results in a massive show of communist unity during Khyber's funeral. Daoud Khan attempts to suppress the communist leaders (Taraki, Karmal, Amin) but is too slow and Amin, under house arrest, begins to order battalions loyal to the PDPA in the Afghan army to overthrow Daoud Khan's republic.

1980's Saur Revolution: The Communist revolution occurs and the Soviet Union achieves dominance in Afghan internal affairs. The Russians had won the ""Great Game"", the never ending conflict between the West and Russia for influence in Afghanistan. Communists begin to implement land reform, state atheism, and mass killing of dissenters. Afghans aren't too fond of any of these measures and begin rise against the government. The PDPA begins to undergo violent internal power struggles. Taraki, the first leader, is assassinated by Amin (apparently Amin did the act himself, put a pillow over him while he was sleeping). Amin is assassinated by the Soviet Special Forces (Spetsnaz). Soviet Union invades to restore law and order and to install Karmal as the new leader. Karmal fails to produce results and is replaced by Najibullah, the former leader of the KhAD (Khedamat etelaati dawlat, State Intelligence Service). Najib proves to be a competent leader and the Mujahideen begin to lose traction in their war against the state. He begins a ""National Reconciliation"" program, in an attempt to end the insurgency against his government. He renounces atheism and promises to bring peace to Afghanistan. Najib is a very complicated figure in today's Afghanistan, as many see him as a national hero due to his efforts.

Enter the US and Pakistan: The US begins to provide military aid through Pakistan to the various mujahideen groups fighting the Soviet invasion. The mujahideen begin to turn the war around when they acquire a new weapon, the ""Stinger"", which ends Soviet air supremacy.
The Soviets decide to withdraw from Afghanistan, while providing Najib with massive amounts of aid to prop up his government. The Soviets withdraw and the Mujahideen relish their victory, with American money and weapons. They now attempt to topple the government. Although Najib is able to support his government until 1992, it topples when the money dries up and the Soviet Union collapses.

Afghan Civil War 1990's - American interest in Afghanistan dies out when the Soviet Union collapses. The various Mujahideen groups from different ethnic groups within Afghanistan gather in Peshawar, Pakistan, to establish a new Afghan government. Pakistan, specifically the ISI (Inter-services intelligence) want the Afghan government to be run by a lackey, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, the leader of Hezb-e-Islami. Pakistan does not want to see a strong, united Afghanistan for two reasons. 1: Afghanistan has never recognized the border between the two nations, and Pakistan fears that it may one day claim the Pashtun areas within Pakistan. 2: Pakistan wants a friendly government inside Afghanistan so that it won't be faced with two fronts in a war with India. Pakistan would be trapped in the middle. This is known as ""stragetic depth"". Pakistan urges Hekmatyar to ignore the Peshawar Accord and establish his own government. War breaks out between Hekmatyar and the other mujahideen groups, known in the West as the Northern Alliance. In his thirst for power, Hekmatyar destroys the city of Kabul using rockets supplied by the Pakistanis. Total anarchy breaks out, mass killings, rapes, torture, violence etc. etc. 

1996 - The Taliban, the ""students"", come unto the scene. The leader of the Taliban is ""Mullah Omar"", a mysterious one-eyed mullah who fought in the Soviet war. Pakistan sees their chance at complete dominance within Afghanistan and begin to massively support the Taliban with manpower, weapons, supplies, and funds. The Taliban begin to take over vast swaths of Afghanistan with the help of Pakistani forces. It is estimated that 70 percent of the Taliban army were actually Pakistani nationals. Hekmatyar submits to the Taliban (on orders from Pakistan) The Northern Alliance fight back but they are largely besieged until 9/11. The Americans come in and with large American air power the Northern Alliance is able to defeat the Taliban.

Present - War rages on as the Taliban fight an insurgency against the Afghan government and the foreign troops helping Afghanistan. The Taliban is still supported by Pakistan, with both material funds and sanctuaries for them to live in peace. Pakistan can crush the Taliban in two days but is unwilling because the present Afghan government is anti-Pakistan and pro-India. (I don't blame them) Although Afghanistan went through 30 years of devastation, we are currently rebuilding and the changes are pretty visible if you visit Afghanistan. Afghanistan's economy has tripled in ten years, its age expectancy is at 64 (from a low of 40 during the war), and the social fabric that was ripped apart is slowly starting to rebuild as refugees come back into the country.

Historical lesson - Religion didn't destroy Afghanistan. Foreign interests did. Never let foreigners fuck with your country, they do not care about you.

Present solution - Pressure the Pakistanis financially to stop supporting the Taliban and to crush the sanctuaries. This is currently an ongoing process and is familiar to anyone following the news.

To OP: This is how it happened, let's hope it never happens again

**EDIT**: Thanks for the Reddit Gold, I really appreciate it. When it comes to religious fundamentalism, every single country on Earth has fundamentalists who believe their ideology is perfect and that if it were implemented it would result in heaven on Earth. The fundamentalists succeeded in Afghanistan, but in my opinion it can happen anywhere. Even in the States if evangelical fundamentalism continues to rise. Thus, the state should counter fundamentalism in every respect, while continuing to respect the religious inclinations of the people. But, ultimately I stand by my point, if foreigners didn't support the fundamentalists in Afghanistan, they would have never succeeded. Most Afghans follow moderate Islam, with many belonging to Sufi (mystical) sects that reject jihad against civilians. We can end this war, but first we need to end the foreign support for fundamentalists within Afghanistan. 

I live in Kabul and I have never left, I was about 6 when the Taliban took over. The future course for Afghanistan will affect me tremendously, and I can only hope that the country will pull through. When I leave my house in the morning to head to university, I am filled with immense pride when I see girls going to school, businesses opening up shop everywhere, and smiles returning to the faces of the Afghan people. The first image that OP uploaded is slowly returning to the streets of Afghanistan, and I hope the international community will help us as we go forward.

True,computanti,,"Sexy, sexy logical fallacies.","Accountant here. I've studied the financial crisis pretty well in my graduate studies, undergraduate studies, and just in my free time. Things like this fascinate me. I wanted to respond to several comments, but thought I'd just make one post, and address a few things. I'm also late to the thread so maybe this won't ever be seen.

&gt; The conclusion I draw from it is basically that the loans banks were granting were largely fraudulent, and they pretty much ignored all the huge red flags in the audit results. [Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/1b7jwg/i_keep_hearing_people_ask_why_nobody_is_in_jail/c94f5v8)

This is half-true. There are a few inaccuracies, which are common misconceptions. First, the investment banks weren't the ones who originated the loans. They bought them from loan originators, most of whom went out of business in one way or another. This is important, because it's part of where the problem came from. Since the originators were just selling off the loans, they had no incentive to lend to borrowers who would ever pay the loans back. 

The second inaccuracy (and this is common also) is about the red flags in the audit results. Auditors aren't hired to detect fraud. Occasionally they do find it, but that's not their main goal. Their main goal is to make sure that the financial statements released by a company are free of material misstatements and follow Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Under U.S. GAAP, investments like these are recorded on the books at fair market value. The issue is that when there either a) isn't a liquid market or b) the market is in a bubble the values on the books can be pretty far off from what they'd be worth in a liquidation situation. Once the banks started realizing what was going on and started selling, it was like a fire sale. Prices were essentially ""whatever we can get for it so it gets off our books."" This is what caused the massive writeoffs.

&gt;Then they packaged and resold the loans anyways, telling the buyers that due diligence had been performed. That's fraud.

It's not the seller's responsibility to do due diligence, it's the buyer's responsibility. There are disclosure rules, but since these securities were being sold to other institutional investors, there wasn't a whole lot of disclosure required. It's also not fraud. Fraud has a very specific definition under U.S. law and it's one of the most difficult things to prove in a criminal case. More on that later.

&gt;I think part of the problem is the lack of investigation into specifically who is to blame.
Or perhaps there has been an investigation and it only turned up a handful of individuals; then the question becomes ""does it make sense to destroy these half dozen people when we know they were not alone and could not be blamed for the entire global crisis""? [Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/1b7jwg/i_keep_hearing_people_ask_why_nobody_is_in_jail/c94cjiq)

There's been a LOT of investigation by the SEC, DOJ, Congressional Committees, etc. 

&gt;This is a great question, I really hope to see some deserving answers from people who accept the premise (that specific people should be in jail for actions related to the crisis). [Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/1b7jwg/i_keep_hearing_people_ask_why_nobody_is_in_jail/c94dakw)

Herein lies the problem with prosecution. We all may *believe* that some law was broken. Heck, we probably *know* that some law was broken. However, of the things that caused the subprime crisis, 99.9% (totally made up statistic) was very much legal and within accounting rules. Of the 0.1% where a law was broken, the problem becomes *proof*. Fraud is probably the most common thing people want to see the Wall Streeters convicted of. However, fraud is incredibly difficult to prove. If you dig around, there have been a great number of people who have been convicted in **civil** matters, but not many in **criminal** matters. This is because the burden of proof that the US Government (via the SEC) has to prove is significantly lower for civil cases than for criminal cases. For a criminal fraud case, you have to prove *intent* and that's very difficult to do unless you've got an email saying, ""Man, I can't believe these schmucks are buying these worthless piles of shit for almost 100 cents on the dollar. It's like taking candy from a baby."" Even if you had an email like that, it's still incredibly difficult to prove what the *intent* was.

Finally, it's difficult to pinpoint who caused what. You could argue that low interest rates set by the Federal Reserve in the late 90's contributed. You could say that ""The American Dream"" of being a home owner contributed. It's pretty evident that lax lending standards, buying and selling complex securities that only a handful of people in the world understand, dumb borrowers who didn't bat an eyelash when they were offered a $300k mortgage on their $24k per year salary, and the lack of oversight all contributed. It's a complicated thing. If anyone's interested I can recommend a few books, movies and documentaries if you're interested in more information.
 

**EDIT** Book/movie/documentary recommendations (in no particular order):

* [*The Big Short*](http://amzn.com/B00ANYJ3NI) by Michael Lewis - Very easy to read, and show the crisis from the side of the guys who made a ton of money from it. Also you should read his book *Liar's Poker* about the bond markets in the 80's.
* [Margin Call](http://amzn.com/B006O2QNOU) - Great movie that shows the crisis from inside one of the big trading firms. I believe it's based on JP Morgan. You can stream this for free if you're an Amazon Prime member.
* [Too Big To Fail](http://amzn.com/B0089DWJ9K) - Fantastic movie based on Andrew Ross Sorkin's book. This shows the reaction from the perspective of U.S. Treasury Secretary. Very well written, very accurate, and the acting is also very good.
* [*Too Big to Fail*](http://amzn.com/0143120271) by Andrew Ross Sorkin. Sorkin is one of the writers for the financial blog *DealBook* for the NYT. This book is a little more in-depth and not quite as easy to read as Michael Lewis' book, but it's still very accessible. 
* [Inside Job](http://amzn.com/B004NOCCEG) - Documentary narrated by Matt Damon. This one discusses how the crisis affected different countries. It starts in a small town in remote Iceland. Very good, though it comes off as being a little bit of a 'conspiracy' type documentary at times. 
* [Any of the Frontline stuff](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/business-economy-financial-crisis/) - I specifically recommend *Money, Power and Wall Street*, *The Warning*, and *The Untouchables*.


There are others, but those are the ones I typically recommend to people.

True,[deleted],,,"I like it, though there's a few things that have been a little frustrating.  

The mirror alignment arrived completely off and tweaking that took some trial and error.  

The bed jack (for raising and lowering the bed) is four threaded rods with gears on them and a timing belt that is supposed to drive three of them when you turn the other.  This works terribly and the belt slipped whenever I tried to use it.  So I printed knobs for the other three threaded rods and just level it like the bed of the 3D printer.

The honeycomb table is junk.  Look on instructables for alternatives.

The software is the part I'm trying to figure out now.  I'm sure I'm doing it wrong but when I try to engrave and then cut, the origin for the two operations is different and so the cuts aren't aligned with the engrave the way they're supposed to be.

As far as smoke and smell, even with the exhaust to the window and an additional blower added on the window side ([I used this one](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000O8D0IC/ref=wms_ohs_product?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)) I can still smell the burned wood or vaporized acrylic in the room.  The wood isn't too bad but acrylic smells like someone jammed a tube of super glue up your nose.  It's awful.  I'm still trying to figure out if the smell is coming back in the window or managing to leak out of the laser before the exhaust system captures it.

With all of that said, I'm still pleased with the laser overall.  I knew I wasn't getting an Epilog but then I paid like 1/3 or 1/4 what the similar Epilog costs.

True,Compungido,,,"Reddit

I've been ""reading"" it for two weeks, and I created my username a few days ago. You guys are all crazy and I'm really enjoying the experience, but I do not understand anything:

- my first comment got almost 1000 points and lots of answers. I thought: waw, this is easy. My following comments didn't reach the 10 points barrier.

- english is not my native language. I can read books, watch movies, talk to people, etc without using a dictionary. When I am in Reddit, I need the dictionary every 10 seconds. And the words I look up are never there. Which is the official language here?

- there are so many acronyms that I think Reddit is on its way to create a new language. I have printed the list of most used acronyms and now I always carry it with me, just in case.

- the questions asked here are always very very strange. Questions are 99% of the time related to 'how was it before', 'what would you like to be', 'what is that thing that doesn't let you sleep', etc Haven't seen a single question that I've been asked before in ""real"" life.

- usernames: if they are a representation of the (english speaking) world, we are fucked up.

- why do you talk so much about homosexuality and god and atheism? Is that really part of your daily lifes? I think I haven't talk about religion with anybody for the past 20 years of my life... I guess that's a US thing.

- memes: I understand you like to use over and over the same image and place funny/interesting/stupid words on them. But I think it would be faster and more practical to publish memes the following way: image: kid with fist - text: I'm finally starting to understand Reddit

- novelty names that have been created long time ago... How do those people sleep? They must be so nervous waiting for the day when they will be able to use it...

I don't go through red lights in the town area. Period. Not worth trying to cross over several lanes, worrying that some idiot is speeding and doesn't see me. I take those 2 minutes and have a sip of water, stretch my arms, and relax. 

I'll make a right turn on red, or once in a while go straight *after a stop* if there's a red light on a road outside of town. That is, I treat them as if they were stop signs. 

At stop signs, I'll slow down and make a right, or I'll slow down and cruise through *only if I can see the entire intersection.* Since I live in the burbs, I don't have to worry about traffic as much, and most of the roads allow me a clear view to see if anyone is coming.

True,Skika,randal,,"Real talk for a second; an even prouder moment will be when you lose weight and your son doesn't have to grow up with an overweight father. He instead grows up with a father than can go running, hiking, play sports with him. He then turns into an adult, with lots of awesome memories about a healthy father, instead of having to nag his father to get his cholesterol checked. Not having to worry about dad having a heart attack. Not have to worry about dad being depressed because of his weight.

That being said, no stranger should be so disrespectful as to say that out loud to someone. I tell my overweight friends they need to lose weight because I care. I don't say it in a mean way. But I don't tell random strangers they need to lose weight.

I'm not trolling here, promise. I genuinely care about the health of people, and would love for you to be a healthy dad for your son. 

PS The guy who linked to the article of being overweight and living longer, that is complete shit. BMI should not be used to judge health. It's a terrible scale, and true health care workers understand this. BMI is based on weight alone. It doesn't take into account muscle mass, bone mass, HDL, LDL, cholesterol, blood pressure, etc. It's just a chart. According to that measurement, I am overweight also. But being 23 years old, weighing 195 and being 6'2"", I reeeeally don't feel overweight. Best wishes to you!

* Dude2 makes a post in IAmA claiming he can prove Olive Garden ticket is faked by Olive Garden, and further claims to be an astroturfing guy sent to destroy reddit. Get upvoted to the top of the front page.

* Reddit, keeping a super cool head and carefully following [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette), waits patiently for proof that the receipt is fake and doesn't start any shit at all. NAW, I'm just fucking with you! In normal Reddit fashion everyone grabs their pitchforks without any actual proof that the receipt is fake and starts mass downvoting Dude1. They further start real life shit because that's clearly the right thing to do because only the Devil or Jesus (whichever you hate more) would post a picture of a fake receipt.

* After Reddit gets done smashing Dude1 a new asshole, it becomes abundantly clear that the Dude1 *did* have his house burn down, really did have a comped meal at Olive Garden, and posted it because he thought it was a nice thing that they had done. There's even an admin post(yes ADMIN, not MOD, **ADMIN**) about how Dude1 is legit and that Dude2 is full of shit. He also politely points out that, ""Ya dun goofed you dumb motherfuckers and you should stop flaming poor Dude1 on your blogs.""

* Dude2's post is removed by the Mods and thing settle down, I guess. 

* Reddit feels like they did the right thing. They totally avoided harassing a poor guy and his family, and totally were helping rid Reddit of corporate astroturfing by not being super reactionary and totally thought everything through. (That's at least how we're remembering it because it didn't happen the exact opposite of that at ALL! No sir.) Which of course is the right thing to do because who wants to see some poor guy get harassed?

True,Ken_Thomas,,,"I started experimenting with brimmed hats (the ones I wear aren't technically 'fedoras') after I had laser eye surgery about a decade ago.

Best decision I ever made (the surgery, I mean - not the hats) but I had a real problem with sunlight from the sides. Hard to explain, but it kind of dazzles you, like when someone is shining a bright flashlight into your eyes. Baseball-type caps didn't offer enough coverage to shade the sides, so I tried a brimmed hat, it helped a lot, and I stuck with it.

After awhile it just starts to make more sense. If you're going to wear a hat, why just shade your face? The brim offers better sun protection for your face, ears and neck, and oilskin hats like I prefer, also offer much better protection when it's raining.

Pic: http://i.imgur.com/K306pV8.jpg

**EDIT**: I probably should have mentioned that it helps when you're old and grizzled.

**EDIT2**: So many questions.

1. Yeah, it's me in the photo.
2. I'm an (avid) amateur wildlife/photographer and I was just out hiking when a friend took that. I think we were in the Linville Gorge Wilderness.
3. The hat is a Madison River model from Outback Trading Company.
4. I like oilskin hats because they're waterproof, but also because it makes them heavier and softer. They sit better on your head.
5. I usually smoke a pipe, but it's not convenient when you're out walking around, so I switch to cigars. I prefer Old Reliables by Marsh Wheeling. (Don't smoke, kids - I only do it because it makes me look more mature.)
6. The best advice I can give is to go to a store where they sell a lot of hats, and try a bunch on until you find the right dimensions to fit your head. By dimensions I don't mean size - I mean width of brim (2.5 to 3 inches in my case) height of the crown (4 inches in my case) and shape of the crown (teardrop for me). Once you know what works for you, get different hats for different activities, but stick with that style.
7. If you're thinking about LASIK, don't let my story stop you. The technology has come a long way in the decade since I got it, and I understand the 'flares' issue has largely been resolved.

**EDIT3**: I don't normally like pimping my little (largely defunct) website on Reddit, but some people are linking to it in the comments, so I guess I might as well.  
[This is my favorite hat story](http://kenthomas.us/?p=2451), and explains why me and my friends started referring to my headgear as ""Danger Hats"".  
[This is kind of a Hat FAQ](http://kenthomas.us/?p=2500). It may help answer some of the questions I'm not getting to.

**EDIT4**: Sunglasses. Sorry, guys. It's a cheap pair of glacier glasses (with the side shields removed) that (I think) I picked up in a gift shop somewhere in Montana after I broke the pair I brought with me. That was in 2006. They don't even have a name or logo on them, but they offer good coverage and they're polarized, so I still use them sometimes for winter hiking. My son tells me they have a Steampunk look to them.

Smoking. The ""makes me look more mature"" thing was a joke. When I was young ""I only smoke because it makes me look more mature"" was sort of a standard running gag, making fun of girls who smoked simply to look older, to such an extent that it popped up in anti-smoking ads. I appreciate all the advice and suggestions about it, but I'm kind of unrepentant when it comes to my last remaining vice. Well, other than bourbon. And Reddit.

The camera bag is a Tamrac model. It's a good bag, but I've been downsizing (making the slow shift to Micro-4/3rds) so I haven't been using it as much lately.

The coat is just a Columbia parka. It's one of those whizz-bang high-tech things with the silver dots inside. Omni-heat or something? I bought it because it was on clearance at the Mast General Store, thinking the dots were a gimmick, but they aren't. It's amazingly warm - almost *too* warm for North Carolina. I can only hike in it when the temps are in the teens.

**EDIT5**: Last edit and then I have to run.

1. Yes, I realize *now* that the intent of the thread was making fun of teenagers in goofy hats. I didn't mean to derail it, or turn it into a pro-hat thread. I get asked about my hats all the time, so I initially interpreted the question as sincere. Sorry OP.
2. I genuinely appreciate all the compliments, but I am not a handsome man. It's just a good picture, where all the elements come together to kind of make it work. For those who are accusing me of intentionally picking a good photo to make my point about hats, I'd say ""Duh.""
3. The key to making the hat thing work is knowing when to wear them. My simple rule (I like simple) is that if I'm wearing boots I'll wear a brimmed hat. If my outfit features tennis shoes, dress shoes, or any other footwear, I probably should leave the hat at home.
4. I live in Lenoir.
5. I'm overwhelmed by all the comments and compliments on my website/blog/whatever. If you want to find the amusing stories, look on the left sidebar and click the link that says ""Whimsical Anecdotes"" - that's where they're collected. If you're more interested in my photographs, feel free to [send me a Friend request or follow me on Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/KenThomas), then look in the albums under Wildlife or Landscapes. That's where I've been posting most of them lately.
6. I use my real name on Reddit because the lack of anonymity keeps me from being too much of an asshole. Usually.

**EDIT6**: Ducked back in and can't believe this is still going. Sorry if the continued edits are obnoxious, but I take questions seriously, and there are just too many messages to answer them individually.

For the people who asked if they've seen me in a hardhat, I'd guess you probably hang out on Wikipedia a lot. I [wrote an article for them](http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Thank_You/Ken_Thomas) that they used in that recent editor recruiting project. Funny thing about that picture is that they edited my cigar out of it, because they didn't think it sent the right message. They asked my permission first and I understood their reasoning, but I still thought it was hilarious.

Camera questions. I like Olympus, to tell you the truth. The 4/3rds standard isn't perfect, but it's pretty good and (most importantly to me) it was a genuine effort at an *open* standard. I think it's important to support that kind of thing when you get the chance. Right now I shoot wildlife with an E-5, and I'm gradually shifting to an E-M5 (Micro-4/3rds).

On the Facebook thing, sure - I'm getting a lot of Friend requests. I think it's cool. My #1 rule with Facebook is that you never put anything there you wouldn't want made public. Rule #2 is that if you followed #1, why would you care who is on your Friend list? I could always use more interesting people in my newsfeed. Bring 'em on.

Last but not least, I'm getting a lot of genuinely heartfelt questions about being a 'real man'. First of all, guys - you can't judge that kind of shit from a photo. I could be a deadbeat dad for all you know. OK, I'm not, but I could be.

But as for ""How to be a real man?"" I don't know. You fake it until you make it, basically. Look at people you admire. Act like they do. You just kind of muddle through. Try to be a stand-up guy. Try to be honest. Try to live up to your commitments, and take your responsibilities seriously. Then one day you realize people are looking to you for advice. People are looking to you for direction. And it hits you: ""Oh, this is what being a man feels like.""

There can be no other reason for holding this event up as evidence of misogyny. Adria Richards got offended by something, therefore the tech world is sexist and exclusionary.

Well, *fuck* those people. I am a woman in technology, and they don't get to speak for me. I gravitated towards this field precisely because it IS a meritocracy. When I was hanging out with my nerd friends as a kid, we could have been mistaken for an uglier version of a United Colors of Benetton ad. Boys, girls, white, black, brown, rich, poor - when we were sharing BASIC programs ripped from the back pages of *3-2-1 Contact* magazine, none of that mattered. What mattered was if you were smart, clever, helpful, and open-minded, and that's still true today.

I loved being in computer science because nobody treated me any differently just because I was a woman. If I could code well, great! If not, I'd be ridiculed (and helped!) just like anyone else. My friends were funny and offensive and weird and they were just like me. Still are.

I am heartbroken to think that it may never be like that again. It kills me to think that some young, smart, crass, awkward girl might not be able to make friends like I did, because all the boys in her program are too afraid to say something ""sexist"" around her. I'm pissed to think of all these girls getting into STEM fields because of ""grrl power"" rather than authentic love for the subject matter.

I am fucking *livid* that these people presume to speak for me. They fucking don't, and I would much rather live in a world with dongle jokes than a world where everyone is falling over themselves not to offend me.

I bet she was always respectful of your (non) beliefs and I don't believe she must have ever tried to force her beliefs onto you; for example, when she said ""you will have to talk to someone else...because I don't have all the answers."" She sounds more like a gentle and respectful person to me, and not like the nightmare of a family she has.

Frankly, you are a coward for leaving her because of that. Husbands and wives have all sorts of problems with their in-laws, trust me, it's normal. They range from petty problems to fucking serious problems (I would put yours in the serious category). However, couples who truly love and understand each other, would learn how to deal with these problems and never let it affect their relationship with one another. These sort of intelligent couples wouldn't have a worry about other people brain-washing their children either. Only stupid parents have that fear.

True,redshirt55,,,"I've been there. Rest assured you are not alone.

The fact that you recognize the problem and that you know your friends are joking is a good sign. Somehow, you need to change the way you react to these sorts of stimuli, where the words are negative but the intent is friendly. I'm not sure exactly how you can do this, but I will do what I can to help you.

First of all, recognize that people joke about everything. They joke about things they like. They joke about things they don't like. The world is an absurd place, and humor helps people to make sense of it, to deal with the absurdity while keeping their sanity intact. The fact that they are joking about you is not necessarily bad; the fact that they are joking to your face rather than behind your back suggests to me that they do it because they like you. For some people, this sort of banter is an important part of friendship. Also, it might help you to take jokes better if you make jokes yourself. This will be hard at first, but with practice you'll be zinging your friends right back. I find it helps to watch a lot of witty tv shows.

You're not alone. As you mentioned in your post, you have a girlfriend. You have friends. I assume you have a family. They all love you. Never, ever forget that. You may not always feel like it's true, but it is.

In my opinion, the best thing to do with negative thoughts is to express them. Putting your thoughts into words serves as a release; you can almost feel the sadness drain out of your body. If there isn't anyone you feel comfortable talking to about it, you can always write in a journal. Still, talking might be slightly better, since then you can get another person's perspective, which will almost certainly be supportive. You may feel like your friends, family, or girlfriend don't want to hear about your emotional struggles, but they care about you and they will want to help you if you tell them what's wrong.

Communication is essential to healthly relationships, both romantic and platonic. It is very important that all parties know where they stand; a lot of problems result from misunderstandings which can be avoided. Tell your friends that you feel hurt when they joke with you. Tell your girlfriend that you love her and you are afraid of losing her. If they are true friends, they will understand and they will do what they can to help you feel better and learn to be more confident in yourself.

Over time, I have developed a sort of detachment mechanism. I don't know exactly how it works, but essentially, very little fazes me. On average, I am content with my life; when things go wrong that I can't change, I don't let it bother me; when things go well I am happy. I can laugh at myself, and I can laugh at witty insults without taking them personally. Somehow, I got here from where you are, and I'm sure you can do it too. 

It sounds silly, but you should try this too: All the time, no matter what happens, think to yourself ""I'm awesome,"" or ""I'm cool,"" or some variation thereof. Eventually you'll believe yourself. It does wonders for your self-confidence. And when you have confidence in yourself, other people's opinions carry a lot less weight.

Pessimism has its good side. If you're always expecting the worst, life will constantly delight you with pleasant surprises. Learn to revel in the unexpected joy life brings you when things go better than your fears.

Finally, regarding quietness and awkwardness: I still struggle with social interaction, at least with new people; when I'm comfortable with someone, I can talk (or not talk) with them easily. What I'm finding out is that talking to people is not as hard as I've made it. Other people don't dwell over your every word the way you do; it's okay to say something stupid now and then. They'll forget about it. If something pops into your head, just say it. If you want to talk to someone, but you're afraid, just do it. It will be hard at first, but like everything it will get easier with practice. Most people want to be approached. Odds are, if you're not rude or offensive, any stranger will welcome your interaction. Just keep it friendly and casual. If you see them again, say hi and build from where you left off.

I'm no expert, but this is what I've found based on my own experiences. I hope I've been of some help to you.

True,laertes78,,,"It's propaganda, the Thirty Years War was a golden age for propagandizing leaflets, most of them were really obscene in their overstatements, think tabloid press used for a specific goal. There are a lot of legends how evil the ""other"" side was. [I suppose you heard that statement in a catholic area?] There are some children songs in that vein; ""Bet, Kindchen, bet/ Morgen kommt der Schwed'/ Morgen kommt der Oxenstern/ wird den Kindchen beten lern'"" = ""Pray, child, pray/ the Swede comes tomorrow/ Oxenstern ( [Oxenstierna](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axel_Oxenstierna), the chancellor of Sweden) comes tomorrow/ he will teach childs to pray"". Of course implying that ""Oxenstern"" is a boogeyman who would come to get you if you don't pray ""right"". The Swedes marched through the lenght of Germany, from Mecklemburg to Munich, and they ""fouraschierten"" = ""foraged"" the food they needed. That they were not nice to uncooperative people should be clear. If cities didn't contribute, they were pressed by such things as taking hostages, summary executions and simply general pillage of the uncooperative areas. This, of course, is Anathema to us today, but it seems not harsher or nicer than what the other side in that war did.

There were of course some really gruesome deeds done by the swedish army, but than again, the catholics weren't nice, either. Tilly, one of the field-marshals of the catholic ""Liga"" took Magdeburg in 1631 and destroyed it utterly, so thoroughly, that ""magdeburgisieren"" = ""to magdeburg"" was a synonym for ""to annihilate"". Here's a part of what Merian, a swiss printer, published - it's rather not too propagandistic compared to other accounts, even though Merian was a Calvinist - (in Theatrum Europaeum, a chronic, for the year (1631)[http://diglib.hab.de/wdb.php?dir=periodica/70-b-hist-2f&amp;pointer=421])

""Als nun endlich auch die Thor geöffnet/ und die Reutteren und Crabaten hineingelassen worden/ da ist das Plündern/ Rauben/ Morden / Jungfrawen und Weiber Schänden recht angegangen/ und über alle Massen und abschewlich gehauset worden. 
In d' Catharinen Kirchen habe sie in 53 meistentheils Weibspersonen gantz unbarmherziger Weiß die Köpff abgehawe/ da man sie dann mit gefalteten und eingeschoßene Händen todt gefunden [...]
In Summa was vor ein Jammer Elend und Noth gewesen/ kann nit beschrieben oder außgesprochen werden.""  

""When the doors finally were opened and the riders and Croats were let in/ the pillaging/ looting/ murdering/ raping of woman and girls (properly) started/ (and it was done in an exessive and heinous way).
In the Church of Katherines, they cut the heads of 53 mostly female people, in a most mercyless manner/ which were found with folded [for praying] and shattered hands afterwards. [...]
In summary, the lamment, hardship and misery can not be discribed, nor  told.""

And Pappenheim, a catholic General wrote: „Ich halt, es seyen über zwaintzig Tausent Seelen darüber gegangen. Es ist gewiß, seyd der Zerstörung Jerusalem, kein grewlicher Werck und Straff Gottes gesehen worden. All unser Soldaten seind reich geworden. Gott mit uns.“

""I think, more than twenty thousand souls have gone over [died]. Certainly, since the destruction of Jerusalem, there was not seen such a gruesome deed and punishment of God. All of our soldiers grew rich. God with us.""

""In Summa"", the Protestants feared the Catholics as much as the Catholics the Swedes.

------
There are a lot of points to rebut here.

Before I start though, let me just say: this article reads like a plea for men to stop articulating their concerns about gender inequality in the world, and seems to feel that feminists should be the only group allowed to do that.  This is an absurd request.  As the article points out- those benefitting from privilege cannot see it, and while feminism has extensively explored the shadow side of masculine power, it is blind to feminine power.  Men are entitled to deconstruct their gender role, without the supervision of feminists.

My response would be: would you please stop threatening to hate us for performing the same introspection of the male gender role that feminism claims to perform for the female gender role?

I'll also throw out an olive branch: this equality that feminists want?  The MRM wants it too.  If the ERA was considered again, feminists would find the MRM fighting right along with them to pass it.  Introduce solid, concrete legislation demanding equality and you will find the MRM to be a tireless ally.

Now:

**Regarding the authors' attempt to explain feminism**

I'm not going to go over this point by point- I dont want to write an article.  But for all the claims that feminism is concerned with MRM issues, I have never found any actual lobbying effort committed to their alleged concern.  

In fact, the author of this article seeks to educate about feminism without having an awareness of what is done in the name of feminism- some examples:

* The National Organization for Women lobbies against joint custody. So: yes.  The largest feminist lobbying group DOES want men to lose custody of their children.  It's very likely that the author doesn't know this- THIS is why feminists need the MRM.

* It was also feminist lobbying groups that argued for the duluth model in domestic violence investigation, which presumes masculine perpetration, and results in abused men being arrested for being battered.  Thus, feminist lobbyists DO want women to escape prosecution in DV cases.

It's possible that the author would issue a ""no true scotsman"" rebuttal to the above, claiming that the National Organization for Women are not true feminists.  Fine- don't be upset when the MRM calls them out then, join us in denouncing them.

**Regarding the author's complaints about inequality**

It is possible to explain male dominated fields without claiming that men are better than women.  [Here](http://www.mensrightswiki.org/index.php?title=Employment) is more on that topic.  So much of feminist theory is based on the presumption of gender as a social construct, and this is just not squaring with science.  It's not that men are better than women, it's that- on aggregate- men are *different* from women.  On aggregate.  It's important that Ada Lovelaces and Hedy Lamarrs continue to exist and are given access to, and respect in, the tech community.  It's not neccessarily accurate to assume that men and women are going to be equally interested in math and science.

Inequality affects both genders, and men are actually more likely to experience physical abuse during their lifetime than women- so the expectation of safety is a shaky flag to use for feminism.  If feminists are outraged about disproportionate sentencing- great.  They are welcome to fight it.  But the MRM isn't going to license them sole ownership of the issue. 

Here are a few other notes for the author:

- you talk about body autonomy, in regards to pregnancy, I assume.  Can we at least acknowledge that bodily autonomy in pregnancy is a special privilege that women are given?  Men do not get pregnant, and have no correlate to pregnancy laws.  However, once a pregnancy occurs, men have no freedoms to unilaterally choose whether or not they are ready to be a parent.  Women and men have the exact same rights before an unplanned pregnancy, but after an unplanned pregnancy, this ""body autonomy"" that is threatened are a special set of additional choices that women are given that men do not enjoy.  If women had no access to abortion, they'd be legally exactly in the same position that men currently are.  Many, if not most, prominent speakers in the MRM are pro-choice, by the way.

- you also seem to feel that there are laws that discriminate against women: please provide examples.  There are, however, laws that discriminate against men.  Selective service.  [Paternity rights law](http://www.dadsdivorce.com/articles/harsh-laws-that-discriminate-against-men-and-fathers.html).  Laws that assume men are the primary aggressors in domestic abuse.

**Regarding the tired, repeated, use of ""patriarchy""**

Patriarchy is a flawed theory.  People who insist on using it seems to feel that the data it tries to explain is evidence of the validity of the theory.  Other theories that explain the same inequalities: gynocentricity.  apex theory.  women are wonderful.  evolutionary psychology.

Patriarchy is a gendered term that places responsibility for everything that is wrong with society at the feet of men, excusing half of society from any accountability because ""they are oppressed and dont have power"".  Women have power- they account for the voting majority in the united states, for instance.   Historically they have had power as well.  What they haven't historically had was the ability to be actors- their power has lain in the ability to compel others to act on their behalf.  This is arguably a greater power. [I'll stop beating this point and just refer to this video about ""patriarchy""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSaT9utl4Ys)

If feminists agree to view patriarchy as a theory that we disagree on, and agree that the phenomena it attempts to explain is more important than the theory, then; lo and behold, the author's theoretical feminists and the MRM are on the exact same page.  We both want men and women to the same social expectation of agency.  We both want legal equality.  No special treatment for men or women because they are men or women.  No discrimination against men or women because they are men or women.

If that is the case, what is it about a separate movement with the same goals that the author finds so threatening?",0,1364581264,,0,1364589827,1,c94r5oy,t3_1b8usy,t1_c94r5oy,t3_1b8usy,,1431738207,27,False,MensRights,t5_2qhk3,27

Additionally, when a ridiculous argument such as ""if we regulate guns, what's next, outlawing knives?"" is made, it receives tons of upvotes while anyone explaining the logical fallacy of that statement is downvoted into oblivion.

So what does that tell us? It demonstrates that the pro-gun crowd will upvote anything that supports their position and downvote any challenge to their position - without any regard to the absurdity or fallacious nature of the comment. There is no rational debate because the pro-gun crowd is so emotionally committed to their position that they refuse to think critically about it.

* Find a weapon, upgrade it (can't do this till first blacksmith, but there is one 30 seconds from firelink). Don't hoard basic mats, they drop everywhere. Find a weapon you like, there are many many weapons and they all behave differently when swung.

* Level up! It helps. There is a huge difference between level one and level 10 for beginners. Don't have to save all the souls you find in your inventory. Souls are pretty easy to collect. Don't be afraid to spend them to level or buy stuff early on.

* Use summons, don't be ashamed of thinking it's cheating. It's what they are there for. Summons can save HOURS on bosses.

* Get a bow and don't be afraid of using it for pulls   

* Don't worry about cluttered inventory. You will be able to store and sell gear later on 

* Running may be a pain at first, but you will be able to warp from bonfire to bonfire later on

* **Be very very careful about hitting NPCs by accident. This especially means the smiths. They are the most important NPCs in the game.**

* Don't feel compelled to kill everything you see. Dashing through is a viable option. Mobs follow you but not forever.

* Take pulls slowly. Don't rush in twohanding a big weapon spamming big attacks and expect to come out okay. Dance a bit with mobs. Nothing in the game is crazy fast that you can't back out of.

* Don't be afraid to use youtube and the DS wiki for help. You are going to miss a ton of stuff anyway if you don't 

* With a shield up, you can't backstab and stamina regens slowly 
* there is no ""best armour"". Once you become familiar with the game you will want to wear armour for looks and playstyle.

* armour equipped type effects movement speed. You move slower with heavier armour but take less damage and vice versa with light armour except you will be avoiding attacks because one can actually dodge faster. This is a key combat concept. Experiment with what you like.  

* Make sure you know how important humanity is in the game. It's one of the most useful things you can have.

Dark Souls is hard, but at it's core, it's like any RPG. Level up, get good gear, know the maps and who you fight and game gets easier. It's no different than any other game-you can become overpowered with time.

Easily the best Japanese game I ever played, and one of the best all time. This is coming from a guy who has been playing RPGs since the 80s. I thought it was just another Redit circlejerk. Boy was I wrong. The ambiguous story and shady NPCs just adds to it. 


Shout out to /r/Darksouls for help and tips, friends and foes.

PS  lot of players will rag on Skyrim, but after spending 700 hours on both combined, they are completely different actually. Dark Souls is much harder for sure, but I have a mount and houses in Skyrim. Similarities are only superficial as far as RPGs go. Both have good and bad things going for them

True,leococho,,,"Looking at these pictures reminds me a lot of my family and friends that I grew up around. It gives me a bitter sweet feeling because on one hand, I am proud of how hard working my people are, but on the other hand it makes me sad because of how hard they have to work on a daily basis. My parents came to this great country when I was barely one year old. They made the tough decision to come here because they wanted to give us the opportunity to make something of ourselves. My parents eventually sent for us from Mexico and we were raised here in the U.S. My parents have worked hard all of their lives. They worked labor intensive jobs where they would have to be outside in the hot sun all day bent over, breaking their backs or lifting some heavy stuff repeatedly all day. 

When ever we would get breaks from school, such as winter break or summer break, my parents would take us to work with them. My dad would always tell us "" We take you to work so that you can see how hard it is to earn a dollar. Make something of yourselves, don't be like us who have to come out here and suffer everyday to put food on the table."" I used to hate it and always wished that I could just have a relaxing break where I didn't have to do anything.... It wasn't until I became older that I really started to understand and appreciate what my parents were trying to teach us. Although it sucked having to work those labor intensive jobs, it made me appreciate my parents hard work ethic and made me realize that they were doing all of that for me and my siblings. When I graduated high school, I joined the Army, did a tour in Iraq and I became a U.S. citizen. I am now on my last semester of college and I am about to graduate with my bachelors. I have a strong work ethic and I attribute it to my parents who instilled that in me. My dad still works outside, but at least now he's operating machinery instead of having to break his back every day and my mom stays home and takes care of my nieces and nephews. I still have family who have to work in labor intensive jobs everyday and I have nothing but respect for them. They push through the heat and pains everyday. I am very thankful that my family raised me that way and I appreciate all the hard work that my fellow Mexicans and immigrants do.

True,ek91,rainbowdash,,"[](/flutterroll) Yeah she is such a horrible role model. It's not like she's done anything to show that overall she's a good pony...
[](/sp)

**Season 1**

Episode 2, Friendship is Magic- Even though this example can be applied to all of the other characters I think it should still be noted as an example, when Twilight began her journey into the Everfree Forest Rainbow Dash (and the rest the mane 6) insisted on accompanying her despite only just meeting her that day and knowing the dangers. Also in that episode RD displayed her loyalty for the first time when she refused to join the Shadowbolts.

Episode 5, Griffon the Brush Off- In this episode Rainbow Dash displays her loyalty once again when Gilda was revealed to be a jerk, Dash stood by her friends and did not succumb to peer pressure when Gilda accused her of being 'uncool' for not wanting to come with her, this shows that Dash truly does value her friends over her own personal image.

Episode 16, Sonic Rainboom- Despite Rarity's 'selfish' behavior in this episode Rainbow Dash forgave her in a heartbeat even though she had every right to be angry with her, and as for the thing with Fluttershy and her cheering, that was more for comedic value to show how different their personalities are, Dash does say that ""Fluttershy is great support.""

Episode 21 Over a Barrel- Ok this is probably one of the best examples of RD's loyalty that is constantly over looked, When Rainbow Dash is trying to sneak up on the buffalo and Pinkie blows her cover and the buffalo surround them, Dash without hesitation offers to fight an entire herd of buffalo to protect Pinkie and allow her to escape. Also when she learns more about the buffalo's situation she is quick to forgive them and help them find a peaceful resolution with ponies of Appleloosa.

Episode 23, The Cutie Mark Chronicles- It was shown in this episode that Dash stood up for Fluttershy when she was being bullied, this was before her and Fluttershy were friends so it shows that she is not just loyal to her friends but also loyal to doing what is right.

Episode 25, Party of One- When Dash went to collect Pinkie Pie for her surprise party Pinkie was acting very irrationally, most people would have probably wanted to get out of there when they saw how Pinkie was acting and when they got a good look at Pinkie's 'party guests,' but not Dash, she didn't give up on Pinkie no matter how insane she might have appeared.

**Season 2**

Episode 3, Lesson Zero- When Princess Celestia arrived and told Twilight to come back to the library with her, her friends went there to defend her, most notably is Rainbow Dash's [display of loyalty]  (http://images.wikia.com/mlp/images/a/a9/Please_Don%27t_Punish_Her_S2E3.png), she stood right between Celestia and Twilight, this shows great courage standing up against a being that can move an entire celestial body without breaking a sweat.

Episode 14, The Last Roundup- A lot of people like to use this incident to discredit RD but I think it's a good example of her loyalty, when Rarity and Pinkie fell off the back of the carriage RD had two choices, does she turn back and retrieve them and risk losing Applejack? Or does she continue her pursuit? because Applejack was obviously upset about something and was unwilling to listen to reason they needed to catch her other wise they would lose her for good, after they did catch up to her and the problem was resolved I would like to note Twilight, Fluttershy, Applejack and Rainbow Dash all failed to go and retrieve Rarity and Pinkie so to place the blame on just RD is unfair.

Episode 21, Dragon Quest- Rainbow Dash, along with Twilight and Rarity brave Dragons to to protect Spike, another example of her loyalty.

Episode 22 Hurricane Fluttershy- This episode is an example in itself of Dash's loyalty and devotion to her friends, I feel I don't need to point out any specific examples from this episode, you need only watch it to see what I'm talking about.

**Season 3**

Episode 6, Sleepless in Ponyvillie- When Scootaloo confessed to Rainbow Dash that she was scared of the storys that she had been telling, Dash comforted Scootaloo and told her that she was scared of those storys as well when she was her age so that Scootaloo didn't feel alone with her fears.

Episode 7, Wonderbolts Academy- Rainbow Dash was willing to give up on her life long dream to do what was right. She stayed loyal to her integrity.

Episode 12, Games Ponies Play- Rainbow Dash worked hard to ensure that the crystal ponies had the best chance at becoming the hosts for the Equestria Games. She said it felt good to do something that helped bring happiness to other ponies and not just herself.
[](/sp)
[](/abmeh) But yeah, other than all that stuff there is nothing to show that Dash is a good role model...

True,PJMurphy,,,"Go to the ""Start"" menu and hit ""Shut Down"". Once the fan turns off, look about the room. There's probably a vertical panel, possibly made of wood, with a metal protuberance attached to it. Grasp it firmly and rotate it clockwise, then gently pull it towards you. A portal may open. If not, try rotating the metal bit counter-clockwise, and try pulling again. If this doesn't work, instead of pulling after rotating, try pushing the panel instead.  

You will find yourself with access to an entirely different chamber than that in which your computer is located. DON'T PANIC. This is entirely normal. Not every chamber contains a computer.  

Look around. It's like a game...is there another vertical panel in this room, or is the one you opened the only one? If the one you opened is the only panel that allows access to the room, then determine if there is a ceramic fixture resembling a throne bolted to the floor. If so, then look about, and see if there are various bowl-shaped objects in the room. If so, back out of the room, restart your computer, and do a browser search using ""bathing"" and ""hygiene"" as keywords.  

If there is a second vertical panel in the chamber, repeat the process. PROTIP -- try to identify the vertical panel through which delivery food, such a pizza, arrives. This is the level-up portal. Venture through it.  

CHEAT CODE -- if necessary, order pizza, then follow the delivery guy through his succession of portals.  

Eventually you should find yourself in a level where sensory stimuli is both intense, and unpredictable. You will likely encounter other users who are just as baffled as you are. Don't panic.

True,tennanja,,,"While I doubt that they could mount a realistic threat to the US due to the fact heir rockets are unreliable at best. There is evidence that they have nuclear weapons at least as much as the US had to end WW2. Seoul is within artillery distance of the DMZ and I've read on a couple different military blogs that the DPRK has huge tunnels deep into the DMZ allowing them to bring out entire divisions of troops and armor into the middle of the DMZ without being able to be spotted by satellite surveillance. So while I doubt that NK can actually attack the US, they would be able to make a devastating attack against south Korea, a major military and economic ally of the US. 

However should NK make such an attack it would cause the US to respond with a severe military campaign that would dismantle the DPRK government, causing all of the north Koreans to be refugees/need a new government which would most likely require South Korea (if it is in any state to be capable) and china (if the US allows it) to step in and take some control of the country otherwise it is likely to be taken over by a group of former generals/warlords, causing more political strife and increasing crime/piracy in the area, prompting one of the three to step in. However no matter who steps in they will have to be willing to shell out huge piles of cash to help modernize the country and feed a poor malnourished and thoroughly brainwashed populace that hates anyone else than their current leaders (at least as far as the current propaganda would have us believe) 

I think part of the North Korean strategy at this point is to try and get coverage in the US and get people to see that the US is taking some actions that if another country would treat us in the same way we would not be happy with it. Flying military aircraft near other countries is an act of aggression just like waving a gun out the window of your car is, but the US is so comfortable in exercising their military prowess where ever they feel that this way of thinking is completely foreign to them. 

Between the threat to south Korea and the fact that we don't really want to pay for fixing north Korea and neither does South Korea, I suspect that we wait until North Korea launches an attack to respond, no matter how much they huff and puff we are likely to wait for an actual attack. And after Kim Yong Un is able to prove to his generals that he is a tough guy and the western world is afraid of their military then things will quiet down and get back to the same situation it has been in for 50 years. They barely have enough resources to maintain their infrastructure, and cannot really expand and the trickle of technology from China will come at ever higher prices as China will realize that they are not benefiting by being the only people that are willing to work with the North Koreans.

I've heard there are JS compilers that you load by simply including the javascript in your html file.  Then, you don't have to precompile the SASS file- the script compiles it on the fly. This sounds like something that might be useful during development, but I would never try it on a production site. You want your site as lightweight as possible.

But honestly, compiling is super easy so I haven't bothered with the JS stuff.  I use [CodeKit](http://incident57.com/codekit/), which will compile my sass document every time I save it. It also somehow triggers the browser to refresh. Codekit will also minify CSS and JS if you ask it to Its pretty slick.

In terms of learning, I just learned from the [tutorial](http://sass-lang.com/tutorial.html) on the SASS website. Its actually pretty simple. If the no-curly-brace thing feels too strange at first, there is a version of SASS you can use that still requires the curly braces.  Just end your file with the .scss extension instead of the .sass extension and your complier will expect to find the curly braces.

No matter which format you use, its pretty sweet. You save time, and your CSS turns out much more organized.

True,gogge,topcontributor,CONSISTENT COMMENTER,"The high fat intake on keto doesn't cause heart disease, the few long term studies there are doesn't show any negative health effects on keto.

From [another thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/19mfup/how_are_risks_not_part_of_the_nutshell_or_faq/c8peq6b) on common misconceptions (cancer, heart health, osteoporosis, etc.):

---

High fat doesn't cause heart disease:

Carotid VWV = Carotid vessel wall volume, a measure of how clogged the carotid artery is.

&gt; Two-year weight loss diets can induce a significant regression of measurable carotid VWV. The effect is similar in low-fat, Mediterranean, or low-carbohydrate strategies and appears to be mediated mainly by the weight loss-induced decline in blood pressure.

*Shai I, et al.* [""Dietary intervention to reverse carotid atherosclerosis""](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20194883) *Circulation. 2010 Mar 16;121(10):1200-8. Epub 2010 Mar 1.*

And here's a review by and independent organization (The Cochrane Collaboration) looking at 48 randomized controlled trials; fat intake isn't bad for anyone, if you're a male at risk for a heart attack you might want to eat more unsaturated fat rather than saturated:

&gt; The findings are suggestive of a small but potentially important reduction in cardiovascular risk on modification of dietary fat, but not reduction of total fat, in longer trials. 

...

&gt; Subgrouping suggested that this reduction in cardiovascular events was due to studies of fat modification, or fat modification and reduction (not studies of fat reduction alone), seen in studies of at least two years duration, in studies of men (and not those of women), and in those with moderate or high cardiovascular risk at baseline (not general population groups).

*Hooper L, et al.* [""Reduced or modified dietary fat for preventing cardiovascular disease""](http://summaries.cochrane.org/CD002137/cutting-down-or-changing-the-fat-we-eat-may-reduce-our-risk-of-heart-disease). *Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2012, Issue 5. Art. No.: CD002137. DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD002137.pub3*

Surprisingly the studies showed no benefit in replacing fat with carbs, not even saturated fat, so low fat diets doesn't seem beneficial:

&gt; Dietary change to reduce saturated fat and partly replace it with unsaturated fats appears to reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events, but replacing the saturated fat with carbohydrate (creating a low fat diet) was not clearly protective of cardiovascular events (despite small improvements in weight, body mass index, total and LDL cholesterol).

There are to my knowledge no studies that show that ketosis is bad for your health, long term or short term. Short term in obese subject usually show no side-effects ([1-year example](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16652223)), studies in epileptic children show no side-effects during [8 years of dieting or 14 years after discontinuing the diet](http://www.hopkinschildrens.org/high-fat-ketogenic-diet-to-control-seizures-is-safe-over-long-term.aspx). The diet has been used both by professionals and ""lay people"" for [at least 150 years](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Banting), more in the mainstream the last 40 years [after Atkins once again made it popular](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atkins_Nutritional_Approach). It seems unlikely that there are any serious side-effects from the diet.

But from what I've seen there are no long term studies going beyond 10 years.

True,NiceGrammarNazi,,,"In this context, it means derogatory. However, I think it was used incorrectly in this cartoon. The artist should have simply said ""derogatory"". ""Pejorative"" usually refers more to an increasing negative connotation over time. *Peior* is Latin for ""worse"", so pejorative, in a sense, means ""worsening"".

An example would be the word ""villain"", which used to mean someone who lived in a village, or from ""the sticks"". Now it means someone who is evil. So we would say ""villain"" has undergone pejoration over the last several hundred years.

""Dude"" used to mean, interestingly enough, someone from the city who stuck out when he came to ""the sticks"". It was not considered a compliment to be called a dude. Now of course, it's used as a friendly greeting, and as we know from Ferris Bueller's Day Off, someone can be referred to in positive terms as ""a righteous dude"". This is an example of an ameliorative, which is the opposite of pejorative.

The alternate meaning of the word ""beaver"" to mean ""vagina"" is not due to pejoration. It's simply a euphemism, possibly due to the hairy nature of both.

Please have a nice day.

**Edit:** Thank you to whoever sent me reddit gold. I shall be in the lounge if you need me.

To those of you who have pointed out that ""derogatory"" is a perfectly good definition for ""pejorative"": you are correct. Perhaps I should not have said it was used incorrectly. I do think derogatory would have been a better choice, however. This is not a question of grammar, but of style, in which I have been known to dabble.

&gt; You won't get any argument from me that LGBT people, and non-white people have serious issues in America today, MUCH worse issues than women,

I am a member of the LGBT community and an active feminist. I see both as necessary. I can list reasons why if you don't mind...

[States Enacted a Record Number of Abortion Laws in 2011](http://www.guttmacher.org/media/inthenews/2012/01/05/endofyear.html) It's so bad that some groups are preparing for Roe v. Wade to return to the Supreme Court.

[This is one of the most comprehensive lists I've seen.](http://current.com/groups/news-blog/93709767_no-retreat-101-assaults-in-the-war-on-women.htm) It describes the height in the ""War on Women"" discussion. Included are the massive amounts of anti-abortion laws, defunding of Planned Parenthood, we had political leaders and religious leaders discussing rape in some of the most disgusting, inappropriate, and beyond horrible ways. The list just keeps going and all of that was recent.

Even more recently VAWA, the Violence Against Women Act, stalled in the House and was threatened to not be reauthorized. New provisions that assisted Native American women and LGBT issues caused problems with Republicans in the House. It was finally reauthorized and signed by the President, thankfully, but it being stalled and threatened to simply not pass is unacceptable. [This article shows the importance of the act and opposition against it.](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/22/violence-against-women-act-_n_2742976.html)

[The documentary Miss Representation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miss_Representation) was created in 2011 and discusses women in the media. It was a huge success and gained a lot of praise, which is wonderful, but the topic of the movie is less... pleasant. The representation of women in the media and politics in the US is deplorable and honestly this documentary has changed some of my friend's opinions about why feminism is still necessary.

I am aware of issues faced by women mostly due to my actual studies in gender theory, queer theory, and Women's Studies in general. If I wasn't in those classes I might completely miss those stories, so I can see where it seems like women are doing fine. 

&gt; Dworkin, Solanas, and Catherine McKinnon.

Dworkin and MacKinnon were big players in the [Feminist Sex Wars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminist_Sex_Wars) during the 80s. Andrea Dworkin was also an anarchist and anti-war protestor, so she had a thing for very... severe viewpoints, to put it lightly. [A book later published about her legacy, by a feminist, actually really heavily criticized her.](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2005/apr/15/gender.politicsphilosophyandsociety) Many feminists feel that Dworkin didn't help the women's movement because she took away agency and free will. She basically had the extremist views of, ""Well, we're just do this for their own good."" Which is awful. Most modern feminists really don't care much for Dworkin overall, the same goes for MacKinnon. 

As for Solanas, that woman was insane. Period. She attempted to assassinate Andy Warhol... I mean I haven't met a single modern day feminist who says, ""You know what we should do today? Murder."" Also her SCUM Manifesto is disgusting, but then again I'm pretty sure she was mentally unhealthy. She told contradicting stories about her life, held contradicting viewpoints to how she actually lived, didn't want to associate with gay society, had a good relationship with her father even though she hated men passionately... 

I also haven't met, talked to, or read anything from modern feminists that say, ""We should eliminate males. What's the worst that could happen?"" Solanas is nothing but a jumbled mess of contradictions rolled into one person. I have seen writings that say, ""She started radical feminism, so she's important."" Which is probably correct, but I would disagree with those people's particular views on feminism. 

Second Wave feminists are... often very extreme, at least by today's standards. It's hard for me to relate and put myself in their position. I try not to judge, because historically speaking I can't understand fully what it was like at that time. Hindsight is always 20/20, so it can be easy at times to look at history and pass judgement. That being said, some Second Wave ideas I won't miss when they're gone... I can appreciate the positive contributions that Second Wave feminists brought, but some of the harm they did to the movement is still being felt. It's not good PR when a feminist tries to off Andy Warhol...

&gt; male gaze... Male privilege

I think this sounds like ""Tumblr Feminists"" which get on my nerves also. They seem to mostly consist of high school females who haven't taken a Women's Studies course, actually read through feminist theory, or understand the language they're using. I think it's that Liberal High School/College mentality that any label associated with being ""open minded"" is cool. Which becomes a problem when they misrepresent the groups they label themselves as... We have enough PR problems without someone coming in and lighting the dictionaries on fire, taking a dumb on the Suffragettes flag, and screaming ""Patriarchy"" at everything that looks somewhat male/masculine/like a penis...

&gt; Okay, so again, if they're basically the same, why associate yourself with the movement of Dworkin and Solanas? Isn't egalitarianism at that point just the same beliefs as feminism, but with none of the hate?

I'll be honest with you, there are days I feel conflicted about whether to call myself a feminist or an egalitarian. So, I'll be up front with you about why I call myself a feminist, because so few people seem to, you know? 

When people like Dworkin and Solanas tarnish the good name of feminism with extremism and hate they simply strengthen my resolve. If we allow a small, but vocal, minority to utterly destroy a movement that has given women so much, what does that say about us? That we are so willing to forget all that it has given us now that we feel like we can settle for less than we deserve. We feel like we have traveled as far as feminism will take us, so we leave it like a broken down bus on the side of the road and allow egalitarianism to carry us to finish line?

But now you don't have the same people driving you to your end goal. So what happens? 

You most likely are drowned out by the majority. The goals and ideology of feminism would simply be swamped by larger groups within egalitarianism. We fear our voices would just be drowned out and soon we would be forgotten. Statements that are only half truths that seem to claim women have finally achieved equality would be used to push aside our plight. Feminism is relegated to the history books and we all go home.

The title Feminism is a reminder of where we once were and where we still need to go. It is a symbol of the Suffragettes who bravely faced down the police, Congress, and the President himself because they knew they were couldn't back down now. It's for every woman who died from an unsafe abortion before Roe v. Wade. It's for every protestor, letter writer, and marcher who held the government's feet to the fire when it counted most. It's for the women who pushed hard against every glass ceiling they came upon. It's for the women who say no to settling for only what is considered ""good"" and ""successful"" for a woman. 

Feminism frames the discussion. It is a constant reminder for where we need to take ourselves, one step at a time, together. Feminism's singular goal of gender equality gives it a foundation, a structure, a collective group ready to remain through the struggle because it is the right thing to do.

I can agree with egalitarian ideas, movements, and leaders. They are some of the brightest and most compassionate people I've met, but it is still simply a collective and we won't risk being drowned out in the noise. We have come a long way, and seeing this thing through would be wonderful if the banner of ""Feminism"" was there at the finish line.

I call myself a feminist because I refuse to allow poor examples of feminists to dissuade me or to undo all that we have accomplished. I refuse to allow people to forget that British Suffragette, Victoria Simmons, lived all the way to 1992. That during the Steubenville Rape Trial almost every major news outlet on TV worried about the future of the rapists, and not their victim. I refuse to allow people to tell me that it is just a ""sad fact of war"" that our female soldiers are more likely to be raped by their comrades than killed by the enemy.

It's moments like this that remind me why I became a feminist in the first place. I'm here to make sure that banner keeps being passed down until the finish line is reached. I may not see that day, but I will be damned if the title ""feminist"" gets left behind. My future daughters and sons deserve better.

So, even when I have those days when I doubt why I should be a feminist, I just remind myself that it isn't over and there is still work to be done. The finish line isn't in sight, but we sure have traveled a long way to stop now.",0,1364650227,,0,False,1,c956icm,t3_1b532g,t1_c956icm,t1_c94e4am,,1431730831,5,False,changemyview,t5_2w2s8,5

As a former submariner, I have a good idea of what it is he's going through, but I want you to try to imagine it. Try to imagine what his life is like, day in and day out, doing absolutely nothing except mopping hallway floors and sleeping and eating. Barely existing. He stares at blank walls,  he reads the same books, he can sometimes watch tv, he eats bland, shitty food, he has to be around people who are absolute pieces of human filth (one of the people in his block picked up a two year old baby and beat it death against a floor). He has earned many months less on his sentence (keep that in mind, this isn't even the amount of time he *could* have done) because he works for us doing janitorial work throughout the jail. He trudges through every day, the same as the last, with the blank walls, mundane work, boring routine, the same shit every fuckin day. He's like a robot. That is his life. That is what I have seen him do every day for months. 
     
Now keep imagining this punishment, think of the days that stretched out before him since the day he came in here. The hopelessness of knowing that you must endure every grueling hour before you can go home. Imagine the absolute shit that his life has been for the past year.

Second story:  

Feral ducks are a massive issue for us.  Lots of birds and water birds, and naturally migratory ducks want to find a good place to post up and get free food.  With that comes lots of baby ducks, who wander off into the darnedest of places away from their mothers.

A small group found their way into the Orangutan enclosure, and shit got disturbing pretty quick. Long story short, in front of a large group of guests, our alpha female picked one up and began to forcefully masturbate with it. In and out, in and out of big hairy orang cooter, all the while she stares back blankly at the crowd that's gathered and is losing their minds.  The alpha male, not to be outdone, scores himself a little duckling. But he ends it quick: he squeezes it until it pops in his hand, and he forcefully throws it into the glass barrier where the guests are, and it's little dead body smears down the glass, streaking it.  Little kids are now screaming and crying, and the male is in there like Russell Crowe, ""are you not entertained??""

True,AndAnAlbatross,,,"Alright, /u/stormgirl, here's the thing -- 

Everybody here who is bashing Natural News is walking a thin line here. What they are literally saying boils down to *Natural News is the source, so it can't possibly be right*. What they probably mean is *Natural News is the source, so it can't possibly be trusted. 

Natural News has a long history of anywhere from subtly misleading to outright lying when presenting information that coincides with their agenda. So, first and foremost, we need to talk about how you can go about making someone realize a source is not reliable. 

My preferred method is the *give 'em enough rope* technique. As in *give the source enough rope to hang themselves in the eyes of the fan.* 

It's not an easy art to master, but the premise is simple. You start by a cautious agreement with the person presenting the source. Then, using humor and disarming social engagements, you start the autopsy on the source. You make an observation here, throw out a compliment there and now you are in a discussion where it's you, your friend and your friends source, all a happy family. Then you ask a question that is leading but positive, your friend answers it, you have your *fake* aha moment and you move on. Now, your goal flips, you let your friend take you on a journey through the bullshit, then you present two or more conflicting beliefs that are likely to be endorsed by the bad source, then you make fun of it in a funny way. 

To be sure, this is not a nice or honest thing to do. It is, however, one of the few socially acceptable ways to take a source down a peg, and as long as the contradiction is honest and valid, you're on the right side of reason, just not the best side of ethics since you had to role play to get your friend there. I'll present a sample conversation in the context of natural news.

*[The skeptic (S) and the antivaxxer (AV) have just started their discussion. AV has just shared the article and S has read it.]*

S: Oh shit... that's kinda fucked up. 

AV: Yeah, seriously. It'd be nice if the news reported something good for a change. 

S: I know, right? A huge part of the reason I actually got a flu shot this year was because the message that you *had* to get a vaccine seriously seemed everywhere! Like... flu vaccines were just being given out at work one day and I thought, obviously I should get one and it's right here, so whatever. 

AV: Yeah. Ugh... that sucks like... I dunno, it's like the article said, this was **years** ago and we're still being lied to, you know? It's like, what's the point.

S: Yeah. I mean, so what's the deal with Natural News, they're like... what? They just take on political issues, or science or what?

AV: They just actually tell you about stuff, like real stuff, not shit that's made in a lab. And they tell you about stuff like... like the fact that while Obama's getting praised over the whole marriage equality thing, he's signing *The Monsanto Protection Act*. 

S: What's that?

AV: Oh man, get this... Obama just signed something that basically lets these huge companies, you know fucked up companies like Monsanto that experiment with genes and make orange seeds that won't actually produce seeds of their own unless you put something in the soil and crap. Anyway Obama basically signed away the last bastion of requiring these places to regulate their GMO crops and he did while everyone was distracted with something they were praising him over, just like the NDAA.

S: So like... I thought all the evidence said GMOs were mostly safe and it was just how they were used. 

AV: Yeah right. Dude, they actually splice the DNA. How could that be safe. That's fucked up. 

S: But... ok. So yeah it sounds weird, but I've looked at some of those studies, it seems like the issue is almost entirely the individual changes that are being made to the organisms, it doesn't seem like the technology to modify them runs any inherent risks at all. 

AV: Yeah, no shit. If they reported everything that was wrong with their technology, they would never get funding.

S: Wait, what? You mean the scientists that do the study, they just all ignore that their techniques for modifying organisms is dangerous. 

AV: It's not like a conspiracy or anything... it's just that if they're up-front about the dangers, they don't get funding. If they don't get funding, they lose their jobs. 

S: Oh, so like the same thing with vaccines then, where if the studies look critical of vaccines up front, they're never gonna get funding. 

AV: Exactly.

S: So... that's like these journals and stuff can't be trusted at all. That's sort of a bold claim, because isn't that like... the best of the best of our knowledge. Also, in the article you just sent me, the whole thing is based around this one study... if the studies can't be trusted, how can we trust this one?

AV: Cause, unlike everything, it's not the mainstream bullshit.

S: You basically just said these studies can be bought, so it's sorta like... they can either be bought and so the data the is suspect across the board or it is only sometimes bought, which case I would think the exceptions, as opposed to the consensus, would be the one's that look more suspicious. I mean... how do you buy out everyone? How can you even afford that? Plus, it sorta directly conflicts with Natural News perspective. You just said Natural News sees through the bullshit that happens in the journals, yet they're still proud to have a peer reviewed journal as a source. I don't know man... it seems a little weird. I think these two ideas kinda contradict each other. 

AV: No, 'cause --

True,Redvixenx,,,"This is really long and I apologize! I wanted to have more of an ending to it, but decided to leave it on a cliffhanger of sorts. 



I always knew we would be our own downfall. In the days before The End, I would go through the day as any other normal 19 year old girl would. I’d get dressed, say goodbye to my little sister Lacie, and head to work. At work I’d plaster on a smile, greet customers, and do my job. But working in a busy café in the middle of NYC gave me a lot of opportunities to see humanity when they thought no one was looking. 
In the day before the outbreak, it was unusually calm in the shop. I sat behind the counter, watching the news. It was early morning, about 6am. The sunlight filtered through the shop windows and I could hear my other coworkers talking softly in the back, starting up the machines. Suddenly an alert flashed across the screen and it was followed by a shaky camera shot of people running down the street. A newsperson, a delicate looking woman, was half running along with the others as she reported. The sound was only coming through in bursts so only a few key words got through.


“Government secret…volunteers for over a year at a private hospital…experiments…virus has affected patient’s brains…breakout…cannibalism.” She said. 

There was another shaky shot aimed behind them of a man in hospital garb snatching a woman and throwing her onto the concrete with a huge amount of strength. He began to bite into her flesh and you could see black veins lining his chalky skin. He lifted his head up and went straight for the cameraman. The image cut out, and there was total silence.


Heart pounding I grabbed my bag and flew out the store and ran straight for home. It was just me and my little sister on our own in a small apartment. Our father had died last year and that left me and Lacie. I burst through the door and look frantically around.


 “LACIE!” I call, and she comes running out her room, startled. Her beautiful strawberry blonde hair bounced against her shoulders in ringlets.


 I envied her genes, she had the best of mom and dad. Her hair was soft and fine, beautiful white skin and big green eyes. I had dark red hair that was straight, freckles that looked dripped along my skin, and hazel eyes. “Kari?” she squeaked. I scooped her 7 year old body into my arms and ran into the room we shared. 


“Grab a bag and get some clothes. We have to hurry, something is happening in town and we got to go.” I told her, trying to remain calm but sound urgent.


 She nodded and obeyed. I grabbed a duffle bag and put in the password for the safe at the bottom of the closet. Dad had a fascination with weapons and at this moment I couldn’t have been more thankful for his weirdness. I grabbed 3 guns, a few magazines, and 2 daggers. I grabbed the utility belt he usually put them all on and began to strap them on. I was only wearing a white sundress and flats, but I didn’t have time to change. I remember the crossbow above the safe and grab that too along with some arrows. Throwing the rest of the ammo in the bag I began grabbing all season types of clothes, unsure of how long we’ll have to wait until the military has everything under control. If they get everything under control…


“K-Kari…?” Lacie cries softly, and I turn around and hug her. She packed her bag and I could see her favorite teddy poking out the side. I kneel in front of her and cup her face in my hands. “Lacie listen to me. I don't know what’s going on but we have to go. We’ll head out to the cottage in Maine, okay? There are some bad people out there and it’s not safe for us in the city. Please don't ask questions and keep with me, okay? Don't be afraid, I got you.”  I tell her and she nods, crying. 


I kiss her forehead and finish packing the bag with food, clothes, ammo, and anything else we’ll need. I grab the keys to the jeep and herd her outside. The panic hasn’t reached this side of town yet, which was a blessing. We climb into the car and I dash back inside to grab blankets and pillows and another jacket. I bundle her into the back seat and climb in, turning it on as I do. Throwing the car into reverse I peel out of the parking lot and head for the nearest bridge out of here. My map and crossbow lay in the front seat and I take a moment to look at Lacie in the rear view mirror. *No matter what happens,* I vow, *I’ll protect her.*

Explanations on choices:

* The Xeon E3 1240 V2 is basically the same CPU as the i7-3770 but without integrated graphics which you won't need as you're getting a discrete GPU anyway. The 8 threads that this CPU offers should help with your programming needs, and will be plenty for gaming on.

* For the CPU cooler, since you're not overclocking you don't really need one, but I put one in for noise purposes as you mentioned sound recording. The Scythe cooler should be quiet especially as the CPU shouldn't make a ton of heat so the fan RPM can stay fairly low. Normally, I'd recommend getting a Xigmatech Gaia, but I couldn't find one available in the UK.

* The ASRock H77 Pro4 will be fine for your needs. Since you're not overclocking there's really no need to spend a lot of money on a motherboard.

* I went with a 2x8GB kit of Corsair RAM so you'll have plenty of memory to run your programming with. Also, this would leave two slots open on the motherboard if you need to add more RAM in the future.

* For storage, I selected two 1TB drives like you wanted. One thing that I'd recommend, is when you do get Windows in the future, picking up an SSD as well as Windows is a lot faster and more responsive with an SSD as opposed to a mechanical drive.

* For a GPU, I went with a XFX Radeon 7950. The 7950 is an awesome GPU that will let you max out games easily. The Linux drivers for both Nvidia and AMD cards can be buggy sometimes, so gaming on Linux might not be the best.

* For the case I went with the Fractal Design Define R4 as its a really nice case with a lot of good features, but most importantly is sound dampened which will be good for your recording.

* The XFX power supply is a good unit and 550W will be plenty for a single GPU build.

* DVD writers are basically all the same, so I just picked the cheapest one at the moment.

* I couldn't fit a high resolution monitor in the budget (the cheapest one I could find was over 400 pounds), so I went with a 1080p IPS panel that should be good for your needs.",0,1364664920,,0,False,1,c959xex,t3_1b8oim,t1_c959xex,t1_c94y3qi,,1431729150,1,False,buildapcforme,t5_2tjcr,1

True,areReady,,,"_Important Notice: The specific calculations of this answer rely on my ability to not be awful at math. Regardless, even with the misplacement of a decimal or two, the general answer should be pretty much the same_.

A **lot**.

I'm going to do some calculations here aiming for a .001% change, which I don't think would make a whole lot of difference in terms of effect on Earth, but should illustrate the scale of the issue.

The mass of the Moon is 7.35 x 10^22 kg. That's...that's such a huge number it's crazy. If we wanted to make a difference of a thousandth of a percent, we'd have to put 7,350,000,000,000,000 people on the Moon (average of 100kg each). Let's make that a little more accessible, since 7.35 quadrillion isn't a very easy number to wrap your head around (thanks to those who pointed out that I got the label wrong. Even after I thought I got it right again).

The Empire State Building weighs approximately 350,000 tons. That's 317,514,659 kg. If we wanted to change the mass of the Moon by 0.001%, it would take 2,314,853,752 Empire State Buildings added to the Moon. In other words, you'd have to build an entire Empire State Building for every 3 men, women and children _currently on Earth_ to make even that small change.

And then there's the question - why would we add that much mass to the Moon instead of using the materials already there to build what we need? It's extremely inefficient to take anything on Earth and put it on the Moon, so we'll probably just move people and a bit of initial material, and then build what we need with the rock and other materials on the Moon. 

And I think we're safe...the number of people above? That's enough people to cover the entire moon with over 190 people per square _meter_ of Moon surface, so it'd be pretty crowded.",0,1364667341,,0,1364715274,1,c95al98,t3_1bb7si,t1_c95al98,t3_1bb7si,,1431728837,1645,False,askscience,t5_2qm4e,1645

True,RandomPotato,Dog2,Dog,"Ok, so, I'm just going to assume you're like me a couple of months ago (which means you have trouble drawing stick figures). If you're better than this, I beg pardon.

Anywho, the most important thing is to draw. A lot. Seriously, practice. However, practicing the same mistakes, or having no idea what to do won't get you very far (at least it didn't get me anywhere). So, I'm just going to link to a few tutorials that others have done that helped me a lot when I first started drawing.

 http://www.reddit.com/r/furryartschool - A lot of people ask for criticisms here. I found by reading what 'professional' artists found issue with others art helped me diagnose problems in my own, which I then worked on fixing. Also, once you get a few drawings done, you could always post here and get helpful criticisms.

 http://hippie.nu/%7Eunicorn/tut/xhtml/ - This one covers everything from the absolute basics of drawing to advanced muscularture. Depending on how realistic you want your art to look, some of this may be a little much, but there are still good tips and tricks. Also, there are some exercises to practice on to build the basics and such.

 http://m.youtube.com/#/watch?v=Fn53RvibnnU&amp;desktop_uri=%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DFn53RvibnnU -This video is actually the one that personally helped me the most. It got me from those crappy stick figures to where people could at least tell what I was attempting to draw.

 http://www.dragoart.com/tuts/2872/1/1/how-to-draw-an-anthro-wolf.htm -This gives a good step by step of how to start at a line sketch to fleshing it out. It's good for proportionally drawing stuff.

 http://www.learn-to-draw.com/drawing-basics/06-drawing-elements.shtml -Finally, there's this thing. I'm not even gonna try to lie, there's so many pages here I have never even looked through them all. It was in my art bookmarks page though, so, ehh. Take that add you will.

Some other general tips that worked for at least me: 

1) Draw only one body part at a time till youre good at that. *Then* put it all together. It may look weird to have a bunch of sketches of left arms only, but it really helps once you get to full body. Then its mainly just a matter of proportion.

2) You may want to start by doing free hand copies of others work (always give accredititation though!). My thinking behind this is its easier to attempt to copy pics, then to use them solely as a reference, then just draw whatever you can think of. Pleaded note I specify free hand, don't just trace it.

3) Practice. Yes, I know I said it before, but its important. You won't get any better just by reading about it. It also helps you to develop your style.

Hope that helps, and sorry for the formatting. I'm on my phone and just plain didn't feel like it. Good luck with your SO also.

True,yajnavalkya,,,"As a young avant garde composer this is a topic in which I am very interested and I think it boils down to one real conflict. People who are ""serious"" about music have different desires than people who are casual music appreciators. 

The casual musician generally seems to want music to reflect emotional states that are parallel to their own. When somebody listens to a beautiful piece of music they hear it in terms of how it ""feels"" to them. There was a time in classical music where composers composed that way too. Every composer wanted to capture the depths of the human experience, and the most successful composers were specifically writing about their own painful love affairs and such. The romantic era, because of this, is basically the ticket seller of classical music. 

It actually is quite interesting, then, to compare the goals of various musicians. Before Beethoven, most composers were writing their music not to be listened to, but to be played. Playing music was considered a fun past time for the wealthy and only rarely would it be done for the sake of an audience. This performer centric view of music is why Mozart and Bach are generally considered to be musical geniuses, but are put on classical programs less often than Beethoven through Mahler. Especially in regards to their chamber music: their compositions weren't primarily about being listened to, they were about being played. Interestingly, there is a whole lost art in the performance of that music, but that's a discussion for another day.
 
Since the romantic era the goal of ""serious"" composers has changed yet again. If you spend a lot of time working with music, before long the idioms such as: major keys for joy; minor keys for sorrow; the cadence; solo violin for moments of emotional tension; fast 6/8 motives to represent water; etc; start to seem completely arbitrary. Why does any of that have to be? If I'm happy and I sit at the piano I could just as easily express my happiness by banging giant twelve tone clusters as playing a few chords in C major. And if you accept that happiness isn't innately related to Major chords, and could be just as well expressed by clusters, before long, even the idea of emotion in music starts to seem really petty. In my opinion, expressing emotion is actually not something that music is particularly good at, rather having emotions is something that audiences are really good at.

I stand by Stravinsky when he wrote: 

&gt;For I consider that music is, by its very nature, essentially powerless to express anything at all, whether a feeling, an attitude of mind, a psychological mood, a phenomenon of nature, etc. Expression has never been an inherent property of music. That is by no means the purpose of its existence. If, as is nearly always the case, music appears to express something, this is only an illusion and not a reality. It is simply an additional attribute which, by tacit and inveterate agreement, we have lent it, thrust upon it, as a label, a convention – in short, an aspect which, unconsciously or by force of habit, we have come to confuse with its essential being.""

The modern attitude becomes then: why use something as powerful as music for something as silly as a broken heart? Especially when it's such a trodden path. If you are claiming that your experience of a broken heart is unique and valuable and interesting, then you have to make it sound unique and valuable and interesting. But even then, I'd submit that the goal of using music to express something like that isn't worth your time, because music is capable of so much more.

Milton Babbitt wrote an infamous essay entitled ""The Composer as a Specialist,"" which was later retitled without his permission ""Who Cares if you Listen?"" This essay basically laid down the case for composers not as producers of popular music, but as an isolated community of scientists. The basic argument was that music is complex and interesting and composers are studying the very nature of music by composing, not producing music for consumption. If the general public is not expected to understand the workings of cutting edge quantum physics, why should they be expected to understand and appreciate the cutting edge of music?

And whether or not you agree with that idea as a goal, that's what happened. Music, due to it's astounding power and seemingly inexhaustible complexity, outgrew the idea of petty emotion. The composers who are on the cutting edge no longer have their own humanity in common with the average person, so the average person feels no compulsion to listen to them. Quite specifically because there is nothing there for them.

If you don't understand Milton Babbitt's music that's ok, because it wasn't for you in the first place. This is more nuanced than just saying Babbitt was an elitist, though he's been maligned that way since the essay was published. Instead Babbitt just recognized that music can be complex and if somebody wants to appreciate it they're going to have to learn a little bit first.

Finally, pop music is an interesting subject. There was always experimental pop music. We take it for granted nowadays, but the late 50s through early 70s were such a revolutionary time for pop music. And these moments of revolution show us that people want more than just the same thing over and over again. Naturally the Beatles got big on their love ballades, but it was the way that their love ballades were written that was so shocking to the older generation at the time. Furthermore, the anti-war music that was produced showed that people were ready for music to make a statement too, not just be a casual past time.

Today, the pop music industry has gotten more cynical. The statements have all been bought, and the industry has gotten amazingly good at marketing music as a product. And for the casual listener that is preferable, because pop music today is about getting the most dopamine for the least amount of listening effort. If you consider how easy it is to listen to 2-5 minutes of pop music and feel the same joy or heartbreak that Wagner would pull out of you over 4 hours then you can see why classical music frankly can't compete in today's world. And it's very hard to explain to a skeptic why 4 hours of Wagner is valuable if they can get the same emotional experience in 2 minutes. Unfortunately the nature of capitalism pits high art music in direct competition with the pop music industry and so they both can't really cohabitate completely. Which is too bad, because they both certainly deserve a place on this planet.

*tl;dr Modern concert music isn't for the average listener. Romantic music has the same goal as the average listener, but doesn't give nearly as much reward for the cost of listening as pop music. Classical music in general has too many different goals for it to have broad appeal. Classical music needs to be protected from competition better, but that certainly won't happen in America where it's hard to get people enough government support let alone art.*",0,1364672254,,0,1364722414,1,c95byag,t3_1b9dwi,t1_c95byag,t3_1b9dwi,,1431728195,78,False,composertalk,t5_2t4cu,78

The game allows full deck building and isn't limited like in Duels of the Planeswalkers game. Playing Magic Online is like playing paper MTG (But online).

You can buy booster pack that contains 15 random cards if you want. Booster packs are sold in official store and through merchants.

You can also join in tournaments, events and compete for prizes like booster packs.

The currency mainly used in this game for trading is called ""Event Tickets"" or just ""tix"". Each tix sells for $1. So if you want to buy cards from merchants, you will need Event Tickets that you can buy directly from official Magic Online store with Credit-Card/PayPal (You can even sell rare cards that you have to merchant bots in exchange for tix).

There's free trial mode that doesn't require account registration, you can download the client and try it first. But you will be matched against other trial players and there are only pre-constructed decks that you can't customize. But if you want to see how the game works and if the UI is okay for you then you should check it out.

True,albertcamusjr,,,"I am in pediatrics so my experience is sightly different. They actually do teach this process during medical education. During the first two years of medical school almost all time is spent in classroom lectures, small groups, etc. In one of those courses you should receive a lecture on how to do it - ours was titled ""Breaking Bad News"" (which I think is now a Bryan Cranston website).  You will also typically watch a video on how it can be done with both good and bad examples.

Later in the pre-clinical years (still years 1 and 2) my school had a workshop that involved breaking bad news to trained actors/actresses who were supposed to react in different ways. This to get us accustomed to the practice of it.

In our clinical years (third and fourth year of medical school) it is incredibly rare for a medical student to break bad news, but they are often present when an attending physician (think Dr. Cox in the first season of Scrubs) has to give bad news to a patient. During this third and fourth year you become increasingly comfortable talking to patients and their families and increasingly comfortable with inherently uncomfortable situations.

Then you go off to residency. Even in residency for at least the first year or two it will be quite unlikely that you break truly bad news to a patient. (Although my first true experience was during my first year of residency; I had to tell parents their child's heart had stopped and we were performing CPR). For the most part though you'll begin breaking lesser degrees of bad news. Think telling somebody they have to stay an extra day in the hospital instead of telling somebody they have renal cell carcinoma. The majority of seriously bad news is still likely to be given by the attending physician or the fellow.

Enter the fellow. Fellowship is done after residency when you choose to even further specialize in your field. For instance I did my residency in pediatrics and then sought further training in pediatric critical care.  A fellow is like a step between the resident world and the attending world. By the end of fellowship you should be capable of delivering any and all bad news.

Now as to the actual method of how it is done, there is actually a pretty good algorithm to follow (and, obviously, it is always incredibly important to ""read the room""). The best case scenario would be for a physician to have a long term relationship with a patient and before any bad situation arises have ALREADY ASKED ""How would you prefer I deliver bad news to you?"" This almost never happens. In critical care you almost never have a previous relationship with the patient, so this is an unlikely luxury. You are coming in to a bad situation and have no previous relationship with these people. It can be a daunting task, so it is best to have a plan. Here is my own basic process (and an adaptation of a six-step process a lot of people are formally taught) (keep in mind I deal with parents typically):

1. **Ensure a private environment**, only the people who need to be present should be.
-For me this typically involves sitting down the parents and only the parents. Or legal guardian, if that may be the case. Quite regularly we will leave the children out of the discussion (and quite frequently for me they are often physically/mentally incapable of participating anyway) until they are in early adolescence. (Some families, against my recommendations, will never deliver the full bad news to their children.)

2. **Set the stage / Calm the scene**
-This basically involves making sure the parents' (or the patient's) basic needs are met and they are somewhat comfortable. ""How are you feeling right now?"" ""Can we get you anything to drink?"" etc. Everyone should be seated, including the doctor. You should be at eye-to-eye level. They already feel vulnerable. No need to stand above them.

3. **Find out what they think already**
-Often people know they are about to receive devastating news. When they say it out loud first it can really help the process. So I just say ""Tell me what you understand is happening right now."" Or something close to that. They almost invariably say ""Something bad is happening"" **Quite Frequently Steps 2 and 3 Overlap**

4. **Fire a warning shot**
-This is simply confirming what they have already guessed. You say something along the lines of ""Yes, you are correct. I'm afraid I have some very difficult news for you"" or, hopefully, something a little less plastic-y than that. But it is important to never mince words. The news is bad news and it is unjust to misrepresent the bad news.

5. Allow them some time to react and then **Tell them the news** - ""Timmy has a bleed in his brain"" ""The bullet went into Jenny's heart"" ""Craig stopped breathing for a long time"" Or whatever. My own touch is that I always use the patient's name. It makes it more personal. This is my own preference stemming from when I received bad news about a family member when I was an adolescent and the physician only said ""He"" or ""Your husband"" (to my mom). It did not settle well with me. I want the family to know that I see the patient as a person, especially in this bad time. Knowing their name and who the patient is shows at least a modicum of empathy.

6. **Allow them more time to react** Grieving (which has likely already started) continues and intensifies. This is a time of crying/hugging... sometimes gnashing/wailing.

7. Eventually they will be ready to ask questions, so **Answer their Questions**

8. Then **clean up** -Explain anything you think is important that they might not have asked. Offer them emotional support - your own and *professional* emotional support as well. Find out what resources they need, what they have. Anticipate challenges they will face. Tell the family what to expect next. **Sometimes step 8 happens before step 7** it just depends on how the family is reacting. But if you move on too quickly I can guarantee you they will comprehend nothing of what you say.

I am sorry that got so long. I hope it helps having one view point.

True,sucksqueezebangfart,,,"9 years ago I was driving down a major highway on a Sunday afternoon with moderate traffic. A lady in a RAV-4 cuts me off while I was changing lanes. I quickly get back in my original lane and my car starts to fish tail. I regain control and then out of nowhere the back end just swings around. I whack the median that is abut 4 inches off the ground. While I'm starting to spin in the middle of the highway I just think to my self ""aw man. now I'll know what it's like to be hit by multiple cars"". I finally come to a stop facing the wrong way....and no one hit me. Everyone stopped. To this day I am still amazed.

**EDIT** 
Unreal how many times this similar situation happened to people. I would also like to add that on the very same road at about the very same spot ON a Sunday afternoon I had a piece of furniture fall out of my truck that no one hit. Someone up above is keeping a handle on my stupidity...because I sure can't.

True,fly_bird,,,"I grew up in a very religious home. I've read the bible, not all of it though (But I have read most of it and have been studying it since I was old enough to do so). My dad was a pastor for almost 20 years at a Southern Bible Church. Also, I am not good at collecting my thoughts, so bare with me. 

I have agnostic and atheist friends, that's cool. I understand why they don't believe. We have talked about my faith and why they don't believe. I never invited them to church, but told them if they were ever curious then they were more than welcome to join me. They told me a couple times that they would come with me, but they never actually followed through. For the most part, they grew up in an overbearing religious family (their words). 

My family was, like I said, very ""religious."" I don't really like to use that word. It makes it sound so... I don't know... exclusive and methodical. If that makes sense. Christianity, to me, is not like other religions. I am always willing to learn about other religions. I am just a curious person. But with every other religion out there, from what I understand, one needs to work to get to heaven (or whatever they believe life after death is). Christianity is based on grace. Simply put: A free gift that we do not deserve. That gift being eternal life. I screw up on a daily basis, I ask for forgiveness, and yes I am forgiven because of His sacrifice. But that doesn't mean I can just go around being bad, asking for forgiveness and BAM I'm good. God has given me the greatest gift anyone could ever ask for, and I am supposed to be grateful and share that with everyone I possibly can. I have seen God work in so many ways throughout my 22 years, especially in my family. I have seen him emotionally change people, cure people, and help financially (through other people). And please don't tell me the doctors cured the people, because in the few cases I am talking about, doctors had not been involved in treatment yet. Oh man I almost forgot. LIFE! Geez, EVERY day I look at the sun, the clouds, the sky, the trees and just think of how perfect everything works together. I mean our ecosystem, it is truly amazing! The fact that the earth is even inhabitable is just crazy to me, without divine intervention, I really don't see how any of that would be possible. The way our brains work, our eyes, our senses... man. Senior year of highschool I lost two very good Christian friends. One in a car crash and one to cancer. My friend that died of cancer was a few years younger than me and she felt great comfort of knowing that she was going to be with our Maker soon. So even if I am in her same situation, I know that I will feel that same comfort someday, I won't want people to mourn my death, but to celebrate that I am in a different, much better place, and to take comfort in the fact that they will see me again some day. I see God's creation everywhere and I am constantly in awe of it. from the molecular level to the stars, it is a constant reminder to me that there is someone bigger than myself taking care of everything, and it is that sense of comfort that helps me get through my day. Sorry for rambling... but I think I answered the question. 

TL;DR I ramble about how God is cool.  

EDIT: I do not have any official schooling in the theological matters. So I will stop attempting to answer questions. I am sure a few others can answer much better than I could attempt. Also, can we keep this civil? Religion doesn't always have to get heated.

True,punkwalrus,,,"My dad was abusive.  He didn't physically beat me up much, but when he did, it was usually quick.  Like **BAM** and it was over.  Once he hit me so hard in the face, in knocked my chair back and I split my head on a hutch behind me.  No hospital visit for me, my mom just stuck a bandaid on it.  For the next 9 years, the wound kept coming open when it got hit hard.  Now my skull has this thick ridge where it finally healed over.  I hope I don't go bald, I'll look like a retarded Klingon.  Another time, my dad threw me down a flight of stairs.  I actually got nothing more than huge bruises.

But the one that I'll never forget, the one I thought, ""This is it, this is how I die,"" was when the social workers started sniffing around.  My mother was the one who did all the cover up stuff.  Not because she was mean or disliked me, but she lived in a kind of apologetic world trying to show everyone marrying my dad was not a mistake.  But things were starting to turn on this poor ruse (partially because my mother was also an alcoholic who had a tendency to get chatty and despondent when she was drinking).  I was 12 or 13, sometime in junior high when things started to get heavy.  

It started as it usually did, I had shitty grades.  Well, they weren't THAT shitty, like a C+ average, but my dad had this attitude that anything less than an A was despicable.  At some point I made the mistake of gaining a spine and saying his verbal abuse wasn't going to magically get me good grades.  He laughed and said, ""Sure it will!"" in his derisive, mocking tone.  So then I said the worst thing I could have at this moment, ""That's not how Mrs. Long sees it.""  Mrs. Long was the school social worker, and my tone was not pathetic but defiant.

He fucking snapped.  He started wailing on me.  Just *beating* me like a fucking ragdoll.  Now, I had a lot of bullies in school, so I did what I usually did: dropped to the ground, put my back against the wall and covered my face with my forearms.  But unfortunately, I had dropped to the ground in front of the dining room table.  My back was to a table leg, so when he started kicking me, it uncurled me with my spine against the leg, and then he'd kick me in the ribs, and when I tried to cover my chest, he'd kick me in the face.  So it was either chest, face, or spine.  Sadly, after a few blows to the head, I was seeing amber stars, so I wasn't thinking clearly.  

But when I saw his face... it wasn't a face of anger.  It was a face of joy.  His face was lit up like a toddler laughing at a clown.  He was kicking me and kicking me, laughing and giggling at my screams for him to stop, and he'd mock my screams like they were the *funniest thing ever*.  

I knew it.  I was done.  I was going to die.  I couldn't cover all my body, so in the end I'd cover my face with my forearms, just letting him kick me in the ribs over and over, pushing my spine painfully against that table leg.  I just prayed that when my ribcage broke, he punctured my heart and it would be over quick.  But my rib cage and spine held, and eventually he stopped, threw my school books at me, and told me something like, ""and now you're going to have to do your homework in PAIN!  How's that, you little dummy?  Didn't think that out, huh?  Dummy!"" and laughed.  When I didn't get up, he half-heartedly kicked me some more, and said he'd let me lay there, but I better do my homework on the floor.

I lay there for a while.  I couldn't breathe.  I was gasping for air, sort of half wailing and crying, half wheezing.  Snot and blood covered my face.  Eventually, in a lot of pain, I got up, and saw my mother standing there, looking at me.  I screamed at her with what breath I still had ""why didn't you DO something???""  And I never forgot her face.  It was blank.  Now I know she was in shock, but then I felt so betrayed.  She had no answer.  She eventually just walked back to the kitchen and went to finish dinner. Later she covered this up with, ""well, I couldn't hear what you were saying,"" but even her own voice seemed to belie that was a stupid excuse.

I managed to make it to the bathroom, and coughed and vomit up bloody and sticky strands.  My chest *ached* and I could barely breathe.  Everything was in red and amber, and I saw dots of bright light.  At some point my mother found me hunched over the toilet bowl, sobbing.  She put a cold towel on the back on my neck, cleaned up the toilet bowl, and my face.  ""You're not the only one that suffers when you get hurt,"" she said.  I think she meant it in a supportive way, not like she was making it all about her.

Later, social services did get involved and I got some help.  I got some therapy, and my dad had a kind of mild restraining order put on him that said we were allowed to be in the same house, but he was not allowed to be with me alone. Sadly, in my senior year of high school, my mother took her own life, and I have to graduate high school crashing at friend's houses.  My dad and I do not speak.

I still suffer from breathing issues.  He damaged my lungs and diaphragm pretty badly, but I don't know how badly because they were fairly healed by the time I became an adult.  It may be the root of my asthma, but who knows.

""Anime Fans generally have a favourite type of anime and will watch that type for the most part, very rarely switching it up. They will talk about it with their other friends, however, if they do not mention it you would have NO FRIGGIN IDEA.

Anime Nerds for the most part, will watch anything that is suggested to them, and discuss it as functioning human beings. Nerds may cosplay at various conventions and the like, but it is contained to said conventions. You may also notice subtle hints that they are a nerd, like a watch or a wallet from a specific anime, so you can tell they enjoy it without being overwhelmed by it.

Now, anime 'kids' are the non-functioning fucking retarded anime fans that seem to travel in packs that have a collective IQ of 7. You can tell an anime kid is an anime kid from miles away, as they're usually the one rocking a naruto headband and random ass cosplay EVERY. DAMN. DAY. They generally cannot form thoughts that aren't anime related, believe themselves to be in actual loving relationships with anime characters, and are more or less pathetic excuses of people. They will constantly talk in Japanese to prove how 'smart' they are LIKE OMGTHATSSOKAWAIIDESUNE!!?!?! fuck off. The majority of anime kids are are combination of fat, terrible looking, unfortunate looking, smelly or so fucking awkward it makes your heart die a little just to see them. They're the ones that when you see walk into an art store (like I used to work) or anywhere else that sells manga/supplies you RUN LIKE THE WIND BULLSEYE and get the fuck out before they wrangle you and try to convince you that anime is life; there is no other way to live, and that they're SUCH A GOOD ARTIST, THEY DRAW EVERY DAY.

I selfishly wanted something that would love me because it was the only thing it ever knew, something vaguely tabula rasa, a little animal I would watch grow into a big, sleek cat.

There was an eight year old longhair in a cage way off to the side with bright red stickers all over his cage. ""WARNING"" ""AGGRESSIVE"" ""DO NOT TOUCH"" ""DO NOT STICK HANDS IN BARS"". He was beautiful. He was the cat that super-villains bought to pet ominously in large, consuming leather chairs. His eyes were the most striking feature, bright gold with a slight ring of emerald around the iris. He stared half-lidded at me for about five seconds, after which he stood, stretched, and thumped his head against the bars. His tail was orange along with the bottom of his right ear and made him look like those were the parts of him that had escaped the bleach dip. 

I stood there petting him through the cage bars in the way every label said I shouldn't until I guess I caught the attention of a volunteer.

""He's letting you pet him?""

""Yeah.""

She stared at me like she was looking for blood. ""I think you need to get this one,"" she tried, warily.

""Probably.""

He's ten years old now and he's starting to get feline dementia. He'll stare at corners as if he's hunting ghosts and wail in the middle of the night from my living room -- terrified that I've gone away. He's a velcro cat, always somewhere close when I'm awake. He won't drink water out of anything but one of my mugs. After the first two days he became the chattiest cat I've ever had, sitting and telling me about his hard-knock life of sleeping and pooping and eating.

I don't think I'll ever get a kitten now. I don't know how much longer I'll have with him but it's probably been the happiest two years I've ever had with an animal.

&gt; Captioned photos are not a teaching tool

Yes, they can be, and are.  To risk being pedantic about your point, textbook diagrams are ""captioned photos"", and are used as teaching tools in books made specifically *for* teaching.  Anything can be a teaching tool.  It's the context in which they're used that determines their worth.  For example...

[This is a diagram from a textbook.](http://astro.wsu.edu/worthey/astro/html/im-sky/moon-phases.gif)

[This is a meme, a captioned picture, not at all unlike the pictures that are linked on the IFLS Facebook page.](http://www.doctormadscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/funny-science-news-experiments-memes-close-enough11.jpeg)

All have actual scientific fact in them--the only difference is they use humor to impart that knowledge (whether or not the humor or the knowledge is the point of the image is up for debate, however).

Point being--even if they cannot *accurately* sum up an idea in 8 or less words, or are intended as a joke, I'd argue that's not the point of their existence.  Something like the above may just be the hook that gets some kid (or adult!) to wonder exactly *why* the liquid maintains a constant volume.  They have merit, though admittedly should be taken with a grain of salt.

Also, one final point... 

&gt; there are tons of resources available to show applications or the fundamentals. They're everywhere.

They're ""everywhere"" if you know where to look.  That's why having easily accessible outreach pages like IFLS, even if they're not the most pure example of the disciplines, are so important.

True,AnonJian,,,"&gt;Stage 0] No money. No company. No Product. No experience. No contacts.

It would be smart of Bob to use meeting one to discuss if this is an auspicious start -- or a recipe for failure. First step being advice on getting a related job which would allow Bob to get firsthand knowledge of 1)Imprinted goods 2)Money. 

Jeb should point out what kills business is 1) No money. 2) Ignorance. 

&gt;Bob has a legitimate company, to handle the sale of basketballs, that is on reasonably good terms with the IRS and the like.

If Bob has a legitimate sales rep, meeting two is how to fulfill an order and how to deal with buyers. That takes money, if nothing else. First thing a buyer is likely to ask is ""can you fulfill."" Meaning can you supply a 200 ... or 500  ....or 1,500 chain outlet? And restock if the product sells. 

Next question a buyer is going to ask is ""Who else bought, and where's the market demand?"" A buyer for a chain store is not a river boat gambler out to give the little guy a break. This is where having a job at, for instance, an imprinter who already supplies chain stores solves Bob's problem. 

Given stage zero, Bob's third meeting should be about how to work within a company as an intrapreneur and sell the company first on Bob as a source of product ideas, then second on licensing or getting a commission on this as a first product. 

What's this do? First it grounds Bob in reality. Next it presents Bob with the problem of *what comes next.* One product -- especially this -- does not a company make. Buyers also want a continuing source of new product ideas.

In addition to providing a whole product line, having a company already doing business with buyers solves huge marketing and manufacturing problems for Bob. One being getting that first sale. Next, success or failure, it gets Bob's focus off what he wants to sell and into the psychology of *who's buying what.*

Major failure point of entrepreneurs is being a student of products, of supply, of invention. Entrepreneurs should study markets instead. Final twenty minutes of this meeting should strive for the beginnings of a competitive advantage and positioning or unique selling proposition. 

Fourth meeting, Bob should ask about how to negotiate -- the art of the deal. Entrepreneurs are horrible at deal structure and don't think in terms of what's in it for the guy they are dealing with. This solves huge problems in everything from employee or dealer negotiation to venture capital negotiation for starting your own company. 

The classic concept of the entrepreneur was a scrappy deal-maker and contact maker. Resilient and adept at the quick thinking needed to upend a business model to succeed. Thick skinned. Sales savvy. Able to turn on a dime. 

Now an entrepreneur is a precious snowflake. No experience. Less knowledge. Zero contacts. With two things: Blind unwarranted optimism and a 'big idea.' In love with their untested, unproven idea. Ignorant of its flawed execution. Intractable. Entitled. Touchy. 

A precious snowflake entrepreneur won't sit still for meetings with Jeb or put up with my advice. They'll go straight to kickstarter. That's why there's no kicstarter meeting -- money doesn't wear an ""I'm With Stupid"" t-shirt. Bob's task is finding out why he has no money ...that's the symptom, not the cause. 

Meeting five should be about big idea syndrome and how to avoid it. This idea lacks competitive advantage. It lacks much barrier to competition. It has no unique selling proposition. There is little room for profit and zero margin for error. 

Heck; any Google search turns up companies who imprint basketballs already. The instant a whiff of success wafts over to them, they'll be competition. That's why you go with an existing company and shove as many of these as you can out to as many stores as you can, in the shortest time possible. 

Big ideas are notorious for getting ripped off -- because they are singular ideas. Better to have at least a dozen smaller ideas; each carefully constructed to support the other ideas. 

It's harder for copycats to tease out success factors this way. And because they are lazy, when copycats don't find something simple to rip off they look elsewhere. Today, that's a key source of competitive advantage. 

That's why there is no meeting for copyright, patent, or any other kind of protection. If the phrase is original, copyright is a moot point -- it's protected. Two minutes on making this official with a filing is one minute too long. Nobody is going to pay attention to your 'protection.' Speed is your protection in this case.

True,no_moon_at_all,,,"Meh. If we're going to get all metaphysical here, determinism is better for you overall.

At first you make a decision using the mindset and information available to you at that moment. Later, you have another mindset/new information which would have led to your making a different decision. You feel regret.

But you didn't have that information back then. You couldn't have. Even if you ""knew"" X was ""wrong"" at the time, you clearly didn't think so for some other reason which you have either forgotten about or now consider invalid. Some part of you might have thought as you do now, but it was clearly not given enough mental clout to be the leading factor in your decision making - because you didn't have the experience to know that part of you was right.

Regret serves a purpose, but it shouldn't be a purpose in itself. It can drive you to make the right decision, but if you dwell on it you might go too far. There's no sense worrying over something you can't affect. Recognize there is a lesson and then prove to yourself that, beyond the lesson, any more regret will be acting against you, when it should be acting for you.

Thanks for all your great comments and feedback! Here are the changes in this version:

* Fixed the spelling of Rosalind's name (Reapinghavoc, Microfoot)
* Added the year line for 1913 (Microfoot)
* Added a through-line to highlight the path followed in the game (PooveyFarmsRacer)
* Added a legend
* Moved ""The Hall of Heroes is burned down"" from A1 to A2 (lolmaster2000)
* Some other small changes
* Added a couple more in-depth details in the form of sidenotes (I figured sidenotes/footnotes are a good way to add extra details without crowding the actual timeline too much).

I was born...odd. If I was bored, I couldn't think. Imagine marching under water, the pressure working against you, slowing each step. The feeling of drowning...

That was what it was like to think my way through homework, or pay attention in class. I aced every test, but only because they were exciting, a change of pace and a sudden challenge... 

Normal ADHD, right? Except I had another condition, one which kept me from connecting my thoughts into cause and effect. Studying psychology helped, but people still struggled to understand me, because my conversations were as linear and clear as Robin Williams arguing with all the voices in your head. 

It would later develop into disorganized schizophrenia. But before that...

When I was given ritalin and seroquel...

Holy shit. Suddenly, everything in the world made sense. Cause and effect. I could see the conversation openings that were meant to invite me inside friendships, flirt back with people I didn't notice were flirting before, and become an actual paid artist, because out of nowhere, I developed the ability to draw light textures and complex shadows, and all in perspective. I could move images in my head, as if controlling a camera in a videogame.

But that was nothing.

My talent for being random and incoherent became a stand up comedy routine that won me a standing ovation when singing karoke at a bar. It was a rush like drugs, religion, sex, and a white water rapids ride. The greatest compliment I've ever received came from the guy who complained he had to follow me. 

Too bad there was a time limit to all this fun. 

My thoughts were organized...and then they started to cluster together. Crystal clear sentences became beautiful, but obscure metaphor...it was a fight to talk like anything other than a gothic fairy tale. It was humiliating. Some people loved the style, but it was the only style I had, where once I could imitate all kinds of speech...

And then the metaphors were slowly fading. And then I lost the ability to count syllables and write poetry and songs. And then I lost peace of mind, my thoughts shattering into splinters...

Soon I was struggling with word choice and sentence structure again, and outside of the internet, where I could reconstruct my thoughts as if working on a puzzle, I became thought simple...

Friends and family related to me as if I was a child.

Flowers for Algernon still hurts to read. It's too close to home.

Apologies, for ending it on that note. I'm trying to keep this post short. I'm skipping over a lot of terrifying shit that happened, and also some of the best parts of the experience...

True,whalemango,,,"In World War II, there was a Spanish spy named Joan Pujol Garcia who approached the Allies to work for them. When they refused, he approached the Nazis, and they accepted him (giving him the codename Arabel). Once he earned credentials working as a Nazi spy, he approached the Allies again, this time getting a job as a double agent (codenamed Garbo).

This is where it gets unbelievable: he fed the Germans a combination of mis-information, true but useless information, and high-value information that always got to the Germans just a little too late. He even started a spy network consisting of 27 sub-agents of his own. Keep in mind that not a single one of these sub-agents existed. They were completely imaginary, but regardless, he submitted expense reports for them and had the Nazis giving him money to pay their salaries. At one point, when he had to explain why some high-value information got to the Germans late, he told them that one of his spies had died. He actually got the Germans to pay the imaginary spy's imaginary wife a very real pension for her loss.  Not only did his false information get the Nazis to waste millions of dollars, but he was also instrumental in convincing the Nazis that the attacks on D-Day were just a diversion, and the real attack was yet to come, keeping vital German resources away from the front lines.

He is one of the only people to ever get an Iron Cross from the Germans (which required Hitler's personal authorization, since he wasn't a soldier) AND an MBE from King George VI.

Okay so the people involved with this joke/potentially real team is an ex-F1 Driver/businessman, his wife and her agency. It is also to be noted that Wurz in the past has been linked to trying to save F1 teams such as HRT (which was denied). Also if a US based team is started, he might be one of the people working in it which has been rumored before.

True,[deleted],,,"Now it's pretty straightforward, and there is no one right way.  Here is what I do:

- set the camera to a low ISO (each camera has a ""sweet spot"", I think mine's around ISO 160) and a reasonable aperture.  I use bulb mode, so it's good to have a remote which supports that.
- Focus the camera on a spot you like using a torch.  I use spot focus, most DSLRs have this as an option.  
- Slowly light out the areas you want to ""paint"" in smooth, even strokes, circles, spirals, whatever.  You have to experiment here.  This is why the Lenser I linked to above is great, you can zoom into the distance.  Remember that you'll need less lighting time for closer objects than for further ones.
- I use the really crazy powerful 1400L focusing torches to light out distant tunnels.
- Don't hesitate to shoot many many pics of a given place.  Light up individual areas, side tunnels, nooks, crannies, etc.  in different pictures (this is why you have the tripod and the remote - so your scene does not change).  This will allow you to selectively paint different parts of a scene.  I'll get to the ""why"" below.
- Shoot RAW if you can.  Do it anyway.  Bring more cards if you have to.  
- If you use flash or a very strong torch, try to avoid direct lighting.  Use bounce flash, lightbox, etc. - I often use my flash gun to manually light up areas in strobe mode.  Other people swear by flash remotes (PocketWizard = Ugh Eek $$$$$$), a friend of mine loves his Yong Nuo RF602, I have no experience with it plus I am shit at flash anything.
- I like to wear a white shirt or t-shirt.  Who cares about getting filthy - it lets you bounce your flash or strong torches off your shirt, giving a warmer light.
- avoid directly pointing flash or light at anything directly to keep it from being blown out.
- a friend of mine likes the technique of slowly walking down a hallway away from the camera, with a petroleum lamp in front of him, shielded from the camera by his body.  That way he's gotten some amazing shots.  Me, I usually fuck it up.  [In this picture](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kosmograddotnet/7039069057/in/set-72157629360406532/lightbox/) I had to manually ""rebuild"" the left track in Photoshop because I walked too slowly and caught ghosts on the pic.
- You can also walk around out of sight and selectively light up an area - [like in this pic here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kosmograddotnet/6379769215/in/set-72157628088473225).  Don't be afraid to mix and match different light tones, like the warmth of candles or incandescent torches and cold LED/flash.  Experiment!
- Work with indirect lighting.  [This one](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kosmograddotnet/6998351549/in/set-72157629623250705/lightbox/) is one of my favorite pics of all time, that's the Petromax behind the door.  [Here is another one I like](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kosmograddotnet/6741475701/in/set-72157628979326517/lightbox/), this one with a torch hidden behind a rock.
- Take lots of time, but don't focus on banal stuff right away, take lots of pictures quickly on your first run through, then double back and take more time to shoot the good stuff.  That's a mistake I always make.
- Photoshop content aware fill is black magic.  Learn it.  You will end up with ghosts, light squiggles, whatsit, not to mention bits of trash that annoy you in post.
- Remember the ""take lots of pics of the same scene"" bit?  Learn to stack in Photoshop, and to mask. I like stacking semi-opaque layers.  You'll have to play around.  Do yourself a favor and figure out lens profile correction in Lightroom and do this on all elements of a stack before you load them into PS, it'll make adjusting for distortion much easier if you have a wide angle/fisheye.  [This pic](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kosmograddotnet/6351882078/in/set-72157628019117895/lightbox/) consists of about 20-25 stacked pics, and cost me more goddamned nerves in post - I could have done it in five if I'd had more of a clue, and spent more time on the other shots in [the set](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kosmograddotnet/sets/72157628019117895/) (which are admittedly pretty mediocre).

True,Shurikane,,,"I was gonna do a point-form list but instead I'll go with an analogy.

Several hundred kids are brought to a lake set deep within a circular cliffside.  They are thrown into the lake with no prior information on how to swim, and once it's all done the attendants at the top of the cliff turn away and have a smoke and a coffee while not giving a single fuck about what's around them.  Down below the kids struggle to figure out how to stick their heads above the water, some of them climbing on top of other kids to stay up or just because they decided that guy deserved to drown.

There's a few un-inflated swim-aids floating around but nobody's been told what these do, let alone the climbing equipment over on the side, to better get out of the lake and up the cliff.  Everytime a kid grabs a swim-aid however he is summarily dunked under the surface and soon a few kids hoard all the swim-aids despite doing nothing with them.  Suddenly there are shouts as they spot a kid who has snuck out, climbing up the cliff with his bare hands, escaping the lake with bloody limbs.  The kids down below greet the sight by yelling insults at him.

Within hours, a large portion of the kids have drowned and the water has turned murky because everyone dumped bladder and bowels alike into it, turning the whole place into a filth-infested cesspool.  Now and then another kid manages to sneak out of harm's way, one of them even figures out the swim-aids and the climbing equipment to make his escape easier.  Unfortunately, that kid runs up to the attendants to ask why they hadn't explained those useful tools since they're such a tremendous help - and the attendants respond by picking him up and throwing him right back into the lake where he is summarily drowned by his vengeful peers.

As the sun begins to set, the attendants drop a bunch of ladders down the cliff and yell at all the kids to use those to get out.  Following that, they proudly announce to the kids that they've just learned to swim.  As for the drowned, they open a mass grave, dump the bodies in it, and since they've had a lot of coffee over the day they take a leak into the grave before covering it up and leaving it unmarked.

Happy that they've taught the kids how to swim, they then tell them they're ready for the real world, and so they ferry them all onto a boat and proceed to dump them all in the middle of the ocean before speeding away.

3.

To put it another way, I saved up all of my spare money in the earliest months of my young adulthood, to afford the pair of 19"" LCD's.  With deep discount, they cost me about $730 out the door. I kid you not, I saw *my* model of LCD display available at my local Goodwill in 2010, sitting on a shelf and marked for $30. You wouldn't believe how quickly this stuff is succeeded in the market.

True,yetkwai,,,"If it were 4chan, I would have just called you a fag and not bothered explaining the meaning of the word.

The act of penetration is very important in our psyche. But because of political correctness, we often get a conflict between how we're thinking, and how we think about words. We want words to apply to either gender, so we try to change the definitions.

Think about cases were a teacher has sex with an under age student. When it's a female teacher and a male student, our reaction is ""heh, nice going"" or ""he's living every teen aged boy's fantasy"". But if it's a male teacher? Holy shit, lock that pervert up for life!

Why is this? Because deep down we know the act of penetration is what's significant. Teenage boy penetrates his teacher, we shrug it off. The boy wasn't violated. Male teacher penetrates one of his students, he has violated them.

So a woman that allows herself to be penetrated by many men? She's a slut. A gay man that allows himself to be penetrated by many men? He's a slut. 

But a man that penetrates many others? Sure you can call him a slut, but no one really takes that description seriously. We just laugh it off. Why? Because we all, deep down, know he did not allow himself to be penetrated. 

Now think of a dominatrix. She may force men (or women) to perform all kinds of kinky sex acts. But if she does not allow them to penetrate her, we would not consider her a slut. It just doesn't fit, right?

Yeah, you're going to call me a misogynist pig or whatever, but everyone knows that the true definition of ""slut"" is ""a person that allows them self to be penetrated with very little discretion"".

Maybe its not fair that this word, for the most part, can only be applied to women and gay men. Maybe it's a ""bad word"" and we shouldn't use it at all. But trying to deny the real definition of the word doesn't change it. You can try to apply it to a heterosexual male, but everyone will just laugh. ""yeah, I'm a slut, hahaha"".

So define the word however you please. We all know the definition that everyone is thinking.

True,FrostMonstreme,,,"True about the BOR -- I almost went into a discussion of that in my original comment, but didn't want to go off on the Federalists v. the Antifederalists.  Suffice it to say, though, that the Antifederalists made a lot of very insightful points.

Regarding wants vs. needs:

Nobody needs anything in a vacuum.  Do you need food?  Yeah, if you want to live.  If you don't want to live, you don't need food.  A need is always contingent on a desire.

Given this definition of need, there are many times you would ""need"" a fully automatic weapon.  Maybe you have the desire to shoot one because you think they are more awesome than other guns.  Then you need one to fulfill that desire.  Maybe you like the moddability of the ar-15, and other guns don't fit the bill; then you need one.  

I don't think Piers is talking about needs, as such.  Instead, he appears to be saying that the only reason to _desire_ an automatic weapon--NB, I doubt he knows what an automatic weapon is, but I'm playing along--is to perform mass-murder.  Well, as a descriptive statement, this is just untrue; there are lots of other reasons to desire these cool guns.  

As a normative statement, of course desiring mass murder (i.e. with the intent to act on it, not idly thinking about it) is illegitimate; but it is fallacious to thereby conclude that desiring automatic weapons is illegitimate.  The trick is to narrow the range of possible reasons you could want an automatic weapon to one very improbable, and illegitimate desire, denounce that desire, and attempt to draw a false equivalency between this desire and a tool that could be used to achieve it.

The trick is more obvious the more familiar you are with the object at issue.  If I said, ""arsonists always use fire to burn people to death in their homes, therefore we should ban fire, there is no other reason to use fire,"" the trick would be obvious, because fire is a commonplace.  Piers is trading on the ignorance of most of his fans about guns, and the desires of the people who want them.  

Moreover, he is inviting us into a world--to the extent that we're not already there--where the government decides which objects are legitimate to desire, shorn of all relation to acts that cause harm.  It's totemic thinking, magical thinking, shamanic thinking, pre-logical, pre-Enlightenment, pre-Glorious Revolution thinking.  It's not thinking at all, it's emoting; instead of Pavlov ringing a bell, the media shows pictures of bloody children and then shows pictures of guns, therefore, _the desire for guns kills children_.

Essentially, a matter traffic jam many magnitudes worse than all the rush-hours on Earth combined forms (an accretion disc), and the friction from all the jostled molecules and atoms struggling to dump their gravitational potential energy and inch *that much closer* to the black hole heats up the entire disc to ridiculous temperatures.

If the infalling matter wasn't already a plasma, it is now! And being plasma, it's beholden to all the peculiarities of plasma physics. The particles begin to interact and flow--magnetic fields are generated.

This is important, because once you're in the disc, you can't get out easily. You can't fall in faster because you hit those ahead of you in line, and you can't bust out the way you came because even though you're at a ridiculously high temperature and thus should have the energy to make an escape, there are way too many particles behind you that will absorb your energy before you make it very far. And angular momentum keeps you further locked down to the plane of the disc. Why? Think about those nifty experiments where you hold a spinning bike wheel and try to twist it around: that resistance you feel? That's what a particle has to deal with, except the accretion disc is spinning a *hell* of a lot faster than what even a dead Founding Father of the United States of America can muster in his grave.

The magnetic field propels particles out of the disc and toward the poles. As it turns out, a lot of matter is stolen this way, and so the ratio of what escapes the disc compared to what falls in the hole is surprisingly high. But what happens to all this stolen matter?

Think about a spring in a can. Someone before you has already used their strength to cram the spring in, and then successfully put a lid on it. Opening the lid would thus release the spring, and perhaps be cause for a lawsuit against the person who left a loaded spring in a can just lying around.

The friction of the accretion disc has crammed a lot of energy into the matter spiraling in towards the black hole, but the environment has done a good job holding that matter in check...until it gets chucked off by the field and reaches the poles.

The poles are weak points in the field that are the equivalent of opening the canned spring once this superheated plasma hits it. There's finally enough energy and enough of an absence of resistance for the plasma to explosively spew out both poles of the black hole at near light speed, like a hapless tourist who accidentally drank the water in Mexico.

The energy release is enormous. The matter at the poles shines across the entire EM spectrum, from gamma all the way down to radio waves. These jets of matter will travel for light-years, the grand pillars of radiative destruction slowly dissipating into the interstellar medium, but still ""visible"" large-scale due to the retained heat of the plasma. Any poor bastard star systems who find themselves within a certain distance of the originating jet will, as they say, ""have a bad time.""

It is this process that causes black holes to shine so brightly, but! Astute readers will notice that it's not technically the black hole that's doing the shining. The black hole is still black (I guess one can't go back), so it's the combination of the heated material in the accretion disc and the plasma jets that's doing the shining, marking the hole like a big damn beacon shroud floating out in space.

Thus, this makes being around a black hole a Very Bad Thing. You don't even have to fall into one to be killed horrifically; the heat and radiation from the matter falling into the hole will murder you long before you get to the hole itself.

If you actually want to *have* a chance at falling into the hole (and happily suffer the spaghettification process, which may be a preferable end for those who work call centers), you'll have to approach a black hole that isn't currently feeding, but you'd only be alive to cross the event horizon if the black hole is massive enough, pushing the horizon out past the point where tidal forces would pluck you apart like so many atom-sized gravitational chickens at the matter feed bag that is *you*.

**edit** Thanks for the gold, fellas! Stay coo.

**edit2** Awesomeman /u/neutronicus has been nipping at my heels about a few things that could be interpreted incorrectly in my post. To make things clear: black holes are not the hoovers of the cosmos. Sure, they'll ruin a star system's life if that system chooses to walk down a dark alleyway alone without mace, but given their formidable power, black holes generally eat surprisingly little matter, which I did try to explain with the accretion disc and polar jets thing.

In short, it's really easy for stuff to orbit a black hole. It takes a special case to make stuff fall in. The only reason these things can get huge, like in the cores of galaxies, is that they've been around for quite a while--billions of years.

As for the ""traffic jam"" analogy I used early in the post, that blurred the line of correctness even further, especially my comment about not being able to fall in faster because matter ahead of you was holding up the line for destruction. Matter in accretion discs is often in a stable orbit unless something causes that balance to tip, like giving a ball a gentle nudge down a hill, to make that matter exchange gravitational *potential* energy for gravitational *kinetic* energy. In short, an exchange must take place to tip the balance and start the wanton orgy of orgiastic fury. I hope this makes things a bit more clear. &lt;3

However, its a kinda piece of trivia that Ed was a ctually describing how their day would go when the whole zombie apocalypse arrived. 

Bloody Mary first thing -  The zombie girl in their back garden the next morning, she had a name tag. It said Mary.

Bite at the Kings Head - refers to killing Phillip, Shauns stepdad.

Couple at The Little Princess - they had to go to the home of Liz (Shauns girlfriend, his ""little princess"" if you will) to save her. The couple refers to David and Diane, Liz's friends who were a couple in the movie.

Stagger back here - They shuffled through a crowd of zombies, pretending to be zombies in order to evade them and get to the Winchester.

True,RaySis,,,"Blacks and whites are NOT THE SAME. I don't know why this is so hard for people to swallow. We have dog breads that show characteristics of its bred and no one questions it. All the diversity of the natural world on this planet owes its success to genes. At some point in our distant past , the group of people who would become the white Europeans left Africa. It is at this point that our evolutionary paths diverged. This group of people also met and interbred with the Neanderthals, increasing intelligence. Life to the north was not like Africa.   
Leaving their predecessors behind, the fledgling stock pushed onward. Changing selection pressures would favor those mutations that bestowed upon the new stock reasoning abilities, deductive thinking, and logic. These traits would be necessary in order for the new breed of man, the White man, to survive the colder climates to the north.

The winter season brings new challenges and obstacles to the stock. For months at a time the fertile soil becomes a frozen, barren land, incapable of cultivation -- an inhospitable climate where even short exposures can quickly lead to frostbite and death. Gone were the days of endless warmth and pursuing only those behaviors that offered the reward of immediate gratification. The new breed needed to have the vision to see into the future and make plans ahead of time, if they were to survive.

Through a long and rigorous process, subsistence hunting and food gathering, and building temporary structures from mud or straw were replaced by agriculture, domestication of livestock, and true architecture. These are among hallmarks of civilization achieved by early Whites. And it was only when the fundamental problems of day-to- day survival had been solved that the mind could be free to ponder the higher things in life -- and the infinite possibilities of the future. A future with automobiles, refrigerators, television, radios, cell phones, satellites, and space travel. Look around you: the White man invented virtually everything you see.

The paucity of invention by sub-Saharan Africans -- it is virtually nil -- is evident. This lack of creative thinking is so because the Africans left behind did not follow the proto-Whites along their migration routes out of Africa -- and hence did not evolve in the same way. It was the genetic response to the changing selection pressures generated by the exposure to the colder climates of the north that elicited the changes in the genome that made our race, civilization, and mighty technology possible.   
  
Its ridicules that genes count for so much in all the life forms found on this planet except for man.   
  
For example no one questions the fact that some breeds of dogs are just inherently meaner then others. Quick to anger. Hard to pacify. Oh sure there is always the exceptions but you would be hard pressed to find someone who works with dogs a lot that would dispute this. When the same thing is suggested of a race of people, it couldn't possibly be so.  
I have lived among blacks for a long time. I can tell you this with absolute certainty. There are inherent differences in races that transcend the socioeconomic argument. It is likely the cause of many of the black races problems.   
Blacks are: Quick to anger.  Blacks are more promiscuous, they tend to have children at a much younger age then whites. Blacks have difficulty differing gratification and are more prone to violent outbursts. Most black males do not support the children they create.

Remember a couple of things.  First, you are seeing only the highlights in someone else's life.  They may drive a fancy car, but only because they are looking for an outlet for their money, and they are trying to buy happiness.  I have many co-workers who continually buy fancier and fancier cars, and their wives keep buying fancier and fancier clothes.  And it never stops.  Because they are looking for happiness in a place where it doesn't exist.  Now some may be happy as can be and drive a fancy car, but I'll say in my limited experience that lots of these people are miserable.

The second thing that I would caution against is attempting to compare yourself to ""The Joneses.""  Again, you are only seeing the highlights.  There are lots of people out there trying to keep up with The Joneses, but the Joneses are frauds.  The Joneses are faking it.  And it's only a matter of time before they get found out.  You worry about what you can afford, where you can live, and what you can buy, and leave everyone else out of it.  Because there are tons of people out there living The Good Life, yet they are maxed out on their credit cards and a month from foreclosure on  their big fancy house.  And you'd never know it until it all comes crashing down on them.  

My wife and I make a combined AGI of just into the 7 figures.  I drive a reasonable car, and we live in a house that we could afford if only one of us worked and took a huge pay cut.  I was lucky enough to learn (from my folks) that my family is the most important thing in life.  Money helps take away some stress in life, but only if you live below your means and don't get caught up in the more more more attitude most of us were raised with in the US.

I meet guys all the time I don't like; Jock types, sports type, boozey types etc etc etc. If I generalised all those who like sports, I could come up with some broad brush type casts inferring that all guys who are jock like are dumbfucks who treat people like shit, but as you and I both know, that's not true. Once we all grow the fuck up once we're out of school, people become people, not a typecast. Hence, a seemingly jock type person is very unlikely to just simply fit that stereotype and be nothing more. 

Therefore, why would a woman be...?

For the record, I'm in my late twenties, and haven't known a woman with these sorts of values since high school - and even then it was EARLY high school and life experience soon undid those BS ideas. The average person likes to be good to people - why would women be different?

I see a lot of people in this thread already, taking about what they surmise women believe and/or want. Women are as diversely opinionated as men, there are no such commonalities as are being implied here. More importantly, however, how the hell do you know? Observational bias is the worst was to see this issue. Hell, if I remembered my first few relationships and used that as a basis for how I judged men, I would think all men were ass-monkeys. But I don't, because I know I was younger and therefore not well enough equipped with experience to make better choices. Hence I learnt to avoid those with poor approaches to the world and found a guy who is 110% my equal, and we treat and think of each other as such. I also have awesome friends who treat people well. But it took me a while to find them, not because they weren't there, but because it took me a while to know where to look, and also to get to know a lot of varying people along the way... the vast majority of which didn't fall into any behaviours and of the condoning of such interactions like this.

True,[deleted],,,"Oh my GOD. Stupid fucking men. Time for a lesson.

What our ancestors looked for in women was *fertility* and being able to bring a baby to term. The most fertile women are [shorter and heavier](http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17997-meet-future-woman-shorter-plumper-more-fertile.html) - that is to say, they looked way more like Adele than anyone on /r/gonewild.

Besides that, a woman needed those fat stores to get through pregnancy more successfully. Without hospitals and constant access to food, a fat woman would be a more desired mate than a thin woman. You see, our 'ancestors' didn't want women running around, hunting and gathering - women were the ones getting pregnant. Their job was to sit around and get pregnant and be pregnant. The men were the ones hunting, gathering, defending *because the pregnant women couldn't do it, fat or thin*. Thats why men evolved to be naturally stronger, dumbass prick. For women, it was all about the babies. Mens attraction to women was all about how suitable they were to successfully have children. That meant *fat*. Not outright obese (not even possible back then), but fat. Adele would have been *perfect*. If our female ancestors looked more like Adele, we would have gotten MUCH further as a species. How the fuck can you be so fucking stupid? Is this not obvious even to you uneducated dolts?

Women couldn't get fat (remember that fat is STORES OF ENERGY, of which a LOT was needed for healthy pregnancy in a time where food wasnt consistent) AS easily back then because of diet, which made women evolve to conserve MORE fat, burn less calories. *Fertile women needed fat*. If we're talking about 'our ancestors' or whatever a mans 'ingrained' attraction should be because of BIOLOGY and evolution or 'what would have been best', you'd be fapping over Adele right now. You'd be fapping over /r/gonewildcurvy and even a lot of the women on /r/gonewildplus over EVER going to /r/gonewild.

Let me tell you why you prefer thin women and have such irrational *disdain* for fat ones. You prefer thin women because it keeps people like ME in a job. I'm a personal trainer at a gym. From birth, men are told to like thin women. We tell women to be thin, thin is best. Why? Because women today gain weight more easily (because the most succesful female ancestors were the ones more easily able to retain fat and keep fat/energy stores for pregnancy on their shitty caveman diets - get it, fucknuts?), have more fat stores, find it harder to lose fat than men do. Know what that means? Money. Money for me. Money for diet companies and products. And fashion, cosmetics.. the whole shebang. These are multi-BILLION dollar industries. The diet industry ALONE is multi-billion. The more we tell women that thin is best, the more they spend on getting there. The more we tell dumbasses like you thin is best, from the moment you're born, the more pressure you put on women to do all it takes to get there - and yes, they WILL spend, because 'diet and exercise' wont make every ""Adele""-woman thin. A woman can eat healthily and exercise as much as she can but will still be on /r/gonewildplus. She could lose weight, but then in 5 or so years be back on /r/gonewildplus cus her body wants that goddamn fat even if shes being as healthy as you are.

Yes, seriously. Yes, they can loose weight (with STRICT calorie counting, they need to eat a LOT less or burn a LOT more than you imagine to get and stay thin if they are not naturally able to get there), and yes it is more healthy now that our aim is 'long life without heart attacks' (remember that our ANCESTORS lived in a time where you wouldnt ever reach the age that most people get heart problems or diabetes) rather than 'reproduction', now that we have hospitals and constant access to food - but its not easy, and not all fat women 'disrespect their bodies'. It's harder for a lot of them than it is for men to be thin, by a long shot. It's harder for them than it is for me. Some of us get 'lucky' and our bodies fit into what society wants today from our aesthetics and  health.

I got 'lucky' with my genetics, living in this era - I can be skinny EASILY with a balanced diet and exercise. Of course I'm very active now, but even when I was in school studying, not having time for my hobbies and eating junk all the time, I stayed skinny 'enough' for /r/gonewild and men and society (just slightly 'soft' and weedy looking, I just have more muscle mass now). If I lived back with my 'ancestors', being ""able"" to be this skinny would make me *undesirable*. Now? It makes me 'desirable' AND allows me to get a brilliantly fun job as a personal trainer. I could be as fit as I am now, but fatter, and I wouldn't have even been considered for this job I love.

So, no. Shut up, dumbass, stop talking out of your ass. You know fucking nothing. Our ancestors would fucking LOVE Adele. Every man would have wanted to fuck the shit out of her because she had a fertile shape and enough fat/energy stores to carry the babies healthily to term at a time when you didnt know if you were gonna eat properly over the next week or so. YOU want thin women because you've been conditioned that way, it's the opposite of 'what was best for our ancestors', and conditioning is way stronger than any primal desires you may have lingering, because it makes way more money to tell women - who can't easily be thin - that they must get thin at all costs.

As for fat males.. Well, I've learned not to judge after being in this job a while, but males are more naturally lean than women are so if MALES are fat, then something is more likely to be off with their diets. So if you're gonna judge anyone, it should be fat men. But don't do that either, cus that still makes you an asshole, and you don't know their lives.",0,1364769028,,0,1364769826,1,c95y82s,t3_1bd4va,t1_c95y82s,t1_c95uq67,,1431717486,31,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,31
True,bojang,,,"The biggest problem I've encountered is not really having anything that I'm passionate about. I've only recently started to develop hobbies. I found out I absolutely love ballroom dancing, and I could have started years ago, instead of 6 months ago. I learn more about my self as an adult everyday. I recently started actually eating fish, and just always assumed I didn't like it because I never ate it before.

It's necessarily bad to be ambivalent. I associated with just about everyone in my high school class, because I was always so at ease with everything. And it takes a lot to get me worked up about something, so I rarely get mad and freak out about things, which is nice. 

But when people asked me what I like to do for fun, the answer was something bland, like hang out with friends, because I didn't really care that much. Now I'm developing more of a personality than just that funny, witty guy. I have interests and hobbies. 

A lot of why I was ambivalent was because I was insecure and didn't want to alienate any one who could potentially be a friend by disliking something they liked, or really liking something they disliked, so I was rather passive about everything. 

I would say develop who you are. Find out what you like as a person, and don't worry so much about what everyone else thinks about it (like I did).  And, yes, I know that can be hard advice to take follow in high school. But what do I know, I'm only 22.

True,ketri,,,"Hi JLWakeful!
I'm just gonna throw some ideas here. Some might be too basic if you know your stuff already (also maybe some are not relevant just yet if you're a beginner. But they're all good stuff!) but hopefully you find at least some of them interesting!

First, I really liked the Codeacademy course that goes trough basic html and css http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web
It really goes trough most important things and develops a nice solid base where it's good to build on! Do it! 
You an also check out http://teamtreehouse.com/. They have similar course also which I'm sure is very good. And if you google, you'll find a coupon to Treehouse for a free month. There you can also learn some php which will come handy when designing with Wordpress or other CMS's.

I also suggest getting a feedreader like Feedly and starting to follow all kinds of web design blogs. Some good ones are css-tricks.com, smashing magazine, a list apart, nettuts...
Css-tricks has awesome screencasts also that are worth checking out!

I very much suggest learning to use Wordpress and really get a deep understading of it. It's quite fun and easy to get into. I don't really develop sites with anything else anymore. Wordpress is just so nice. You're getting some of the smartest people in the world, spending thousands of hours of work so you could use this awesome result of their hard work, for free! Thank you all awesome WordPress developers! 
Of course you should check out Joomla also if you are interested... 
A good place to start is digwp.com and their book Digging Into Wordpress. All the posts and videos By Chris Coyer are good. 
http://css-tricks.com/video-screencasts/109-getting-off-ftp-and-onto-git-deployment-with-beanstalk/ I just love his approach. 

For custom wordpress -themes I like Elegant Themes. Good bang for your buck and at least the responsive themes seemed better than WooThemes.
But I'm still looking for the ultimate framework to build on thats made for heavy customizing and not someone who just changes the background from inside the admin-panel. Recommendations..?

Learn to debug and write CSS in your browser. Firefox has the css nicely as a sidebar but doesnt autosuggest. Chrome is overall nice but the layout of Dev tools is a bit silly since I mostly just work on CSS and would like to have more space for it...But both are good.
This seems to explain briefly what it's about: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2IAPyohv5g
When your CSS works in browser, you copy-paste it to your .css -file. 

Make sure your designs work with all the browser you choose to support. Your site will look different on different browsers and mostly just not work on some (IE :) I hate IE).
If you're on mac, check out http://osxdaily.com/2011/09/04/internet-explorer-for-mac-ie7-ie8-ie-9-free/ to run IE on your mac for testing.

Of course find and bookmark all the nice pages you like and inspect their source code with developer tools to find out how they were made! Steal all the great ideas (but only the rough ideas, never the code obiviously) 
Check out some nice stuff for example at http://www.awwwards.com/ and well, everywhere. I like very minimalist design so I have a shitload of inspiring minimalist stuff bookmarked just for investigating them when I have the time. ""What is that nice font..? Oh its 'elena web basic'...let's see if it's free...apparently no...Oh what is this thing called Typekit..? Oh wow...""


Read about responsive and adaptive design to make your sites work with all the different devices and screensizes. http://www.abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design This is probably a good one although I havent started it yet... But google ""responsive design"". And play around with responsive frameworks like twitters Bootstrap: http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/ 
or Zurbs Foundation: http://foundation.zurb.com/
And instantly make an impression with your mad mobile optimization skills :)

Of course just ask around your friends for small projects so you can get to work on building something real asap (like you're most likely doing already). But just spread the word that this is what you're doing now and start building some portfolio samples and running into all those weird clearfix -problems and solving them. 

Read at least the very the basics of search engine optimization: 
http://www.seomoz.org/beginners-guide-to-seo 
and google.

Check out fontsquirrel.com and http://www.google.com/fonts/ for some free fonts. 

Tools that I absolutely love, and definitely worth checking out are:
- sublime text 2 (get package control for it and google around for some top ST2 extensions)
- transmit ftp
- codekit
- MAMP 
- beanstalk and Git (google them!)
- Tower git client

Overall just watching tutorial videos is a super nice and simple way to understand new stuff. Youtube is so full of great tutorials. 

Here's some stuff that comes to mind first. Hopefully at least some of them are useful! And sorry for all the spelling errors as I'm not a native english speaker...",0,1364770768,,0,False,1,c95yrx0,t3_1bdk2c,t1_c95yrx0,t3_1bdk2c,,1431717226,68,False,web_design,t5_2qh1m,68

True,[deleted],,,"These two posts made me cry.

I've been struggling with something similar, also due to mental illness. I used to be clever, ambitious, high-achieving, creative... and then I had a mental breakdown, and the woman I rebuilt using the pieces of my own life is nothing like the girl I used to be. I lost my ability to concentrate, to form and organise coherent thoughts into cohesive arguments. I lost my ability to memorise things. Reading comprehension dropped significantly. My ability to interpret texts and to consider all possibilities also dropped significantly, to the point where I found myself incapable of seeing many facets of an issue unless they were explicitly pointed out to me. For someone who used to be so sharp, observant, and intelligent, it was one of the most painful things I have ever experienced.

I had to re-learn how to function as a human being. I still mourn the loss of my creativity. It used to come so naturally to me, writing stories and daydreaming. Now I have to force any sort of creativity. My sense of self has always been tied to my love of and talent for writing, but I am now but a shadow of what I once was.

I began university with a 90% grade average. I graduated with a 68%, without honours and with my dream of going to grad school crushed. 

When people congratulate me on getting a degree, I feel ashamed. It shouldn't have been difficult. It hadn't been difficult until the break down took from me everything I valued. Instead of exceptional, I fell below mediocre, and it has been the most bitter pill I've had to swallow.

I lost my entire identity and had to build a new one. I am still building a new one, but I still mourn the loss of who I once was. ",0,1364772143,,0,False,1,c95z7xc,t3_1avffk,t1_c95z7xc,t1_c95wcwh,,1431717017,260,False,Neuropsychology,t5_2rhda,260
True,Rhindon,,Épée,"Hm. This is perhaps the toughest question I've received thus far.

I'm going to try to walk through how I think this would go:

I'm walking home from practice in the late afternoon. The sun is at my back, casting a long shadow in front of me. I'm tired from a tough saber practice; I've been working on my *Destreza* and I'm beat.

I hear the screeching of tires behind me and I turn to see the creepiest white van I've ever seen barreling right towards me. On the sidewalk.

I dive out of the way, landing on my fencing bag with a sickening crunch. I know I just bent something horrifically out of shape and I'll have a mask-sized bruise on my side tomorrow.

I turn to look and see where the van went, maybe I can get its plates.

It's stopped 20 feet away.

The side door slides open and a wave of gasoline fumes hits me.

Then I hear it. The sound of the ripcord on a big Stihl weedwhacker being yanked. In three pulls I hear the whacker's started running.

So so do I.

A man, or at least it looks like a man, he's wearing a clown mask and baggy clothing so I can't be certain, jumps out of the van and starts chasing me.

I'm limping pretty badly, that fall really messed me up and I'm exhausted from practice, but the adrenaline's kicking in.

I realize soon though that I can't outrun this maniac. I throw my bag off and quickly pull out my mask and draw my saber; there's no time for my jacket, I'll just have to risk my arms.

He comes at me swinging. I step to the side and put my blade in the way of the plastic cord, cutting it, and make a downward cut to the head of this clown.

*CLANG*

He catches the saber in a two-handed block and swings back in a two-handed riposte, striking me across the mask.

My head swimming I hear the clown hit the head of the whacker on the ground, loading more twine into the spinning mechanism. He comes at me again. I use defense of measure to avoid his first thrust, then I duck to the left, hoping to catch him off guard as I toss the saber into my left hand and cut up, catching his elbow. 

If the blade had been sharp the fight might have been over, but it's not, so with a shriek the clown wheels around with what can only be called a weedwhacker roundhouse to my right shoulder.

I drop into a passata sotto so the whacker passes over me, just barely drawing blood in a line on the back of my unprotected neck. It stings, but not as much as the thrust I put into the clown's gut. Again, a pity it's not a sharp.

The clown stumbles back, eyeing me up. I'm clearly more trouble than he originally anticipated but he's not giving up. And I can't run, I have no choice but to fight on.

Back and forth, we attack/parry/riposte. My shoulder is bruised, I'm bleeding from a dozen cuts on my arms where the whacker bit deep. I've landed a few good blows, but I know my only chance to end this is if I can land a strike to the clown's perpetually grinning face.

We dance our dance of death, spinning and whirling. Steel meeting steel, cord meeting flesh. Our strength flagging. Finally I see it. An opening. Just what I've been looking for. When he swings left to right there's the briefest instant where he's off-balance. If I can get the proper disengage I can thrust to the face.

I take a savage blow to the hip and fall to one knee, rolling to the left to dodge a savage overhead blow that resembles the *Zornhau* from Liechtenauer.

I get to my feet, not so quickly as before, and wait for that opening. He swings right to left, I have no choice but to catch it high on the blade and hope to deflect it.

*ting* the blade goes as it pushes the whacker over my head.

A quiet thump hits the ground. I look.

Half of my blade lies there, ten feet from me. As I look at it in shock the clown swings again, this time jumping in the air and swinging at a diagonal.

I catch the full force of it on my bell guard which dents terribly and is wrenched from my hand and thrown out of my sight as I'm knocked to the ground once more.

I roll over and over as the clown brings the whacker crashing down where I used to be, hoping to avoid my fate. I feel a pain in my side.

The broken half of the blade!

I slowly reach around behind my back and grasp it firmly, knowing I'll only have once chance. One chance to make this count.

The clown comes up to me. Dropping the weedwhacker beside me, knowing I'm defeated.

He reaches down to lift off my mask as I lay still, feigning unconsciousness.

As he gets to one knee to savor the up close kill he bends over me.

I headbutt him right in the face. With a yell he falls over and I roll on top of him, stabbing him with the broken tip of my saber. Surprised, hurt, and angry he pushes me off, all my energy spent, but he's now wary and bleeding, he rushes back to the van and gets in.

All I hear as everything fades to black and I lose consciousness for real is one of my friends running up yelling my name, and the quiet sound of an ice cream truck driving away at high speed...

**tl;dr**: Get my butt kicked, but give about as good as I got. Headbutt gloating clown in the face and he runs off with a few stab wounds as I pass out.

Edit: Some grammar and added the tl;dr.

True,AskCropTech,,,"Wow, what a great question!

Since the Green Revolution in the 1940s-1970s, farming technology advances in agriculture have saved over a billion people from starvation. In addition to irrigation, pest treatments, and sophisticated new fertilizers, American crop scientists have also led the field forward in the development of new plant strains that are hardier, better adapted to different climates, and more synergistic with responsible pest control solutions. Indeed, the United States is the world's breadbasket, with such efficient growing that we ship tons of quality product all over the world!

Thanks to legislation like the the Farmer Assurance Provision, biotechnology developers can bring new seed lines into production at a vastly increased rate. In particular, the strengthened intellectual property protections are essential for incentivizing this innovation in a fair marketplace. It's a real win-win for both agribusiness and the consumer!

American family farmers can now rest assured that they'll be able to keep up with growing demand from emerging markets!",0,1364772587,,0,False,1,c95zd7t,t3_1bdw7i,t1_c95zd7t,t3_1bdw7i,,1431716947,59,False,askscience,t5_2qm4e,59

True,umamifiend,female,♀,"So many stories... here's one. Sorry for the wall of text!

This older clean, decently dressed drunk (red face &amp; road map) 55-60 y.o. white man was glancing at me at the bus stop. he makes off hand comment on the weather, how nice it is. I nod. He starts talking about my red hair. How much he likes it, how he's really only ever dated red heads. Then it gets inappropriate as he cites this inclination because redheads are ""so wild, and uninhibited in the bedroom, you know what I mean?"" ""No, and thats very rude. I'm done talking to you."" I say and put my headphones back in. He keeps stammering at me, trying to tell me he knows that I know what he means. Then mumbles his way onto the bus. He's gone quickly, thankfully, I don't think about him again. 

Fast forward about 6 months, on a totally different bus route, &amp; part of town. Guy gets on. ""There's my girlfriend!"" He exclaims upon getting on the bus. Looking at the red haired girl sitting in the seat directly in front of me. I don't remember him initially but as he sits down, blocking her in, she's in the window seat. He starts his lines about red heads with the girl in front of me. 

She too initially talks politely to him. He quickly gets inappropriate. This time he is leaning into her, whispering so people around her can not hear. She proceeded to freeze up, eyes forward, stiff as a board. I remembered him now. I could smell the liquor on his breath. I could hear him describing sexual acts to a mortified and frozen young woman in front of me.

My heart was racing because I knew I was about to start a confrontation and I did not know how it would end. My hands were shaking because I was so mad, and ready to fight.

""STOP talking to her. RIGHT now."" I say loudly at the man. 
""What? Hahaha, oh honey, you know you love it."" or some such response. ""We're just talking... See she likes it..."" he responds, the girl is still frozen. The two men sitting right in front of him who could hear the whole thing and did nothing up until this point turned around to listen. 
""No you were NOT talking, you are harassing her, and she is uncomfortable. Get away from her. Get up now."" I say, He is protesting 
""I'm just trying to be nice,""
""You're not being NICE you misogynistic asshole. That's sexual harassment, get up now."" I was impressed I even remembered the word misogynistic, I was seeing red. My volume has escalated greatly, everyone on the bus was looking. I am now standing in the isle next to him. The two men in front of him are supporting me. ""Get away from her"" They are saying.
The drunk gets up and gets off at the next stop. The girl &amp; myself get off too(it's a main stop) she's shaking like a leaf. Another random woman in earshot gets off too, trying to console the girl. The drunk shuffled off quickly yelling back at me ""*gendered slurs*"" and other some such insults, as he walked into traffic through the light yelling at cars as they drove around him. 

""Are you ok?"" the woman was asking the girl
""Yeah I think so..."" she saw me ""thanks...""
""Yeah, no problem he tried to pull that shit on me a few months back, fucking ass hole."" I walked away quickly. I was shaking too. Just typing this out made my hands shake. I tell you what. That man is lucky he didn't try to raise a hand to me. I would have destroyed him.

TL;DR: Got harassed by a man, months later stopped him while he was harassing another girl. Wanted to fight.

Reasonable, intelligent people (and I think that includes the large majority of people deeply concerned about the down side of the fossil-fuel economy) recognize the amazing benefits fossil fuels have given to the human race. Hydrocarbons are incredibly energy dense and versatile molecules, and as you rightly point out, modern civilization would have been impossible without them. That said, as you yourself clearly recognize, they clearly have some very serious downsides.
