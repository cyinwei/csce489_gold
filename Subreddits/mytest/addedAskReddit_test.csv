no_talent_ass_clown,,,"Okay, so I peeped your comment history and you said you got rejected for prom, right?

""Living well is the best revenge."" That, my young reddit friend, was MY high school quote in MY yearbook, right under my photograph. The things is, you don't even have to *show* anyone you're living well, that's the beauty of it. You just do it, all on your own. 

Three things will always make you feel better: enough sleep, exercise, and a shower. Okay, maybe four things - eating right needs to be in there too. But that's all it takes to feel right. 

Then you work on your work - which for you means school. Intellectually, this is what you need to feel right. 

Spiritually, if you're into that, you need to practice whatever it is. Go to church, light a candle, slip into meditation, offer up a prayer. Go sit in the forest. Pet your cat. Feed your hamster. Whatever floats your boat and makes you feel you're connected with *more*. Feed your soul.

Then you need to get out and do things. Go window shopping at the mall. Get a job. Volunteer at a hospital. Call a friend and have a meal together. Play video games. Stay busy. Get off FB and other social media with whatsherface's crap all over it. Do new stuff. If you want different results in the future, do different stuff now.

Sometimes, a lot of the time, rejection is not about you, it's about them and their insecurities and life experiences. If you saw a gold-colored coin on the street, you'd stop to pick it up, right? Most likely not gold, though. What if you saw a penny? Maybe not. But what if you stopped long enough to look at it, you'd see it was a rare coin from centuries ago and very valuable - then you'd definitely pick it up, right? You're the coin and most high school girls don't have the knowledge to discern coin value. Just wait til your 10 year reunion. 

Most of all, time needs to pass. I promise you, from the bottom of my broken-and-mended-so-many-times heart, things get better after high school. WAY better. Like, unimaginably better. Stick it out, do your time, then be free.

Lets use my brothers name for example; BEN-STICK-A-REN-JO-FEN-JO-FEN-JO-FEN-STICK-A-REN THAT'S HOW YOU SPELL BEN. Anyways, in my first week of Kindergarten my teacher asked me to spell 'Truck'.

glitzyjan,,,"I lost my dad when I was ten, but here are some distinct things I remember him teaching me (and being thankful for them):

An appreciation for nature. My father taught me to stop and watch a sunset, to feed a stray, to smell the flowers, to grow a garden. I cannot thank him enough for showing me this.

He taught me empathy. My dad was a very caring man, and he taught me to help people who need it however I can. No matter what he was going through with his cancer, he always went out of his way to help others even if it physically hurt him to do so.

He taught me to cook. He would have me get him ingredients from a very young age and to put them in the bowl. This helped me not only learn to cook and bake, but it also preserved his recipes and they live on with me.

He taught me about cars. My father was a mechanic in the military. He showed me how to change the oil, change the brake pads, check my tires, replace a belt, and change a flat. These are skills that I've found most girls do not learn, and I'm glad I have them at my disposal.

He taught me to mow the grass, use tools, fix something broken. All the things one would associate with boys. He showed me girls could do it too.

He taught me that hard work is rewarded. He repeated this often during my life, and I sometimes lack patience but it is a truth. If you work hard and take pride in it, you will be rewarded.

And finally he taught me love. When he passed away, it was early December. He knew he'd never make it to Christmas. On Christmas Eve, the FedEx guy came. He brought me presents from my dad. He had ordered them before he died. The message he sent touched my heart forever. He said to not be sad, it was ok to be happy and that my happiness in life would be his gift that year.

2_hertz,,,"This isn't so much a medical error, but a time I feel that I failed my patient. I was on my first clinical rotation in a rural Emergency Room, and a woman came in with a miscarriage, her second one. While we were talking she mentioned she was new to town, didn't know anyone, and her husband was away for the weekend. When we told her the diagnosis, her eyes became teary, and then we left to make arrangements. The doc didn't say he was sorry for her loss or comfort her in anyway, which I instinctively wanted to do. 

When I went back in her room to give her appointment time, she was in pieces. It really gets me.

TCsnowdream,,,"I don't know if this counts, but WHY we study history is always left out or completely under-presented. 

I always explained to my students why we study history and why it is so important. I even ask them what their thoughts are. I always get the same responses: 'I don't know', 'because it's required', 'because we don't want to repeat the mistakes of the past', etc... These are valid responses, but they miss the whole point. 

**We study history to *humanize* others.**

No other subjects gets you so up close and personal with the other 7,000,000,000 people on this planet. We study history to protect your brains from the fear of 'the other'. You learn about tragedies that happen so you can learn to feel sympathy for the humans that suffered. Yes, and to prevent them from happen again. But we get into that state of mind by making you give a damn. 

When I was a small child, there was an airline crash... [TWA-800](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TWA_Flight_800), I think. I was maybe 6? When I saw my family watching the news, I remember I asked why everyone cared so much - we didn't know any of them. 

It was explained to me that the people who died on there were moms, dads, brothers and sisters. That there would be people at the gate waiting for their family members to come off the plane, and they never would come home ever again. And if that happened to our family, it would be tragic so therefore it's good to understand it from the other people's shoes. 

As we all grow up, we begin to see the world beyond just us, to our family and friends, to our coworkers and peers, to the whole world around us. And when we study history, we begin to understand that every person has a story and has a reason for being the way they are. But that ultimately we are all people, and that we are driven by the same emotions. An Iraqi father who looses his son to an IED deserves our sympathy, and when you study more about the son who died and the father who is suffering, you begin to realize how small, fragile and special life is. You begin to see why it is important to collect and remember these things about other people, because that is how we keep these people and their messages alive. That is how we know they lived. That is how we know what they felt.

We study and strive to better understand the world around us. So when the **TERROR REPORT** comes in, and explains how the **TERRORISTS** will **DESTROY** us and how they **HATE** us, you can take a step back and think... Why do they want to destroy us? Why would they hate us? They're humans like me, so if I was in their situation, how would I react? But there are people who do not think that. There are people who immediately hear the word **TERRORIST** and think of some cartoonish villain in caves who hates America simply because were America and that's it. No background information needed, no questioning, no thoughts.

This is why it's important to instill into people that Hitler and the Nazis we're humans, and not caricatures of humanity. They had families. They made jokes, they went to the bathroom, they had likes and dislikes, just like you. It shows that *a monster can come from any one of us*, and that we should understand how situations and circumstances change people and mold them, but we're all still human none the less. 

History is the only school subject that has the capacity to teach kindness, compassion and empathy. And it comes wrapped in a bow with social-tools and a complete, humanizing skill set ready to be used on demand that will be used everyday. Math can't boast that, science can't... *Only* history. 

And it's a crime that it has been reduced into a parody. It's a crime that kids think it's boring. It's a crime that kids think it's pointless.

It's not. It is a beautiful, wonderful subject that unlocks the entire world around you and makes the whole bright, big beautiful world a whole lot less scary.

**TL;DR - History is the only subject that humanizes others. *That is why we study it.***

forest_rose,,,"Not unethical exactly, but frowned upon by the hospital if they found out.  When I was a junior doctor, I had an elderly patient on our specialist cardiology ward who'd had to travel 100 miles for a really specialist treatment.  She didn't have any family, and all her friends were similarly elderly and couldn't drive far, let alone a 200 mile round trip to visit her.  She confided in me that she was running out of clean nightdresses and was embarrassed as she didn't know what to do, so I took them home and washed them for her in my machine.  Looking back, I'm sure there was some procedure I should have followed - we're not supposed to get personally involved - but she was so sweet and it was late and all the admin people had gone home.

this-damn-throwaway,,,"I created a throwaway for obvious reasons. You wanted a serious and honest response, so this is how I can do it.

I've been a cheater in most relationships I've had, and as a result, a self-hater for most relationships. I've been through therapy for about 8 years for other reasons and what I've come to learn is that I didn't feel I deserved love, affection, or appreciation. This stems from a whole host of other things from my childhood (sexual abuse, lack of fatherly relationship, latchkey kid, etc).

I treated relationships as though they were temporary even though they lasted for years. I'm a good looking guy so lots of women offer up temptation that I found difficult to reject. And each time, I hated myself for my indiscretions. I also picked relationships that were bad for me--cheater girlfriends, terrible communicators, insecure women, etc.

Then I met the girl of my dreams. I was so into her from day one that I immediately shut down all of my other options. I told other women I was dating that I was happy and done dating around. I shut down a non-committed long-distance relationship as well. I was really, *really* in love. Then I found out she was cheating on me. I can't describe the heartbreak and betrayal I felt. This sent me into a downward spiral of emotional hell. Through therapy, I was able to get back on track, appreciate myself more, and find a girl who is absolutely perfect for me. I *do* still feel urges to cheat sometimes, but my unwillingness to hurt her saves me. Part of my self-hatred stems from not doing the right thing. Each time I do the right thing, I feel a sense of pride, and it makes me feel worthy of the love I receive. A positive cycle.

Edit: Um, wow, I didn't expect for my response to be up top. I will answer questions as much as I can but it may take me a while.

fightdomfreer,,,"Look, I'm just a guy. Worse yet, I have no identification, no money, and no clothes. 

*The one where I get arrested*

Next, I'm probably going to get arrested, I just woke up naked in Central Park. 

Assuming I know it's September 4, 2001 and I don't completely seem like a psychotic when I'm picked up (in which case, I'm probably spending time in the psych ward while the authorities figure out who ""John Doe"" is who thinks he's from the year 2015), I would say that my name is &lt;My Name&gt;, I was visiting Prince George's County, Maryland, and some Arab guys I just met at a hotel drugged me, said they were going to kill me, and it's the last thing I remember. they probably are heading back to Maryland. I would say one of the guys who kidnapped me was Mohammed Atta (who, IIRC, was staying in Maryland at the time). I could probably sit down with a sketch artist and put together a decent enough picture, although it might not work out too well.

Since I don't have an address for them and was picked up naked in Central Park with no drugs in my system or apparent injuries, this probably doesn't do anything, but maybe I could trigger a NYPD call to PG County Police.  A drive-by or a check-in from the cops might startle them and force a delay in the plan. A delay gives them more time to screw up, and more time to get caught. (It also may give me more than a week to solve this, as well as pick up some under-the-table work to start earning money.)

If nothing else, it would hopefully get me out of police custody?

---

*The one where I don't get arrested*

At best I can maybe grab clothes off from a passerby. At that point, my options open a little. I still need: identification, money, and a plan.

1. My first thought might be to try and leverage knowledge of John O'Neil, the FBI's anti-terrorism guy in NYC, into a meeting with him. He was leading a double life with another family in, I think, New Jersey. I could offer that knowledge to a secretary, over the phone, to pass along--not to blackmail him, but to demonstrate that I know about a pending terrorist attack. It might be worth a shot, but I doubt I'd get anywhere.

2. Call my parents from a hotel phone or beg for change on the street until I can call from a pay phone. If anyone is going to believe me, it's them, and I know enough information about my family that it might not seem crazy. Luckily, I sound somewhat similar to the way I did in 2001, and it might work. If this is the case, I can get access to money for clothes, a fake ID, and a space to live.

3. If I get money, I hire P.I.'s to find Hani Hanjour and Mohammed Atta. If I get their location, I can possibly find a way to get them both arrested--or, at worst, try and kill them. If one of the pilots (Hanjour) and one team leader (Atta) is dead or incarcerated, the plan may be delayed or canceled.

4. Worst comes to worst, I try and collect enough money to get a ticket to Boston on one of the planes. I check in early, I wait. I see Atta, I walk up to him and explain that God sent me to stop the attacks, and if his team doesn't turn themselves into the cops and explain *everything*, right now, the effect will be that the destruction of al Qaida by the Crusaders, which will postpone the End of Days for millennia, during which Allah's children will only suffer.

Hope he doesn't call my bluff. If he does, I'll at least try to start and fight and incapacitate him. If we both get arrested and miss the flight, he'll be a valuable source of intelligence for the U.S. after the remaining attacks go down.",1426801233,,1426802261,1,550,AskReddit,True,False,680,0,Afternoon,61+,5,48,"{u'probability': {u'neg': 0.846136362021481, u'neutral': 0.8411232238244951, u'pos': 0.15386363797851904}, u'label': u'neutral'}",0.846136362021,0.153863637979,0.841123223824,neutral,"{u'tone_categories': [{u'category_id': u'emotion_tone', u'tones': [{u'tone_name': u'Anger', u'score': 0.196195, u'tone_id': u'anger'}, {u'tone_name': u'Disgust', u'score': 0.135467, u'tone_id': u'disgust'}, {u'tone_name': u'Fear', u'score': 0.532737, u'tone_id': u'fear'}, {u'tone_name': u'Joy', u'score': 0.107287, u'tone_id': u'joy'}, {u'tone_name': u'Sadness', u'score': 0.540903, u'tone_id': u'sadness'}], u'category_name': u'Emotion Tone'}, {u'category_id': u'language_tone', u'tones': [{u'tone_name': u'Analytical', u'score': 0.562856, u'tone_id': u'analytical'}, {u'tone_name': u'Confident', u'score': 0.0, u'tone_id': u'confident'}, {u'tone_name': u'Tentative', u'score': 0.937415, u'tone_id': u'tentative'}], u'category_name': u'Language Tone'}, {u'category_id': u'social_tone', u'tones': [{u'tone_name': u'Openness', u'score': 0.419803, u'tone_id': u'openness_big5'}, {u'tone_name': u'Conscientiousness', u'score': 0.16251, u'tone_id': u'conscientiousness_big5'}, {u'tone_name': u'Extraversion', u'score': 0.112949, u'tone_id': u'extraversion_big5'}, {u'tone_name': u'Agreeableness', u'score': 0.619694, u'tone_id': u'agreeableness_big5'}, {u'tone_name': u'Emotional Range', u'score': 0.536909, u'tone_id': u'emotional_range_big5'}], u'category_name': u'Social Tone'}]}",0.196195,0.135467,0.532737,0.107287,0.540903,0.562856,0.0,0.937415,0.419803,0.16251,0.112949,0.619694,0.536909

606_10614w,,,"Posted this a while back but it was buried. 

A little late to the game here, but this is one I wanted to share.  

I'm definitely a skeptic, but one experience I had housesitting for my aunt and uncle definitely raises some questions for me. They were going out of town for a weekend and asked if I would keep an eye on the house and take care of their dogs while they were away. I was staying with my grandparents for the summer as I usually did and being a 16yr old with a brand new driver's license, I jumped at the chance for a few days of freedom with a house to myself during my summer vacation. I packed up my PlayStation, rented some games and movies, stocked up on some snacks and headed over to their house. 

The first night there was uneventful, but I remember feeling slightly uneasy being in the house. Nothing out of the ordinary was going on. I just attributed the uneasiness to being in the house alone for the first time (without my aunt and uncle there). Around 1am I decided to go to bed, and let the dogs out in the back yard to relieve themselves before bed. After they were done I made sure everything was locked, doing the deadbolt and the chain locks on the doors.

I woke up the next morning, put some coffee on, and got the dogs up to let them out.  The uneasiness remained. I couldn't help but feel like I was being watched, even though I knew no one else was around.  

After breakfast I decided I was going to go for a bike ride, and meet up with some friends.  I put the dogs in their crates, locked up, and headed out.   I was gone for maybe four hours until mid-afternoon when I decided to head back to the house.  When I walked in the dogs were FREAKING THE FUCK OUT.  Not your normal ""happy to see you! let me out of this crate!"" excitement... full blown panic, shaking, foaming at the mouth, howling, the works.   These dogs are normally very calm, and are perfectly content to spend most of the day in their crates sleeping (they go in on their own for naps), so this was really out of the ordinary.  

I opened the doors to their crates, but neither of them wanted to come out.  Being a little freaked out myself at this point I decided to check the house to make sure nothing had happened.  All the windows were fine, everything was still locked, and the house was completely empty. 

At this point I should mention how the house is laid out a bit.  It's an old house (late 1800's), and prior to my aunt and uncle owning it was divided up as a duplex. The upstairs was a separate apartment.   They mentioned that an older woman had rented the upstairs while the previous owners lived downstairs.  My aunt and uncle didn't rent the upstairs, but didn't really do anything to convert the house back into a single family dwelling.  My uncle used the upstairs apartment as his home office, with several computers and a couple of modems (early 2000's dial-up), and most of the time the door to the upstairs (in the enclosed porch off of the kitchen) just stayed closed and locked, there really wasn't any reason to go up there.  

I decided, in an abundance of caution, since the dogs were so freaked out that I should check the whole house.  I unlocked the door to the upstairs and went up to check.  I noticed that one of the computers was on.  This was odd, as my uncle had said in his note that he'd shut off everything upstairs and unplugged the surge protectors.  Maybe he meant to do so, but got into a rush to get out the door and forgot.  No big deal.  We were expecting storms later, so I shut the computer down, unplugged everything and went back downstairs, locking the door behind me.  By this point, the dogs had calmed down and had taken their usual spots on the couch where I joined them to play some playstation.   

After dinner, around 8PM at this point, the dogs and I were still on the couch watching movies, and just chilling out.  All of a sudden one of the dogs stands up on the couch, with all of the fur on his back sitting on end, and begins growling towards the direction of the door to the stairs.  He continued this for the next 5-10 minutes, and nothing I did would distract him from whatever he was sensing.  He eventually calmed down and laid beside me again.  

A few hours later (around 11PM) he started again, and the other dog joined in this time too.   That's when I began to hear creaking coming from upstairs.  Like someone stepping on a loose floorboard. It didn't sound like footsteps, just like someone rocking back and forth on the loose board.  Properly freaked out now I  went to investigate.  This time I noticed that the door to the upstairs was now unlocked.  I had locked it when I went up there earlier.  Oh fuck! Someone might be in the house!  I took a few steps back into the kitchen and grabbed a knife, you know, like a horror movie cliche...   I checked the porch door to the backyard, which would be where someone would come in to get to the upstairs apartment.  It was still locked...  Okay... weird.   The creaking upstairs was still happening.  I opened the door to the stairs and it immediately stopped.  I turned the lights on and went upstairs.   Nothing.  I was freaking out over nothing, it was probably just the house settling or something, it was, after all an old house, these things creak and groan all the time.   A little embarrassed with myself for getting so freaked out, I went back downstairs, again locking the door behind me.  

I decided to get some sleep, popped in another movie, curled up on the couch and passed out.  I was woken up a few hours later (2AM) to the dogs again in full-blown panic mode. This time I could hear the creaking again, and then something else happened.  I heard a dial tone. I heard a modem upstairs dial some numbers.  I heard it try to connect.  WTF?!?!?!?!?!? Was I still asleep?  No, I'm definitely awake.   I again, grabbed the knife, went to the upstairs door, again unlocked!  I opened the door and the noise again immediately cut off.  I went upstairs to check, again, nothing, and everything was still off and unplugged just as I had left it.  I went back downstairs, locked everything up and went to try and calm the dogs down.  About 10 minutes later, I heard the modem start up again, it would dial, try to connect, stop, and then dial again, and again, and again.  The creaking was back too, and this time it did sound like someone was walking around up there even though I knew I was alone, and had checked every conceivable place in the house an intruder could hide.  I put up with this for another half an hour or so, and it didn't let up.   The dogs wouldn't calm down either.  

Eventually I had enough, I grabbed the dogs, loaded them in my car, locked up, and got the hell out of there!  I went back to my grandparents' place and stayed there for the rest of the night with the dogs.  

The next morning my grandparents were surprised to see me there, and asked what had happened.  I relayed the previous night's events to them, feeling like a crazy person for what I had experienced.  Strangely, they didn't seem surprised at all.  They then told me that wasn't the first time something strange had happened there, and that my aunt and uncle had all kinds of stories about the place.  For example, my little cousin frequently woke up screaming that a ""shadow man"" was looking at him in his bed,  or my uncle going upstairs to work on his computers one day and discovering the gas stove turned on (but unlit) leaking gas into the house, and all kinds of things misplaced, or doors left open/unlocked.  

I still don't think I believe in the paranormal, and consider myself an agnostic atheist, but I still can't find a reasonable explanation for what I experienced that weekend.   It was all too weird...

EDIT: Thanks for the many kind comments and for the gold. Since many people asked, I'll give some background most of it I've posted before:

 16 years ago I was an overweight IT guy doing almost nothing but eating, reading, smoking, and watching TV. I was engaged to an amazing women and to be honest I took her for granted and didn't treat her nearly as well as I should have. She was active, played sports and generally had a huge ""hunger for life"".
Then in July 1999 she was murdered and my world fell apart. I went into a huge depression. Without really trying I lost a great deal of weight. November 2000 my dad suddenly passed away. At that point I came the closest to suicide a person can probably get without actually going through with it. Luckily a friend rang my doorbell at a critical moment which gave me more time to reflect.
I realized I had many unfilled dreams and ambitions...and decided to give life a go. I decided to capitalize on my lost weight and started to actively pursue a healthier lifestyle. I ended losing a total of 35 kgs. I also started to actively do the things in life I always wanted to do.


Since then I have:
Started karate and gained a 2nd dan black belt.
Took up classical guitar and played the first two grade exams. I still take weekly lessons but stopped playing exams many years ago. This past December I enrolled for a crash course with a luthier and build my own classical guitar from scratch.
Took photography lessons and learned how to develop black and white film. This culminated in a small successful exhibition.
Started studying again and earned a Masters and later a PhD degree. I also ended up changing careers and became a full-time academic.
Learned to speak a few extra languages (just the basics of Spanish, Portuguese, French and German)
Started keeping fish. At one stage I had more than 20 aquariums, both freshwater and marine. I also bred fish and sold them to local petshops and went on fish collecting trips where I collected my own marine fish. Realized this was becoming a job and quit after a few years.
Took up archery and bowhunting. I gained provincial colours in 3D archery, and successfully hunted many African game using the walk and stalk method.
This lead to me wanting to learn to make my own equipment. I have since made my own hunting longbows and made some friends longbows as gifts. I even sold some longbows.
I learned to make knifes and in the process made all my own knife making tools and machinery. As a spinoff I started doing leatherwork too.
I took up fly fishing (but sucked at it).
I tried miniature wargaming. Its a load of fun but you need time to paint figurines.
I learned to cook. Not just the basics. I am a VERY good chef and I bake fantastic sourdough breads, pizzas, etc. I also make my own cured meats.
I travelled all over the world and experienced new cultures. Including diving in the red sea, dancing the tango in Buenos Aires, watching an opera in the Sydney Opera house, etc.
I still actively pursue gaining new skills every day. Currently my wife and I are taking ballroom dancing lessons and loving every moment of it.
I have learned to treat my wife like a goddess and make sure she knows she's appreciated...


TL:DR
You only have one life, live every moment of it as if you might just have no tomorrow. Treasure every person you love fully and make sure they know it. Life is too short and too wonderful to waste.

StainedTeabag,,,"It was mid March of the 2000’s decade, I was cruising on my longboard headed to the local high school talent show. I arrived at a crosswalk, looked both ways and proceed to walk my board across the street. At some point while I was walking a large lifted pickup truck came out of the school parking lot and proceed to accelerate, striking me and continuing on.

I have no recollection from arriving at the crosswalk onwards. Everything I’m about to tell you I have read in the police report, heard from a witnesses, or friends of the person that hit me.

The gentlemen that hit me was texting when he pulled out of the parking lot, he struck my board (my treating doctors say this saved my hip from any major damage) before obviously hitting me. I then flew and hit a tree and fell hitting my head, cracking it open on the ground. I was knocked into a coma. In the report the gentlemen said he heard something while he was driving but looked and didn’t see anything. His friend that was driving behind him quickly called him on his cell phone and he returned to the scene.

I was quickly rushed to the local trauma center, they didn’t think I was going to make it. For two weeks I lie in a coma, I imagine lifeless and still. I awoke at the hospital with guests and my family, I do not recall any of this. I was somehow transported from the hospital to my family’s home where I went to sleep. The next day my good friend and his mother had come to visit me. I awoke not knowing what was going on, slightly startled to be in my room with balloons, posters, and gifts all around me. I had a hard time recalling who my friend was. He called my mother in and they all proceed to tell me I was in a bad accident and what had happened.

My body was weak I could barely sit up but I did not feel any pain due to the medications I was on. My flesh had died from where the bumper struck me leaving my hip unsupported. The many coming weeks, months, and years were full of doctors visits, specialists, physical therapists, chiropractors, and acupuncture. Slowly I started to regain my core muscles but till this day I am left with chronic hip and back pain. I felt like a computer that had just been powered on, before the operating system had a chance to load. I had all my senses and my hardware was functioning like a [BIOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS) but felt like I had no hard drive, or memories attached.

The rest of my high school years we spent joking about my accident and using human as a “coping” mechanism. At first it seemed to be fine and relieving that we could all laugh about something that was so traumatic. In reality this didn’t help me to properly cope with the mental and physical aspects of the accident. It was really hard for me to get reacquainted and have enough stamina to last through the hard plastic chairs. I missed almost 6 months of my freshman year of high school finishing the year off with independent studies well into the next year.

In the years following high school I was diagnosed with mild [PTSD](http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/post-traumatic-stress-disorder-ptsd/index.shtml#pub16). I was so focused on the accident and what it had done to me that I was convinced it had ruined my life. It had a profound effect on my relationships both family and personal and led to many others than myself sometimes sharing my emotional load. For years I wallowed around in my own sadness with no real direction, grasping on to anything and everyone around me.

I finally found myself through my passion of agriculture, I have worked on family farms, corporate farms, and  in urban agriculture. The work keeps me active and using my body which in return keeps my mind, goals, and life straight. Directly after my accident I had trouble coping with my doctors telling me not to lift anything heavy or perform anything strenuous. It made me feel weak and worthless, but I now have found myself again.

This accident left me with some restrictions:

* I now have to wear high arched shoes to support my back. This was difficult leaving my favorite shoes behind, but I’ll tell you [these] (http://www.merrell.com/US/en-US/Product.mvc.aspx/12007M/21306/Mens/Moab-Ventilator-Wide-Width) are more versatile. They allow me to travel longer, further, and over varying terrains.
* I had to quit high impact sports like lacrosse and football.
* I had to quit baseball because the impact of my arm hitting the tree left me with no range of motion.
* I was treated for a flesh eating bacterial infection that I probably received from the physical therapist that also did sports training. This left my leg with a gaping hole in my skin.
* My heart rate increased, I quickly get started and react whenever I see anything in my peripheral vision.

There can be some benefits to surviving traumatic experiences, I might be left with some restrictions but I did learn some important lessons:

* Your family is the most important thing you have on this Earth, no possessions or monetary value should ever change that.
* Do what makes you happy but make sure everything you do is in moderation.
* Cherish the memories that you have because they might not always be there. People, pets, and things can come and go with the blink of an eye. Don’t be left with any regrets.
* Most importantly follow your own advice, it’s easy to point out your own faults but difficult to improve them.

I took this evening to throughly think through this situation and put into words what it has meant to me. I usually don’t like conversing about it but tonight I had a pleasant experience typing all of this out. Currently “Simple Man” by  Lynyrd Skynyrd is playing on my Pandora Joe Cocker Radio, what a coincidence my favorite song came on for my favorite people. If you have any questions don’t hesitate to ask. OP I did my best to talk about the coma but thats the part I remember nothing about. Hope you all enjoy,
							-STB

tl;dr - Truck accident, coma for two weeks, physical and mental problems, fit and happy now.

NFZHunter,,,"Ok, story time:

So one day, I was sitting around, I was an early teenager. So it was pretty much a given that I was super horny. I began jacking off because, well, what else is there to do, am I right? Anyways, I was jerkin and workin, and I wanted to escalate my masturbatory experience- I wanted to fuck something. Unfortunately for my young, narcissistically promiscuous self, this is easier said than done. So I set out on a quest, introspective and extrospective, to find some object that is fuckable. I looked at loofahs and chairs and trash cans and trash, but nothing quite fit the size of my pubescent dick. Until I found the one: it was a calendar I had (several years out of date) that was bound with a metal spiral, like a notebook. The spiral seemed just the right size to fit my monument to horniness. So, instead of taking precautions like lubing up or getting all the way hard or thinking, I went gung-ho at it. As I said before, I was not quite all the way erect, and so as I was going at it, the tiny monster began to expand. As you can imagine, it started to get a little uncomfortable in a couple of ways, so I decided to give it a rest. Unfortunately, the little guy had swollen a bit, both from bonerocity and from some chafing from the metal rings. I had found that my dick had gotten stuck in the calendar.

So there I was, saving the date in a very special way, and nobody else was home. I couldn't pry my Excalibur from this stone to crown myself the king of stupid fucking ideas. I had to get somebody to help, though. I wasn't about to call 911, since I had heard that you got billed for that sort of stuff and I didn't want my mom finding out about this escapade. The only person nearby that I could think of was old man Nicholson, my neighbor. This guy had to be 70, at least. He had been in the war, and was short, stocky, and I'm pretty sure was made of calluses. For the huge extent that I did not want to go to him for help, I had to. So I went a-waddling over next door as discreetly as possible, with my pants most of the way on. I  rang the doorbell, and after an uncomfortable minute or so, he came to the door. At first he didn't notice the problem, but I said something like ""Mr. Nicholson, I need some help,"" and looked down at the problem that had arisen. He didn't even bat an eye. He took me inside, and using some pliers, we eventually got the rings apart enough for me to withdraw. He didn't ask any questions, but when I was walking out of the door, he looked me in the eye and said:

""Son, you just don't fuck calendars""

TL;DR: Don't fuck calendars.

Blue-quaffle,,,"So the way I found out was every dad's worst nightmare. There I was on a weekday browsing in a private window when all of a sudden something caught my eye. It wasn't a video on the page, but one of the gif ads on the side of the page. 

As that brief image flashed in the corner of my eye I could have sworn I saw her, but it was just a quick flash. 'Haha that's impossible. It must have just looked like her', I kept telling myself as I continued to browse. I couldn't shake the feeling that I saw her though. 

About 5 minutes later, unable to relax, I just started refreshing the page until I saw that same ad pop up. I sat there and intently watched it through, and that's when I saw my baby girl's face pop up. My heart dropped and my mind started racing. 

There was my daughter. That cute little girl I had taught to read, there in an ad for a porn site with her top off and a penis near her face. I was sick to my stomach. I'm sick to my stomach now just typing about. It doesn't matter how comfortable or progressive you are, or think you are, you can't quite understand the feeling of seeing your daughter in porn.

Windex007,,,"I might be in an interesting position as someone who performed well above average in high school (not saying that means I was super intelligent or anything), lost a great deal of mental capacity after brain damage, and then spent the better part of a decade recovering, and then finally was able to succeed in university and am now again performing well above average there after a long struggle.

Maybe to start, I'd say what it's like to be mentally impaired. I'm sure different people have different stories and it's not a one-size-fits-all experience.

I would describe being challenged as... walking through deep snow every time you're looking to form a thought. You have a vague understanding of where you want to go, but there is this resistance and hesitation as you try to drag yourself to that destination. As well, thoughts and realizations materialize gradually... maybe like you're in a dense fog trying to deliver mail. You can see a house, and know it's there, but you have to blunder towards it before the house number materializes and you can confirm this is where you want to be... otherwise you need to backtrack and take a stab at another house.

It's a lot of effort. Even just talking is hard... especially if your goal is to say anything meaningful.

As things improved for me, what I began to notice was that the mental availability of tangential considerations was better too.

It's maybe like if you imagined yourself as having an assistant who, whenever you are thinking of something, rushed out and grabbed related memories and suggested alternative considerations and put them on your desk for you. This isn't even an entirely absurd analogy, as your subconscious brain actually does this on your behalf.

At my worst, my assistant was shitty, bringing me very little and what it brought was of poor quality. There were a great many things that my conscious mind had to work through that would have just been provided for me in a more fully worked state when I was healthier.

Now that things are better, and getting increasingly better, my assistant is fast and brings me a lot of tangential things to consider and, of higher quality too. Also, when these thoughts strike me, they're already in a more completely worked state.

I *imagine* that since I've got a few data points drawing a trend, I could extrapolate and say that very *very* intelligent people are even further able to offload certain processes into the backs of their heads, and by the time they arrive at the forefront of their minds eye they are even better assembled and ready for concious processing.",1428970894,,False,1,1590,AskReddit,True,False,447,0,Evening,61+,0,11,"{u'probability': {u'neg': 0.5910701121241584, u'neutral': 0.15562046375053287, u'pos': 0.40892988787584167}, u'label': u'neg'}",0.591070112124,0.408929887876,0.155620463751,neg,"{u'tone_categories': [{u'category_id': u'emotion_tone', u'tones': [{u'tone_name': u'Anger', u'score': 0.141443, u'tone_id': u'anger'}, {u'tone_name': u'Disgust', u'score': 0.124674, u'tone_id': u'disgust'}, {u'tone_name': u'Fear', u'score': 0.42395, u'tone_id': u'fear'}, {u'tone_name': u'Joy', u'score': 0.506113, u'tone_id': u'joy'}, {u'tone_name': u'Sadness', u'score': 0.540595, u'tone_id': u'sadness'}], u'category_name': u'Emotion Tone'}, {u'category_id': u'language_tone', u'tones': [{u'tone_name': u'Analytical', u'score': 0.635598, u'tone_id': u'analytical'}, {u'tone_name': u'Confident', u'score': 0.0, u'tone_id': u'confident'}, {u'tone_name': u'Tentative', u'score': 0.74855, u'tone_id': u'tentative'}], u'category_name': u'Language Tone'}, {u'category_id': u'social_tone', u'tones': [{u'tone_name': u'Openness', u'score': 0.674643, u'tone_id': u'openness_big5'}, {u'tone_name': u'Conscientiousness', u'score': 0.052312, u'tone_id': u'conscientiousness_big5'}, {u'tone_name': u'Extraversion', u'score': 0.242618, u'tone_id': u'extraversion_big5'}, {u'tone_name': u'Agreeableness', u'score': 0.750041, u'tone_id': u'agreeableness_big5'}, {u'tone_name': u'Emotional Range', u'score': 0.126978, u'tone_id': u'emotional_range_big5'}], u'category_name': u'Social Tone'}]}",0.141443,0.124674,0.42395,0.506113,0.540595,0.635598,0.0,0.74855,0.674643,0.052312,0.242618,0.750041,0.126978

Having a baby isn't the most noble endeavor on the planet. A fucking hamster can get pregnant and have a baby. If a hamster can do it, you shouldn't break your arm patting your own back because you did it. Like my first point, there is nothing inherently noble about having a child, it's what you do with the child that elevates you to greatness.  If your only goal is to keep the kid alive until 18, you can pretty much do that with a fucking dog crate, and a bunch of Totino's pizzas.  You want to impress me?  Teach your kid an instrument, introduce them to art, science, books, and the concepts of love and compassion. You make sure those little kids turn into decent human beings... that's noble.

One other thing. People are typically attracted to people of similar levels of ""attractiveness"". If you're a 4, and some guy or girl is an 8 and they're not interested in you. Why the fuck should they be? There are plenty of ""4's"" out there with great personalities, and there are also plenty of ""8's"" with great personalities as well.  Aim high, but don't hate someone for following their most basic biological impulse. It doesn't mean a guy is a dog or a girl is a stuck up bitch because they're not attracted to your asymmetrical face.

hornpipe,,,"Divorce after two years of marriage. It made me look at the reasons I got married, most of which were immature, and own up to mistakes. Now I know what I want in a partner and am willing to put the work in to be the partner that someone would want. 

Edit: Many people are asking me what the immature reasons are, so rather than respond to each inquiry, I'll post here. I did love my ex-husband in many ways, but our relationship was not the type that should have led to marriage. We had serious personality differences, and we wanted different things from life. I was looking for stability and was afraid that if I didn't get married then, I never would. I thought that what we had would be enough in a lot of ways, even though I knew that I wanted to focus on my career and he and I were not on the same page with that. In addition, I was coming out of treatment for an eating disorder and needed to spend more time growing as an individual, but I jumped into the first thing that looked stable. I have since recovered and I love the person I am becoming. Getting divorced at such a young age is all part of my story, and I do not regret the marriage, nor do I regret ending it. As I said to my ex recently, ""I wish I had had the strength to end the relationship before it became toxic."" With hard work, being teachable, and being authentic with myself, I have grown to accept why I chose him as a partner, what I contributed to the relationship and its eventual downfall, and how I can get the life and relationship that I desire in the future.",1426963105,,1426993350,1,3740,AskReddit,False,False,300,0,Afternoon,61+,0,29,"{u'probability': {u'neg': 0.6742585532612209, u'neutral': 0.19252370987072767, u'pos': 0.32574144673877914}, u'label': u'neg'}",0.674258553261,0.325741446739,0.192523709871,neg,"{u'tone_categories': [{u'category_id': u'emotion_tone', u'tones': [{u'tone_name': u'Anger', u'score': 0.129986, u'tone_id': u'anger'}, {u'tone_name': u'Disgust', u'score': 0.109673, u'tone_id': u'disgust'}, {u'tone_name': u'Fear', u'score': 0.599739, u'tone_id': u'fear'}, {u'tone_name': u'Joy', u'score': 0.290631, u'tone_id': u'joy'}, {u'tone_name': u'Sadness', u'score': 0.362136, u'tone_id': u'sadness'}], u'category_name': u'Emotion Tone'}, {u'category_id': u'language_tone', u'tones': [{u'tone_name': u'Analytical', u'score': 0.78456, u'tone_id': u'analytical'}, {u'tone_name': u'Confident', u'score': 0.0, u'tone_id': u'confident'}, {u'tone_name': u'Tentative', u'score': 0.012215, u'tone_id': u'tentative'}], u'category_name': u'Language Tone'}, {u'category_id': u'social_tone', u'tones': [{u'tone_name': u'Openness', u'score': 0.624703, u'tone_id': u'openness_big5'}, {u'tone_name': u'Conscientiousness', u'score': 0.015021, u'tone_id': u'conscientiousness_big5'}, {u'tone_name': u'Extraversion', u'score': 0.045647, u'tone_id': u'extraversion_big5'}, {u'tone_name': u'Agreeableness', u'score': 0.640514, u'tone_id': u'agreeableness_big5'}, {u'tone_name': u'Emotional Range', u'score': 0.07144, u'tone_id': u'emotional_range_big5'}], u'category_name': u'Social Tone'}]}",0.129986,0.109673,0.599739,0.290631,0.362136,0.78456,0.0,0.012215,0.624703,0.015021,0.045647,0.640514,0.07144

You know those iron bridges that resemble old style toasters? http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01375/Toaster-centenary_1375042c.jpg When early 20's me and my pals (mid-1970's) would approach one, we'd announce what kind of bread we were. ""I'm whole wheat."" ""I'm a bagel."" ""I'm cinnamon bread."", etc. Then we'd go over the bridge pretending that we were pieces of bread being toasted. The fun part was screaming ""AAAAAGGGGHHHH"" the whole way over/through the bridge and exclaiming, after we'd crossed, how crispy we felt.

I continued this tradition when I met my wife, and we really enjoyed it. It became ritual. Flash forward to the day our 10 year old daughter MARCHED into the house after being dropped off at home by her friend and her friend's parents after an outing. ""NOT EVERYONE PLAYS THE TOASTER GAME, DO THEY?"", she demanded. Apparently her little friend's dad freaked out when she screamed ""AAAAAGGGGHHH"" from the back seat when they went over a bridge. It was the first time she challenged our parenting skills and she was not amused at first, but upon reflection she thought it was pretty cool.

Prufrock451,,,"I fly to Washington, DC. I duck into a bank, pause time, make an unauthorized withdrawal, and then head to a nearby Kinko's, where I print up a few dozen identical flyers. 

Then, in the midst of the State of the Union, I slip copies into the pockets of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the President, the leaders of the Senate and House, the Supreme Court, and anyone I recognize from the intelligence community. 

They say the same thing: 

THIS IS MY FIRST CONTACT. I WILL VISIT THE OVAL OFFICE TOMORROW.

I will then visit the Oval Office tomorrow, leaving instructions for a dead drop. 

What comes next will be tricky. They'll analyze everything I leave behind; fingerprints, printer ink, skin flakes, everything. I'll have to maintain an insane level of caution. But then, I have nothing but time. 

With more funding from unauthorized sources (all of which I've carefully catalogued, against the day I'll need to reveal what I've done and request a pardon), I fly to Turkey. I make my way to Incirlik, where I walk casually up to the locker where I've requested my instructions be left. 

I then make my way to the indicated Humvee, checking the inventory of the attached trailer. 

A few weeks later, I return the Humvee, its trailer filled with boxes and crates. I return the binder of instructions to its locker, covered in highlighter. I make my way back to Istanbul. I shower and shave, and I sleep like the dead. The next morning, I fly back to the United States. If the desk clerk wonders why I wasn't tanned when I checked in the day before, he doesn't ask. 

In-flight wifi confirms what I expected: A shockingly well-coordinated series of ""drone strikes"" has decapitated the leadership of ISIS. Their command bunkers, destroyed. Weapons depots, destroyed. Double agents have sabotaged all of their heavy weapons, stolen vast amounts of intelligence. ISIS is doomed, and in the next few months the CIA expects to roll up anyone who's done business with them. In a stroke, one of the most evil organizations on the planet has been destroyed. 

I spend the night at the bar, smiling quietly, listening to the chants of ""USA! USA!"" as footage rolls across the screen. 

The hand falls on my shoulder. I nod. It was only a matter of time. 

The large man settles onto the stool next to me. 

""I could have taken you by surprise.""

""It was literally the only moment in history that was possible.""

The large man nods. ""And now it's gone."" He smiles. ""We thought it only fair to do you the courtesy.""

""Who's we?""

""Now that is the question of the day. See, there's more than one school of thought about you and your accomplishments. The growing consensus is that you have some device or artifact. Something that lets you do this. Something that can be confiscated. And once something *can* be done, well."" The large man drains half his pint. ""Anyway. That's the growing consensus. But ""we"" aren't part of that yet."" 

""And what do we believe?""

""We don't go in much for beliefs. We go in for results."" The large man eyes me. ""And we'd rather not kill the goose that lays the golden egg.""

cjthepossum,,,"Ex CO in a medium security prison in Oklahoma. We had some real weirdos. The day to day grind felt like any other job. Most of the time it was pretty boring and i thought about quitting a lot. I got to know a couple of the inmates which I regret very much looking back on all of it. There was a guy, let's call him Lewis who caught his wife cheating and killed her and the other guy. He didn't seem like the murderer type and I always wrote him off as a guy who made one really bad mistake.

So anyways, It's about three in the morning and I'm walking down the hall doing a head count. These are always eerily quiet and the smallest sound in the old, decrepit prison sent shivers down my spine. I heard the usual noises, coughing, ventilation fans running, the odd toilet flush. Yes, mattresses squeaking from people fapping. I heard some pretty heavy mattress squeaking as I turned the corner into another hallway. As I approach, I realize it's coming from Lewis's cell. He just got a new celly and I expected to see this new guy wanking away in there while poor old Lewis slept. 

That's definitely not what I saw. I shined the light in there and saw  Lewis, ass naked on top of the new guy. I will never forget the way the hair on his ass all kind of pointed toward his crack. The new guy looked mortified, crying, slobbering, slime coming out of his nose, all of it. Lewis was doing butt stuff to the new guy, big time. I took a mental note that both of them were indeed in their cell and went on with my night, trying to erase the mental picture. As I walked away, I heard Lewis whisper, ""You like that, don't you bitch?"" A second or two of silence followed and then I heard him speak again, ""If you didn't you should've used a serious tag.""

I would get a library card, spend my days there, use the water fountain there to fill up my pots and pans to cook my rice and potatoes. I'd have a 1/4 lb potato every day and about half a pound of rice every day. I'd have one orange a week. If need be, I'll get more supplies with my remaining money. I'll camp out in a tent in our local woods.

WritingForDummies,,,"I realized my marriage was awesome with a pretty simple moment. He had done something that bothered me (I can't even remember what, but it was trivial) and to ""get back"" at him, I didn't wash some dishes he needed for the next morning when it was my turn to do them.

As soon as I saw him a while later, I found myself confessing my stupid passive-aggressive behavior, telling him what I did and why. Instead of him being upset or PA back at me, he just laughed. Then I laughed. He still teases me about that moment and I'm happy to say it's really the only passive-aggressive thing that has happened since we've been married.

I know it's cliche, but it really is communication that makes our marriage awesome. That and a sense of humor and lots of honesty. In previous relationships, I was definitely passive-aggressive and didn't speak up when things bothered me. I think he was that way, too. But now I tell him as soon as anything upsets me in any way and we figure it out. He does the same.

The honesty can be hard (especially for someone like me who doesn't like confrontation) but it's worth it since it makes dealing with everything so much easier without letting it fester for days or weeks.

I could go on and on about all the things that make my marriage great. They're pretty universal, so I'd say these are the most important things:

* honesty
* not being passive aggressive when something bothers you
* letting them see you being vulnerable
* telling them how you feel (good or bad)

Thats the surface of it in a nutshell. PM any questions.

LadyTarTar,,,"I know, I know... no lawyer here but I had to share. A woman came in after her mother's funeral with some correspondence from the company I work for (Insurance). She was worried there was a bill she needed to pay and was coming to tell us her mom had died. She just looked SO tired, and we got to talking while I looked up the policy to close it out. She shared that in the last few years her mom had slipped into dementia and she singlehandedly took care of her...how she missed her but just was run ragged and she hadn't taken a vacation in forever. I realized what she had was not a health policy, it was a life insurance policy naming the daughter as the beneficiary for about 50K. I told her and she just started crying..it made me cry and I got up and hugged her and sort of just held her while she cried. She pulled away and said...""I have no idea what she left that for, everything's been paid for."" I said, ""This might be her telling you to go on that vacation and relax."" It was so touching, and she had no idea that the policy existed.

v_jax,,,"pharmacy student here. all these recommendations are for your average, healthy (no other medical conditions) adults.

**cough:** if it's dry, look for dextromethorphan (delsym). if it's a productive cough (mucus-y), then guafenisin (in robutussin and mucinex) is a good option. just make sure to drink A LOT of water as that can help thin the mucus in your chest as well. if the cough doesn't go away in 7 days or you're running a fever as well, go see your doctor. i'll also add this in here as well since i've commented it - these two meds didn't do much better than placebo in clinical trials! drinking a bunch of water is your best bet. 

**cold:** pseudoephedrine (sudafed) sold behind the pharmacy counter. it's a decongestant. might make you feel little jittery though, so i don't recommend taking this before bed. also, don't take this if you have any heart problems or blood pressure issues. afrin is also a great choice, but DO NOT take more than recommended. you'll get rebound congestion and get addicted to it (i'm serious...my dad's been addicted for YEARS). also saline sprays and neti pots work well, but make sure to use filtered water in the neti pot. 

**allergies:** i always tell people to start with claritin (loratadine), then if that doesn't work move to zyrtec (cetirizine), then if that doesn't work move to allegra (fexofenadine). mainly just because of the cost. different allergy meds work for different people. if your eyes are a huge problem, look for eye drops that have ketotifen as their main ingredient (like zaditor). flonase and nasacort are awesome, too.

**headache/pain:** tylenol or any OTC NSAID (ibuprofen-advil, naproxen-aleve) works well. make sure not to take more than 3 grams of tylenol in a day. ibuprofen max is 1200 mg/day and naproxen max is 660 mg/day. if the pain is more inflammatory in nature, then pick the NSAID over tylenol. beware NSAIDs if you have stomach issues like ulcers or GERD and also if you have kidney problems or if you're on a blood pressure med. avoid tylenol if you're a heavy drinker or have liver problems. side note: if you're prescribed ibuprofen by your doctor, then the max is 3,200 mg provided you're under the supervision of a physician. same goes for naproxen with the max increasing to 1,250-1,375 mg.

**nausea:** to prevent motion sickness, meclizine or diphenhydramine (benadryl) are great choices. pepto bismol is good for nausea associated with food or beverages.

**diarrhea:** ORAL REHYDRATION THERAPY! go pick up that salty nastiness that is pedialyte and drink it! also water. drink anywhere between 2-4 L over 3-4 hours and try to resume a normal diet as soon as possible. imodium (loperamide) and pepto bismol are also options, but go to your doctor if diarrhea happens for more than 48 hours. 

**constipation:** if it's been less than 7 days and you're not on an opioid pain med, try lifestyle changes. aerobic exercise, increasing fiber intake to between 20-35 grams, and drinking 1-4 L of water/day. then try bulk-forming laxatives (metamucil, citrucel). those should work in 1-3 days. if that doesn't work, move to miralax (takes about a day to work). if that doesn't work, try senna or bisacodyl (takes 6-12 hours to work). but if it's been a week, go see your doctor. 

**heartburn:** non-pharmacologic changes include to eat smaller meals, reduce fat intake, refrain from eating for at least 3 hours before lying down, avoid tobacco, limit/discontinue drinking alcohol, and elevate the head your bed. if you notice that certain foods contribute to your heartburn (spicy foods, chocolate, garlic, etc.), you can also try and minimize your intake of those foods as well, but the list of foods that might contribute to heartburn is everything good in the world! first line pharmacologically, try tums. take these with your meal as they last longer if ingested with food. if you're using these more than two times a week for two weeks, move up to H2 antagonist (ranitidine-zantac). take this 30 minutes before meals (only twice daily max). and if that doesn't work, you can try a 14 day trial of a PPI (omeprazole-prilosec, lansoprazole-prevacid, esomeprazole-nexium). take these once a day 30 minutes before the biggest meal, and they may take 1-3 days to work. still have symptoms? time to see a doctor. and these recommendations are ONLY for people that have typical symptoms of heartburn (exclusions for people that have trouble swallowing or pain when swallowing).

let me know if you have any questions! and PLEASE keep in mind these recommendations are for adults with no other medical conditions! talk to your pharmacist next time you're picking up your meds for further information!

He's the director of the company, single guy likes sports cars and only socialises with people who he knows through work. Confirmed when a) I do his christmas cards for him and b) have to constantly avoid meetings that turn into lunches that turn into nights out with just him and my SO. He eats at restaurants every night and brags about the loyalty discount he gets at the curry house, on the top of my street. He's constantly calling me into his office to watch funny youtube videos from about 5 years ago.

For christmas I bought him a jar of sweets which he keeps on his desk and I'm expected to keep it constantly refilled. If I really wanna keep him...sweet...I fill it with old 60s sweets to make him nostalgic and he's amused for days. 

 **Edit:**So much love for Mich...Malcolm! I will pass this on to him, I'm sure he'll find it very funny. Also, thank you for the gold! 5 years of trying to get it by myself and in the end it goes to the boss, typical! :P

You date around. You find some people you click with and some people you don't. But actually having a relationship has nothing to do with finding the perfect person, it has to do with BUILDING a relationship with the person you find. 

Relationships take work, and you get out what you put in - it can be difficult, and heart wrenching and change you as a person, but that's how life works. You open up to someone, put your feelings out there, and they reciprocate. Now, it's possible that they don't reciprocate and they don't feel for you like you feel for them - you can stick around or not, in that case. And sometimes you really should cut off ties if someone is crossing lines they shouldn't.

BizzQuit,,,"I attract a rather off class of women online. I dont know if it is my appearance or some of my peculiar hobbies. But I get some very peculiar women approaching me online. I occasionally humor their interest and once in awhile....things cross the screen and get real.....

this is one of those stories.  

A few weeks into chatting with a girl who contacted me through an old personals profile on a dating site started making me uncomfortable. She was far too interested....and while that had an odd creepy vibe....she also said things that I just didnt appreciate her weighing in on about my daughters and parenting (she didnt even have a kid)  

Well I end up telling her that Im just not feeling it anymore and that I dont feel we would make a good match....   

so her response after 3 weeks of online and phone chats....  
she got on a plane and spent two weeks trying to fuck me into loving her.... the whole time me making it very clear that I am spending time with her to be polite because she booked this trip and paid to come out and spend time with me.....but its not going to change that I dont see any future potential.   

I must admit....a felt a bit man raped at times..but she knew where I lived and worked....and my kids were 14 at the time....just seemed easier to spend evenings entertaining this girl than it did to have her intrude on my daytime life. I mean wah fucking wah hot foreign chick wants to bang you for a few weeks....whos complaining.  

Anyway she gets to the end of her trip....I tell her nothing has changed....she tries to act like nothing is wrong and keeps texting me and emailing and voice mails....oh boy....eventually....   

she just suddenly shifted gears and for two days I was berated by text. once she felt she had fully made it clear that I wasnt ready for us....she dropped off. 

""wasnt ready for us"" still makes me nervous sometimes thinking about it.....like one day I will be?

(I'll skip parts that aren't relevant so this doesn't get too long. For instance:)

After getting scammed out of 1400 [pre-Euro] Francs in Place Pigalle, my buddy (let's call him Quincy) and I sat up all night, drinking all the wine and eating all the snails and hating French people. Like you do.

I don't remember much of that night. I do remember that at some point we created from scratch an incredibly intricate, amazingly fun game that revolved around sliding coins around on a cafe table. The game is lost to memory, and was in fact gone from our heads by the time we came up with the even *better* idea, which was to go to Amsterdam. We figured if we were gonna get drugged and fucked, we might as well get *properly* drugged and fucked. That was the plan, anyway.

Quincy made some slurred calls at a phone box while I urinated almost pure vin rouge into the trough inside the last cafe, the early morning sun slanting in through the window kicking my brain in the balls the whole time. By the time I was done and had splashed some water on my face, he had secured bullet train tickets and three nights in a four-star hotel because why the fuck not (oh, Quincy has money; I totally would have had my throat slit in the shadowy warrens of that ""Maison de Burlesque"" if he hadn't been there to furiously pay our laughably inflated *addition*).

We jump (well, we stumble incoherently) onto the train. There was a kid with a noisy handheld game; that's all I remember. Some unknown amount of time later, we are in Amsterdam. We walk (well, stagger under the weight of hangovers so bad I keep checking to see if my nose is bleeding) to the hotel, where we find that we're about two hours early and that our room isn't available yet. So we traipse (that doesn't sound right; we must have taken a taxi) across the street to the nearest ""Coffee Shop"". I'm assuming you know why that's in [quotes](http://imgur.com/iDoqPHP).

We must have looked really bad, because the waiter poured us coffees unbidden and showed us to a table in the back. We let him know that we were just waiting for our room across the street, and were not in fact going to murder/vomit on anyone. He told us to hang out as much as we liked, and did we want anything else? I, having danced my share of dances with any number of low-level poisons, asked for a nice Space Cookie or something to go with the (best I've ever had, BTW) coffee. *Quincy*, who that past year had only just started drinking *alcohol*, pointed haggardly at the little baggies of purple-and-orange-and-green hanging on the rack behind the bar. ""Oh, and a pipe or something. Please.""

I ate my cookie-thing and got a nicely high. Quincy smoked about an eighth to his stupid, stupid fucking face and proceeded to get so exquisitely paranoid that he convinced himself that the coffee-shop waiter was the same guy as he who had frog-marched (Edit: [no pun intended](http://imgur.com/CvqYW6W)) us to the ATM outside the Moulin Rouge the night before. I guess it's my own fault for not stepping on the brakes, but everyone's gotta learn sometime, right?

Anyhoo. We check in. I go off and have an amazing three-day adventure in Amsterdam. I (sort of) stop a mugging. I have a brief, painful love affair with an ex-prostitute who is in training to become an opera singer. I see the Van Gogh museum, and the Museum of Sex. I eat pizza. Etc.

Quincy, ever the compulsive consumer, proceeds to smoke brain-shattering amounts of pot and watch hour after hour of gross Europorn in the hotel room for the entirety of the trip. The only time I see him is when I come home to sleep, which I do on the mattress I've dragged out onto the balcony because he has stanked up the room so bad with room-service-farts.

So it's our last night in Amsterdam.

""So it's our last night in Amsterdam,"" I say to Quincy, over the sounds of *oonCH oonCH oonCH oonCH* music and sodomy coming from the television. ""You've got to at least see the place *once*. Anything you wanna do, we'll do. Do you want to see the canals? You want to go bungie-jumping? See the Van Gogh? Anything you want. Just name it, buddy.""

His eyes never leave the TV. ""I wanna have sex with a prostitute.""

""Ohhhh... *Kay.*""

I go down and wait for him in the cafe in front of the place while he de-grossifies. He comes down, looking like a kid tiptoeing his way across the room on his first day of kindergarten. Oh, and he has a massive, eye-catching erection clearly visible through his cargo pants. We head off.

We walk along the canal, eyeing the goods. We explore Fat Black Chick Street; we amble along Terrifying Russian Girl Avenue (Edit: not actual street names). The women are lined up behind glass windows, shaking and shimmying. It's like walking through a pet shop, only with slightly more window-licking. Quincy weighs the pros and cons of a dozen different girls, and finally decides that he doesn't want to do it anymore and that he wants to go back to the hotel. Fuck that. I tell him that we're going back out onto the main canal-street, and at the very fucking least having a drink at the first restaurant or bar we come to.

Which is a place called ""Bananenbar"".

Bananenbar is *nicer* than you're imagining right now, first of all. Have you ever been to one of those giant old-timey one-screen theaters, with velvet seats and and art-deco murals on the walls and Roman columns and signs of the Zodiac lovingly painted across the royal blue ceiling and all that? Okay, well imagine that, but with actual people actually fucking in front of you on stage.

Yeah, it's a live sex show. As in you come in, an usher in epaulets takes you to your seat, and watch people hump. Real weiners going into real buh-ginas. I mean yes, it's done with as much artsy-fartsy as possible, the slightly bored-looking people switching positions faster than an early-Nineties Skinemax ""love scene"". I would love to be a fly on the wall during rehearsal of *that* show:

""Alright people, let's keep it lively, remember to cheat out with your genitalia, and have *fun!* Five, six, seven, eight and *Blowjob!* Good, good, work the balls, Ingrid... good! Mani, arch back a little, let's see those abs! Excellent! Okay, the shitty Enigma 'monks chanting on top of a dance beat' song is about to change chords, so... let's... go with it annnnd... *Reverse Cowgirl!* Good! Wonderful! Ingrid, do the hair thing--- GOOD! We're making *magic* here, people!""

Oh, and another thing: this is a *tourist attraction.* This place isn't full of haggard, solitary men sitting equidistant from one another and angrily masturbating under their raincoats. This place is full of lively, happy ""theater-goers"". Quincy and I were actually seated next to an entire Japanese *family*, two (adolescent (still, though)) children in tow and all. They sell *t-shirts* in the lobby. Okay? So:

Yeah, so we're there. The price was either one Moneys (it's been literally a decade; forgive me if I forget details) or Slightly More Moneys and you get two drinks included. So we carry in our four beers, say *konbanwa* to our seat-neighbors, and quietly and briefly argue over who has to watch a live sex show while sitting next to a twelve-year-old Asian boy. Quincy backs down due to his pants-shitting terror of Someone Noticing him at any moment and slumps down into the seat.

I join him and we watch shaved, sculpted, tanning-bedded Estonians or whatever make lackadaisical love. Honestly, the actual ugly-bumping is the *boring* part. You can kinda tell that these people have been doing it (heh) waaay too long (HAW!) and would probably be in art school or something if times weren't so tight. (what? What's so funny?)

The fun parts are in *between* the sex acts. While the sex actors go off and get hosed down and re-lube and Viagra up and all that, there are little cabaret-style acts to get the crowd pumped up (HAH! *snort*). A guy will come out at do a Sexy Puppet Show; there are Sexy Balloon Animals, Sexy Card Tricks. A guy that spins plates-- let me *FINISH*-- on his dick. You get the idea.

Throughout, there is a woman who comes out and keeps things moving. Let's say she looks amazing for fifty, with dark hair and, what, Eurasian features? Is that a thing? I'm getting an ""ex-sex-worker/the Owner/MC of the place or something"" vibe. Anyway: she comes out in between the lie-down-hugging parts, dressed in various ""sexy"" outfits, and gets people to come up onto the stage in these little audience-participation bits. She shows up as a dominatrix and paddles some dude's butt. Gives a guy a lapdance while wearing a fat-suit and bloomers. You get the idea.

Each time she shows up, I joke to Quincy that he should raise his hand and go up onstage. Quincy, who isn't having a good time at *all*, keeps telling me to shut the fuck up. He's coming off of a seventy-hour high, and is too busy melting into his seat for such shenanigans. I keep at him; he keeps telling me to be quiet and concentrating on not throwing up.

Finally the moment arrives. Elsa (c'mon, you *know* her name was probably ""Elsa"") shows up on stage in a Carmen Miranda outfit: bright yellow pants and top, a bunch of fruit on her head. Maracas. Got it? So: She sambas her way back and forth the stage with a police whistle in her mouth, then starts spotlighting people with a banana-shaped flashlight, beckoning them up onstage. She gets two douchey-looking fratboys and an Ali G lookalike up on stage with her, and is shading her eyes as she scans the crowd for one more victim.

wearehell,,,"Just failed out of college. Moved back in with my dad. Things weren't going real well between us. I was depressed and not really going anywhere. I was angry at my dad because he came down on me so hard but I was mostly angry at myself, and his attitude toward me just kind of compounded it all. 

Anyway one day after being out at a friends house and hanging out all over the city for a couple days I finally came home and things around my house were just tense and I felt like nothing and like I would never get out from under this.. weight.  So I just started packing some stuff.   As I was leaving I remember I was coming out of my room with a Bag. This wasn't unusual because I would often take a bag with me when Id be gone to a friends house, but today, my dad was standing at the top of the steps just looking down at me. I remember very vividly , him standing there with his hands in his pockets kind of looking at me then looking away and he quietly just asked.

""where you going son?""

I just looked up like everything was normal and just said "" Im going to so and so's house""

He nodded slowly "" when ya com in back?""

I shrugged slowly "" I don't know dad""

Somehow he knew. I could feel it.  I never came back home, days turned into weeks and months and then years.   I could tell he knew.  It makes me so sad now when I think of it. Like I tore his heart in two. He has never been a very expressive man, but I could just tell how sad he was.  I needed this though, I needed to go off on my own and suffer the real world and grow up some.

It still hurts my heart to think about him slowly nodding after I told him "" I don't know dad""

Edit: hey guys, sorry I didn't thinks this would have gotten much attention.  I'm updating this from my iPad. 

I want to thank all of you for your kind words and the even the the ones calling me out for being selfish.  Sorry if I worried you guys, all to of the emotion you read was in me looking back on the moment.

First I'd like you all to know I have been in contact with my dad since I left. And things are pretty good. I left during a time when cell phones were not popular and I spent a lot of time on the streets at first with the only thing I owned being a car that I kind of lived out of.  Eventually a good friend of mine had his family take me in and I spent years helping their family while kind of searching for what to do.  

During this time I would periodically just speak to my dad and step mom and mom and step dad on the phone every few months.  They knew I was alive and well.  My dad never really brought up the fact that I'd left, and would just make sure I was doing alright.  We just don't have a relationship where we express much.   I think he understood as time went on. See he has this idea of how I should have progressed through life,  I wasn't good at his plan, I was too immature.  I left not because I was unhappy with him and what he provided me but more so that I could stand shoulder to shoulder with him and make my own successes.  I just wasn't who he expected me  to be and it took a lot of growing away from him for us both to understand that.  

After a few years I went to visit him in his office and it turns out he had bought me a cell phone ( my first).  It was enough of a sentiment for me to understand that he understood what I needed, he just wanted to talk to me occasionally. I tell my dad I love him every time we talk.

Chivobear,,,"My mother had undiagnosed bipolar disorder for much of my childhood. I spent the majority of my formative years being tortured by her, being beaten, locked in closets, being left alone for days at a time, and not to mention the horrible things that would come out of her mouth. Around the age of three I started to notice there was a ghost in my house. A mean ghost who would do horrible things to me and make me do things that would get me in trouble with my nice mommy. This ghost would pretend to look like my mom so that I couldn't tell the difference between her and my mom. For years I told people about this ghost....it took me a really long time to realize it was the awful side of my mother and that as a 3 year old that was the only way I could comprehend all the awful things my mom did to me. I told my grandmother and she took me in and saved me from that awful hell. She was the most amazing person I have ever known and the only person who has ever shown me how it feels to be loved unconditionally like a mother should. She died when I was 14 from MS. I was absolutely destroyed, she was the only thing that gave me hope in life. So back to my mother I went. 3 more years of being tortured by her ended with her trying to run me over with her car because I didn't want to leave that minute and drive to St. Louis with her on a whim. I had no where to go and no family so at 17 I joined the Army, which saved my life. It gave me all the support of family but I still had a hole in heart where the space of loved ones was supposed to be, until I had my children which filled all the empty space in my heart. I thank god everyday for them.
