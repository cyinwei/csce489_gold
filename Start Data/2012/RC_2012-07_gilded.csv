True,dignityblows,,"28/F/5'4"" | S: 222lbs C: 145.7lbs G:18%BF | SD: 07/05/2011","Well folks, it’s been exactly one year since I took a good, hard look at myself and decided to reclaim my health. My combination Keto/Paleo diet has honestly been 99% of the reason for my success (as I’ve done virtually zero intentional exercise in the last year), and I cannot thank this subreddit enough for its wisdom and support (in addition to r/loseit and r/progresspics!). Now, if I may be so bold, I’d love to give back:

(The following is advice that I’ve admittedly repeated a few times on reddit, but I’m such a fervent believer of this ideology that I don’t think it can be restated enough. That said, I can only speak for what’s worked for me, so take all this with a grain of salt.)

When you're first starting your journey to better health through fat loss, the thought of losing weight can be extremely daunting. Thinking about how many pounds/kilos you need to lose, or how much time it's going to take to reach your goal weight, or how hard exercising is going to be, can seem really overwhelming (if not almost impossible). It’s easy to get discouraged, easier to just feel like giving up, and, on some days, really fucking hard to get motivated to do anything at all.

If this sounds all too familiar, I recommend something a little unorthodox: Don't make your weight loss journey JUST about reaching a final goal. Before you click ‘send’ on that hatemail, I am not saying that goals are bad. Goals are great and completely necessary. But without actionable, concrete behaviors to support them, goals can be very hard to visualize. If you're anything like me, it's easy to get so caught up in how much farther you have to go, you lose sight of how far you've already gone.

**Part A: Take your weight loss one day at a time.** Trust me, I recognize how stupid and cliché this sounds. But instead of dwelling on how difficult your entire journey is going to be, focus on making it through Today. This is the only thing you have to worry about, ever.

**Part B: Establish daily healthy habits.** Daily habits are tangible things that you can check off of a list. “Lose 85 pounds” is a good goal, but lacks direction on its own. “Drink 1400ml of water a day”, “Eat at or under 1400 calories” and “Complete 20 pushups” are observable, verifiable, reproducible habits.

Armed with these two halves to the ideological whole, I encourage you to take back Today. Today, you are in complete control. Today, you are choosing to stick to pre-defined healthy habits. Not lose X pounds, not fit into size X pants. You are choosing to eat within or under your caloric limit, drink plenty of water, and maybe exercise a little. That's it. No matter how bad you fucked up yesterday or what the scale says after that particularly shameful McDonald’s run, it doesn't matter.

That's right. It doesn't matter what the scale says. You gained a pound since yesterday? No big deal. Your body is a dynamic and surprisingly resilient organism that fluctuates and changes all the time for a variety of reasons. As long as you dedicate yourself to eating within your caloric allotment and staying even just mildly active, the pounds will eventually come off. Yes, your weight might fluctuate from day to day for any number of reasons, but as long as you stick to your habits, the overall trend will be a loss in pounds. Now, if your habits leave you plateauing for a significant amount of time, it’s time to adapt and reevaluate. Learn from your mistakes, don’t dwell on them. 

Maybe it’s just me, but I’m always intrigued by how quickly time goes by. Regardless of whether I ate 3000 calories over my limit or exercised my ass off and ate like a mouse, the world still turns, the sun still rises and sets, and another day gets ticked off the calendar. The hours are going to pass whether I like it or not, and it’s up to me to make the most out of all 24 of them. Every minute is an opportunity to do something great, and every minute you don’t act is an opportunity squandered. 

You are more than just a number on a scale. You are greater than the sum of your cravings. You are a complex and amazing human being, and no matter what you might think, you are in control of your weight loss. Because shit, you can do anything for 24 hours. So why not start now?

**tl;dr - Take your weight loss one day at a time, establish daily healthy habits, and never, ever, ever, ever, ever give up. &lt;3**

""Please believe me when I tell you I did not plan my facial expressions, nor did I intentionally arrange them in a way to make my face more flattering in later photos. In the early stages of taking progress pictures, I literally only took one photo of myself. I hated the way I looked and wanted to spend as little time in front of the mirror as possible. I didn't realize that I should've opened up my face more, smiled, cleared the hair out of my eyes and stood up straight. I had so little self-confidence that the thought honestly never crossed my mind."" [Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/w2kuu/365_days_85_pounds_2ish_pieces_of_advice_f54/c59qfgb)

*Nitty Gritty Diet Details*:

I do my own kind of Keto-Paleo hybrid. I constantly run into people who tell me it's impossible to combine Keto and Paleo (most notably, because Paleo ""allows"" for too many carbs). Frankly, I've always viewed the Paleo diet as a very rough guideline as to what types of food you should eat for optimum overall health (""eat this to not be sick""), while Keto provides the macronutrient recommendations necessary for fat loss (""eat this much of those things to lose weight""). With this mindset, an individual can easily implement both methodologies simultaneously...I've adopted the Paleo lifestyle and food options because I have tons of food sensitivities, but I'm adhering to Keto macros to lose weight.

* 1200-1300 calories a day
* Keto-esque macros (but purists will note I'm TOTALLY WRONG OMG)  at 60% fats, 30% protein, 10% carbs
* Paleo-esque foods (Eggs, fish, pork, beef, lamb, chicken, veggies, veggies, veggies, a small amount of nuts, avocado/coconut/almond oils, a small amount of fruit, and the occasional low-lactose dairy)
* Daily multivitamin, fish oil
* 3 liters of water/day

True,super_pickle,,,"I was at a friend's place in her kitchen, grabbing something out of a cabinet.  I lived with her family for a while so I (thought I) was home alone.  A sneeze hit me out of the blue, so I didn't have time to prepare for it.  I threw my head forward when I sneezed and banged my head on the cabinet.  It stunned me a little and I staggered backwards, backing into the kitchen island, which threw me off balance and I fell down.  The second I hit the ground, I let out a loud fart.  I was just laying on the ground, not knowing what had just happened, when I noticed her dad standing in the doorway with the biggest smile I've ever seen on his face.",0,1341598833,,0,False,1,c5aab67,t3_w4vbw,t1_c5aab67,t3_w4vbw,,1429311504,323,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,323
True,Griffie,,,"I was just coming out at the time that AIDS came into public awareness ( I was 25 at the time). I had moved to Denver to kind of find myself and figure things out...to get away from my hometown. Not knowing anyone in Denver, I of course started making friends. Unfortunately, what happened was that a few months after I'd make a friend, they'd pass away from complications of AIDS. I attended just over 20 funerals the first year I was there.  

It was a scary time. Not  only the fear of AIDS, but I started getting to where I was afraid to try to make any friends knowing that the chance of them dying from AIDS was extremely high. 

There was also the fear of not knowing the specifics of how the disease was transmitted. It was strongly believed at the time it was sexual, but there was no information on other methods of transmitting it...casual contact? kissing? sharing eating utensils? No one knew, and everyone in the gay community was afraid. 

Over  time, AIDS wiped out an entire generation of gay men. This has had an effect on the more recent generations since people that would normally have been mentors, big brother figures, teachers, etc. were gone, so the younger generation lost out on the wisdom and experience of the previous one. 

The worst thing was when my first gay friend (and my best friend), came to me two years after I moved back home, that he had AIDS. He told me how scared he was, and that he didn't want to die. He was one of the first group that was put on AZT as the one and only treatment at the time. He died 8 months later. 

EDIT:  Ok...so this is my very first posting on reddit. I'm OVERWHELMED by the responses. I had no idea it would take off like this!  

This has also brought me to tears many times...I have pushed all of this deep in the back of my mind for over two decades. Thank you everyone for your posts. It has really been healing for me to finally face the tragedy of the past, and at the same time,  brought back a lot of very fond memories of the friends I've lost.

True,Then_I_Saw_Zeus,,,"I had a similar yet more depressing situation like this. I moved out of North Carolina to California for a job (Aunt/Brother got me blind hired at the company they worked for) and I packed my truck up and went, leaving my mother (who Bro and I support) and my dogs back in NC. After 10 months of being away (and doing the talk to my dog over the phone thing several times) my dog got very suddenly sick and took a fucking NOSE DIVE in health. 

He went to the vet on a Monday and by that Friday I was hopping an emergency flight (booked 2 hours before plane left) to NC to be there with him because the Vet told me it was a neurological thing (too advance for them to figure out exactly what it is/was) and he may have to be put down, I told them DO NOT put him down unless it is literally the only way for him to not be in dire pain/trouble until I get there.

I went into the vet the second they opened to get him and was on the verge of losing my shit (I'm a big scary lookin fella and was on the verge of crying) and as they walked me back to the kennel section and flicked the lights on he began to bark. Without missing a beat i gave my trade mark 'Oi!' which I always used to get his attention and the barking silenced. A fraction of a second later I heard him body throwing himself into the kennel cage door trying to get out so i pushed passed the vet tech and ran to his kennel and between Scout (my dog) and myself we pretty much ruined the door.


This is where it gets depressing, so If you don't like sad stuff stop there and enjoy the teary-eyed reunion.


Scout's condition had degraded so much, so quickly that one of his legs was completely useless and on the verge of locking up, so he could not walk, let alone stand under his own power. So here was my BEST FRIEND who was there for me when my dad died when I was 16, Saw me off at the door EVERY TIME of EVERY DAY I left the house and would greet me back at the door upon returning with his favorite toy, and the only living thing I would sacrifice 99.8% of anything in existence for, dragging himself out of the kennel and into my arms like the old pedophiles dog on Family Guy. In under a week my dog had went from running around the backyard chasing his tennis ball to being nigh-crippled by some unknown problem.

The Vet informed me short of a miracle and a god-awful amount of money (which I would have to drive over an hour away to a neurological specialist to even begin trying to diagnose him, assuming of course they could find out WHAT it was, IF they could fix it before he got in any worse condition/pain.

So I ate what happiness I had inside me and picked my best friend, who has loved me through the worst times in my life, up and took him home. I played with him (given he couldn't move it was limited but it made my mom cry to see his old energy back and the way he used to 'smile/grin' which he stopped doing after I had been gone for a few months) and spent every moment with him. I would feed him, I would pick him up and take him outside so he could sit/lay outside. I would help him piss and shit because he could not (I mean I would lift his leg and balance him so he did not piss all over himself, help him squat so he could try and shit, and then clean him up after EVERY bathroom trip) and I didn't flinch. I loved that dog more then almost everything in my life.


After our weekend I knew I had to take him in and end his suffering even though neither of us wanted it. He wanted nothing more then to spend time with me and make me happy (and it confused and hurt him to know I was devastated, he would wake me up at night to lick me, whine, and then cuddle with me just so I would know he was there...and I am sure it helped him too) but it had to be done.

A part of me died in the vet room with him when he was put to sleep and I don't remember anything outside of the night my dad died that ripped my heart to shreds that bad. I could not cry enough, I cried so hard it was more like guttural moan-crying from my gut as i clung to his body with my face buried in the scruff of his neck.

It has been over a year since that event took place and I am still hollow in the spots he helped heal. Every time I think it is finally starting to scar over and not suck so bad, some memory or thought rips it open anew...even if it is a happy memory, which makes it all the more crushing that he is gone and not with me. Even the GREAT dream I had about him ruined me for days after waking up. Not even talking about bad days I have where I wish I still had him as a crutch. 10 years I had him.

Well Aww, there you go. I am sorry for ruining your day if you read that. Its good to talk about Scout even if its sad or depressing because I never want to forget him. This subreddit always cheers me up and I ""Aww"" a lot at animals and even get sad when I see dogs that look like Scout.

True,radarsat1,,,"The problem with anti-drug campaigns, the reason, I'm convinced, that they don't really work, is that they lie to you.  They tell you that drugs are horrible and will ruin your world.  They don't tell you how much fun they are, or how good they feel.  So kids are told drugs are _bad, bad_ things and to stay away from them, but just.. on the off chance.. that they try it.. all their carefully programmed predispositions towards drugs are shattered.  ""Hey, this is _great_.""  On top of that, you are surrounded by friends who are open to doing them, and ""gee, _they_ seem fine, their lives are not destroyed.  Maybe I can do this safely after all.""

You see, although drugs can be harmful, the fact is they are _not_ nearly as harmful to a large number of people.  The anti-drug campaigns are attempting to stop the select few people who are seriously affected by drugs, who tend towards addiction, to ever get there by trying them and falling in love.  They take the abstinence route: ""if addicts never try drugs, they can't get addicted!  So we'll tell everyone never to try drugs! Perfect!""

It's the same logic applied in abstinence-based sex ed:  The fact is, sooner or later, teens will try sex, and realize that it's _awesome_.  The word will get around, and soon a large number of teenagers are pregnant.  Keep in mind, not _all_ the teenagers are pregnant, but more are than would have been had they been encouraged to use protection.

Same for drugs.  If kids were encouraged to take a _safe_ approach to drug use, there might be some more success in avoiding addiction.  If they were warned what the signs of addiction are, and how to avoid them, they might have a chance.  But instead, because we are collectively scared of drugs, and scared to admit that manipulation of your neurotransmitters can be fun, we don't tell them to enjoy but watch out, instead we just tell them simply ""drugs are bad, don't do drugs.""  And this oversimplified image is _shattered_, just completely shattered, on the first puff or swallow.  It's no wonder they think MJ is a gateway drug.  It's because they lied about how awesome it makes you feel, and this becomes _blindingly obvious_ to teenagers when they try it.  So as soon as they break the barrier, they have little left except their own common sense to protect them in the world of chemical experimentation.

So the reason for your reaction to this post is that he didn't lie to you; he didn't tell you that the first time he tried it he was hooked and ended up in an alley.  Instead, he explained what it feels like, why he tried it, why he kept trying it, and described the gradual progression he experienced towards addiction.  Stories like that, that you can empathize with, and that can and do hold up under your own empirical ""investigations"" are far more effective deterrents to addiction.  From stories like this, it's much easier to appreciate the subtleties of addiction and imagine how easy it might be to not notice them creeping up on you. You begin to imagine how to put up checks and balances in your attitude towards life, to watch yourself for signs of addiction, to be seriously introspective about it based on what you understand from other people's _true_ experiences.. you can imagine how the story might apply to other areas, like alcoholism, or even workoholism.  And that is far more valuable a lesson than a warning never to try something.

tl;dr Anti-drug campaigns would be a lot more effective if they didn't lie, pretending that anyone who tries something for the first time will ruin their life.",0,1342551220,,0,False,1,c5fd7cu,t3_wnj2d,t1_c5fd7cu,t1_c5ezp8v,,1429399792,39,False,IAmA,t5_2qzb6,39

True,brinked,,,"There are a bunch if useless baby products out there such as the diaper genie.

Do not buy a bunch of one type of diaper.  We thought we needed 10 cases of diapers for when the baby came so we had 10 cases of huggies.  It turned out our baby didnt agree with huggies.  Buy a variety of a few different brands to see which one you and your baby like most.  For us it was pampers dry max.

If you have a boy, make sure to point his peepee down before wrapping the diaper.  Otherwise, he will be pissing on his face every 10 minutes.

Get a mother fucking swing.  We got the papasan swing by fisher price and every time we put his little ass in there, he would stop crying instantly and fall asleep within minutes.  This was by far the best investment we ever made.  Be sure to get one that swings side to side and front to front, side to side is what worked best for us.  Try to get one with lights and shit.

Try to get the bassinet that converts into a playpen and has an attached diaper changing table.  Our son is 21 months and we still use the thing as a playpen.  Its the one item we still use from when he was a newborn. The pack and play is awesome.  Get that shit.

Get yourself A+D and triple paste.  Use a+d after every diaper change and use triple paste whenever you see a rash building up.  Triple paste will clear that rash up real fast.  

Get a bunch of onesies, the cheapest you can find because you will go through them really fast.  Do not worry about cute and expensive baby clothes for your newborn, you will change his clothes about 6 times a day so dont even bother with that until he/she is about 3 months old.

Learn how to swaddle your newborn.  It mother fucking works.  Watch some youtube videos about it, its pretty easy once you practice it a few times.  

Try to buy long sleeve clothes for your newborn so he/she doesn't scratch her face all the time.

Try to never get the jumperoo or excersaucer.  We had it and he loved it so we always put him in it.  Because of it, it took him longer to learn how to walk, and even longer to get him to not walk on his tippy toes.


You do not need a baby crib right away.  Or even baby furniture.  You can wait a few months for that after the baby is born.  You will only be using the portable baby bassinet for the first 2+ months and keep it by your bed.  Try not to fall asleep with the baby in your bed.   Keeping the bassinet very close by helps with this.

If you have a smart phone get a white noise app.  The white noise shuts them the fuck up so you can have some peace of mind when you're changing their shit.  You can always shhhh them in their ear calmly.  

If you cant get your baby to stop crying, hold them upright in your arms and gently bounce up and down, this will get them to burp, which is usually the cause of why they are crying.

Talk to your baby often.  Your voice is very soothing to them and it will help them talk faster as well.  Try to read.  Reading is good, dont actually read the book just show him the pictures and say what ever the hell you want, they will never even know because they cant read yet so you're golden for now.


Get a pacifier.  And then start calling it a binky.  I swore I would never say that fruit ass word in my life, but you try saying the word pacifier 50 times a day and you will start saying binky because its just fucking easier than saying pacifier.  And if you think you will be one of those people who wont give the binky, then fine, enjoy not getting any sleep asshole.  Just make sure to get them off it before 20 months, its much easier than doing it when they are older.  We took the binky away at 18 months and it was only 1 day of fussiness before he forgot all about it.

Breastfeed if you can for as long as you can.  It will be hard at first but dont get down, it gets much much easier and its much more convenient than bottle feeding.  It also allows for some great bonding with your baby as well.


Get them cheap ass disposable diapers and use them as burp clothes.  They are cheap and effective.

Amazon is a great place to find great baby stuff.  If you can, become a prime member.  Having the ability to have everything shipped to your door in 2 days is a life saver when you have a newborn.  Diapers are usually cheaper on amazon with subscribe and save as well.

Try to use slickdeals.net and put an alert in for diapers and other baby essentials.  This will alert you via email whenever there is a good deal and it will save you some serious money.

True,SovereignGFC,,,"The problem I see with this term is that everyone defines it differently (incoming wall of text).  Then, people argue back and fourth and get angry, without realizing the difference is how they're using the term rather than any actual disagreement.  This isn't always the case but it happens a lot more than it should!

In my experience the friend zone results from non-willful ignorance (deliberate ignorance being a separate issue that isn't addressed at all here), malice or both.  As soon as everyone's intentions are revealed, *it's no longer ""friendzone.""*  To me, friendzone is about poor/nonexistent communication.  Once everyone knows where everyone else stands, it's unrequited love (s/he knows I want to be in a relationship and s/he says no), creepy stalking, etc.

I split straight men who talk about friend-zones into two types for the purposes of this discussion.  Type 1 (Passive Nice Guys) and Type 2 (Sex Fiends).  It may even be possible to reverse the men and women here, as well.  Heck, this probably applies where friendship/relationship/sex lines blur no matter the orientation of those involved (gay, straight, lesbian, bisexual, queer, etc.)

**Ignorance**

Type 1: The Actual Nice Guys.  They're *not* trying to get into her pants, or, that's not the primary driver.  They think being ""nice"" will earn her respect and cause her to initiate a relationship (or at least create an opportunity).  Even if she talks endlessly about how she ""can't find a perfect guy"" and may even hint that he might be ""that guy"" she wants, *he does nothing.*  His continued passivity is the problem in this case, unless she specifically drops these hints, then says ""we're just friends"" (this will be addressed in another section).  He also goes above and beyond what I'd consider reasonable ""friend but not boyfriend"" behavior by bending over backward for her.  This is highly subjective, but being a former Type 1 myself I know exactly where *I* draw the line at ""This goes beyond friendship and we're not that, so you will have to find someone else.""

**Malice**

Type 2: The Sex Fiends.  They emulate Type 1s with the sole or primary goal of getting sex.  The best ones aren't ""detected"" but many are clumsy.  She smells this a mile away and puts an end to thoughts of sex before it even begins (assuming she does not want such a relationship).  If she keeps repelling them, it triggers a perverse ""Challenge Accepted"" in some.

I split straight women who are accused of friend-zoning into two types as well.

**Ignorance**

Type 1 (Different Definition of Friendship): She doesn't view things the same way he does--e.g. those flowers were ""just a cute thing"" (he views it as a ""Please like me"" for instance).  She genuinely just thinks he's being ""nice"" for the sake of ""being friends.""  Combined with Type 1 Guy's passivity, it makes a wonderful mess of things.  He keeps wondering why she doesn't ""notice him"" and she may wonder why he seems to be glued to her (see ""reasonable friend but not boyfriend"").  This doesn't apply to Type 2; friend-zoning someone who is only after sex when she is not interested is not the friend-zone.  That is the ""no sex"" zone.

*Addendum*: The difference between how straight males and straight females define ""friendship"" is often a big problem.  What's ""just friends"" for said women might be ""beyond friends"" for said men.  Again, communication would have ironed this out, as I will show later in my own story.

**Malice**

Type 2 (Cruel Temptress): She knows exactly how to lead the Type 1 (or even Type 2) ""Friendzoned Guy"" on.  She does it on purpose, dangling the prospect of a relationship/sex in front of him to get what she wants.  She gives *just enough* to keep her dog(s) running, but little more.  This may be the one listed in Type 1 above--""You're an example of everything I want, but I don't want you *and I'm going to keep rubbing it in your face.*""  It goes beyond simple rejection.

**Conclusion**

Most straight men want to believe they are Type 1 (harmless passive nice) when many are not.  Type 1 straight men do have a fault: they DON'T COMMUNICATE FOR SQUAT (hence the passive part).  Since foundation of any relationship (friendship or more) is communication, she has no way of guessing what his motives are.  Especially if she's faced many Type 2 ""Nice"" (Sex-Fiend) Guys.  Type 2 are the ones who give ""Nice"" a bad name and leave women thinking guys are always after sex.

Most straight women want to believe they are Type 1 (differing views of friendship).  It absolves them of fault!  With Type 1 Nice Guy's failure to communicate, most friend-zones are probably Passive Nice Guy, Different Definition Girl or Sex Fiend Guy, Different Definition Girl.  With Passive Nice Guys it's his fault for not setting boundaries (I fell for this more than once).  With Sex Fiend Guys it's simple unwanted sexual advances.  Not hard to figure out.

That said, some women (just like some members of any group) are indeed horrible people who will manipulate others for their own gain.

TwoX seems to love stories, so here's one that backs up everything I've said here.

In college, I dated one girl junior year.  Toward the end of the year, she broke up with me.  She implied that we could start up again in the spring.  Me, being that this was my first serious girlfriend, read every possible thing into this.  Once spring rolled around, both parties did All The Wrong Things.

I kept hoping she'd want to date me again, so that meant dropping everything to help her with computer problems, helping her friends (who I would not have helped otherwise), trying to patch up a friendship with a mutual friend that she was CLEARLY at fault for destroying, and the like.  I won't pin Cruel Temptress on her, but regardless of her motivations it was quite toxic.  Given that she stopped talking to me except when she needed something tech-related, I'm seeing shades of Cruel Temptress (since I'd become nothing more than a tool to fix electronics), but not full-on let's make a movie out of it.  Once I figured this out (months later), I drew lines.  ""Jane, I'm not helping you with that--it's too involved.  Either you can pay me for services rendered, or find someone else.  *The free computer services like this should have ended when you dumped me, but I was dumb.  Now I'm setting boundaries.""*

Now she rarely talks to me.  However, everyone's motivations became clear--regardless of her intentions (different definition/cruel temptress) she was asking for something I felt was too involved for free ""just-as-friends"" tech support.  So I drew a line.  Passive Nice Guys don't draw lines, which is often why they end up feeling ""used"" regardless of whether she was deliberate or oblivious.

**TL;DR**

The Friend Zone definitely exists, but it's far narrower to me than what most people ascribe to it.  It is bad communication and the resulting confusion that lets people massively misinterpret others' intentions.  This leads to hurt feelings, internet rants, etc.  There's plenty of blame to go around.  Zonees (because this can apply to straight, gay, lesbian, bi, etc), stop thinking you are always innocent.  If you're Passive Nice, speak the hell up!  Getting shot down (and knowing) is better than pining without knowing.  Note that I'm not saying ""Being up front earns you a relationship.""  I **AM** saying ""Being up front (should) earn you an answer to whether you even have a chance.""  If you're a Sex Fiend, well, too bad!

Zoners, stop just taking everything and assuming you're innocent!  If you're not interested, *say so.*  From what I've seen, the Passive Nice people do more under the guise of ""friendship"" than anyone else in one's stable of friends.  So if you have someone of your target gender/orientation who just seems to be *too nice* and they're not a Sex Fiend, chances are they think they're gonna earn themselves a shot without speaking up.  Make it brutally honest so no matter who you are dealing with, s/he knows s/he has no chance at all.  After that, it is their problem.  And if you're Cruel Temptress, you're a horrible person.",0,1343673825,,0,1343680808,1,c5lnvan,t3_xc82o,t1_c5lnvan,t3_xc82o,,1429508880,3,False,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt,3
True,Alansredditaccount,,,I looked at the weatherstripping and it was fine. I ended up taking the truck to a dealer and it turns out that several of the rubber bump stops on the door were simply not installed. They charged me 5 bucks for the rubber stoppers and it completely fixed the problem. The doors close much quieter and no more rattling. ,0,1343745689,,0,False,1,c5m2cqh,t3_xe6ml,t1_c5m2cqh,t1_c5ln24a,,1429515927,3,False,Ford,t5_2qutc,3
