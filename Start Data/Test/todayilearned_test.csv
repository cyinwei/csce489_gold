&gt; **What's bigger: 1/3 pound burgers or 1/4 pound burgers?**
&gt;  
&gt; Do Americans really think 1/4 pound hamburgers are larger than 1/3 pound burgers? Apparently they did in the early 1980s. At least according to the New York Times — and the guy who bought the A&amp;W restaurant chain back in 1982.
&gt; 
&gt; You may have seen this bizarre example of American mathematical ignorance getting passed around lately as a fun fact from ""Why Do Americans Stink at Math?"" by Elizabeth Green:
&gt; 
&gt;One of the most vivid arithmetic failings displayed by Americans occurred in the early 1980s, when the A&amp;W restaurant chain released a new hamburger to rival the McDonald's Quarter Pounder. With a third-pound of beef, the A&amp;W burger had more meat than the Quarter Pounder; in taste tests, customers preferred A&amp;W's burger. And it was less expensive. A lavish A&amp;W television and radio marketing campaign cited these benefits. Yet instead of leaping at the great value, customers snubbed it.
&gt; 
&gt;Only when the company held customer focus groups did it become clear why. The Third Pounder presented the American public with a test in fractions. And we failed. Misunderstanding the value of one-third, customers believed they were being overcharged. Why, they asked the researchers, should they pay the same amount for a third of a pound of meat as they did for a quarter-pound of meat at McDonald's. The ""4"" in ""¼,"" larger than the ""3"" in ""⅓,"" led them astray.
&gt; 
&gt; But is this depressing tale true? I couldn't find it in any marketing textbooks or journals — at least none indexed by Google. But it does appear as an anecdote in the 2007 memoir of real estate tycoon A. Alfred Taubman, who purchased the A&amp;W chain back in the early 1980s.

I went up and down since. I then broke my coccyx and got a herniated disc in my lower spine two years ago, and went from fit, healthy, gym going young man to obese, unfit, twenty-something with somewhat of an alcohol problem and constant pain in my spine and down my left leg.

What I would say from my personal life experience is that weight gain is something that you can't really explain to ""permanently thin people"", or even some fat people that have become thin and now look down upon overweight people. **The mental component for me is 99% of weight loss**. It's really stupidly easy to learn about basic nutrition and exercise, and follow a routine - Google, exercise and low carb are your friends. But the immense battleground is in the mind, and as with my experiences is also overcoming injuries that basically make you feel like an old man.

**I'm not one to defend fat lifestyle choices, or imply that I'm a great role model, or even think I should ""own my new look"" of being 300lbs, unhealthy, unfit, in constant pain and genuinely depressed. But it really does kind of hurt that the Reddit hivemind has deemed fat people as some sort of sub-species. Many of us are just down on our luck, and some of us have been in your shoes only a few short years before!

My personal Dudeist philosophy is that we all have within us a Dude, a Walter, and a Donny. The Dude is what really ties the Trinity together. He's the main man and the one we should all aspire to be, even though the Dude himself is not perfect. He's pretty chill and alright, but he lacks motivation and direction. The Walter within us is the rash, emotional person in us, short-fused and suspicious. We should try to limit the amount of Walter we exhibit, though he is not without his positive qualities. He is also bold and loyal. And then there is Donny. The Donny within us is the reserved, quiet type who is content with just going along with it. Donny also has his good and his bad; he's shy and awkward and just not confident, but he's a good listener and humble.

""he case was delayed on the court's docket when Bright Tunes was placed in receivership. During the interim, Harrison's contract with Klein was terminated in what proved to be a bitter parting of the ways (and another lawsuit involving the Beatles). After Bright's affairs were put in order so as to enable it to continue the case, settlement negotiations between Bright and Harrison resumed.

After much discussion, Harrison's best offer of $148,000 was made in January 1976, a few week's prior to the trial on the issue of whether or not MSL was too similar to HSF. That sum represented 40% of the writer and publisher's royalties earned in the United States by MSL, and further provided that Harrison would retain the copyright for MSL. The attorney for Bright viewed the offer as ""a good one"", but did not accept the offer, but rather raised its demand from 50% of the U.S. royalties to 75% of the worldwide receipts, and surrender of the MSL copyright.

Why did Bright turn down what was viewed as a good offer and make a counter that was so harsh to Harrison? What Harrison didn't know was that Klein had again entered into discussions with Bright Tunes to purchase all of Bright's stock, except at this time, he was not attempting to buy the stock for Harrison, but rather for ABKCO.""

TL;DR:  Harrison's manager scuttled settlement negotiations to benefit himself, so the court ordered him to sell the song to Harrison.

It is one of the most important aldehydes, occurring widely in nature and being produced on a large scale in industry. Acetaldehyde occurs naturally in coffee, bread, and ripe fruit, and is produced by plants.""

""The acute oral toxicity of propylene glycol is very low, and large quantities are required to cause perceptible health damage in humans; propylene glycol is metabolized in the human body into pyruvic acid (a normal part of the glucose-metabolism process, readily converted to energy), acetic acid (handled by ethanol-metabolism), lactic acid (a normal acid generally abundant during digestion),[16] and propionaldehyde (a potentially hazardous substance).""

""Ethyl acetate is used primarily as a solvent and diluent, being favored because of its low cost, low toxicity, and agreeable odor. For example, it is commonly used to clean circuit boards and in some nail varnish removers (acetone and acetonitrile are also used). Coffee beans and tea leaves are decaffeinated with this solvent.[3] It is also used in paints as an activator or hardener.[citation needed] Ethyl acetate is present in confectionery, perfumes, and fruits. In perfumes, it evaporates quickly, leaving only the scent of the perfume on the skin."" 

**Hmm... but is it dangerous? It's basically just a derivative of acetic acid aka vinegar.**

""The LD50 for rats is 5620 mg/kg,[5] indicating low toxicity. Given that the chemical is naturally present in many organisms, there is little risk of toxicity.""

""Benzaldehyde (C6H5CHO) is an organic compound consisting of a benzene ring with a formyl substituent. It is the simplest aromatic aldehyde and one of the most industrially useful. This colorless liquid has a characteristic pleasant almond-like odor. In fact, benzaldehyde is the primary component of bitter almond oil and can be extracted from a number of other natural sources.[2] Benzaldehyde was first extracted from bitter almonds in 1803 by the French pharmacist Martrès.""

""Air exposure of 2-ethylhexanol to a human in a case study involving concentrations between 80 and 470 μg/m3 included throat irritation, cough, sore eyes, headache and blurred vision. Other volatile organic compounds were detected in the air as well, but 2-Ethylhexanol was of the highest concentration.[6] Another study involving several people exposed to 2-Ethylhexanol reported headaches, dizziness, fatigue and gastrointestinal disorders, but the concentration of 2-Ethylhexanol in this case is not known.[6] According to animal studies, 2-Ethylhexanol does not seem to be carcinogenic.""

There are absolutely __zero__ rules stating that all work must be absolutely original or new for that matter--as with any science fair. Back in the 1950s, and many times since, many a science fair was won by mixing baking soda with vinegar for a extremely simplistic acid-base chemical reaction.

The thing that should be focused on here is that three extremely young women were insightful enough to experiment with relatively advanced agricultural and biological techniques to yield very interesting results--so much so that they beat other very interesting experiments such as cleaning up oil sands waste, fruit fly robots, wearable sensors for the elderly, and converting breath to speech for the disabled.

But instead of praising these young women for taking an active interest in science and attempting to spread agricultural awareness to __actually help people who are unable to feed themselves__ we're content at debasing their achievement because it's not entirely original work.

You people are really starting to fucking piss me off.

__EDIT:__ A science fair is not about making any form of contribution to science. It's about celebrating science. Any type of science. Including science that's already been done before.

His tool exhibits an 81 percent accuracy rate and could be used to more accurately identify cancer threats from BRCA1 gene mutations.

1. **Understand that leaders don't create riots - riots create leaders.** Once your horrible truth has been revealed, the riot will begin organically. Your job is to organize it toward a focused goal.

2. **Start an act of violence.** It takes one act of violence to turn a protest into a full-blown riot. Start a small fire into the Nabasco corporate office. Others will quickly follow your lead.

3. **Justify your actions.** People need to feel like they're doing something right. Remind them what infuriated them through chants and slogans, such as ""Double Stuff? Double Lies!"" to keep the riot from dying down.

"karmavorous","","","In just a few weeks you'll get to see the first ever detailed images of the dwarf planet [Ceres](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceres_%28dwarf_planet%29). Courtest of the [NASA Dawn Mission.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawn_%28spacecraft%29)

Unlike New Horizons at Pluto which is just a fly-by encounter, Dawn will actually orbit Ceres and study it for at least a year.

Ceres is between Mars and Jupiter.

From studies from ground based telescopes and Hubble, it appears that Ceres has a LOT of water ice. Possibly more ice than there is fresh water on the Earth. Even though it is a fraction the size, it probably has more water than Mars has.

Ceres contains 1/3 of the mass of the Asteroid Belt. It is the largest asteroid. It appears to be large enough that it is round in shape. It also appears from distant observations that surface does not retain impact craters for as long as Mars or Earth's Moon does - possibly indicating that it has ongoing geological processes - although it is probably something more like ice churning than plate tectonics. It could be periodic cryo-volcanism that is stimulated by the planet's somewhat elliptical orbit around the Sun. This *could* mean that during certain times in the Cererean year, the planet has a tenuous atmosphere rich in water vapor.

Ceres definitely isn't just another asteroid. It is more like a little infant Earth, that early in its development was starved for material by Jupiter's gravitational interactions with the asteroid belt. 

In some ways it is more like one of Jupiter or Saturn's moons. But likely very different because the moons of the gas giants are shaped by tidal interactions with their host planets while Ceres has no real tidal interactions with anything. 

Seeing Pluto is going to be cool since many people alive today remember when Pluto was a planet. Ceres was considered a planet too after it was discovered. And it too go the demotion when astronomers started finding more bodies in it's neighborhood (which is the real reason Pluto stopped being considered a planet). Ceres was discovered 200 years ago, so nobody alive today remembers the day it got demoted. 

However, when Pluto get demoted, at the same exact time, Ceres got promoted to the newly adopted category of ""dwarf planet"" where it and Pluto both reside. 2015 is the year of the dwarf planet. We'll get to see our first two, a glimpse of Pluto and a long duration orbital study of the other.

Pluto is not a place humans will probably think or revisiting any time soon. It takes too long to get there. It would be very difficult to set up an orbital mission, much less a lander.

Ceres might be the next best location to send humans after Mars. It takes twice as long to get there, but you have more frequent opportunities to launch or return. The way the orbital resonances work out, if you go to Mars you have to stay for 2 years before you can return. If you go to Ceres, you have to stay for more like 1.3 years before your next opportunity to return.

Ceres has less gravity than the moon or Mars, but it has more gravity than Comet 67P - where you can jump off the surface. You don't have to worry about things floating away on you, but it takes less energy to return to orbit than even the Apollo moon lander had to deal with. This might make it an excellent place to build a shipyard to build interstellar vehicles. Ceres is conventiently close to the raw materials in the asteroid belt.

New Horizons at Pluto is going to be cool.

Dawn at Ceres will probably blow people's minds.

Mars in big in popular culture because we've had good pictures of it for almost 50 years and it always seemed like the next best place for humans to go in the solar system.

We're all about to get a big ole face full of Ceres. It could be a game changer in a lot of ways.

If you want to hear Dawn scientist say the same things I just said and even more amazing things about Dawn and Ceres, the google hangouts on the Dawn Mission's website are great.

http://dawn.jpl.nasa.gov/multimedia/hangouts.asp

Today, dawn is slightly closer to Ceres than the Earth is to the Moon (Ceres quite a bit smaller than the moon though). Dawn is expected to enter orbit in early March, but there will be a few distant photos taken between now and then. The latest is supposed to be released on January 20th and by early February they will probably release at least one image that is better resolution than the Hubble picture from 2004 on the Ceres wiki page.

The TL;DR is that Frank Darabont assembled a great cast and crew (many of whom had worked with Darabont on prior projects) to sell the production of the show to AMC, and was given $3.4 million **each episode** to produce the first season of 6 episodes. However when renewed for a second season, AMC slashed the budget to $2.75 million **per episode** despite ordering 13 episodes, 7 more than the first season, and decided to fire Darabont over disagreements and strained relationship with AMC executives. However, despite having made the decision to fire him weeks prior, they waited until after Darabont promoted the show at Comicon 2011 to inform him, and subsequently 'pressured' the show's cast and crew to remain silent about the affair.

Women are placed on pedestals by men their entire lives; they do not know a world in which men don't treat them in a unique way, and therefore neutral treatment is received as hostile because their barometer has been shifted up.

When they speak about equality they are usually talking about having their cake and eating it too, with very little effort expended to understand how males experiences life (and a LOT of assumptions and generalizations in place of said effort). Now, that's nothing out of the ordinary - males generalize just as much. The problem lies in the current culture surrounding ""gender talk."" Examining female culture is perceived as inherently sexist, as the ""problems with women"" are all said to be injected by external sources (they are not vain - they are pressured by society to focus on appearance; and so on), so there is no examination to be done; you should be examining the external force ""inflicting"" the situation on the female. This obviously goes hand-in-hand with female passivity and the passive perspective (careful now - such passivity isn't a problem; it's ""who they are."" In the same vein, male directness and brashness is not a problem because it's who we are...  /s). On the other hand, examining male culture is treated as inherently progressive; males need fixing, while females do not.

"VeritassAequitass","","","I am glad people are learning about this. This is a huge problem that touches upon many issues affecting Aboriginal women in Canada, notably in BC. Many of these women originally come from reserves, where there are insufficient resources - financially and otherwise - and where the legacy of colonialism has left a pretty dismal life for many people, especially women. Aboriginal women who are disenfranchised and suffering from poverty, either on the reserve or off, as they try to escape to big cities, often have no choice but to hitchhike to try to get out. They are left, just as they were on reserves or in Vancouver, in extremely vulnerable and precarious situations, leading to these tragedies on the Highway of Tears.

It gets worse though. The RCMP (federal police) often overlook these missing and murdered women. Investigations have been insufficient and the police have been proven to be callous and discriminatory in the way they treat these cases. Not only that, but RCMP officers have actually abused Aboriginal women and girls themselves, without being held properly accountable. So not only are Aboriginal women ill-treated in Canada, leading to things like this happening, but families and entire communities have no way of getting justice, leading to further feelings of alienation and disenfranchisement.

/u/topsmate at /r/Australia [has uploaded a scan of a 1991 Australian magazine](https://www.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/2xe7wi/when_was_the_first_time_you_heard_the_term_mullet/cozdfmr) referring to a young man as ""mullet-haired"". It doesn't say that he ""has a mullet"", so it's not clear if it means ""he has hair like a mullet fish"", but he does definitely have a mullet hairstyle! Good enough for me! It's still remarkable that the quote isn't from the 80's, but at least now we know that The Beastie Boys weren't the first!

We did it, reddit! We made a significant contribution to lexicography! 

Original comment and edits: 

The Oxford English Dictionary entry for [mullet](http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/253382) (referring to the hairstyle) lists 1994 as the earliest date it was used, having been unable to find any earlier examples. They even put up an [appeal to the public](http://public.oed.com/appeals/mullet/), asking if anyone could find earlier examples, because it seems so strange that no one used the word like that until the mid-90s. 

It should be noted that the word ""mullet"" itself is much older. It's been used to refer to [this fish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mullet_(fish\)) since the 14th century. There's also a term ""mullet head"", meaning ""stupid person"", that has been used since the mid 19th century. 

If anyone can find earlier examples of the word referring to the hairstyle, let the OED know, they would surely be very grateful. 

EDIT: lots of people are saying ""no way that's true, I was using it all through the 80's!"". I'd just like to ask: are you sure? Like, *really* sure? Beyond a shadow of a doubt? It's not just that you saw the hairstyle all through that decade, but only found out later (in the mid-90s) that it was called a ""mullet""? Memories are malleable, are you sure that you didn't ""insert"" the word into your memories afterwards?

Because the simple fact is that there is literally no evidence for it that anyone has found. None! Not one printed word, not one spoken line in a movie, not one music lyric, not one barbershop sign. It's true that it might be out there somewhere, and nobody's found it yet, but it doesn't look like it. There are lots of ""mullet heads"" and lots of people talking about fish, but no hairstyles. There's literally the same amount of evidence for the use of the word ""mullet"" to refer to a hairstyle before 1994 as there is for creationism, or that vaccines cause autism. 

Shit is freaky, yo. 

EDIT 2: Ok, to clear some things up, here are answers to common questions: 

**You're full of shit, I've been using it since way before 1994**

See above.

**My coach used to call us ""mullet-heads"" all the time in the late 70's!**

As stated, the phrase ""mullet-head"" is different from ""mullet""; it is a much older term (from the 1850's, at least), which means ""stupid person"". It has nothing to do with hair styles (though it is probably where The Beastie Boys got the term). 

**They said it in Cheers/Cool Hand Luke/Mark Twain!**

All the examples I've seen people point to are using the term ""mullet head"" to call someone stupid, not ""mullet"" to refer to a hairstyle.

**Just because there's no written source before The Beastie Boys, that doesn't mean that it didn't exist! They just used some common slang! We didn't have the internet back then, so nothing got written down!**

While it is a possibility (you can't prove a negative, and all that), the total lack of evidence makes it fantastically unlikely. While it's true that because of the internet, much more of the language is preserved today, the 1980's are not some sort of dark age. There's a massive amount of media from that time, from magazines to books to music to movies to television show to everything else imaginable, not to mention lots of academic linguists documenting slang, and nobody has found an earlier use. And this stuff is easier to research than ever, there's Google Books and LexisNexis and archive.org, and many more massive archives you can search. Not one single use has ever been found. 

Many people say they've heard it since at least the early 80's, which is at least a decade before anyone wrote it down. Do you really find plausible that slang that was apparently that common TOTALLY escaped the massive clutches of American pop culture? No, it doesn't seem likely, does it?

**Just because The Beastie Boys are first in the OED, that doesn't mean that they coined it.**

Certainly possible, but given the fact that the song lyrics ([helpfully posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/2xcl2e/til_that_the_beastie_boys_coined_the_term_mullet/coz2b0j) by /u/zyzzogeton) are basically one long explanation of the meaning of the term, and given that the [Grand Royal magazine article about mullets](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/2xcl2e/til_that_the_beastie_boys_coined_the_term_mullet/coz5ftf) (helpfully posted by /u/BovingdonBug) claims that Mike D coined it, it seems like a safe bet. This is also the opinion of the OED in their etymology section. 

**I hate you. You're wrong!**

A local tourist intentionally crushed an otter's hand, breaking multiple bones in its hand and arm. The incident was not immediately noticed and the suspect wasn't found for quite some time. It was a compelling story for the media since the injured otter suffered complications from the surgery and passed away. 

  By the time the suspect was finally captured, public resentment had been building for weeks. Pets are quite revered in Japan, but with real estate at a premium, small residences and/or homeowner associations keep many Japanese from being able to keep pets of their own. Thus, public spaces, especially zoos are a very treasured part of Japanese communities. 

   There was a minor scandal when it was revealed that the suspect had been severely beaten after his arrest. The rumor was that local authorities placed the suspect in a general holding cell despite the notoriety and resentment that followed him. Whether it was the police or others that beat him within an inch of his life was never determined. Bear in mind that Japan has an unusually high conviction rate because authorities tend to wait until cases are slam dunks. Once a suspect is officially named and arrested, it pretty much becomes a case of ""guilty until convicted, told you so."" Don't feel bad for the otter attacker. He later confessed that he did it because he owed a large gambling debt to the owner of the zoo.

  Yup. A deal had been arranged to drum up publicity for the zoo, though neither man expected the cruel stunt to turn into such a fevered situation. Word eventually got back to the local Yakuza outfit, who killed the otter attacker while he was in custody, then burned the zoo owner alive. Supposedly the zoo owner's final word's were, ""Can i get abouta tree fiddy?"" To which he received no response before perishing in the flames. This ran a bit longer than I planned. Sorry.

&gt; § 1. Ich ernenne zu meiner Universalerbin Mathilde Crescence Heine, geborene Mirat, meine rechtmäßige Ehefrau, mit welcher ich seit vielen Jahren meine guten und schlimmen Tage verbracht habe und welche mich während der Dauer meiner langen und schrecklichen Krankheit gepflegt hat. Ich vermache ihr als volles und gänzliches Eigentum, und ohne jede Bedingung oder Beschränkung, alles, was ich besitze und was ich bei meinem Ableben besitzen mag, und alle meine Rechte auf irgendein künftiges Besitztum.

The important part is: *I leave her my whole and complete property, without any condition or limitation, everything I own or might own at the time of my death, and all rights to future possessions.*

So essentially: TIL Heinrich Heine loved his wife, left her everything, imposed no silly or whimsical conditions.

Years and years ago I was on a flight from Chicago back home to San Francisco. During the flight something went wrong with the plane and we had to do an emergency landing at a small airfield in the middle of nowhere, I believe somewhere in Wyoming (keep in mind I was 10-11 and this was 2 decades ago so specifics are fuzzy). 

Once we landed we had a very long wait while arrangements were made and eventually we were given the option of taking a shuttle to the closest large airport or chartering a small plane to Nevada. 

My dad wanted to seize the opportunity to allow me to see a small plane, and didn't want me to be afraid of flying after the emergency landing ordeal so we opted for the flight. 

During the flight in this tiny 4 seater plane while my dad was drifting off from our incredibly long day I saw two of these! 

I thought it might be buildings shaped as arrows, I wasn't quite sure. I tried to nudge him awake but that didn't work. When we landed I told him about it and being a kid of course he didn't believe me. Actually no one really did and partially thought I was delirious from lack of sleep, eventually I doubted it myself. Back then you couldn't google something so it remained a mystery.  Now it's solved! 

TLDR; Saw these as a kid, no one believed me. 

Edit: went camping and came back to this comment being somewhat popular... Thanks all! I emailed the story to my dad right away. He doesn't check email often so I'll probably call him tomorrow and tell him to check it out!

Linda was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1995. What Paul said is that they both knew her odds probably weren't great from the start, however they ""tried to block it out"" and focus on the positive. She had surgery and very intensive chemotherapy for about two and a half years, so she definitely fought intensely. But according to Paul the cancer spread to her other breast and finally, her liver, at which point they knew things were bad. He said at one point her primary doctor told him privately that Linda was not going to survive. Paul asked if anything would be accomplished by telling Linda that outright and the doctor said no, he didn't think she needed to know because it would just destroy any positivity she had left. Paul agreed. 

However, Linda did know on some level she was going to die soon. Plenty of her friends attested to that. She asked her daughter to move up her impending wedding by several months. She arranged for birthday and Christmas presents to be delivered to Paul and her children for later that year (she died in the spring of 1998). Before she left on her final vacation to Arizona, where she passed away, Linda called her best friend to tell her she loved her and also sent her a meaningful present. A couple of months before she died, the head of her frozen food company had a long meeting with her where he said Linda bluntly told him she was not going to beat her cancer and needed to make arrangements for the business to carry on in her absence (source: the biography of Linda McCartney by Danny Fields). 

As for treatment, Linda was in no way denied it. She of course knew she had breast cancer and had battled it for about two and a half years by her death, with intensive treatment that made her very, very ill for most of that time. She had private medical care in her home when she died. Paul, Linda and their children all went to their home in Arizona two weeks before she died expressly because Arizona was Linda's favorite place, they were all there and all got to say their lengthy goodbyes to her. The horse riding actually occurred two days before she died; Paul physically assisted her so she would be able to get one last ride because it was her favorite thing in the world, she was not galloping around. She went into a coma the following day after the horse ride and Paul stayed in her bed with her and held her in his arms the entire time until she passed. He said they felt very blessed that she had so little discomfort and went quickly. In thanks to the medical staff who helped Linda, Paul donated $1 million after her death to each of the hospitals who treated her. 

Here's a direct quote from Paul on the subject from a 1999 interview with Chrissie Hynde:

""[After her cancer spread to her liver] We asked, 'Is there anything we can do? Do people ever come back from this?' Yes. Sure. There's statistics which show that people have licked this, which is true -- so we always went with that side of it. Linda never said, 'Oh, I'm going to be a bad statistic.' I think that's what sustained us. She'd say to us, 'You're the best support group a girl could ever have,' and we'd say, 'We couldn't do it without you, babe.' She had such courage. We just couldn't have done it. It's true. We would have fallen apart. But she was just so on the ball. We could be strong because she was. I don't even think that until the last week she even knew. I think the last week, you know, things were going so badly -- but we were riding horses. I said 'Tell you what, babe, I'll get the horses ready, you don't have to even do anything. I'll tack them up, get them all ready, get a little bale of hay and you can hop off of it.' That was always one of our horrors, of being eighty and you can't ride. We'd joke that we'd design a special crane and have you lifted up. Because that was the horror of her life, that she couldn't ride. Thank God that she was able to, two days before she died. And, as I said, the crowning moment was this big rattler  stretched across the track. We just looked at it and felt awed. Like it was some sort of magic sign. I bet it is in Indian folklore.

So, thank the Lord, she went into a coma as they had predicted. Which wasn't the worst of all scenarios, as it happened. She just felt tired, and I said, 'Would you like to sit by the pool?' She said, 'No. I don't really fancy it today.' I thought I'd try her in about an hour's time. I tried her in about an hour's time, she still felt tired. I joked, 'Well you just fancy a lie-in, don't you?' She said, 'Yeah.' The next day she died. She was just in a coma for one day. It was as if she was so smart that something in her said, 'We can't lick this one. Let's get the hell out of here, quick.' And she didn't hang about. As I say, she'd spent that day in bed, the previous day she'd got up, she spent that one day in bed, I went to bed that night with her figuring, 'God, things are getting desperate but we'll just keep hoping.' I went to bed and she got restless in the middle of the night, as they'd warned me she might. So I called the nurse about 3 in the morning and at 5 she died. She didn't hang about. In her last sort of moments she got very peaceful. As she died something told me to just say something to her...It just suddenly came to me at the moment when she was just about to die. I have no idea why, I just thought, 'I've just got to say this.' It was as if I was guided and I said, 'You're up on your beautiful Appaloosa stallion; it's a fine spring day, we're riding through the woods. The bluebells are all out, and the sky is clear blue.' And she just drifted off. So, a terrible tragedy. But I don't think it could have happened in a better way in a better place.""",1432962123,"","1433015628",1,1319,"todayilearned"

&gt;Sure enough, he recalls, when all the tracks were cut, Ono's assistant showed up with a shoe box. Inside was a dead rat. Ono wanted it incorporated in the recording. So Douglas had his assistant place it on a stool and set up an expensive mike inches away.

First of all showing those who would attack western countries that we won't be ""cowed by there actions"" isn't going to change their minds, if it would they wouldn't be doing what they're doing right now.

Second, just because a VERY small percentage of a group are assholes does not give you the right to insult or intimidate those who just want to get on with their lives and fit in. The only way extremists bolster their numbers is by bringing more people to their side, and guess what, that'll be a lot easier when they can go 

""Hey! Look! No one in this country RESPECTS your religion. They mock you, they insult you, they make your life difficult because your religion is different, why should you try to fit it with them! Come and join us!""

The only way we can stop people joining their ranks is by showing that we respect their religious beliefs. That doesn't mean accommodating all of our laws to them, but it DOES mean not going out of our way to purposefully piss them off. 

By the same reasoning here we should also have a ""call every Christian you meet a cunt day!"" Because of the WBC, or ""punch every Somalian in the eye week"" because the Somalian pirates.

1. People aged 20-34 have shockingly low death rates. The is a peak at birth and up to 7 ish due to childhood cancers, then the birth rate plunges until your 50s when cancers and cardio-vasc starts to creep in.

2. It is a very distant 6th. At 2.8 %, it is ten times less than injury at 1 29.9%.

3. The number is essentially an average and averages are tricky. They tend to over represent the extremes. For example, Bill Gates and I have an average net worth of 20 billion. And this number is meaningless. The number is heavily skewed by very high risk pregnancy, weather due to medical conditions or due social factors. Think huge pre-existing conditions or very marginalized people. For the average, relatively healthy women with a modicum of healthcare, pregnancy, while not much fun, is very safe.

"UhSwellGuy","","","The flavor packs themselves are made by distilling the orange oils and essences out of oranges and then fractionating them to get different aspects of it (juicy, rindy, pithy), then adding them back in such a way that it makes a more consistent product.  The other advantage of this is that the flavors break down much more slowly when stored separately than they would while still in the orange.

Think of a blended whiskey, which seems to retain the same taste year after year despite differences in the raw materials.  The blend ratios might be slightly different, but the goal is to have the same product as you did last year.

The real take home message that I want you to get is that there isn't some guy combining random chemicals which taste nothing like orange into a suddenly orange tasting potion which they then feed to us.  They are adding essences taken from oranges back into orange juice.  Although this is certainly a mechanized and engineered process, it is not quite as deceitful as you might be led to believe.

Also, it's pretty well known if you are a food scientist that fragrance companies and flavor companies are one and the same - it's simply because the chemists they employ are the best at extracting particular taste and aroma extracts from raw materials &amp; at evaluating them (tasting and smelling things isn't exactly a standardized, quantitative science, but these guys have done a really good job of making it in to one).  Not sure why the article felt the need to point that out unless it's to really underline the artificial nature of this process and spook everybody.

When it comes down to it, the whole point is to make something that is harvested once and doesn't last long available year round, and something which changes from year to year consistent.  The chemists that work for these companies are always struggling with the reality of what actually happens and the pressure of making the product seem as  true to ""natural"" as possible.  What they have come up with is essentially ""split it apart and recombine it later"".

Tl;dr - the ""flavor packs"" used in this case are made from the essence of oranges, so while definitely engineered, not entirely artificial.

He was a Public Defender for close to 40 years, and in a relatively small county like I grew up in, he'd sometimes have three generations of the same family as clients for things like larceny or possession. Sometimes he'd have the 4th or 5th generation of felons in his office, whose family had been represented by his predecessors in the 1960s or '70s.

What he noticed, though, was the families that didn't find themselves in that cycle had a common factor: The parents, after their sentence was up, made an effort to get involved in the education of their kids. Maybe they couldn't control what schools their kids went to and maybe they weren't even educated enough to help with homework, but they would make an effort to encourage their children to be better.

The most effective way to help the kids was reading. The kids who learned to read had better vocabularies, which meant they were better at communicating with peers and adults. They had an expanded worldview from the stories they read, even simple kids' books, and knew how to empathize. 

What surprised him was that *it didn't matter what the kids were reading*. Books, comics, blogs, magazines... as long as they were reading *with their parents* they had a phenomenally lower recidivism rate.
