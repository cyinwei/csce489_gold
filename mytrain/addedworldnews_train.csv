TheEarthquakeGuy,,,"Okay! How are we doing guys? Welcome to another earthquake update! When it rains, it pours!

This is the third event that has happened within a week at this location. At this point, I would not be surprised if we see something bigger. This is not a prediction, just a personal comment.
***

**What you need to know:**

***

* **Magnitude:** Originally a 7.5, but has since been downgraded to a 7.4 event.

* **Depth:** Originally reported at a depth of 10km, this quake has since been deepened to 63.1km, which is good news all around.

* **Intensity of Shaking:** Currently the USGS has this at VIII on the Mercalli scale which means Severe shaking. The did you feel it reports reflect this.

* **Expected Fatalities:** Currently the Pager is Green which means the USGS does not expect many, if any deaths from this quake. Due to the depth, the shaking experienced from the quake would likely have felt dampened due to the amount of earth the waves had to travel through. 



Expected Fatalities | Percentage
-------------------|----------
**0** | **65**
1-10 | 30
10-100 | 4
More than 100 | 1


* **Expected Cost of the Quake:** Again, this is green too, which means the USGS is confident that the quake didn't create too much damage.



Expected Cost (US) | Probability (%)
------------------|---------------
**Under $1m**  | **68**
$1-10m | 30
$10-100m | 2

* **Tsunami:** There is currently no watch in place for the greater Pacific Ocean, although there is a watch for coastlines within 300km of the epicentre. The data used for this commentary reflects the quake occurring at a depth of 10km, so this may now be incorrect.

Mohamed-ElShamy,,,"explaining the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attack in the eyes of Islam with verses from the Quran itself. 

please read to the end and judge by yourself .

if Muslims find someone who is cursing their religion and mocking it's holy book , and Quran's words ,how do they react ? 

well , the answer is actually in the Quran itself , the first source of legislation for -true- Muslims , that every Muslim should follow and do by it's words , instead of following weak historical novels that are fabricated , which some like sticking to .

1- Allah says in the Holy Quran : 
( He has revealed to you in the Book that when you hear God's revelations being rejected, or ridiculed, do not sit with them until they engage in some other subject. Otherwise, you would be like them. God will gather the hypocrites and the disbelievers, into Hell, altogether.) 
Women ( Al Nisaa') : Verse 140. 

if a Muslim was sitting with a group of people who are mocking Allah's words in public , which in Islam is a degree that's more offensive than infidelity , and a Muslim is hearing this with his own ears , what should he do ? he should leave them , Allah didn't say to engage with them in defending his Religion , or go get your gun and shoot them to death , no only leave silently .
Allah even says ( until they engage in some other subject ) , that means if they go back to talking about normal life matters , A Muslim can sit back with them , which the verse is dedicated to sophisticated degree of rationality and the separation of the issues of life and religion , and the diversity of ways of relations between humans .

2- Allah Says : 
(And endure patiently what they say, and withdraw from them politely.) 
The Enwrapped ( Al Muzamil ) - Verse 10 .

which means that a Muslim should be patient on their annoyance and their words and cursing , and leave them politely .

3-Allah Says : 
(As for his statement: ""My Lord, these are a people who do not believe.
Pardon them, and say, ""Peace."" They will come to know.) 
Decorations ( Az Zukhruf ) - Verses 88 89 . 

Quran legislated that Forgiving them after they curse and disbelieve and saying "" Peace "" will renounce any kind of violence that might get triggered .
because if swords changed countries , they don't change hearts , and if bullets kills innocents , they don't kill ideas , and Islam depends in the first place on conviction , freedom and testing the mind at the matters of the universe which imprints the magnificence of Allah , and these are things that won't work unless all the people are living safely in peace .

4- Allah Says : 
( If they accuse you of lying, say, ""I have my deeds, and you have your deeds. You are quit of what I do, and I am quit of what you do."")
Jonah ( Yunus ) - Verse 41 .

5- Allah Says : 
(The hypocrites worry lest a chapter may be revealed about them, informing them of what is in their hearts. Say, ""Go on mocking; God will bring out what you fear."")
Repentance ( Al Taubah ) - Verse 64

the verse clearly says that people will mock , but it didn't include any punishment in life by anyone , and didn't order Muhammad ( PBUH ) to punish them , even though they make annoyance and internal disorder because the Prophet had a political position as well as a religious one when he ruled Madina , so he had all the power to do this back then ( this is when this verse was suggested to him by Allah ) , but the truth is the prophet made Madina at this time a place where everyone can criticize anyone even the Prophet himself .
and when someone said : prophet ,why don't you kill them ? , he said : i fear that people will talk about how Muhammad kills his friends .
as Islam reputation was a priority to the Prophet over getting revenge of those who disobey Allah .


The Prophet Muhammad when he founded his State  , he made  human and worldly and political behaviors. Though some of the political and military actions to protect the state is acceptable under it, // but it is not a religious legislation transferred by him //. It is the same to open the door so he said (and if i tell you to do something from my opinion , i'm just a human ) . But the difference is that the Prophet was moving within a state that was calm and balanced and clear for all its policies, and not a random terrorist group that disappears from sight and practices criminality.

But after that settled it and ended the conflict became a prophet puts fixed for life legislation, which represents the origin of the transaction. And expressed by saying, ""Today is a day Compassion is the axiom"". in which he forgives enemies who cursed him and threw dirt on his head and drove him out of his land.

Which is consistent with the message of Islam in the Qur'an (but as a mercy to the worlds )

my whole point here is that criminal acts like these are made by people who don't understand what Islam is , and they are extremists who are hated by every community even the community and religion that people think they represent . 
they misuse the word Jihad ( fight for religion ) , the word actually means that Muslims should fight their sins in order to follow their religion .

JamesColesPardon,,,"This also plays into [Parallel Construction](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/08/dea-and-nsa-team-intelligence-laundering), a term used to describe a process of building an incriminating case against a citizen without their knowledge, and then tipping local authorities off when and where they will be to do a routine traffic stop and find the incriminating evidence that authorities already knew was there.

Follow me? [Reuters](http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBRE97409R20130805?irpc=932) did a nice job explaining it:

&gt;The undated documents show that **federal agents are trained to ""recreate"" the investigative trail to effectively cover up where the information originated, a practice that some experts say violates a defendant's Constitutional right to a fair trial**. If defendants don't know how an investigation began, they cannot know to ask to review potential sources of exculpatory evidence - information that could reveal entrapment, mistakes or biased witnesses.

This is blatantly against the fourth amendment, of course, but the US Government has bypassed this issue by utilizing the FISA (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act) court's warrant rubber-stamping process (here's [list](https://epic.org/privacy/wiretap/stats/fisa_stats.html) of the warrant requests presented, approved, modified, or rejected). Of note, 0.3% of requests are **denied**.

Also, the vast majority of these warrants have nothing to do with *terrorism*, as you may think. The court even reinterpreted the legal doctrine used to compel railway workers to get drug tested (*a minimal intrusion in privacy*) to allow for almost limitless electronic surveillance on Americans. [I shit you not](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/07/us/in-secret-court-vastly-broadens-powers-of-nsa.html?pagewanted=all).

&gt;In one of the court’s most important decisions, **the judges have expanded the use in terrorism cases of a legal principle known as the “special needs” doctrine and carved out an exception to the Fourth Amendment’s requirement of a warrant for searches and seizures**, the officials said.

How patriotic! Continuing:

&gt;The special needs doctrine was originally established in 1989 by the Supreme Court in a ruling allowing the drug testing of railway workers, finding that **a minimal intrusion on privacy was justified by the government’s need to combat an overriding public danger**. Applying that concept more broadly, the FISA judges have ruled that the N.S.A.’s collection and examination of Americans’ communications data to track possible terrorists does not run afoul of the Fourth Amendment, the officials said.

So, that overwhelming public danger (drugged out railway workers laying railroads) was legally bound to *terrorism* in the schema of minimally invasive privacy intrusions. Your tax dollars hard at work, people.

Also, the President's legal framework adjustments entitled [Updated Administration Proposal: 
Law Enforcement Provisions](http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/legislative/letters/updated-law-enforcement-tools.pdf) reorganize cyber crimes under the RICO (Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organizations) statutes, which gives the administration broader powers for prosecution. He alluded to this during the SOTU.

It also specifies under Section 103 (Modernizing The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act) that *intentionally accessing or exceeding authorizations on protected computers without causing &gt;$5,000 worth of damage is lawful* (or at least specify no penalties), which to me seems a lot like what the NSA has been doing.

At the risk of making this comment far too verbose, I would not live with myself later if I didn't try and capitalize on this visibility for an idea I've had for awhile now. There has been some great discussion about this below, and am thankful for all the great conversations in the morning while I've been snowed in. Many have brought up how there really is *no recourse here for this issue* other than belly-aching on Social Media. So here's my idea:

Don't like this policy? Don't like all the Surveillance State regulations that have crept onto the books in the past 14 years? Tired of bitching about it? So you wish there was *someone* willing to do something about it, who isn't bought by corporations, and would run not out of the possibility to gain power but to give power back to the People? Well, what are *you* waiting for?

Did you know that legislation needs to be agreed upon by a House Majority (which is 218 votes)? You really only need to get 218 people to agree to *not pass any legislation at all* until these various policing powers are reigned in and we start projecting solutions to this country's policies. That's not that many people. Did your Rep run unopposed?

What if *this idea* actually caught on? What if Wolf-PAC vouched for you and helped at least get the process started? Surely the get-big-money-out-of-politics is an idea that most here can agree with. Sixty-nine districts ran unopposed last year - and maybe it's time my age cohort (18-35) gets politically active? 

*Could you imagine*? 

If anyone knows anybody willing to help towards this crazy idea, let's talk about it. I'll help in any way and talk to anyone willing to put 217 people in Washington in November of 2016, regardless of silly Ds and Rs next to their name.

Dan Carlin has a great monthly-ish podcast called Common Sense. Two podcasts come to mind from all of these discussions.

Here is a link to [Episode  278: Uyguristic Perspectives](http://www.dancarlin.com/product/common-sense-278-uyguristic-perspectives/), which kind of inspired the 218 idea in it's infancy stages. Well worth a listen.

Here is a link to [Episode 288: Kickstarting A Revolution](http://www.dancarlin.com/product/common-sense-282-kickstarting-revolution/) which offers the unique idea of utilizing existing crowd-funding technology to supplant corporate candidates, which would be necessary, along with Wolf-PAC, for this idea to have any legs (IMO).

Also, by request, here is [Episode 255: The Big Long Surveillance Show](http://www.dancarlin.com/product/common-sense-255-the-big-long-surveillance-show/)


All well worth a listen this if you haven't.

**What you need to know**

****

**Magnitude:** Originally at a 6.9, but now downgraded to a 6.8 by the USGS

**Location:** 77km ENE of Miyako, Japan. This is north of the area where the 9.0 occurred nearly 4 years ago. This quake did occur offshore.

**Depth:** A very shallow quake for its size, sitting at only 10km. This is subject to change.

**Intensity of the shaking:** Reports currently suggest strong (V) shaking from the quake. 

**Expected Fatalities:** Current USGS pager probabilities as follows:



Probability (%) | Number of Deaths
---------------|----------------
**62** | **0-1**
30 | 1-10
2 | 10-100


**Expected Damages:** Current USGS pager probabilities for the total cost of the quake is as follows:



Probability (%) | Total Cost of Damages (US $ millions)
---------------|-------------------------------------
**65** | **Under a million**
30 | 1-10 
4 | 10-100

**Tsunami:** **There is no tsunami warning or advisory in place.** ~~This quake did occur offshore and has caused a tsunami warning. No tsunami has hit just yet, although residents and locals to the quake are still advised not to go near the coast.~~

Edit: hijacking my own comment for an update at 2pm:

I'm transcribing what I hear on France Info right now:

It's getting more complex because there are two hostage situations going on at the same time.

- One hostage, the two Kouachi brothers (who presumedly did the Charlie Hebdo shootings) in an industrial area in Dammartin-en-Goële, situation is ""under siege"", authorities try to open negociations.

- ""at least five"" hostages, one guy dual-wielding AK47s in Paris (Avenue de la Porte de Vincennes), shots fired, one wounded, the guy is the one who presumedly killed a policewoman yesterday in Montrouge. The guy apparently called the authorities himself at around 1pm. The siege is happening currently in a Koscher Store (or whatever ""hypermaché cacher"" translates to).

Journalists are particularly conservative and professionnal, considering the stress.

Edit 2: ...and because /u/EpicRisc is doing a much better job than me at reporting, scroll down to [his post](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2ru9y0/charlie_hebdo_hunt_shots_fired_as_police_chase/cnjbk7n)! 

Edit 3: 5:15pm, assault in Dammartin en Goële, and just now 4 explosions in Paris Porte de Vincennes, shots fired... assault there too... crossing fingers! crossing fingers!

Edit 4: 5:22pm, Dammartin: silence, officially the two terrorists, the Kouachi brothers are dead and hostage was released, Paris: several hostages seen evacuated from the store, waiting for official report.

rafa_the_rasta,,,"Well you see folks of Reddit, when you live in a country where most places are limited to education and currency but abundant in illegal money to be made, some people decide to do the wrong thing and go with the more enticing gold plated ak's, designer clothes, and nice cars. And it doesn't help that some of the most popular music over there openly talks about these things. Not just the luxurious side but the parts where they talk about lopping heads off as military-trained hit men. Almost like the U.S. where the music talks about similar things, especially rap. The difference is the actual people doing the drug trading and head lopping are the ones paying the artists to write these songs and then these songs are fed to the poor, power hungry, and impoverished youth in these parts of Mexico. They're willing to sell large amounts of meth, marijuana, and cocaine and even traffick live humans. The police can't be trusted because they too can be bought off by even $20. So these places that see multiple deaths everyday at the hands of these cartels rely on Military to protect them. Even some of the politicians r paid off by these cartels. Corruption doesn't stop at the Mexican border people. It knows no boundaries and seeps into our own government. And this is when we have to look at the larger picture fellow redditors, the root of these horrendous acts of corruption and death. **Money**. You really believe that waging war with the cartels is the answer, please **wake the fuck up**. As soon as the heads of these cartels are cut off, they will only b replaced with more power hungry leaders. Which in turn means more tax money poured into the war on drugs. As if our government would even want the drugs to stop flowing into America. The more drugs that are on our streets means that there is more product to be pushed and consumed. Which in turn is more crime to be stopped by police and more drug users to be jailed and fined. And where do those fines go? Back into the governments pocket. The only answer is to render the majority of their product worthless by legalizing these substances. Drugs are so expensive because of the risk that goes into making and distributing them. And that is why cartels are so well funded. Some even hire engineers to design submarines in order to smuggle cocaine from south America. These people have always been oppressed by their government. When my parents were young they lived in a time where the government made it so hard to get a full education that the oldest siblings would have to drop out to work so that their youngest siblings could finish school. My parents didn't finish middle school, they went to work before their high school years. When they got together to start a family they didn't see a future in their home land. They went north to give their children a good life, the kind of life they never new as youngsters. When I hear people bitch and moan about how immigrants only come over to steal jobs and bullshit like that, it truly sparks a burning anger inside of me. These people come here to escape poverty and oppression and usually work jobs that citizens of America won't work. They work their asses off because they know what it means to have very little despite working since a young age. Since my parents have been here they have paid off a house, always stayed employed, and never broken the law. My dad even went back to school and struggled with material that i had done in 6th grade but he got his GED and is now taking college courses. It just goes to show that you should not show anguish towards an immigrant for having a job in your country when they could have chosen the easy way by bringing drugs into America.",1426149148,,False,1,16,worldnews,True,False,671,0,Night,0-20,6,4,"{u'probability': {u'neg': 0.7207672453624134, u'neutral': 0.8242841109497115, u'pos': 0.27923275463758657}, u'label': u'neutral'}",0.720767245362,0.279232754638,0.82428411095,neutral,"{u'tone_categories': [{u'category_id': u'emotion_tone', u'tones': [{u'tone_name': u'Anger', u'score': 0.534021, u'tone_id': u'anger'}, {u'tone_name': u'Disgust', u'score': 0.206361, u'tone_id': u'disgust'}, {u'tone_name': u'Fear', u'score': 0.119852, u'tone_id': u'fear'}, {u'tone_name': u'Joy', u'score': 0.109726, u'tone_id': u'joy'}, {u'tone_name': u'Sadness', u'score': 0.552984, u'tone_id': u'sadness'}], u'category_name': u'Emotion Tone'}, {u'category_id': u'language_tone', u'tones': [{u'tone_name': u'Analytical', u'score': 0.33221, u'tone_id': u'analytical'}, {u'tone_name': u'Confident', u'score': 0.0, u'tone_id': u'confident'}, {u'tone_name': u'Tentative', u'score': 0.608276, u'tone_id': u'tentative'}], u'category_name': u'Language Tone'}, {u'category_id': u'social_tone', u'tones': [{u'tone_name': u'Openness', u'score': 0.580827, u'tone_id': u'openness_big5'}, {u'tone_name': u'Conscientiousness', u'score': 0.545054, u'tone_id': u'conscientiousness_big5'}, {u'tone_name': u'Extraversion', u'score': 0.287936, u'tone_id': u'extraversion_big5'}, {u'tone_name': u'Agreeableness', u'score': 0.086375, u'tone_id': u'agreeableness_big5'}, {u'tone_name': u'Emotional Range', u'score': 0.623471, u'tone_id': u'emotional_range_big5'}], u'category_name': u'Social Tone'}]}",0.534021,0.206361,0.119852,0.109726,0.552984,0.33221,0.0,0.608276,0.580827,0.545054,0.287936,0.086375,0.623471

lablaakings,,,"” Unlimited tolerance must lead to the disappearance of tolerance. If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them.


In this formulation, I do not imply, for instance, that we should always suppress the utterance of intolerant philosophies; as long as we can counter them by rational argument and keep them in check by public opinion, suppression would certainly be unwise.


But we should claim the right to suppress them if necessary even by force; for it may easily turn out that they are not prepared to meet us on the level of rational argument, but begin by denouncing all argument; they may forbid their followers to listen to rational argument, because it is deceptive, and teach them to answer arguments by the use of their fists or pistols.



We should therefore claim, in the name of tolerance, the right not to tolerate the intolerant. We should claim that any movement preaching intolerance places itself outside the law, and we should consider incitement to intolerance and persecution as criminal, in the same way as we should consider incitement to murder, or to kidnapping, or to the revival of the slave trade, as criminal.”

The Yemeni government was recently overthrown. Most people would assume the US did this (as the comments show) as that is what their biases and propaganda has led them to believe.

TheEarthquakeGuy,,,"Hi guys! Earthquake perspective here.

****

**What you need to know**

* **Magnitude:** **Now a 7.5** 7.6 originally, however it has been upgraded to a 7.7 event.

* **Depth:** Originally sitting at 33km, it's now been updated to 65.7km. This is a moderately deep quake, although the quake is still quite large so locally there will have been a lot of stronger shaking.

* **Intensity of the Shaking:** Currently sitting at Mercalli scale VII (Very strong), with an estimated 26,000 people in Kokopo, the closest major city to the epicentre. 

* **Expected Fatalities:** The USGS pager system currently shows the following:



Estimated Fatalities | Probability
--------------------|-----------
No Fatalities | 65%
1-10 Fatalities | 30%
10-100 Fatalities | 4%
100+ | 1%

* **Estimated Economic losses:** Again the USGS shows the following via their pager system. 



Estimated Economic Losses (USD) | Probability
-------------------------------|-----------
Under $1 million | 68%
Between $1-10 million | 30%
Between $10-100 million | 2%

* **Tsunami warning:** There is currently a localised tsunami warning in place, with a possible 1-3 metre tsunami around the Papa New Guinea coastline. At most, a 30 centimetre 'tsunami' could be expected around other coastlines (Japan, Australia, NZ, Hawaii and other pacific islands), however that is also likely to die out.

Israel is being bullied by the Muslim masses and anti-US countries that thrive on making the US look bad. However, its only crime is defending itself.

Yes in defending itself shit happens, and critics love screaming such injustices to the high heavens, but this conflict wouldve been resolved decades ago if not for Muslim belligerence and wet dreams of supremacy. And sadly, this supremacy is not gone, it has instead been replaced by a facade of peace by Abbas and his ilk- who line their pockets as de facto dictators with donor funds, saying how they only want peace, all the while teaching their youth hatred in schools and media and inciting violence. Promising peace while they tell Arab media they will not accept anything less than 100% of Israel.

Funny enough this conflict has a resolution: stop giving Palestinians money. When the people in Hamas/PLO realize war with Israel is no longer an easy path to billions, and that attacks vs Israel and the effects of its reprisals will no longer be funded by the west...theyll negotiate based on the reality. Otherwise be ready for decades of conflict.

Kyoo-Ehh,,,"We have to remember, ISIS is aligning itself to make massive gains if western nations decide to intervene. They and their supporters want boots on the ground.

We may talk big about bombing them to kingdom come, annihilating their villages, and eradicating both soldiers and their families to thoroughly ""cleanse"" the world of their bloodline. But this kind of response will, like the brooms in Fantasia, make them stronger in numbers and justify their existence as soldiers fighting the invading western ""empires"".

The solution has to come from local nations that are occupied by or adjacent to ISIS controlled regions. Without their desire to see ISIS wiped from existence, foreign intervention will only be a temporary solution, and when the western forces leave, an even bloodier fanatical group will take ISIS' place.

This is exactly what happened in Iraq, exactly what caused ISIS to pop into existence in the first place. Western powers attempted to ""stabilize"" Iraq by removing a leader they thought was stockpiling weapons of mass destruction, and after they ended combat operations and executed Saddam Hussein, Iraq became a veritable Petri dish of Islamic fundamentalism. ~~Operation Enduring Freedom~~ Operation Iraqi Freedom (thanks /u/DrShaufhausen for the correction)  didn't have local Iraqi support, nor did it have support from Iraq's neighboring nations, thus the ""evil"" we were fighting to extinguish ended up getting replaced by something worse.

It got replaced by ISIS.

ISIS wants another invasion like that of Iraq in 2003. And they're probably going to get it with the length of barbarism they're achieving like today's sick display. But the end result is likely going to be an even worse region than it was before, because we do not have the local support needed to keep the region stable after any foreign military intervention.

And the biggest problem, even worse than the cowards and psychopaths living out their sick power fantasies under the false pretenses of Islamic righteousness, are the foreign interests supporting ISIS.

In particular, the Saudi Royal Family. You want to hit Isis where it hurts the most? Remove those rich Saudi bastards from their donations listing. Diplomatic persuasion is preferred...but not *required*...

MeltMyCheeseKThxBai,,,"As a former Catholic (now Protestant), this is WILDLY inappropriate and had I been attending this service I would have walked out. Whether you agree with this or not is unimportant, it's just the facts; even if he is gay himself, it is completely against Catholic teaching to support same sex marriage. Point, blank, period. The Catholic church does not condemn being gay. What is considered sinful is acting on your desires. 

It was distasteful and unnecessary to announce his sexual preferences during MASS. That information has zero place in a mass. He essentially announced to the congregation that he has the desire to have sex with men. Since when is that an okay subject for the pulpit, whether from a gay or straight priest? The pulpit is also NOT the place for blatant political pandering. In the Church's view, he just actively encouraged his flock to vote for and support something sinful. He is not brave or gutsy, he is inappropriate and according to his own faith, leading his flock astray.

To reiterate, I don't care one iota if you support SSM or not. The fact is that a Catholic mass, where Catholics go to receive Catholic teachings, is in no way the place to campaign about homosexual marriage. It should be respected as a place of worship and not made into a platform for things the Church firmly teaches against.

ClockworkAeroplane,,,"It helped me immensely. I am a different person post-MDMA. Just taking a several-hour break from the insecurity and distrust built up through years of bullying/mockery because I was so small and so underdeveloped as a kid was enough to make me see that it didn't have to be that way. If I stepped away from that and just communicated directly with people, I found that they weren't all just setting up an elaborate trick to embarrass or hurt me.

Nothing has been the same since that first dose 20 years ago. I only did it a few more times after that, but I felt that I'd gotten what I needed from it.

Of all the illegal recreational substances, I think MDMA has the most promise as an actual psychiatric medicine. Yes, some people will stupidly try taking it every week (all that does is fry you—the effect is not the drug, it's just eating up like a month's serotonin over the course of a few hours), but everyone I know who used to use it stopped, feeling they had gotten what they needed.

In addition, people here slamming US tax payer aid ignores that that a lot of the aid that mandates buying *American* equipment means that money flows back to the US. Yes, some of it goes to the leadership of those companies, but do people realize how many tens to hundreds of thousands of employees are employed by Lockheed Martin and subcontractors (which range from other corporations to mom &amp; pop operations manufacturing specific parts)? Or that the money often ends up in the form of grants to university labs and research labs for R&amp;D?

It's easy to slam the foreign aid, but people conveniently forget that money largely flows back into the pockets of Americans.

In addition, the Camp David Accords is why Israel and Egypt get as much money as they do - we're basically bribing the two sides to stop fighting each other, each of which were many magnitudes larger than the Israeli-Palestinian conflicts of the past few decades. The cost of the financial aid is a lot lower than the cost of those wars.

------
edit: It seems like I've touched on a lot of nerves, so let me expound on my views.

Prior to the 1979 Camp David Accords, Arab-Israeli war was a daily occurrence. The primary player for the Arab side, and considered the leader of the Arab nations (and certainly its military powerhouse), was Egypt. The wars routinely involved Egypt and Syria, with support from other Arab countries like Iraq, Jordan, Libya, Lebanon, etc. against Israel. 

The recent Israeli-Palestinian wars pale in comparison. We're talking about hundreds of thousands of troops and tens of thousands killed. They weren't just the Six Day War (in which tens of thousands of Arabs were killed in 6 days) or the 1973 Yom Kippur War, there was also low level conflict that occurred such as the War of Attrition from 1967-1970.

The 1979 Camp David Accords changed all that - the US deftly flipped Egypt, the main powerhouse of the Arab world, onto its side, ending Arab attempts at destroying Israel militarily. In addition, the US already had a long standing alliance with Saudi Arabia [forged by FDR when he met King Ibn Saud, the founder of Saudi Arabia](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ac/FDR_on_quincy.jpg), which meant the Arab leaders were now on the American side. 

In exchange, the US provided military aid to both countries - this shifted the balance of power permanently so that Syria (now without Egyptian aid) could never militarily defeat Israel, now with US aid money buying more US equipment.

In addition, the Egyptian military aid built up the military as an institution in Egypt, which was already held in high praise after it successfully breached the defenses along the Suez Canal in 1973. Egyptian officers were invited to the US to study at the US War Colleges (President Sisi was one such person) and build close relationships with the US and learn US doctrines, including secular government leadership.

For better or worse, one can argue that the strong Egyptian military is what has kept Egypt together (even if it used questionable tactics) throughout the Arab Spring, enforcing secularist government - one look at neighboring Libya or nearby Syria, which had extremely weak military institutions (kept intentionally weak by the dictatorships) and are now in chaos between secular forces and Islamist militias fighting for control of their countries, and one can easily see why the Egyptian model is the preferred method over the alternatives. (Hell, many would argue the disbanding of the Iraqi Army in the wake of the US invasion was the biggest blunder of the war, as they would've been put to work immediately on keeping the country cohesive, just without Saddam's brutality at its leadership).

I think most of us would agree that $1-2 billion per year to Egypt and its military is far better and far cheaper than having to go in there and clean up if an ISIS or Islamist force takes over that country.

The question is also asked - what does $3 billion in foreign aid (or roughly $10 per citizen in the US) mean, and how does it affect me, the average American? After all, doesn't this money go to a small segment of the US employed in the defense industry?

We can argue about the defense industry and its role on the US economy all we want - its important to remember that the defense industry isn't just big corporations but also research labs and even PhD students who receive research grants from the government or said companies. But let's focus on the immediate impact of the Arab-Israeli peace:

In 1973, in the wake of the Yom Kippur War, the oil embargo by Arab OPEC nations quadrupled the price of world oil by the end of the 6 month embargo. That meant relatively high oil prices, extremely long lines at the pump (hours in some cases - and an estimated 20% of gas stations had no oil) -- all of which had direct impacts on the average American citizen. In addition, a big part of the economic recession in the 70s was blamed on this disruption - high oil prices meant higher costs of production and distribution of products, leading to job cuts and a downtrend in the economy.

The Suez Canal was also cut off due to the Arab Israeli War. A HUGE part of world trade flows through here - and I emphasize world, as this is where trade from Europe flows through to get to the Indian Ocean and so on, not to mention trade from the East Coast of the US to the same regions. 

So yes, the average American can and has definitely felt the impact of the Arab-Israeli war.

Ramy_,,,"I don't think people realize how anti-Jewish most of the Muslim world is. Not anti-Israel or ""anti-Zionist"" but anti-Jewish.

I grew up Christian in Egypt. The Muslims didn't like us and we didn't like the Muslims but we saw each other as humans with different religious beliefs.

We literally viewed Jews as Satan personified. If some kid went missing ""it was the Jews"", if someone shoplifted some milk from the store ""it was the Jews"". And it didn't matter when the next day we found it was some local kid who took it. We never thought back to ""we shouldn't have blamed the Jews for that one"".  We just moved on to the next one.

You call someone ""a Jew"" as an insult similar to the way kids in the West might call someone gay. A Jew is literally the worst kind of thing you can imagine, like a cockroach or mosquito.

And that's the culture. And that's how I grew up and that's in a Christian town in Egypt. A country that is supposedly at peace with Israel.  I'd have to imagine it's worse in Syria, or Iran, or a multitude of other countries.

I since moved to the US at 13. I have quite a few Jewish friends, dated a Jewish girl for a while. Given up on most of how I was raised including my religion (atheist/agnostic for what it's worth).

But people in the West literally have no idea. I laugh when I hear people in the West say ""if Israel did X"" or ""if Israel did Y"" there would be peace. Yeah right. It would be like a mosquito trying to make peace with humans. You are so hated and reviled nothing you ever do short of dying will be enough.

It's honestly incredibly sad but that's the way it is. And it's not going to change anytime soon.

RockBandDood,,,"Please people, do not be scared by the American politicians acting as thought this deal is bad for us.. It is not.

There has NEVER been a single time the Israeli or American intelligence agencies have thought that Iran having a bomb was a possibility.. The politicians, Netanyahu, George Bush, and other, have been pushing an anti Iran narrative for decades that simply isn't grounded in fact.

Netanyahu gave speeches to the UN saying Iran would have a bomb within a few years after his own intelligence agency told him that was not the case at all.

We have been swindled by these men and women about the Iranian regimes actions.

No one is saying Iran is ""right"" about anything, no one is saying them hanging folks in the street is okay - what we are saying is let's not bomb a country over something they haven't done and even our own intelligence says they're not even nearly capable of doing.

Please, let's take a moment to breath and understand a simple fact: Iran was never a legitimate nuclear threat.... But.. We now have a deal that likely guarantees that will never happen - and no one had to die.

This is not Obama tricking you. This is not the EU tricking you.  This is them finally addressing a manufactured problem and allowing the Iranian people a chance to join the rest of the civilized world.. And they sure won't be a bad ally to have if the Mideast continues spiraling out of control.

All in all - this is a good thing for everyone involved.  Don't let the fear mongerers scare you: this is a good deal and this is a good day.

flashbunnny,,,"Okay as a Canadian University student this absolutely boiled my blood for half an hour and after an intense imaginary argument with myself in the shower, I am forced to write this. 

I would absolutely destroy this lady for trying to impose this absurdity on a multi-cultural University. Just because Canada is a free country doesn't mean one can abuse the system to favor one's twisted prenotions.

First of all, its not a legitimate reason to just presume women are uncomfortable working out with men in the room. If one feels conscious, embarrassed or ashamed in the company of 50% of the population then they should tackle their mental issues, not spread it and demand that everyone else change for them to accommodate their demands. 

If there is women's hours because they feel intimidated by men, then there should be a skinny guy hour too - for the same ""reason"". Citing religious reasons is becoming cheap because no one wants to offend another religion. But her religion doesn't say anything about not working out with guys. And even if it did, that's her problem. The University can only go so far in accommodating everyone's religious demands. Its not a church, mosque or temple. 

What if my religion requires me to carry a 6"" dagger everywhere I go (Sikhism)? Will you feel safe? If you are intolerant about that, then why make an exception to this.

Making a separate woman's hour indirectly suggests and supports the idea that women are not safe in the presence of men. That attaches a stigma to both men and women's minds. When in reality, no one gives a crap what you do at the gym - or anywhere. Why is she so butt-hurt about this. If she wants to work out only with other women then go to a private gym. Everyone works out and does their thing. No one bullies or intimidates anyone. 

This stupid wanna-be ~~lawyer's~~ law student's false sense of self-righteousness needs to be put in place. I hope the petition against her is successful. I admire people who take a stand against change. But this is just plain abusing your rights.

Overall:

* [Bureau of Investigative Journalism](http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/category/projects/drones/drones-graphs/) = 77-83% militants.

* [New America Foundation](http://natsec.newamerica.net/drones/pakistan/analysis) = 80-90% militants in Pakistan from 2004-2014.

* [Columbia Human Rights Clinic (PDF)](http://web.law.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/microsites/human-rights-institute/files/COLUMBIACountingDronesFinal.pdf) = 72-87% militants in Pakistan in 2011.  (Anti-drone study.)

* [Long War Journal](http://www.longwarjournal.org/pakistan-strikes.php) = 94% militants in Pakistan from 2004-2014.

* [Small AP investigation](http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/2012/02/26/20120226study-drone-strikes.html?nclick_check=1) = about 70% militants.

[A report by Stanford](http://patrickjohnston.info/materials/drones.pdf) states that ""the results do lend some credence to the argument that drone strikes, while unpopular, have bolstered U.S. counterterrorism efforts in Pakistan.""

**Appendix on sources and methodology, such as the sources of who classifies victims as ""militant"" or ""civilian"":**

* The Bureau of Investigative Journalism's sources and methodology are [here](http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2011/08/10/pakistan-drone-strikes-the-methodology2/).  Their primary sources are international, national, and local press reports, supplemented by occasional field investigations and government leaks.

* The New American Foundation's methodology is [here](http://securitydata.newamerica.net/drones/methodology).  Their primary sources are media outlets, for which they try to build a consensus, erring on the side of reporting more civilian casualties.

* The Columbia Human Rights Clinic describes their criteria for identifying victims as civilians and militants on page 24, which is basically their independent analysis of media reports and other drone-tracking organizations.

* The Long War Journal gets their numbers from Pakistani sources and original reporting.

* The AP interviewed local villagers to obtain their number.

feared_rear_admiral,,,"Moderate Islam is like moderate Nazism, the only moderate thing about it is that followers *don't* follow everything that their religiously mandated document of absolute truths tells them. Why bother being moderate about it? How *can* you even be moderate when your ideology demands absolute obediance? When you moderate away all the dangerous and inaccurate elements of the holy text there's nothing left that isn't just generic human understanding of the world. Have some courage, both intellectual and physical, and say no to a hateful doctrine.

It reminds me of that Mormon episode on South Park, how Stan is the bigot for pointing out that Joseph Smith was basically a con artist. The Mormon kid then said that Mormons know this and instead just try to be good people. If the core of your ideology is fundamentally broken then why bother hanging on to it in any way?

theartfulcodger,,,"After nine and a half decades of both the Saudi state and its rulers supplying massive amounts of political, religious and financial support to authoritarian, puritanical, and violent Wahhabists, consistently and regularly proffered by several successive generations of the royal family, the Saudi people are only now *just beginning* to feel the very first tentative, precursor zephyrs, indicating the imminent arrival of what will most assuredly soon become a terrifying, self-sown, self-destructive fundamentalist whirlwind that their nation will reap.

It is important to understand that the ISIS flame which now threatens to turn the nation into ashes and char marks, originated as just a tiny Wahhabist spark, first struck in the late 1800s by the legendary ibn Saud himself. It was essentially a desperate, big-casino political gamble on his part, and had very little to do with any conviction he held about the Islamic purity of Wahhabist doctrine. Ibn Saud almost literally ""cried havoc and let slip the dogs of war"",  first by himself adopting Wahhabism (then just a small, minor sect with little influence, but uncompromising, vengeful and bloody-minded in its intensity), then unleashing its violent and unforgiving proponents to run amok among his enemies and rivals, and allowing the fundamentalist and puritanical principles they carried to spread among his broken, terrorized and baffled neighbours like a contagion. 

At first, he supported Wahhabism simply to spiritually justify, to both his supporters and detractors, his waging a bloody, protracted series of otherwise mostly pointless tribal wars against neighbouring clans ... clans who had conveniently (for ibn Saud, anyway) adopted significantly less militant and bloodthirsty strains of Islam. The inherently uncompromising and vengeful nature of Wahhabism, coupled with its blood-lust and predilection for violent conversion, made limited conflicts like these a virtual duck shoot for a master tactician like ibn Saud; it was like having an army of wild-eyed, blood-of-the-lamb, speaking-in-tongues, serpent-handling Crusaders at his disposal, and ordering them to go forth and convert pacifist Buddhist farmers, by dint of sword and trebuchet. And after his rivals were conquered, Wahhabism helped keep them compliant and obedient to his authority.

But ibn Saud had a deeper agenda for spreading Wahhabism, too: its long-term purpose was to aid him, probably over the course of several decades, in consolidating enough regional power and gathering sufficient influence that he himself might someday come to be viewed by the ever-advancing West as the principal political, military *and* spiritual authority dominating the land west of the Ottoman Empire and east of Egypt (Which, incidentally, was then being overrun by the British ... thus creating *another* reason for ibn Saud to waste no time consolidating whatever local power he could lay hands on).

Ibn Saud was carefully setting himself up to be the only player at the Middle East table that was evidently capable of both representing local concerns, *and* of commanding local co-operation. If he could manage that, then it would become likely (he hoped) that he might advance both his own personal, and his peoples' pieces on the board, without and within the region, simply by playing off one competing western nation's offers, intrigues and demands against those of the others.

So his ultimate goal was to use Wahhabism to help position himself as a triple threat. He wished to appear to Western eyes as a priest-king-warrior: pious, noble, and steely-eyed. He would represent his European contemporaries Pope Pius, Emperor Napoleon, and General Wellington, all combined into one truly formidable individual. That alone might give the vastly technologically superior nations of the West pause, before they just walked into the region and took it over. Because there *was* a clear local authority, they would try to avoid bloodshed by first seeing if they could negotiate useful political, financial and military agreements with him. If such an authority didn't exist, they'd just move in and do whatever they wanted.

However, ibn Saud also wanted them to think that indulging in said process would not be overly onerous. Because clearly, acquiring such needful things would merely hinge on obtaining the consent of but one single man. A man who was uneducated and unsophisticated perhaps, but who could be very useful - especially if he wielded *enormous* influence over the large and bewildering array of local tribes, clans, sects, subsects, creeds, families, miscellaneous groups of tents in the sand, loose alliances, internecine wars, local blood feuds and squabbles over stolen goats that Western expeditions would otherwise have to sort out individually as they moved through the region: a daunting, time-consuming and onerous process.

Ibn Saud's tactical gamble in allowing the Wahhabis to wreak sufficient spiritual chaos for him to gain significant religious influence over the region to bolster his leadership, paid off handsomely. With Wahhabi help, his hard work, subtle planning, courage and sheer ballsiness eventually carried him from being a minor and hard-pressed tribal chieftain - principal of just one of four tiny and desperately poor traditional regions, which even together boasted few natural and human resources - to becoming the founder and father of what is now the modern, prosperous, and powerful nation that carries his name.

But today, that puritanical, merciless Wahhabist spark ibn Saud first struck 130 years ago, has since grown into a fierce flame called ISIS, and it has shifted position enough to now be capable of reaching and igniting the massive towers of fundamentalist tinder represented by so many years of ""decadent"" and ""sinful"" cultural and economic modernization / Westernization by the Saudi nation. Or at least ""decadent"" to the radicalized and hyper-orthodox eye of ISIS, who regard even strict Saudi Wahhabism as moral slacktivism and shameless religious deviance. Further, with such lavish and obvious quantities of religious combustibles lying about the country unprotected, readily available for them to ignite at will, ISIS' s.o.p. of slow-burning, asymmetrical and theocratic revolutionary war is now destined to continue burning fiercely within the Saudi nation's boundaries *for decades.* 

While the Saudi military is large, well-equipped and well-trained in comparison to, say, their regional neighbour Iraq, we have now seen that traditional military muscle often has great difficulty even holding its own on asymmetrical fields of battle, much less prevailing convincingly. And as a nation composed largely of underworked, overweight and overprivileged civilian men who are accustomed to having personal servants, and relying exclusively on hired immigrant and expatriate labour to accomplish anything of substance, the potential for increasing the military's striking power against ISIS through induction, or even for efficiently replacing combat losses (which could soon be substantial) are questionable at best. So I suspect that very soon, there is going to be a morale problem. If you thought the Iraqis were fleeing the scene of battle prematurely, just you wait.... 

Even if their military manages to put out the multiple surface hotspots that will soon blaze in ISIS' wake like Kuwaiti well fires marking the late-night passage of the Republican Guard, the destructive heat of ISIS's radicalism will continue to burn underground like a smouldering coal seam, and to flare up again with a brilliant vengeance, in unexpected places, and at inconvenient times. 

This may indeed result (and perhaps surprisingly soon) in the dramatic Syrianization of much of urban Saudi Arabia, if not of the large stretches of unoccupied countryside. Or it might even eventually result in the bloody collapse and overthrow of the entire House of Saud - the globe's only remaining absolute monarchy.

This latter scenario would be, I personally believe, in and of itself a good thing for the Western world. For the private, narrow and national interests of absolutist rulers generationally accustomed to wielding immeasurable private wealth, who believe with absolute conviction that their own hereditary political authoritarianism has been divinely ordained, and who are overly accustomed to using secular law as a blunt weapon to enforce religious doctrines they find politically useful ... well, those sort of self-serving private interests rarely align well with the more global, commercial and inclusive interests ascribed to by functioning democracies, do they?

The problem this possibility represents, of course, is that if and when such a scenario comes about, the current Saudi regime - for all its dubious morals and values, and lack of concern for its own people - will probably be replaced by something much, *much* worse - worse for the Saudi people themselves, worse for the West, and worse indeed for worldwide Islam.

The point of having a massive data collection on every citizen is that within very few years you have dirt on everyone. That means if someone threatens the cherished policies of the bureaucracy they can be smeared and discredited. They can be bullied and targeted and marginalised. Political opponents can be eliminated this way before they even become a threat.

Atypicalclone,,,"A lot of comments in this thread about missiles, landmines and so forth. There is a fundamental difference; missiles are ordnance launched at something. Mines are put into the ground by someone (or shot somewhere or airdropped). Drones are remotely piloted. In all these instances it is another human being who decides to kill other human beings. A human making the decision for human reasons and who is subject to human laws. 

This ban - and other talk on the subject - is all about autonomous machines making the decision to kill a human being on their own. It would be a machine deciding to kill a human. Do we want to step over this boundary? It will remove a lot of responsibility when fatalities can be blamed on machines. It will open up a realistic possibility for machines going haywire (or intentionally hostile) with murderous results. Humans can be monstrous, but at least we have thousands of years of experience regarding them.

EverydayKrampus,,,"In case anyone wanted to have an informed opinion on this topic it should be pointed out that only a couple weeks ago an ethics journal article hit front page dealing with this very topic. I am at school right now so I don't have the time to find it again however I will outline its major points.

**Thanks to Alfredo_BE for finding the article. http://aeon.co/magazine/philosophy/male-and-female-circumcision-are-equally-wrong/** Please read this if you are looking for a balanced view on the subject which i tried to emulate in this comment.

The article outlined the fact that female genital mutilation (FGM) occurs on a slider of medical cleanliness and severity of procedure. It ranges from out back aboriginal tribes women preforming FGM on their daughters with old spear tips to operations done in hospitals by medical professionals. It also ranges from 'minor' nicking of the clitoral hood (causing it to be permanently exposed) to complete removal of the clitoris and parts of the majoral and/or minoral labia. As well (and this is a major part to bring balance to the conversation) male genital mutilation (MGM) also occurs on such a slider.It ranges in procedure in a similar way (and in similar tribes) from fathers preforming the procedure with an old spear tip to medical professionals in medical practices. It also ranges in severity from the 'minor' Mosaic practice of removing the overhanging bit of foreskin (preserving the majority of its lubricating and overall sexual function) to the complete removal of the foreskin (this is the common western type most people are familiar with) to in some aboriginal tribes slicing the penis open lengthwise along the urethra from the base of the penis to the head (usually resulting in the complete loss of sexual function).

The argument the MGM has medical validity in the form of cleanliness later in life is moot because the same might be said about FGM. The vagina has many folds and moist places that may harbor pathogenic bacteria and the removal of some of these folds may reduce the chance of infection - we will just never know because it is illegal to preform in the western world. However, the risk to the individual's health in either FGM and MGM in their most minor forms is evident with multiple cases of death in infants in the US each year from complications of MGM and the same would be expected of FGM^1. Then ethically the argument would be that without life threatening medical cause there should be no operations done on either gender-ed patient. 

**TL;DR;**Both male and female circumcision should probably be considered genital mutilation (MGM and FGM) because in neither case is the consent of the patient obtained (nor can it be until the patient is an adult eg. 18+).

Both occur in 'innocuous' forms and extreme forms.

The argument that MGM increases cleanliness is moot because it most likely would be the same for FGM.

Both FGM and MGM pose serious health risks to patients (multiple cases per year of infant death due to complications of MGM in the UK alone).

Neither MGM or FGM should be common medical practice because of these risks and absence of medical necessity or patient consent.

**edit: provided a source for the mortality of boys undergoing MGM**

[The Israeli Committee Against House Demolitions: Key Facts
](http://www.icahd.org/faq)

&gt;Since 1967, about 27,000 Palestinian homes and other structures (livestock pens and fencing for example) crucial for a family’s livelihood, have been demolished in the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT)

&gt;Throughout the OPT Israel follows a policy of not granting Palestinians building permits. How is this done in a country that claims to be a democracy? Discrimination against Palestinians (and this is true for the Palestinian citizens of Israel as well) is embedded in the dry technicalities of planning, zoning, and administration. Almost the entire West Bank has been declared by Israel “agricultural land,” so that when Palestinians request permission to build on their own properties they are refused.

&gt;The policy of house demolitions, based on a manipulation of planning mechanisms and closely linked to the confiscation of land and the growth of Israeli settlements, is a grave human rights violation against the Palestinian residents of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. This unacceptable policy has caused homelessness and accompanying trauma to thousands of Palestinians, including children; it has brought in its train wounding, and even killing. Amnesty International calls on the Government of Israel to:

&gt;1) End the discriminatory policy of denying building permits and demolishing the houses of Palestinians.

&gt;2) Ensure that all outstanding demolition orders are cancelled and responsibility for planning be restored to the Palestinian communities in each area.

&gt;3) Repeal discriminatory laws without delay.

&gt;Israeli officials justify demolitions of Palestinian structures on the grounds that they were built “illegally” without building permits in areas not zoned for residential construction.

so6p,,,"Everything about Zuckerberg and Facebook stinks of corruption and mass control. And how many people are still on Fb? A Billion? Fuck, people are stupid putting out all that personal information and wallowing in the pit of non-stop status update drama. 

Just man the fuck up, and quit it already. Go have real friends. Quitting facebook will initially feel like a divorce or a major heartbreak, but eventually you will have so much free time and such liveliness in your interactions with people. Just try it for 6 months, or until you have gotten over that depression hump which comes after leaving your 'friends'.

I can see how Fb has alienated friends. Nowadays, it's so hard to talk to someone without them wanting to share something they learned from their news-feed, or this false feeling they have that they don't care about you as much because they have 'so many friends'. 

It puts you in a stupor. Sit down and think about the times before fb, where when you met someone or talked to someone, you gave your all because you weren't afraid that they might share what you just talked about with the entire world, or because you knew that it would be a while before you will see them again. It has had a weird subconscious effect on how you think about personal communications.

Now, the one not on your fb profile is not even remembered. Think about it. And when you do meet them, you have this sense that they they don't know what you know and hence they seem a little alien. After all, they didn't 'Like' you inspirational status updates or comment on your pensive thoughts. You think, ""How could such an off-the-grid person even understand what you have been going through?"" It's better for you to hangout in real life with people who *you think* are browsing the same pages and have the same thought process as you.

Fb is the worst thing to happen to culture. There are positives to Fb but they all can be achieved elsewhere - Twitter to spread viral information, And emails/phone-calls to connect with people you consider important. Yet, you deny to see that what addicts you to Fb is this invisible play on your psyche - much like the effect of hard drugs on your nervous system.

flynavy88,,,"This is going to be an interesting few years for Saudi Arabia. King Abdullah was considered a reformer - his brother and predecessor, King Fahd, was a conservative who drove Saudi Arabia far deeper into Wahhabi Islam, in order to appease the clerics. King Abdullah, on the other hand, pushed quietly for a lot of reform for females and tried to reverse a lot of the change the hard-line conservatives in the country did during his predecessor's reign.

There are a LOT of people who don't quite understand the dynamic between the Saudi people and the Saudi government - an absolute monarchy - and why blaming splitting/spurning Saudi Arabia could hurt us a lot more than trying to keep reforms in Saudi Arabia going. The following is a bit of a history lesson, but very relevant to the struggle going on there.

First, we must go back to December 1979, a pivotal month year in modern Islam.

At the end of 1979, Islamists seized the Grand Mosque in Mecca, during the hajj, when millions around the world came for pilgrimage. Hundreds of pilgrims were taken hostage - hundreds died and the ringleaders were beheaded.

That same December, Ayatollah Khomeini officially became the 1st Supreme Leader of Iran. In doing so, his revolution had successfully created a Shia theocracy in Iran, a rival of the Arabs and in particular Saudi Arabia.

Also in December of 1979, the Soviet Union, an atheist state, invaded Afghanistan, an Islamic state.

Why do all of these tie in together?

For one, the Saudi royal family sees themselves as the caretakers of Mecca and Medina - a sort of royal protector of Islam like an Islamic Vatican State. In Iran in 1979, however, there was a new rival in both culture (Arabs vs Persian), religious sect (Sunni vs Shia), and now in government (monarchy vs theocracy). Note that many hardline Islamists do not believe that monarchies can exist in strict Islam - as thus, the Saudi royal family was nothing more than a western, imperialist creation that was ultimately un-Islamic. Furthermore, the agreement they've had with the US for protection (established by FDR during WW2 actually, after he met with the founder of Saudi Arabia, in exchange for logistics bases for the war) was seen as a mortal sin - dealing with an infidel country.

The Saudi family feared that Iran would become a model for the commoners to rise up. The Saudi populace is very conservative and while the Saudi royal family has been famous for its debauchery and westernized living (especially abroad), for the most part the population had been quiet. The Seizure of the Grand Mosque, however, sent a shockwave through the Saudi family - they were not immune. They feared they too would be toppled by an Iranian-style revolution by those who deemed them not Islamic-enough.

As thus, the Saudis embarked on appeasing the hardliner clerics with more strict laws, a tougher moral police, etc. Prior to all this, Saudi Arabia didn't have such strict laws as requiring women to be covered in public, foreign females could drive legally, etc. In exchange, the clerics continued the agreement to legitimize the Saudi family.

Furthermore, the Soviet invasion was an unexpected boon - the Saudi government encouraged young Islamist-leaning males to go fight in holy jihad against the atheist commies and defend Islam in Afghanistan. Also, many Saudi citizens donated money to establish mosques in Pakistan and Afghanistan to preach their ideology and send more fighters against the Soviets. All of this was welcomed by the Saudi government -this relieved a lot of the pressure internally as those fighters and money went away from funding fundamentalists internally.

Where did it all go wrong? Well, fast forward to 1991 and the Gulf War. When Saddam invaded Kuwait, Osama bin Laden - through his family connections - petitioned the Saudi king to let him and his hardened fighters in Afghanistan come and fight the Iraqis.

The Saudi King refused - instead, he requested the US and an international coalition come help. The Saudis volunteered their soil for US bases.

To Osama, this was the last straw - the Saudi King let an infidel army establish bases on the holiest soil in Islam. In turn, Osama declared war not just on the US and the west - but also on the Saudi government and its royal family.

This is why all the talk about removing our support from Saudi Arabia, etc. simply isn't going to happen. Yes, most of the 9/11 hijackers were Saudi citizens - but the Saudi government itself has been under attack by people of those same ideologies. The Saudi government has had to play a balancing act between its western-leaning royal family and the hardliner citizens that make up its population.

This is also why we need the Saudi government to come aboard in cracking down harder on its citizens - after a string of attacks in the 90s and 2000s, they finally came to a realization that they had to do something and it's made a lot of headway in the fight against Islamists.

And that's why Saudi Arabia has supported toppling Gaddafi (because he's a clown) and Assad (because he's an ally of Shia Iran), whether there are Islamist rebels or not -- its radical citizens have a place to go wage jihad away from home  -- but also has supported toppling Morsi (because he's a hardline Islamist) and re-establishing the secular rule of the Egyptian military.

(Yes, I know much of this is very simplified, but it should provide a big picture to what's going on with Saudi Arabia)

&gt;**NASA Mars Rover's Weather Data Bolster Case for Brine**
&gt;
&gt; ...
&gt;
&gt; **Perchlorate identified in Martian soil by the Curiosity mission**, and previously by NASA's Phoenix Mars Lander mission, **has properties of absorbing water vapor from the atmosphere and lowering the freezing temperature of water.** This has been proposed for years as a mechanism for possible existence of transient liquid brines at higher latitudes on modern Mars, despite the Red Planet's cold and dry conditions.
&gt;
&gt; New calculations were based on more than a full Mars year of temperature and humidity measurements by Curiosity. They indicate that conditions at the rover's near-equatorial location were favorable for small quantities of brine to form during some nights throughout the year, drying out again after sunrise. Conditions should be even more favorable at higher latitudes, where colder temperatures and more water vapor can result in higher relative humidity more often.
&gt;
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; ""**We have not detected brines, but calculating the possibility that they might exist in Gale Crater during some nights** testifies to the value of the round-the-clock and year-round measurements REMS is providing,"" said Curiosity Project Scientist Ashwin Vasavada of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, one of the new report's co-authors.
&gt;
&gt; ...

TL;DR the conditions are possible for brine (salt water) to form during *some* nights. They haven't discovered the brine, only calculated that it could exist.

**ELI5:** There is salt in the Martian soil. Salt attracts water out of the air. Salt lowers the freezing point of water. Mars isn't cold enough to freeze the salt water.

Cybugger,,,"The people stating things along the lines of ""As an American, this distrubs me"", can I point something out, very clearly: The Muslims who immigrate to the US are not the same as those immigrating to Europe. In particular, a vast majority of the Muslims that have immigrated to the US are relatively wealthy, well educated and moderate. What's more, the proportion of Muslims in the US is ridiculously low compared to most EU countries.

Now, I am firmly against discriminating against Muslims. They are free to come, and to integrate European society. And that's the key: integrate. The problem is the small minority of extremists that have infiltrated the UK, France, Germany, etc... They want Sharia law. They want others to follow Ramadan. They want to be able to beat women, they want to be able to force marriages. These are not people who are worthy of our defence. They simply are not. They can go back to whatever backwards society they came from, that imposes those same ""values"". Another issue is that the Islamic community, while working against extremism, is still partially to blame as a whole. There is no way to get away from that. For proof, I point to the huge numbers of Hindus in the UK who are not threatening to blow up buses, or decaptitating soldiers in broad daylight, or the vast Kosovan/Albanian population in Switzerland who are not threatning Djihad, or any other real minority. This is a problem that is nearly entirely reserved to the Islamic community. Something is failing, and people have had enough.

And all this coming from a man who knows, and is friends with loads of Muslims. However, they are people who have integrated into Western society, and espoused our values, while keeping their own cultural heritage alive. The issue is with those extremists who spit in our faces, despise us because we don't share their hatred for all non-believers, but also with those in the Islamic community who defend them through inaction and silence. They can fuck right off, back to whatever hell-hole they crawled out of. 

If they don't like our system of law; guess what, it is a fundamental right that everyone be treated equally in the eyes of the law. Not happy with that? Fuck off. Want to be able to impose your misogynistic ways onto us? Fuck off. (Note: I'm not saying that all Muslims are misogynistic: just that the extremists are). Threaten us with violence? Fuck off.

Being European is more than just living here: It's having certain fundamental, core values that we all share, and that we share with our American friends, and Aussies, and many others.

KSinz,,,"Wrote this once already, but everyone should check out the Frontline special on Putin. With more context this seems like something they would do. Does it mean they did it for sure? No, but if there's a pattern then maybe it warrants a closer looks:

Before Putin came into power he had to be elected. Now the problem with this is the timing. At the time he was really more of a nobody and had corruption charges against him and Anatoly Sobchak, the guy who was actually running the show at that point. Putin showed that he had loyalty to Sobchak throughout the charges and was then looked at by Yeltsin and promoted to head of Federal Security Services as a stepping stone into power once Yeltsin left. Still, was pretty much an unknown rising to power because of his connections and loyalty. So he runs for president and it looks like he will most likely not win. Then there are a series of bombings of residential apartments in Russia. Putin blames Chechnya and from his post as FSS goes about with a plan to strike back and rallies support from the people and eventually gains the popularity to win all while the elections are delayed. Can't have elections while the bombings are happening, so Yeltsin delayed them. Now one other part to mention that draws us back to where we are now with this specific case, one bomb didn't go off. After the investigation it was shown this bomb was similar in size and placement to the other bombs. In addition, it was military grade explosives and linked back to the FSS. You know the department that Putin ran? He said it was a training exercise and he was not responsible for the other bombings, but rather Chechnya was even though there was no evidence of this.

Mr_honesty_,,,"As a kurdish man I feel offended by this. 
 
The Kurdish army (Peshmerga) were the first ones to act and America aided them with guns and troops and Germany aided also in weapons.  40 countries signed a pact of ""bombing"" ISIS to the ground. 
 
The Iraqi army is cowering behind the Kurdish army and the American army. 
 
WE Kurds have been allies to America long long ago even before sadam hoessein. 

The Iraqi government is giving weapons to iraqi people who want to fight and.get trained by the American ""ADVISORS"" but what do they do? They never come back when they receive their guns and go back home and protect their own ass at home instead of fighting the shit head goat fuckers ISIS. 
 
I find this very offensive towards the Kurds.
 
The Peshmerga are keeping our own region calm and peaceful and always have fought every sources that wanted to attack our region.
 
I'm happy that the Americans are so helpful and always have been. 
The France and Germans have also added the Kurds very well.
 
Let them all have their own talk in London the Peshmerga and the American troops will fight further to keep the filth out of the world.
 
Let the hatred flow 
 
 Edit: I've read almost every comment in this full thread about this article on the Kurdish website.
 
And let me thank you all from the bottom of my heart for all the support. 
 
I understand it completely and can accept it also fully why we Kurds weren't invited. 
 
First: we still aren't an official country. 

Second:  the Turks would be totally pissed off by this of course. 
 
 Third: I know this is a meeting to convince other countries to help arm the Kurds and aid them in destroying ISIS.
 
And one more thing.
 
We Kurds have been let down more than once by so many allied country's... 
 
America Is the biggest allie of the Kurds.
They aided us in destroying the sadam empire and we were promised independence but nothing happened not even the troops that were promised. 
 
But that didn't stop us and that's just ONE example but the Americans are still and always will be the best friends and allies with us Kurds. 
 
We are grateful for every aid we have gotten and wil get and are getting.

Omaestre,,,"I feel the need to point this out due to the many people claiming security was lacking, and generally posting misinformation

I am immensely proud of the work the police has done. We are not a country that is used to violent crime at all, and there has been no precedent attack that is comparable.

Despite this, our police officers managed to not only defend the public, and stop the attackers plans from succeeding. 

They were on site and present when the terrorist attacked the free speech debate, and as a result the attacker could not even reach his target. 
Later they again were already present at the Jewish synagogue and prevented the madman from even setting foot inside. Finally they also within 24 hours identified the attacker's whereabouts and killed him.

They did this without  causing panic despite our media's best attempts to illicit it. They protected us not only with their weapons but also with their bodies, as at least 5 officers have been injured. 

Two victims Dan Uzan and Finn Nørgaard have died, and while their deaths were tragic and senseless, I know that it would have been much worse had our officers not been as fast. The  police still managed to protect at least 80 people, at the synagogue and the debate meeting and stopped the terrorist from achieving any of his goals.

Seeing some of the nonsense being written here that the Synagogue was unprotected and had to fend for itself, and other unfounded claims is simply frustrating.  If any of it was true, we would have had several more victims to mourn.

Thanks for liking my little list and I highly recommend digging down a bit in the comments. Some wonderful teachers showed up and offered some fine corrections. Below is my unedited comment.* 

**Well, maybe we can start talking about how this is not a new mistake? Eisenhower and Iran, a timeline of the consequences.**

*     Standard Oil agrees to split oil revenue with Saudi Arabia on a 50/50 basis in 1950.
*     Iran tells the UK that the existing 5% royalties for their oil just isn't going to cut it. They want half the money, too.
*     UK says fuck you to Iran. Secretly asks US for ""help."" Truman says no.
*     UK imposes sanctions against Iran--cutting off their own oil supply. The UK has to switch back to coal for electricity. The ""London Fog"" air pollution episode of 1952 kills 4,000 UK citizens.
*     UK secretly asks US for ""help"" and uses the word communism. Eisenhower says yes.
*     US CIA overthrows Iranian government. Installs puppet: The Shah in 1953
*     Iran gets 50% revenue anyway.
*     Shah is a vicious dictator for 30 years while the people of Iran learn that the CIA did the deed that took their democratically elected government from them.
*     Shah finally overthrown in 1979... by **an Islamist Theocracy. Religion was the only speech not censored by Shah--so it was his only organized opposition. Again, Religion was the only organized opposition.**
*     US Hostage Crisis 1979-1980.
*     Saudi king promotes conservative non-tolerant version of Islam as a response to Iran. Wahhabism was the family religion but now it is the national religion.
*     In 1979, the Russians invade Afghanistan--partly because they want to build an oil pipeline.
*     Saudi Wahhabist doctrine includes the idea of Jihad--and they try it out in Afghanistan.
*     US gives weapons to Saddam. Iran-Iraq war, 1980s.
*     US gives weapons to Saudi Jihadis in Afghanistan. Defeat Russians in 1989.
*     Saddam uses US weapons to invade Kuwait 1990. First gulf war. US installs military bases in Saudi Arabia and doesn't leave at war's end. The Islamists view the US bases as occupation. Jihad anyone?
*     US becomes target of Jihadis with WTC bombing of 1993.
*     US is still target of Jihadis in 1998. USS Cole and Kenyan embassy bombings.
*     911 ... and you probably know the rest.

History is not so different from people--if you watch what countries do, you can ignore what they say.

tl;dr Eisenhower was vaguely interested in opposing communism and inadvertently sparked the Islamist movement. Religion is the only answer that possibly believes it can defeat the undefeatable US military force. Religion as the basis of governing in the 21st century is approximately insane--but it's the only actual choice. Mossedegh PROVED that oil producers can't expect modern highly evolved diplomacy to be in good faith. Any answer other than faith-based is completely irrational because... you know you will lose. The US/UK proved our willingness to harm--and we prove it to this day. [Mossedegh](http://guardianlv.com/2013/11/mossadegh-the-iranian-president-who-changed-the-world/).

........

Additional reading for the curious... (note: I am barely an amateur historian but I do like to read. Ask at/r/AskHistorians if you want the real deal) Strong recommend that you watch what politicians DO, not what they SAY. There is a fairly strong case that both World Wars were partially about that strange strategic resource: oil. As WWI started, Germany and Turkey (Ottoman Empire) agreed to build a railway to transport... oil. The UK had already begun shipping oil on ships.

* Winston Churchill. In 1911 he served as the UK's [First Lord of the Admiralty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill#First_Lord_of_the_Admiralty). His agenda? Convert the UK Navy from Coal to Oil. Single-handedly, he convinced the UK body politic that oil was a strategic material and worthy of military intervention. He was very instrumental in the signing of the first UK/Iran oil contracts. One of the first military orders of WWI was simple: ""Protect Baghdad."" Most of the weirdness of 20th century middle east politics traces right back to Churchill. When he said ""Never Ever Ever give up.""--I think he meant oil.
* Theodore Roosevelt. [Also a Navy man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt#Assistant_Secretary_of_the_Navy) and specifically the guy who arranged for the US to begin 'projecting power' overseas. During his presidency he invented what came to be known as the 'American Century' by strongly advocating for the near imperialism that the US is so often criticized about today. Sadly, it was normal in those times for racist ideology to drive policy. The Philippines were occupied because the people were considered too childish for self governance. Roosevelt launched a world tour of the US Navy to show off our military prowess: ""The Great White Fleet.""
* Kermit Roosevelt. Grandson of Theodore. He is the man who [orchestrated the Iranian coup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kermit_Roosevelt,_Jr.) and pretended there were communists. He lied.

vivasalt,,,"ISIS and the Jordanian Pilot situation explained: 
From a jordanian point of view... 

ISIS the barbarian fucks captured Jordanian Pilot Muath Al-Kasasbeh a 26 years old newly married pilot who joined the allied countries in bombing ISIS rats in Syria and Iraq. 

How did it happen?
His F-16 had a technical incident and he was forced to lower his plane altitude which puts him in the range of RPG and basic anti- aircraft weapons that ISIS Owns... they shot the aircraft down and he ejected from it and was captured by them. 

Now, Pilot Muath is a practicing Muslim, and in islam it is forbidden to kill Muslims (or prisoners btw). 

After ISIS got him, the leaders inside Isis had a heated argument about what they should do to him. some said he should be executed and some said he should stay alive. 

the Jordanian part started an operations base aimed for negotiating with ISIS fucks for getting the pilot back alive...

THE CONFUSION: 

 ISIS is related to al Qaeda... and al Qaeda did a number of terrorist attacks in Jordan. 
since we Jordanians live in the center of a very fucked up world.. we are pretty impressed by our police and cia that they can control Jordan this much.. 
otherwise, we would be another ISIS ruled area or at best terrorist training area. 

in 2005 3 lunatics did a suicidal bombing on 2 hotels causing 60 deaths. 2 out of the 3 fucks did the job and killed themselves along with a dozen of innocent people. 
the third one, known as Sajeda Al-Renshaw, failed to do the job and fled to Al-Salt in which she was captured days after. 

Who is Sajedah: 

Sajedah is the wife of one of the stupid fucks who did the suicidal thing at the hotels, her mission was to detonate herself IN A FUCKING WEDDING alongside her husband. 
her explosives did not work and so she tried to escape. 

Why do they want her? 
because her husband was the right arm of al-Zarqawi which is a former leader of al-Qaeda. 
that means that she knows Al-baghdadi the current ISIS leader personally! 

She was sentenced to execution, but since Jordan stopped executions for being a part of the human right thing... so she was sentenced to stay in prison for a lifetime. 

ISIS Fucks VS. Jordan: 

the Jordanian king is the direct and closest descent of Prophet Muhammed... but he is open to different world views, good ally to U.S and not much of a religious man. 
He is really humble and cool king, he is a big fan of star wars, he once pranked [Russell Peters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUXsw3n_iCA)  and he sometimes disguise in some old man costume and go around checking the situation inside Jordanian governmental organization.


Now, Jordan is in a very critical position geographically speaking.
Everywhere around us is basically going nuts with terrorism... and Jordan is a very poor country, we have no Oil production and one of the poorest countries with water supplies, mostly desert and not much green areas. 

this would make you think of Jordan as something like a dessert full of camels and stuff... No. 
We have 36 worldwide recognized universities. almost everyone in the capital speaks at least 2 languages and we are a very educated population... no one dies of hunger or thirst in Jordan and in general we are holding strong. 

The economy of Jordan relies on Tourism... so we have to provide a safe environment and good relations with everyone. 

ISIS don't really like that and some extremists in Jordan agrees with them.. so they are trying to create some mess in Jordan, luckily we have a very well-trained army and police forces... and they are able to maintain safety of this country. 
IN-SHORT: Jordan is pretty fuckin safe now, don't worry. 

The Hero Muath Al-Kasasbeh: 

Muath was killed with the most brutal barbaric way, those fucks had put him in a cage and burned him alive while watching and filming the whole thing... I personally watched the video and really wish I did not... I don't advise anyone to watch it. 

Now, me and every other Jordanian wants to fight ISIS rats RIGHT FUCKIN NOW, you have no idea the volume of anger going on the streets of Jordan now. 

I think that what the government did in executing the two nutjobs was right, and I think the Jordanian army should respond with utmost brutality to such terrorist.. they don't understand humanity..

I hope I explained it well!

&gt;Google took almost three years to disclose to the open information group WikiLeaks that it had handed over emails and other digital data belonging to three of its staffers to the US government, **under a secret search warrant issued by a federal judge**.

It came from the government. ANY COMPANY would comply when the Feds come to your business with a warrant by a judge. 

Additionally, because it was ""under a secret search warrant"" we dont know the full details. What if the UK government had asked for this? Or agreed to this?

Fascist_Pink,,,"Allow me to repost something which I've been passing around the various Russia threads:

&gt; ... it is undeniable that Russian provocateurs and regular forces are active within the Ukraine. 
&gt; 
Before we even go into hard evidence, specifics, it should be self evident; for one, the man at the heart of the separatist movement -- Igor Girkin, alias ""Strelkov"" -- was, of his own admission, in the employment of the Russian FSB until 2013. From [this article](http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/russias-igor-strelkov-i-am-responsible-for-war-in-eastern-ukraine/511584.html), we have the magnificent quote: *""If our unit hadn't crossed the border, in the end everything would have fizzled out, like in Kharkiv, like in Odessa.""* And that was on /r/worldnews' front page only days ago!
&gt; 
Secondly, there's the fact that [Russia denied it was involved in Ukraine](http://en.ria.ru/russia/20140304/188087074/Putin-Denies-Sending-Russian-Troops-to-Crimea.html), only for Putin to later [confess *""Of course our troops stood behind Crimea's self-defence forces*
""](http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/04/17/russia-putin-crimea-idUKL6N0N921H20140417). Russia's word is fundamentally untrustworthy. 
&gt; 
[Rebel leader Alexander Zakharchenko has also attested that 1,200 of his fighters spent 4 months training in Russia](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-28817347). So even if Russia is not directly involved, we have it from the rebel's own lips that they are training and arming them. 
&gt; 
Does anybody remember the ten Russian paratroops (VDV) which apparently entered the Ukraine by mistake, and were apprehended? [Here's the link](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-28934213). The thing is, those paratroops belonged to the 98th Guards Airborne Division. Of the 98th Airborne, you have the 331st and 1065th regiments. Both are based out of Kostroma. Coincidentally, in [this article](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/29/us-ukraine-crisis-prisoners-idUSKCN0HO1MP20140929) you have two Ukrainian soldiers, belonging to separate units, both attesting they had fought Russian VDV out of Kostroma. 
&gt; 
On the subject of the VDV, [we then have the captured APC's with the documents of Russian paratroopers, paratroopers of the Pskov division's No. 74268 Brigade](http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/ukraine-gets-new-evidence-of-russian-soldiers-fighting-on-its-turf-photos-361543.html).
&gt; 
A basic understanding of the timeline of the content also demonstrates Russian involvement. Before the *massive* [Russian humanitarian convoy in August](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2014/08/russia-aid-convoy-moving-into-ukraine-201482282413556411.html), the Ukrainian army were on a veritable blitz, [ capturing a number of towns including Pervomaisk, Kalynove and Komyshuvakha](http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/218108.html), [tightening the noose around Donetsk](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-28724487) and [reclaiming much of Luhansk](http://news.yahoo.com/fighting-outside-key-ukrainian-city-kills-9-troops-091723576.html). Then, out of nowhere, a counteroffensive turns the tide. The rebels [capture Novoazovsk](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-28951319), and suddenly they're on the [doorstep of Mariupol](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/04/russia-rebels-ceasefire-approaches-ukraine).  That is not coincidental. 
&gt; 
Now let's dig into hard evidence. 
&gt; 
[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkRtOSk1tps) we have a handy camcorder video, from our friends the Separatists. They claim, as in the title, that's a T-72M; a common piece of Soviet surplus which the Ukrainian Army has never operated. They also claim to have captured it from the UA. Weird, huh? Despite that, there's another problem; that's not a T-72M. It's a T-72B3 -- a modernized variant of the T-72 which is operated exclusively by the Russian Federation, and is immediately distinguishable by its French *Thales* night-vision and reactive armour. The video gives a nice close up of those distinguishing features. 
&gt; 
On the subject of T-72B3's, we have [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKpsybu-x64) footage of another T-72, with a convoy of MT-LB's. It's clearly a modernized variant, as you can see from its reactive armour, though a definite identification is difficult. 
&gt; 
[More](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iWDkn-6mak) T-72's. Again, it's hard to tell what variants they are, but one wonders where they're getting so many T-72's when the modern UA pretty much exclusively operates T-64's. 
&gt; 
[Here we have a T-72BM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL-yofb3HzU), happily driving alongside an MT-LB Strela 10M and a BTR-ZD ""Skrezhet"" -- which is flying the flag of the Sevastopol Naval Infantry. That video was filmed outside Luhansk, and the International Institute for Strategic Studies [does not think it is a hoax](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-28961080). 
&gt; 
[Here](http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=2e1_1415920466), you have an interesting case of deja vu. The same MSTA-S, identified from Youtube videos, has been seen in Russia and Ukraine. It's worthy to note that those numbers are actually shorthand for ""oversized cargo"". 
&gt; 
Whilst people may suspect the [NATO satellite images](http://www.businessinsider.com.au/nato-satellite-photo-evidence-russia-lying-about-ukraine-2014-8), they corroborate what we've been seeing so far. 

&gt; And more:

&gt; I'd also like to bring up the fact that we have *video evidence*, actual footage, of these Russian convoys. Columns of Kamaz trucks which stretch out literally for miles.

&gt; [Here](http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=056_1409727656) we have a convoy of BMP's, Kamaz trucks and T-72's. Roughly 150 vehicles in all.

&gt; [Here](http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=056_1409727656) we have a UAZ, a T-72 and a 2S1 Gvozdika in Donetsk Oblast. 

&gt; [Wonder where these rebels are getting hundreds of identical trucks?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq1iBchjVFk)

&gt; [More](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ladnBDs_Gg).

&gt; [More](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPlew6Ee118&amp;feature=youtu.be)

&gt; [Yet more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bgmxo7ImMQk#t=11)

&gt; Those videos are a pretty big step up from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodMqzF37ME), which is the sort of convoy you'd expect separatists to have. That was on the 28th of April. You've got a BTR, which they could have plausibly captured, as well as a civilian lorry and an anti-aircraft cannon towed by a bus.

&gt; And here we have a clueless Separatist operating a 12,7 KSVK rifle, which is exclusively operated by the Russian Federation:

Supposedly the bus went off road and tried to go around the checkpoint, unfortunately there was a mine perimeter around checkpoint and the bus triggered a mine.
Most likely reason as to why the bus tried to go around, Kiev is now requiring civilians to have an ATO pass that lets you travel between rebel and UA controlled areas.

Wagamaga,,,"""The towers are gone now, reduced to bloody rubble, along with all hopes for Peace in Our Time, in the United States or any other country. Make no mistake about it: We are At War now — with somebody — and we will stay At War with that mysterious Enemy for the rest of our lives.
It will be a Religious War, a sort of Christian Jihad, fueled by religious hatred and led by merciless fanatics on both sides. It will be guerilla warfare on a global scale, with no front lines and no identifiable enemy. Osama bin Laden may be a primitive “figurehead” — or even dead, for all we know — but whoever put those All-American jet planes loaded with All-American fuel into the Twin Towers and the Pentagon did it with chilling precision and accuracy. The second one was a dead-on bullseye. Straight into the middle of the skyscraper.
Nothing — even George Bush’s $350 billion “Star Wars” missile defense system — could have prevented Tuesday’s attack, and it cost next to nothing to pull off. Fewer than 20 unarmed Suicide soldiers from some apparently primitive country somewhere on the other side of the world took out the World Trade Center and half the Pentagon with three quick and costless strikes on one day. The efficiency of it was terrifying.
We are going to punish somebody for this attack, but just who or what will be blown to smithereens for it is hard to say. Maybe Afghanistan, maybe Pakistan or Iraq, or possibly all three at once. Who knows? Not even the Generals in what remains of the Pentagon or the New York papers calling for WAR seem to know who did it or where to look for them.
This is going to be a very expensive war, and Victory is not guaranteed — for anyone, and certainly not for anyone as baffled as George W. Bush. All he knows is that his father started the war a long time ago, and that he, the goofy child-President, has been chosen by Fate and the global Oil industry to finish it Now. He will declare a National Security Emergency and clamp down Hard on Everybody, no matter where they live or why.

And for his part, Seymour Hersh refuses to respond substantively: [“I Am Not Backing Off Anything I Said”](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/foreigners/2015/05/seymour_hersh_interview_on_his_bin_laden_story_the_new_yorker_journalism.html).

**Edit 05/13/2005**  I just read through Isaac Chotiner's [interview with Hersh](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/foreigners/2015/05/seymour_hersh_interview_on_his_bin_laden_story_the_new_yorker_journalism.2.html).  I'm not a psychiatrist, but Hersh sounds insane.  That's not hyperbole, he literally sounds like he's sitting on a park bench ranting.  If somebody's going to rescue Hersh's piece, it's going to have to be somebody other than Hersh himself.

&gt;Hersh: You want to write about this totally tedious shit? Yes, I am a huge pain in the ass. I am the one that decided to publish it wherever the hell I please. That’s the story. You want to listen to hall gossip about me? Go ahead. [Sarcastic voice] It is so immensely important to so many people to know where I published. I can’t believe it.

&gt;Chotiner: Can I tell you why?

&gt;Hersh: I don’t want to hear why. You think there is a different standard in London?

&gt;Chotiner: I wish you would listen.

&gt;Hersh: All right, maybe I will listen, but I gotta hang up.

&gt;Chotiner: If people here are turning down stories because of certain politics—you yourself said it was easier in Europe—that is a story that should be written.

&gt;Hersh: Now you said the first intelligent thing you have said. If you had asked whether he didn’t run this because he is in love with Obama and all that stuff that people think, no … It is a very good question. Although we have huge disagreements. My children and I have huge disagreements. I have a huge disagreement with my dog. We have a lot of disagreements and there are times when he will call me and I will not answer the call. Oh fuck hold on. He always has said to me he welcomes any information and it was I who said fuck it.

Some skeptical background on Hersh's other recent exposes:

James Kirchick: [The Deceits of Seymour Hersh](https://www.commentarymagazine.com/article/the-deceits-of-seymour-hersh/)

 Emmanuel Sivan: [Media consumers should heed the unwritten warning, ""Reader beware.""](http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/opinion/thus-are-reports-about-the-mideast-generated-1.223615)

Michael Calderone: [New Yorker, Washington Post Passed On Seymour Hersh Syria Report](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/08/seymour-hersh-syria-report_n_4409674.html)

**Update**  [NBC News](http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/pakistanis-knew-where-bin-laden-was-say-us-sources-n357306) has corroborated *part* of Hersh's story.  A very small part in which

&gt;two intelligence sources say that the year before the U.S. raid that killed Osama bin Laden, a ""walk in"" asset from Pakistani intelligence told the CIA where the most wanted man in the world was hiding - and these two sources plus a third say that the Pakistani government knew where bin Laden was hiding all along.

NBC News doesn't corroborate any of the more sensational aspects of Hersh's story such as that the entire raid was an elaborate hoax cooked up together by the Pakistanis and the U.S. or that U.S. forces met no resistance in the compound or that the Seal Team cut up parts of Bin Laden's body and dropped them over the Hindu Kush mountains. In fact, NBC News's sources reject those parts of Hersh's story outright:

&gt;Multiple U.S. officials, however, denied or cast doubt on the assertion that the U.S. told the Pakistanis about the bin Laden raid ahead of time.

So, in case you're keeping score at home, Seymour Hersh is still a nut who's been wrong dozens of times and there's no reason to believe the bulk of this story either.

RichardSaunders,,,"i always find it odd when the media releases the names of the accused *before* there's a conviction. if these guys are found guilty, then fine, give them a dishonorable discharge, prison, etc., but i dont think an *accusation* should be enough to justify ruining someone's name.

edit: some people have brought up the point that if you release the name, there might be more victims who come forward. that's a valid point but there has to be a balance between protecting the rights and privacy of the accused (who might actually be innocent), and making it possible to collect enough evidence to convict a guilty person. in this case i think its unfair that some one becomes a pariah and basically has their life ruined (nobody wants to hire the accused rapist/drunk driver/etc. they saw on TV, much less put them in a customer-facing position) before they even stand trial.

edit 2: i agree *some one* should be notified so that people dont end up standing trial in secret, but you can notify the accused's family without releasing their mugshots to tabloids.

edit 3: and in response to some comments, before the conversation devolves into a feminist vs MRA shouting match, i want to make it clear it's not my intention to make this a gender issue. my point is that in general, regardless of the crime (for example drunk driving accusations can also ruin your reputation), regardless of anybody's gender (men get raped too), the names of the accused shouldnt be released until/unless theyre convicted.",1429442921,,1429462641,1,645,worldnews,True,False,257,0,Morning,61+,2,14,"{u'probability': {u'neg': 0.7281240190078992, u'neutral': 0.13857901001617698, u'pos': 0.2718759809921008}, u'label': u'neg'}",0.728124019008,0.271875980992,0.138579010016,neg,"{u'tone_categories': [{u'category_id': u'emotion_tone', u'tones': [{u'tone_name': u'Anger', u'score': 0.448533, u'tone_id': u'anger'}, {u'tone_name': u'Disgust', u'score': 0.470564, u'tone_id': u'disgust'}, {u'tone_name': u'Fear', u'score': 0.118392, u'tone_id': u'fear'}, {u'tone_name': u'Joy', u'score': 0.042869, u'tone_id': u'joy'}, {u'tone_name': u'Sadness', u'score': 0.437967, u'tone_id': u'sadness'}], u'category_name': u'Emotion Tone'}, {u'category_id': u'language_tone', u'tones': [{u'tone_name': u'Analytical', u'score': 0.896923, u'tone_id': u'analytical'}, {u'tone_name': u'Confident', u'score': 0.0, u'tone_id': u'confident'}, {u'tone_name': u'Tentative', u'score': 0.574758, u'tone_id': u'tentative'}], u'category_name': u'Language Tone'}, {u'category_id': u'social_tone', u'tones': [{u'tone_name': u'Openness', u'score': 0.82883, u'tone_id': u'openness_big5'}, {u'tone_name': u'Conscientiousness', u'score': 0.016581, u'tone_id': u'conscientiousness_big5'}, {u'tone_name': u'Extraversion', u'score': 0.141834, u'tone_id': u'extraversion_big5'}, {u'tone_name': u'Agreeableness', u'score': 0.185217, u'tone_id': u'agreeableness_big5'}, {u'tone_name': u'Emotional Range', u'score': 0.368957, u'tone_id': u'emotional_range_big5'}], u'category_name': u'Social Tone'}]}",0.448533,0.470564,0.118392,0.042869,0.437967,0.896923,0.0,0.574758,0.82883,0.016581,0.141834,0.185217,0.368957

**Note:** For anyone interested, I'll be doing an AMA on /r/casualiama on the 1st of April - No joke, it's my cake day!
****

**What you need to know**

* **Magnitude:** **Now a 7.5**. 7.6 originally, however it has been upgraded to a 7.7 event.

* **Depth:** Originally sitting at 33km, it's now been updated to 65.7km. This is a moderately deep quake, although the quake is still quite large so locally there will have been a lot of stronger shaking.

* **Intensity of the Shaking:** Currently sitting at Mercalli scale VII (Very strong), with an estimated 26,000 people in Kokopo, the closest major city to the epicentre. 

* **Expected Fatalities:** The USGS pager system currently shows the following:



Estimated Fatalities | Probability
--------------------|-----------
No Fatalities | 65%
1-10 Fatalities | 30%
10-100 Fatalities | 4%
100+ | 1%

* **Estimated Economic losses:** Again the USGS shows the following via their pager system. 



Estimated Economic Losses (USD) | Probability
-------------------------------|-----------
Under $1 million | 68%
Between $1-10 million | 30%
Between $10-100 million | 2%

* **Tsunami warning:** There is currently a localised tsunami warning in place, with a possible 1-3 metre tsunami around the Papa New Guinea coastline. At most, a 30 centimetre 'tsunami' could be expected around other coastlines (Japan, Australia, NZ, Hawaii and other pacific islands), however that is also likely to die out.

Ago_Solvo,,,"It's probably 1 in 4 Americans.  Let me tell all you nuts a story before you jump all over Germany like you are.  In 2005 I was in Fallujah.  I came home back to my reserve unit in Brooklyn New York.  We went to the Tunnels to Towers run, a bunch of people from our unit all did, to run together as a unit.  Before the run began, we had plenty of key speakers, mostly all Democrats, currently serving at the time.  For the most ""liberal"" city in the nation, I've never heard so much Islamaphobia in my entire fucking life, being a Marine who had just served in Iraq, it actually fucking disgusted me.  This is why.  One of the last people to speak, was the creator of the Guardian Angels.  As he bashed Muslims for 9/11, he eventually moved on to how we would kill all Muslims in their homes, the world over, women and children included, and finished his speech.  They fucking cheered.  There were easily well over 20 politicians there, all Democrats except for 2 Republicans, they even applauded, more than for anyone else.  He had the greatest response of any key speaker there.  A little history about me, my Grandfather was German, they came here to avoid what was happening in Germany when he was a child, and he went back to fight them in World War II.  But I'll tell you what, if you think that *we* here in America can't be just like the Nazis, you're fucking wrong, because I've already seen it, by the people who claim to be the furthest thing from them, the most fair and equal, which they obviously are not.  Don't go around judging others.  We're funding and arming ISIS, don't you people read the news?  We have admitted that we can't tell the difference between ""moderate"" rebels and ISIS, and that we are arming and training them with the CIA.  Israel announced publicly that they are ""cautiously"" arming ISIS, and they had just recently attacked Syrian targets with bombers to help ISIS.  Saudi Arabia and Turkey are both doing the same.  So all this anti-Muslim hatred, along with these Muslim extremists, is very much the fault of this country.  This deeply saddens me, I don't understand how you all ignore this, I don't understand how our country could be going in this direction.  I love all the people that say the military is all brainwashed, because in case any of you noticed, they have pointed out that the morale of the military is too low for another incursion anywhere.  Why?  It isn't because we don't want to fight bad guys, it's because we don't know who really are the bad guys anymore.  22 Veterans are killing themselves a day, and it isn't the horrors of war making them do it, it's their loss of faith in you.",1420151920,,False,1,131,worldnews,True,False,480,0,Afternoon,61+,5,15,"{u'probability': {u'neg': 0.6501363407683727, u'neutral': 0.18278122781970432, u'pos': 0.3498636592316273}, u'label': u'neg'}",0.650136340768,0.349863659232,0.18278122782,neg,"{u'tone_categories': [{u'category_id': u'emotion_tone', u'tones': [{u'tone_name': u'Anger', u'score': 0.130267, u'tone_id': u'anger'}, {u'tone_name': u'Disgust', u'score': 0.635567, u'tone_id': u'disgust'}, {u'tone_name': u'Fear', u'score': 0.412705, u'tone_id': u'fear'}, {u'tone_name': u'Joy', u'score': 0.134944, u'tone_id': u'joy'}, {u'tone_name': u'Sadness', u'score': 0.502311, u'tone_id': u'sadness'}], u'category_name': u'Emotion Tone'}, {u'category_id': u'language_tone', u'tones': [{u'tone_name': u'Analytical', u'score': 0.0, u'tone_id': u'analytical'}, {u'tone_name': u'Confident', u'score': 0.0, u'tone_id': u'confident'}, {u'tone_name': u'Tentative', u'score': 5.2e-05, u'tone_id': u'tentative'}], u'category_name': u'Language Tone'}, {u'category_id': u'social_tone', u'tones': [{u'tone_name': u'Openness', u'score': 0.679571, u'tone_id': u'openness_big5'}, {u'tone_name': u'Conscientiousness', u'score': 0.759165, u'tone_id': u'conscientiousness_big5'}, {u'tone_name': u'Extraversion', u'score': 0.515098, u'tone_id': u'extraversion_big5'}, {u'tone_name': u'Agreeableness', u'score': 0.500288, u'tone_id': u'agreeableness_big5'}, {u'tone_name': u'Emotional Range', u'score': 0.531683, u'tone_id': u'emotional_range_big5'}], u'category_name': u'Social Tone'}]}",0.130267,0.635567,0.412705,0.134944,0.502311,0.0,0.0,5.2e-05,0.679571,0.759165,0.515098,0.500288,0.531683

Ramy_,,,"I don't think people realize how anti-Jewish most of the Muslim world is.  Not anti-Israel or ""anti-Zionist"" but anti-Jewish.

I grew up Christian in Egypt.  The Muslims didn't like us and we didn't like the Muslims but we saw each other as humans with different religious beliefs.

We literally viewed Jews as Satan personified.  If some kid went missing ""it was the Jews"", if someone shoplifted some milk from the store ""it was the Jews"".  And it didn't matter when the next day we found it was some local kid who took it.  We never thought back to ""we shouldn't have blamed the Jews for that one"".  You call someone ""a Jew"" as an insult similar to the way kids in the West might call someone gay.  A Jew is literally the worst kind of thing you can imagine, like a cockroach or mosquito.

And that's the culture.  And that's how I grew up and that's in a Christian town in Egypt.  A country that is supposedly at peace with Israel.

I since moved to the US at 13.  I have quite a few Jewish friends, dated a Jewish girl for a while.  Given up on most of how I was raised including my religion (atheist/agnostic for what it's worth).

But people in the West literally have no idea.  I laugh when I hear people in the West say ""if Israel did X"" or ""if Israel did Y"" there would be peace.  Yeah right.

StJohnsFog,,,"I'm a pretty liberal person. Politically, when I lean to the right it tends to be about fiscal issues.

The more this happens, the more I begin to think about things in ways I haven't before. I can't imagine any neutral observer watching this happen time and time again, over and over, and continue to think that defending the all aspects of the religion is what needs to happen. Obviously everyone knows that these people represent only a small fraction of the group, but its becoming more and more clear that there are larger ideas and themes that simply don't mesh with western ideas as we know them.

So how do we change this peacefully? Is it possible? As I watch ISIS terrorize, and I watch these seemingly ""individual"" attacks occur more frequently... there is a common theme. There is a common denominator, and to ignore it is to willingly blind yourself. Extreme solutions (kick them out! Invade the middle east!) are just as extreme as the perpetrators and are not the Western way. However, political correctness, and continuing to protect and defend ideas that are at war with us, does nothing to fix the problem and move society past this mess.

I don't know what the answer is, but I know I'm not happy about what the current status quo is.

**EDIT:** To clarify, I am suggesting that there needs to be a way to differentiate between the incompatible ideas that these extremists are latching onto, and the generally good intentions and good people that make up the majority of Muslims in the West. It is unfair and unjust to suggest that these attackers are the norm. They are anything but. That said, most people bury their head in the sand or come to the defense of every facet of the religion simply because it is ""politically incorrect"" to begin to acknowledge that ""hey, some of these ideas aren't defensible"". 

What I'm saying, is that there are clearly ideas that are polluting a small portion of a major world religion, and these ideas are causing them to commit unthinkable crimes. It is irresponsible to not try to combat these ideas, in the same way that it is irresponsible to try and lump the entire religion in with these monsters.

flynavy88,,,"Egypt acknowledging they're bombing IS targets - and likely other Islamist targets in Libya - is a huge development.

Beware, long history post ahead. (I know this is highly simplified, but bear with me, it covers 60 years of history).

For people not familiar, Egypt has largely been considered the center of the Arab world for decades. Though its influence has waned a little in the last couple decades, as the oil rich Gulf countries took on a larger role in world affairs, Egypt's influence cannot be understated.

For one, Egypt is the most populous nation in the Arab world - its 80ish million people is more than double the next closest Arab nation, Algeria, and is roughly three times that of Saudi Arabia. Another is that a LOT of Arab culture flows through Egypt. It has one of the largest (if not largest) entertainment industries within the Arab world and although Arabic is spoken with variation throughout the Arab world, most everyone can understand Egyptian Arabic because of how much of this.

Most of all, Egypt has played a unique role at the heart of the modern Arab world. As a bit of a simplified history lesson, one has to go back to when Napoleon was defeated by the British in Egypt. The Muhammad Ali dynasty was founded which nominally swore fealty to the Ottoman Empire. Instead, however, it became a British protectorate and more or less became a British puppet from the 1800s on after after the British directly occupied Egypt in 1882, and became a full blown protectorate in 1914 when the Ottoman Empire declared itself on the side of the Central Powers. It would remain under British rule until 1952.

Now, what happened in 1952? Well in 1952, the Free Officers Movement, a military coup led by middle class junior officers, led the Revolution which overthrew and exiled the last ruler of the Ali dynasty. The Republic of Egypt was created and the British kicked out of Egypt.

Who was the leader of the Free Officers Movement? Gamal Abdel Nasser, a highly charismatic man who made pan-Arabism a major ideology of the Arab world throughout the 50s and 60s. Nasser and members of the Free Officers Movement espoused increased secularism and nationalism which angered the Muslim Brotherhood and Islamist groups in Egypt which helped overthrow the old King. As the new Constitution was created, which was very much focused on secularism and modernity, the Muslim Brotherhood was angered and street clashes erupted. 

A 1954 attempt on Nasser's life by a Muslim Brotherhood member was caught live on radio - in return, the leadership arrested and executed numerous Muslim Brotherhood leaders and banned the organization which remained banned until 2011.

Nasser's stature in the Arab world grew from this and grew even further in 1956, during the Suez Crisis, in which British, French, and Israeli troops were sent to the Suez Canal to prevent Egypt from nationalizing the canal and to overthrow Nasser. Militarily, the western coalition was quite successful. However, it suffered immense political backlash - both the US and USSR condemned their invasion and pressured them to withdraw. In fact, President Eisenhower went so far as to threaten the UK financial system - a sign many saw as the end of British world power and the ascent of American world power in the west.

It was a HUGE political victory for Nasser, who cemented his power in Egypt, and made him a huge hero in the Arab world. He had lived up to his reputation as an anti-imperialist, a champion of anti-European de-colonization, and a fighter of Israel. How far did it it reach? In fact, from 1958 to 1961, the United Arab Republic was declared which consisted of a political union between Egypt and Syria, with Nasser as its president.

His revolution in 1952 and his growth as a hero in the 1950s inspired many similar movements throughout the Arab world - in 1958, a similar group named the ""Free Officers"" overthrew and killed the last King of Iraq (a monarchy established by the British, no less). Those same organizers would later align themselves with the Baathists, of whom Saddam Hussein would help use and consolidate his power. Not surprisingly, he stylized himself as an Arab champion after Nasser.

Similarly, in 1963, a movement in Syria inspired by Nasser overthrew the secessionist government there and vowed to restore the United Arab Republic. That movement was led by the Baathists of Syria, of whom one of them was Hafez al Assad, who would later seize power and rule for decades and then pass on leadership of Syria to his son, the current President of Syria.

Similarly, in 1969, Muammar Gaddafi and a group of junior officers seized control of Libya and overthrew the King there (considered a puppet of Italy). 

All this time, of course, Nasser was trying to grow his pan-Arab movement to unite Arabs around the world against the divisions created by the imperial powers which had drawn up arbitrary borders on a map that divided the Arab world. To do so, he rallied the Arabs around the Palestinian cause. Indeed, Egypt was the primary military power that opposed Israel throughout the decades of the Arab-Israeli conflict.

Now, that certainly angered the Americans. More-so, the socialist-leaning Nasser received a lot of aid from the Soviet Union - which in turn put them even more at odds with the US. All of this made Nasser a hero amongst Arabs -- a big reason why many major cities in the Arab world has a Gamal Abdal Nasser street to this day - and a big reason why Egypt became a leader in the Arab world.

Where did things start to change? Well, Nasser died in 1970 from a sudden heart attack. His funeral drew an estimated 5 million to 7 million mourners and leaders from throughout the Arab world - it is rumored that Muammar Gaddafi even fainted twice.

His successor, President Anwar Sadat, would change a lot of things. For one, he began to sever ties with the Soviet Union, expelling Soviet military advisors in 1972 and reforming the Egyptian military. His offensive on Israel in 1973 during the Yom Kippur War ultimately failed militarily, but it came as such a shock and surprise to the Israelis -- and were the first major victories for the Arabs in the greater Arab-Israeli conflict -- that it was viewed as a huge success. It also gave Egypt the realization it could never defeat Israel militarily, however, and also shattered Israeli confidence in its invincibility. This became the impetus for both sides to begin discussing a peace treaty which culminated in the Camp David Accords of 1978, making Egypt the first Arab country to recognize Israel and returned the Sinai peninsula to Egypt.

This, however, sealed the end of the pan-Arab movement. In 1979, the Arab League suspended Egypt and move its headquarters out of Cairo. It would not come back until 1989. Furthermore, this unpopular move with Arabs around the world forced many to turn their attention to other Arab leadership -- countries like Saudi Arabia were quick to respond and espoused pan-Islam. After all, instead of ethnic unity trying to cross artificial borders, why not unite under common faith which no borders can stop?

President Sadat was assassinated in 1981 by Egyptian jihadists at a military parade who had a fatwa issued by a cleric later convicted of the 1993 WTC bombing. The assassins were tried, found guilty, and executed. Soon after, Vice President Mubarak would become President, a position he would hold for nearly 30 years until 2011.

As one can see, Egypt had played a huge role in the Arab world for decades. Though their allegiances shifted from the USSR to the US, they were a great example of the internal struggle facing Arab countries in the 20th century. Here was Egypt, a country with a secular and nationalist leadership, being challenged by a large segment of its poor rural society to which the Muslim Brotherhood and other Islamist groups appealed to greatly.

Here is Egypt, a country that lead pan-Arabism and then simultaneously killed it off. With a large population with many of those enraged at its peace treaty with Israel, many turned to Islamist leanings directly resulting in the assassination of President Sadat, as well as numerous terrorist acts throughout the 80s, 90s, and 2000's in Egypt.

And it's no surprise that when Mubarak was overthrown in 2011, the long-banned Muslim Brotherhood re-surfaced, and tried to undo all that had been done since Nasser and the secularist military came to power. Unlike other countries in the Arab Spring, however, the strength of the Egyptian military and how strongly it was entrenched in Egyptian society led to General Sisi and the military overthrowing Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood in a year and a restoration to the old way of doing things.

So why is this a huge deal? Because Egypt, though lambasted this past year for overthrowing the democratically elected Morsi, seems intent on once again fighting back at Islamist forces both internally and externally. Egypt hasn't had problems with fighting fellow Arabs - it sent more troops to fight Saddam in the 1991 Gulf War than France did. Indeed, it is this deep nationalism that allows Sisi to bomb Islamists on behalf of executed Egyptian Copts (Christians) -- that they being Egyptians means more than them being of the wrong religion.

And if Egypt can regain its position as a leader in the Arab world, it can set a huge example for other Arab countries in how it deals with extremists - for better or ill. Whether they become benevolent reforms or a return to the old brutality remains to be seen, but I can definitely guarantee that countries like Israel are breathing a sigh of relief that Sisi is in power and not Morsi.

Soltheron,,,"This is a surprise to no one except libertarians / conservatives.

This is literally the difference between actually understanding human motivation somewhat, or not. You can ask any psychologist or sociologist about this issue, and they will tell you: people enjoy working and being productive members of society. In fact, *not* feeling like a part of society is the strongest correlation you'll find with suicide; it's a fucking terrible feeling.

My country, Norway, has arguably the strongest social safety net *in the entire world*, yet our unemployment is *absurdly low*. If people aren't working in the US, you need to figure out why that is instead of dismissing people as lazy.

Beyond the point where people have enough to survive, [people are not motivated by money.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6XAPnuFjJc)

Heck, [money isn't correlated with happiness even a little bit](http://www.ted.com/playlists/4/what_makes_us_happy.html) (first video), beyond that point—unless you spend it on others.

And as for Norway being so terribly different: 

[The will is there to improve your system.](http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2012/07/connor-kilpatrick-its-hip-its-cool-its-libertarianism.html)

&gt; For almost two decades, roughly two-thirds of the American public have supported what we’d call a moderate European welfare state—putting the average U.S. citizen significantly to the left of the Democratic party, a center/center-right organization saddled, much to their dismay, with a perpetually-disappointed center-left constituency.

http://mediamatters.org/research/progmaj/

I don't think that Scandinavians are somehow much more awesome than Americans so much as I think that the US has a [really shitty political system](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7tWHJfhiyo) and a corrupt government. Also, the individualistic mentality that Americans historically have had is slowly dying out, which is very good for the country.

Most can at the very least agree that getting a single-payer healthcare system would be a huge step up.

As for Norway, let me clear up some arguments:

1) The oil argument is libertarian / conservative propaganda.

The social safety net here in Norway has historically been paid for by **high taxes**, not the Government Pension Fund (oil fund). If it were paid for by oil money, it wouldn't be sustainable in the least (the fund would be gone in a few short years).

It is against the rules to spend more than 4% of the fund per year; since it is an emergency fund, we take good care of it. Some years (like 2007), it's not touched at all and just grows.

It is a myth that it is simply oil money that lead to the success in Norway: sound fiscal policy, spread wealth, technology building, nationalization of the energy sector, high education, stable global region, close situation to the market, predictable and stable government, balanced mix between taxes and benefits...the list goes on.

**Sweden is also a very similar country to us, and they're doing just fine without the oil.**

2) Homogeneity is certainly helpful, but not anywhere near as important as racists claim. What's more important are factors that interact with and reinforce homogeneity across cultural borders: [equality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_inequality-adjusted_HDI) and [overall peace.](http://www.visionofhumanity.org/#/page/indexes/global-peace-index) These factors play off of each other along with homogeneity, but to claim that homogeneity is the sole cause or something is ignorant.

3) Size is a poor excuse. A higher population makes things more difficult but by no means impossible. Besides, you could easily make the comparison of the EU as a whole compared to the US in arguments such as universal healthcare, etc.

--------

I'll tackle another typical complaint:

&gt;This is very misleading, because most people on welfare are not counted as unemployed.

Yeah, the way unemployment is calculated won't include someone who's on welfare *and* isn't actively seeking employment.  It doesn't matter though, since Norway's labor market activity rate is at 66% while the US is at 63%, meaning even given the generous welfare benefits, more people choose to activate in the labor market in Norway than in the US.  South Korea spends almost nothing on welfare and their activity rate is 61%, while Sweden's is 64% (World Bank). 

The level of benefits really doesn't seem to be related to labor market activation.  Of course 20% of people in a Scandinavian state are going to be ""on welfare"" since welfare in those states is *universal*, not *means tested*.  That means if you are well off and have a kid, you get welfare.  If you are a student, you get welfare. If your industrial sector didn't get a cost of living increase in the last round of wage bargaining, you might be compensated by a cash benefit (this happens in more [corporatist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_corporatism) countries.)

Guess what?  *The US is the same way.*  The same thing happens as in all these other countries, but the US spends welfare money through the tax system as a subsidy instead of in cash benefits.  Have a kid in Norway? Get a check.  Have a kid in the US?  Get a tax credit. It's the exact same thing, only when it comes to tax based welfare everyone *thinks* they're not on welfare while only lazy people are, when in fact almost everyone in the US gets generous welfare support unless you are a single, income earning individual. 

It's the hidden welfare state, and it's really fucking inefficient.

EDIT : 

As it was the top comment I'm trying to hold somewhat of a live feed right now. I'm watching French TV (BFM + France 2 and some live streams). Therefore I apologize for the lack of source links, just trying to report what I hear. If you want you can follow the [reddit live feed](http://www.reddit.com/live/u7qtz12ybb74) or /u/Tarkan7 comment below mine who relates some infos with their source!

EDIT : 

+ Every media talks about him like he is yesterday's shooter so that seems 100% confirmed now. 

+ His identity hasn't been communicated yet (though the police identified him and he seems to be a member of the same organization than the Kouachi brothers). 

+ **at least 5 hostages is rumored** including women and kids, there seems to be 1 wounded too.

EDIT :

+ SHOTS HAPPENNED, **AT LEAST 2 DEATHS (it's just been denied by the Police as of right now (14:48 GMT +1))**, France 2 says. Looks to be confirmed by BFM TV.

EDIT : 

+ A PHOTO OF YESTERDAY'S SHOOTER HAS BEEN PUBLISHED. He was seen in a car yesterday after the shooting with a woman who may be his partner. Unsure if he's the hostage taker of the kosher shop right now, I'm a bit lost to be honest!

+ [**SEARCH WARRANT FOR 2 PEOPLE BELIEVED TO BE YESTERDAY'S SHOOTERS, MAN AND HIS WIFE/PARTNER**](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B66SsSzIMAAmnLC.jpg)

EDIT : The search warrant is more like the communication of their identity. 

+ It is confirmed that the man called **AMEDY COULIBALY** is the hostage taker of the kosher shop

+ Unsure if the woman's involved today too. She was only seen with him in a car yesterday after the shooting.

EDIT (14:48 PARIS TIME, GMT+1) : 

+ Police source says at least 6 hostages, no deaths confirmed according to Le Monde.

EDIT (14:54) : 

+ The hostage taker came right before the Kosher shop closed, before shabbat, worst timing for the jewish people so this could hint at a somewhat planned attack...

+ Unsure if the woman HAYAT BOUMEDDIENE is with him in the shop, she appears to have been with him when the first shots happened at around 13:00 in front of the supermarket.

EDIT (15:00) : 

+ A woman can be seen from outside laying on the ground, wounded but still alive. 

+ BFM TV said another person is hiding in the cold chamber inside the supermarket right now.

+ The shooter openned fired right when he entered the supermarket so there seems to be casualties but nothing confirmed

EDIT (15:21) : 

Not much more happening right now. 

+ It's unclear if this hostage taker is in contact with the terrorists responsible for the Charlie Hebdo attack right now. 

+ Police aren't in contact with the hostage taker.

+ Another info that I didn't specify is that he has got at least two AK47s as weapons.

EDIT (15:25) : ~~Two unrelated events : Armed man apparently seen near the Place du Trocadero in PARIS, all the perimeter + subway was closed but seems to reopen so looks like a false alarm. Another armed man apparently seen near ROUEN, another city close to Paris where the Kouachi brothers come from. Very little info about this right now, probably bullshit!~~ (confirmed false alarm by the Minister of Interior). 

EDIT (15:51) : 

+ The hostage taker apparently said that he will kill the hostages if the police don't let the 2 brothers responsible for the Charlie Hebdo attack escape.

+ If you don't follow it [here's the thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2ru9y0/charlie_hebdo_hunt_shots_fired_as_police_chase/) about the other hostage situation happenning right now in a print company in Dammartin-en-Goele, North of Paris.

+ Crisis meeting still underway at the Elysee with the president.

EDIT (16:08) : 

+ A fellow inmate of the hostage taker has contacted the police and is now on the spot. He proposed his help to maybe initiate contact with the hostage taker. 

+ His lawyer of 10 years has also arrived. 

+ No confirmed negotiations or contact established.

EDIT (16:37) : 

+ Things seem on standby right now as both hostage situations are linked and police is hesitant to do anything.

+ Nearby schools and buildings are evacuated

+ TV channels have stopped to live stream in order to hide possible infos to the hostage takers.

+ We know nothing about potential contacts between the police and hostage takers. We only suppose that the 2 hostage situations are in contact with eachother.

+ It looks like we're entering a ""waiting phase"" that coud last hours (The last hostage situation in France in 2012 lasted more than 30 hours before the assault was given).

EDIT (16:56) : 

+ **LOTS OF GUNFIRE AND EXPLOSIONS HEARD AT THE OTHER HOSTAGE SITUATION AT DAMMARTIN, MORE NEWS TO COME**

+ No more doubt the assault has been given by the GIGN at Dammartin. 

+ It's been going on for 2-3 minutes and it's now over. Initial shots were followed by a short pause, gunfire again, another pause and a final gunfire session. Smoke rising from the building can also be seen.

+ An emergency helicopter has arrived. The assault is over so the two terrorists are surely dead/captured. No info available right now

EDIT (17:09) : 

+ Waiting for more news about the consequences of the Dammartin assault which is now over

+ We can highly suspect that an assault has simultaneously been given at the Kosher shop Porte de Vincennes, ZERO info about it though.

(17:15) ASSAULT ALSO GIVEN AT THE KOSHER SHOP Porte de Vincenne a couple of minutes after the one at Dammartin.

+ About 50gunfire/explosions heard
+ Around 10 Hostages seen escaping!
+ Policemen from the RAID appear to be wounded
+ ""Ils l'ont eu, ils l'ont eu!"" = ""They got him! They got him"" AMEDY COULIBALY apparently dead/captured. So both assaults are now over.

We're waiting more information as for now regarding potential casualties/wounded

(17:20) **THIS WILL BE THE FINAL EDIT AS ASSAULTS ARE OVER AT BOTH HOSTAGE SITUATIONS**

**FINAL DAMARTIN HOSTAGE SITUATION** **:** 

+ BOTH TERRORISTS DEAD
+ THE HOSTAGE IS SAFE!
+ 1 policeman injured

It seems like the two brothers went out of the building and faced the police in a desperate attempt.

mistervanilla,,,"I suppose this is one of those cultural anachronisms that is **really** hard to explain. However, before everyone's takeaway is that there is a large subversive nazi element in dutch football, let me attempt to give a little context.

First off, it is important to note that fans of the dutch football club Ajax call themselves ""Joden"" aka Jews. This is because the club comes from Amsterdam and historically speaking Amsterdam has had a large jewish community, more so than other cities in the Netherlands. Most likely, this label originated from a period before the second world war, when anti-semitism in the Netherlands and Europe as a whole was more of an issue. However, Ajax supporters have long since taken the name upon themselves and now consider it a point of pride. They are ""Joden"" and proud of it. 

Now the problem arises when you notice that football chants are some of the most insulting things people can come up with. Dutch culture is already one of excessive bluntness (compared to other cultures) and we casually use [swear words](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_profanity#Profanity_related_to_illness_and_disability) that would leave non-dutch people reeling. Combine this with mostly lower class and low educated 'hard core' supporters, you get some pretty nasty shit. A good example would be the semi-famous wife of a football player of Ajax, who was frequently called ""The whore of Amsterdam"" in similar chants. 

These two elements then intersect in the most unfortunate manner. Here we have a group that labels themselves as Jews, but having no actual relation to real life jewish people - and a culture and history of saying some of the nastiest shit out there. This combines into what any rational outside observer would perceive to be anti-semitism. However, it really is not, because the word Jew in this context has lost it's connection with the jewish people. In the same way that 'nigger' has completely different connotations depending on the context.

What it is, is making light of a terrible event in human history, it's juvenile, childish, hurtful, but at no point is it actual anti-semitism or nazism. That doesn't excuse it, that doesn't mean they should be chanting this, it just means that it isn't quite what it appears to be.",1428688903,,False,1,2184,worldnews,True,False,371,0,Afternoon,61+,3,7,"{u'probability': {u'neg': 0.45841801858302744, u'neutral': 0.16292147334023663, u'pos': 0.5415819814169726}, u'label': u'pos'}",0.458418018583,0.541581981417,0.16292147334,pos,"{u'tone_categories': [{u'category_id': u'emotion_tone', u'tones': [{u'tone_name': u'Anger', u'score': 0.152715, u'tone_id': u'anger'}, {u'tone_name': u'Disgust', u'score': 0.269259, u'tone_id': u'disgust'}, {u'tone_name': u'Fear', u'score': 0.123301, u'tone_id': u'fear'}, {u'tone_name': u'Joy', u'score': 0.152533, u'tone_id': u'joy'}, {u'tone_name': u'Sadness', u'score': 0.532204, u'tone_id': u'sadness'}], u'category_name': u'Emotion Tone'}, {u'category_id': u'language_tone', u'tones': [{u'tone_name': u'Analytical', u'score': 0.50252, u'tone_id': u'analytical'}, {u'tone_name': u'Confident', u'score': 0.0, u'tone_id': u'confident'}, {u'tone_name': u'Tentative', u'score': 0.802296, u'tone_id': u'tentative'}], u'category_name': u'Language Tone'}, {u'category_id': u'social_tone', u'tones': [{u'tone_name': u'Openness', u'score': 0.939621, u'tone_id': u'openness_big5'}, {u'tone_name': u'Conscientiousness', u'score': 0.00724, u'tone_id': u'conscientiousness_big5'}, {u'tone_name': u'Extraversion', u'score': 0.539921, u'tone_id': u'extraversion_big5'}, {u'tone_name': u'Agreeableness', u'score': 0.01143, u'tone_id': u'agreeableness_big5'}, {u'tone_name': u'Emotional Range', u'score': 0.292625, u'tone_id': u'emotional_range_big5'}], u'category_name': u'Social Tone'}]}",0.152715,0.269259,0.123301,0.152533,0.532204,0.50252,0.0,0.802296,0.939621,0.00724,0.539921,0.01143,0.292625

Yes, it's true that no one ethnic group in any nation can truly claim to have been there first. We all know the story of England, the britons, and the Anglo-Saxons.

But should the fact that everyone has immigrants in their family tree mean that people living in a certain country shouldn't be restrictive towards those that wish to move to that country?

In any country, and **especially** in homogeneous countries, there are various economic programs and support systems which are built upon the trust and the goodwill of the people. If a certain demographic ends up undermining and abusing those systems, is it really wrong to turn them away? 

Likewise, if a country stands for gender equality, and a group comes in which abuses and limits the freedom of its women, would it really be xenophobic to not allow that group to immigrate? 

I understand the skepticism that comes with Germans being anti-anyone, but I think the immigration debate can get too emotional. If we acknowledge the concept of a nation as an entity with borders that acts in the best interest of its people, then I think we should at least the possibility that restricting immigration is less a matter of hatred towards others, and more a matter of trying to preserve autonomy.

When the headline is something about a surge of radical Islam or ISIS latest terrors, the top comments are about how claims the USA is culpable for this extreme strand of terrorism ignore the history of the region, the nature of Islam and traditionally conservative readings of the Qu'ran, and what have you. You see, Islam traditionally has always been interpreted in a way that encourages violence against secular or multicultural societies. You see, Islam is incompatible with democracy because it requires strict adherence to Mohammed's dictated revelations from God. You see, we have a long history of military campaigns run by Muslims with no absolute goal but to subvert anything not Muslim.

When the headline talks about any relationship between the US invasion and the collapse of Iraqi civil society, well of course we had something or everything to do with it. I mean we did invade them after all and bomb them to shit and support dictators and train radicals and allow missionaries and fund operations. Of course this is a predictable consequence. You see, we supported the Saud theocracy, exacerbated Sunni-Shia relations and extremism in both, we supported dictators in Iran, Egypt, Iraq, Pakistan, and Afghanistan to name a few and constant intervening only to raise the economic level while social conditions decay encouraged a generation of individuals trapped in poverty and indoctrinated by rebels we armed and trained to go to the only source of stability, a coherent world view, and security.

Everybody says the final solution to this RELIGION problem is for the ONLY JEWISH country to “assimilate,” i.e., intermarry, with all those non-Jews.

What if I said there was this RELIGION problem and this RELIGION problem would be solved only if hundreds of millions of non-Buddhists were brought into EVERY Buddhist country and ONLY into Buddhist countries?

How long would it take anyone to realize I’m not talking about a RELIGION problem. I am talking about the Final solution to the BUDDHIST problem?

And how long would it take any sane Buddhist man to notice this and what kind of psycho Buddhist man wouldn’t object to this?
