Interestingly enough, this fact is presented by ONE GUY - a [Dr. C. George Boeree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._George_Boeree) - based off this [ONE PAGE](http://webspace.ship.edu/cgboer/race.html).

So I was like... well surely there must be somebody else also saying this - confirming that 2% of the world is actually naturally blond other than this one guy -so I started looking.

Every single source, over 2 dozen different websites - ALL QUOTE THIS *ONE* *PAGE* FROM THIS *ONE* *GUY*.

So who is this Dr. C. George Boeree guy to be such an authority?

&gt;C. George Boeree (born January 15, 1952) is an American psychologist and professor emeritus at Shippensburg University, specializing in personality theory and the history of psychology.

&gt;He is the author of the first online psychology texts,[1] which he made available at no cost to students and other interested parties starting in 1997. They have been translated into German,[2] Spanish,[3] Bulgarian,[4] and Indonesian.[5]

&gt;Boeree is also the inventor of the auxiliary language Lingua Franca Nova, introduced on the Internet in 1998.

So we have this ONE GUY who specializes in ""personality theory"" and the history of psychology, writer of the first online psychology textbook, and inventor of some strange ""auxiliary constructed language"" which I'm not even going to bother trying to to explain; POINT BEING - none of these things attribute strengths/history/study/reason to think he would be any kind of authority.

Now I'm not saying he's wrong, he could very well be in fact right. I just found it exceptionally strange that this information is based from ONE GUY who has no real past experience in said field to be considered an authority on the subject.

Misleading statistic is misleading. All you need is to apply some critical thinking and math.

Consider first, the overall applicant pool:

* There were [49,480 applicants to medical school](https://www.aamc.org/download/411780/data/enrollment2014.png) in 2014. 
* Of those, [20,343 enrolled](https://www.aamc.org/newsroom/newsreleases/411636/10282014.html). 
* That's about a 41 percent enrollment rate.

The black pool:

* Of those 49,480 candidates [only 3,990 were  black](https://www.aamc.org/newsroom/newsreleases/411636/10282014.html). That's about eight percent of the pool
* And out of that 3,390 applicants, only 1,412 enrolled. 
* That's about a 35 percent enrollment rate.

This means that: 

* Black applicants make up about 8 percent of the 49,480 pool. (3,990 divided into 49,480) 

* It also means that black applicants make up only 7 percent of the 20,343 applicants who actually enroll. (1,412 divided into 20,343).

* It also means that **over 65 percent of black applicants to medical school didn't get in.** (1,412 divided into 3990).

So why is the black acceptance rate so high compared to other groups?

Think of it this way.

Five black applicants apply to a medical school. Three get in. That's a 60 percent acceptance rate.

Compare this to twenty Asian American applicants who apply. If ten get in, there's a 50 percent acceptance rate. 

In this hypothetical there would be three black candidates and ten Asian ones (i.e. over twice as many). 

The acceptance rates don't tell you anything about an individual candidate's chances of acceptance, even if you know the total number of candidates. It suggests that either a group has a huge admission advantage, or that their number of applicants is so small compared to the rest of the pool, their admission rate looks much higher than everyone else's. Even though that doesn't bear out in absolute (or even relative) numbers.

And the latter is what happened here.

**TLDR:** Affirmative action didn't help black applicants here. The vast majority of black applicants didn't get into medical school. Black acceptance rates (at 35 percent) are still lower than the overall acceptance rate (~40 percent). Sources are included if you doubt the black guy.",1429572819,"","False",1,11,"todayilearned"
"battleship61","","","Wow.. utterly pathetic reddit. So many comments about how he was anti-semetic despite that being a bold face lie which has been propagated throughout the last 60 years. 

Here are the facts. 

- Art Babbitt (who is Jewish) who worked closely with, and **intensely** disliked Walt even said he saw no evidence of anti-semetism from Walt. 

- The legendary Sherman brothers (both Jewish) said they never saw any evidence of anti-semetism from Walt. 

- The legendary Joe Grant and Disney icon (Jewish) said that *""some of the most influential people at the studio were Jewish.""* and never saw any evidence of anti-semetism. 

- Walt often donated to many Jewish charities in his time

- Walt won the 1955 Man Of The Year from the B'nai B'rith chapter in Beverly Hills.

- Disney biographer Neal Gabler was given unprecedented, and unrestricted access to the Disney vault and files. He concluded that Walt was in fact not anti-semetic and rather suffered from poor public perception because of a few instances. 
 - He had invited German film maker and Nazi propagandist Leni Riefenstahl to Hollywood to promote her film Olympia without knowing her Nazi affiliation. He didn't retract the invitation once he found out which led to the rumours. 
 - Walt also got himself allied with a group called the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals, which was an anti-Communist and anti-semitic organization. Disney eventually distanced himself from the Motion Picture Alliance in the 1950s but was unable to expunge the reputation as anti-semetic because of it, despite the fact he had no time for such political meetings and was considered ""very apolitical"".

**He was not an anti-semetie** it's a rumour that persists because of uneducated sheep who hear a rumour and take it as gospel. Many of the most important and integral people at Disney studios were Jewish. Do you honestly think that if Walt was anti-semetic that he would A) Hire them, and B) If he were anti-semetic one of the many Jewish individuals there would have fucking said something? Babbitt pretty much hated Disney and vice versa, never accused him of anti-semetism. 

Get your facts straight Reddit. 


**EDIT**: Because people are demanding I provide sources to back what I'm saying. How ironic considering they'll believe he was an anti-semite without any sources.

Quote from Gablers book regarding what Joe Grant said
&gt; “Of the Jews who worked [with Disney], it was hard to find any who thought Walt was an anti-Semite,” Gabler reported. “Joe Grant, who had been an artist, the head of the model department, and the storyman responsible for Dumbo... **declared emphatically that Walt was not an anti-Semite.** ‘Some of the most influential people at the studio were Jewish,’ Grant recalled, thinking no doubt of himself, production manager Harry Tytle, and Kay Kamen [head of Disney’s merchandising arm], who once quipped that Disney's New York office had more Jews than the Book of Leviticus. **Maurice Rapf concurred that Walt was not anti-Semitic**; he was just a ‘very conservative guy.’”

"onoffabsurd","","","Yup. From a perspective of weight loss, fewer calories means fewer calories. One of the real problems with ""junk food"" is that these foods are very calorie-dense, and don't necessarily give your body the nutrients it needs. During a meal, your body mediates appetite based on volume, more than anything else. A large apple has ~90 calories. A single oreo has 45 calories by comparison. If you eat to satiety, then with a calorie-dense food like bacon or oreos, you will have consumed far more calories than if you were eating a food with low calorie density, like an apple or cucumber. Either way you feel full (or at least less hungry), but the difference is how you got there, whether your body has what it needs, and how many calories your intestine will absorb from that load of food. This is also why it's helpful to drink a glass of water before and/or during meals if you're trying to lose weight; the added volume makes you feel full earlier, and hopefully you stop eating sooner.

EDIT: Ok, I'm gonna expand on this a bit. There are three basic components to short-term satiation during and immediately after a meal. Mechanical signals, nutrient signals, and hormonal signals, in that order. The mechanical signals, carried on the vagus nerve, are mediated by stretch receptors in the stomach, [first documented in this article](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1365716/pdf/jphysiol01403-0067.pdf). This component of satiation is the fastest acting; it responds as soon as your stomach starts to fill with food/drink. The nutrient signals come next. They are based on blood concentrations of glucose, amino acids, and fatty acids; all that information is picked up by chemoceptors throughout your body and sent to your hypothalamus, described [here](http://physiologyonline.physiology.org/content/22/4/241). Chemoceptors in your mouth, stomach, and small intestine also interact with your hypothalamus to mediate hunger, but that signalling pathway is more oriented towards making sure that sufficient gastric acid and pancreatic enzymes are prepared to properly digest the food as it progresses through your GI tract. Finally, hormonal signals including insulin and cholecystekinin mediate hunger, but this a downstream effect that occurs after chyme reaches the duodenum, and these pathways don't respond as rapidly as the stretch receptors. These other mechanisms keep us from being able to substitute water for a meal, and make it hard to diet unless you have a balanced intake. The stretch receptor signalling is what makes it hard to stop eating at the appropriate time, and the reason that eating to satiety with calorie-dense foods (such as junk food) will make it hard to maintain a healthy weight. 

**tl;dr** [satiety](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunger_%28motivational_state%29#Short-term_regulation_of_hunger_and_food_intake) is complicated but stretch receptors in the stomach represent the first and strongest physiologic signal for fullness.

"Ofactorial","","","It's the result of food becoming cheaper and much more fattening over the last few decades. Turns out how tasty most people find a food is directly related to how much fat, salt, and sugar is in it, so economics is just giving people what they're programmed to want. And thanks to advancements in food technology, we can now churn out a lot more of it for a lot less money, so now everyone can stuff their faces with as much high-fat, high-sodium, high-sugar food as they want.

In neuroscience we have a name for this: ""super-stimuli"". It's a phenomenon where a stimulus manages to be so salient that it completely overpowers the brain system handling it. The result is the animal is virtually helpless to resist reacting to it. In this case the stimuli is the tastiness of food. On a neural level, what happens is that when you eat food you find tasty, you release dopamine in a certain area of the brain. Thing is, dopaminergic activity in that same area is also what drives eating behavior. As a result, the release of dopamine causes you to eat more, which releases more dopamine, which makes you eat even more, which releases even more dopamine, which makes you eat even more, and so on. The system quickly adjusts to this new level of stimulation, and suddenly a lot of foods are no longer palatable because they can't compete with the stimulation delivered by the extremely fattening food. At the same time, the stomach grows in response to such large volumes of food, so now it takes way more food to feel full, much less not-hungry. It would be bad enough if it were just normal food we were over-consuming, but like I said, today's food is intentionally designed to be as calorie-dense as possible, so it's now more than possible to eat more than an entire day's worth of calories in a single sitting. Do that three times a day, and now it's easy to see why 1/3rd of the population is obese.

In layman's terms, we've succeeded in turning food into an addictive drug.

It's not even just America anymore. Many countries, even in Europe and Asia, are now reeling from their own obesity crises. America isn't even the fattest country these days. Even France which just 10 years ago was laughing at how fat Americans were is now grappling with the fact that nearly half it's population is overweight or obese, and France is still the least-fat nation in Europe. Turns out it was just a matter of getting people the right food. Once a person eats enough unhealthy food, they're addicted. Just like once a person uses enough meth, they're addicted.

Joseph Stalin's second wife,  Nadezhda Alliluyeva (or Nadya), died on November 9th, 1932. The cause of death was reported as suicide by self inflicted gunshot wound.

However, Stalin believed that there was more to her death was suspicious. For several years, members of Nadya's family had been trying to use Stalin's position to gain power and influence. In deference to his wife and their happy marriage, Stalin mostly ignored these attempts and focused on more pressing matters of governance. However, the family's scheming and conniving continued after Nadya died. Under duress from his wife's death, Stalin no longer had the patience to deal with what he called ""piyavki"". He executed these three family members for the following crimes:

- Her brother, Abram: Abram tried to gain control of the Russian postal service by threatening its senior leaders with deportation to Siberia. He had no real authority, and was instead stealing money from the government run post.

- Nadya's sister, Alina: Alina attempted to set up a huge brothel in Moscow to serve Russian soldiers. Prostitution was illegal in Russia, and she was taking productive workers out of factories to use as sex slaves.

- Finally, her cousin, Boris: Boris was the absolute worst of the bunch. He had an extensive network of homeless children that he hired as rat-catchers, paying them with moldy bread. He then butchered the rats in unsanitary conditions and sold the meat to hospitals, schools, and the army as premium grade beef.

So while it is true that Stalin was distraught at his wife's death, the executions listed in the title were not that unreasonable.

&gt; Alcoholic beverages played an important role in Colonial America from the very beginning. The Mayflower brought more beer than water as it departed for the New World. While this may seem strange viewed from the modern context, it should be understood that drinking wine and beer at that time was safer than water - which was usually taken from sources used to dispose of sewage and garbage. Their experience showed them that it was safer to drink alcohol than the typically polluted water in Europe. Alcohol was also an effective analgesic, provided energy necessary for hard work, and generally enhanced the quality of life.

Elon Musk is a master marketer, first and foremost, who has built a hype machine around his companies (Tesla and SpaceX) that focuses heavily on the young, self-proclaimed tech savvy crowd which helps further promote his products that he sells as the cheaper alternative to the big old corporations - the establishment, if you will. 

He advertises this as the new way forward: Forget Boeing and Lockheed and come to SpaceX, where they will do things with a ""new business model"" that does it cheaper than those who make outrageous profits! Forget Nissan and Toyota, and come to Tesla, where our ""new business model"" will make electric cars cheaper AND more stylish and build the infrastructure that these old corporations don't want to do!

However, he achieves this often at the expense of his employees.

Here is a [class action lawsuit from August 2014](http://www.law360.com/articles/564591/spacex-slapped-with-wage-class-action-over-mass-layoff) for a mass layoff at SpaceX:

&gt; Space Exploration Technologies Corp. is facing a putative class action in California court accusing it of not properly notifying its former employees of a mass layoff of up to roughly 400 workers in the state, and not paying them wages earned before termination. 
The proposed class action, filed Monday, alleged that SpaceX ordered the mass layoffs of between 200 and 400 workers on or about July 21 without giving advance notice to the them, in violation of California's Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act.

Here's the [second lawsuit filed just days later](http://www.law360.com/articles/565870/spacex-employees-file-2nd-suit-allege-unpaid-wages) alleging that SpaceX failed to provide employees with rest breaks or pay full wages:

&gt;The lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, alleges that SpaceX supervisors impose schedules on their employees that make it impossible for them to take statutorily required rest periods every four hours or first or second meal breaks as required by California law.

And here's the [third class lawsuit by ex-employees against SpaceX that same month](http://www.law360.com/articles/569123/spacex-workers-launch-3rd-suit-allege-racist-policies):

&gt;Space Exploration Technologies Corp. employees on Monday launched a putative class action suit in California court accusing it of fostering a racist working environment in which certain workers were subjected to slurs and passed over for promotions, making this the third employee suit to befall the rocket manufacturer in less than a month. 

&gt;Plaintiffs Namon Nolan Allen and Shawonna Ross accused SpaceX of instituting policies that allowed abusive verbal behavior to persist and not allowing African-American and gay employees to be given the same terms of employment and opportunities for advancement as their colleagues.

Did I mention that all three were filed in August 2014 alone?

Oh wait, here's [another lawsuit, from last month](http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/04/22/lawsuit-spacex-wagehour-idUSL1N0XJ21X20150422):

&gt;In a suit filed Monday in state court in Los Angeles, Sebring Whitaker, a former clerical worker for the company known as SpaceX, says he and others worked off the clock without pay, were denied meal and rest breaks, and were not paid a severance when they were laid off.

It's not like you have to look very far to get these same stories. Here on reddit itself:

[Here's an example](http://np.reddit.com/r/space/comments/2gl2k4/nasa_to_award_contracts_to_boeing_spacex_to_fly/ckkan3e):
&gt;I also personally know several SpaceX employees. They say the company doesn't have their shit together as much as Elon has lead everyone to believe. Many in the industry see SpaceX succeeding only they can fix their toxic work environment. 

[Here's another one]( http://np.reddit.com/r/space/comments/2gl2k4/nasa_to_award_contracts_to_boeing_spacex_to_fly/ckkfrmt):

&gt;You only ever hear outside praise of SpaceX. As a person in the Aerospace Industry, I only ever hear bad stories from people who leave who worked there. They work long hours (80+ hour weeks, often), very demanding and stressful timelines, and make below industry standard pay and benefits. Many people work for a few years, gain some experience, then jump ship to somewhere they can actually build a life. Most of the people who stay are... enthusiastic.... to a fault.

How does this all work? Well look at this post [here](http://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/2yo9za/til_that_during_the_first_moon_landing_the/cpbuvo6):

&gt;They're worked into quitting. You're expected to do a lot of over time. Because there's always a steady stream of equally qualified replacements. I've heard 'old timers' (that's a relative term) even keep betting pools on how long new hires will last, and I've even had a spacex recruiter tell me at my school that people usually don't make it more than a year or two there. She even admitted she was pretty new--this was in 2010, I wonder if she's still there.

And that's exactly it.

The hype and marketing around Musk's creations is largely generated by the younger demographic that levies online journalism and the Internet to spread the word. It's one of the reasons Tesla is [predominantly invested by the younger demographic](http://np.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/35058w/old_people_dont_invest_in_tesla_apple_is_middle/) - and is also one of the most significantly overvalued as a result, with it being [one of the top shorted stocks on the market](http://www.zacks.com/stock/news/129945/tesla-is-the-most-shorted-stock-2-etfs-to-watch)

And guess where that young hyped demographic wants to work? SpaceX, who can then hire these new young engineers at a cheaper rate (hype sells, after all - people will take pay cuts to work at somewhere new and popular) and work them hard. It's the startup mentality after all - pay less now in the hopes of a future payout.

Of course, as soon as they demand higher wages or better working conditions, like those at competitors in the aerospace or auto industry, the company won't budge: there's a new and younger group that will do your job for less. So inevitably, the burnout, lack of promotion opportunities, etc. cause the turnover.

But it's all a giant cycle of course: SpaceX and Tesla hires these new, fresh-out-of-school engineers that WANT to work at SpaceX because of all the great stuff they've heard, and will do more work for less pay. But of course, SpaceX advertises their products as being the ""new business model"" which enables them to do it ""cheaper than their competitors"" - when in reality, they're doing it a lot cheaper in the same way the youth of today are working longer hours for less pay than ever before.",1431398963,"","False",1,1038,"todayilearned"

Excerpts:

* I perceive myself as completely unselfish and dedicated to the well-being of others.
* My unselfishness is often misconstrued or misperceived with negative results.
* I judge what I think, say, or do harshly, as never good enough.
* I am extremely loyal, remaining in harmful situations too long.
* I compromise my own values and integrity too much, to avoid rejection or anger.
* I put aside my own interests too much in order to do what others want.
* I am hypervigilant regarding the feelings of others and take on those feelings.
* I freely offer advice and direction to others without being asked.
* I become resentful when others decline my help or reject my advice.
* I can defiantly take care of myself without any help from others, but
* I believe most people are incapable of taking care of themselves.
* I value others’ approval of my thinking, feelings, and behavior over my own.
* I constantly seek recognition that I think I deserve, but at the same time:
* I am embarrassed to receive recognition, praise, or gifts.
* I think 'The more I suffer, the more it shows I really care'

Some things to consider:

* **For those of you who are thinking that these excerpts apply to you**, click on the link and check the full list. If some most of them apply to you, **do some research on your own, whether that's a coda meeting, buying a book, or just reading some more literature**. I know you'll feel a lot better soon.

* I have felt more caring and compassion at CoDA meetings than I ever have with most people. We're nice, we promise!

* Most people deal with their codependency with a particular drug of choice, whether it's liquor, wine, beer, porn, coke, pot, food, or exercise. Honesty time: Mine is food.

* So, either type of Jameson (Jenna or liquor) listed elsewhere in this comment section may help cover up those feelings, but only for a bit.

* As for God: All that's required is just a 'higher power'. I'm an atheist; I still go. I replace it with 'Nature' or 'The Universe'. Anyone who admonishes you for not believing in their God is acting inappropriately, really. Really.

* A great book, it really helped me: [Codependent No More](http://www.amazon.com/Codependent-No-More-Controlling-Yourself/dp/0894864025)

* This does not demonize consideration or empathy. People who are codependent can't help feeling this way, to a fault. We 'help until it hurts', and we can't stop. A balance is crucial, and the program is helping me find the right balance.

* If you don't feel this way, please don't criticize those who do. Everyone is different and everyone has things they already have a good balance with.

* A $20 book or an hour long meeting is a small commitment to potentially discover something incredible about yourself, even if you decide afterwards that it doesn't apply.",1426276643,"","1426308588",3,852,"todayilearned"

Among the 30 countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development – a body that
comprises the world’s most affluent nations – the United States ranks fourth in per pupil spending on K-
12 education; this is not an unreasonable position to hold. **In addition, about 8 percent of U.S. education
spending is for health insurance, while other nations account for these costs in their health systems.
Finally, if one instead looks at preprimary-secondary education expenditures as percent of GDP, which
some economists think is a better measure of education spending, the United States falls to 14th.**

"recremen","","","Sharing a trout, Frank and Bear idled under a tree on a warm summer afternoon.  Frank had his old, worn-down cowboy hat slid over his eyes, and that cheeky smile that drove Bear wild.  Bear nudged him with his snout, and Frank responded with a light punch to Bear's shoulder, followed with a coy offer of the rest of his fish.  Bear humored him, taking the rest in his maw and offering a loving lick to Frank's hand.  Soaking in the mottled drops of sunlight that managed to pierce the canopy, they both settled into a short, peaceful nap, hand in paw.

The first bullet hit the tree right next to Frank's head, putting another mark in his faded hat.  Bear awoke in a confused started, but Frank shot up like a spring.  He knew.  And he thought he was ready.

They had become too complacent, or maybe too bold, or maybe just too tired.  Sometimes, when you spend so long hiding, you end up actually wanting to be found.  Those stray looks at the grocery store, every giggling whisper in the ear, the interlacing of his fingers in Bear's claws, quick as a falling raindrop and lingering just as long... it all came flooding back in a bittersweet cascade of memory.  And while he didn't want to admit it, that wasn't even what stood out most in his mind.  It was the eyes.  The way people could look at you was worse than any word, real or imagined.  Or maybe, under other circumstances, that would take a back seat, and only the warmth of his lover would flood in, melting away the fear, the doubt, and the hopelessness.  Memory is so unreasonable, so caught up in evidence and circumstance, you could never hope to get the whole picture.  Maybe that's why he'd already forgotten.  Way back, the first time this happened... with *him*.

As Frank focused his eyes and poised to defend his partner, another bear stepped into view, surrounded by his posse, who were all plaid and balding red hair and old rifles, one barrel still smoking from its recent discharge.  The bear, another Bear from another time, glared menacingly at Frank, who could feel the hatred seeping through both that beast's eyes, even if one was mostly scarred over. He looked almost too pleased that the first shot had missed... maybe he wanted Frank to live just long enough to see his face before his whole world fell apart.

Bear stepped forward, face full of concern and fright, but Frank put a hand in front of his nose, guiding him back.  Tears began to well up in Frank's eyes, his mind racing, searching for a way to escape.  Bear backed up more, looked behind him, but Frank gave him a firm pat on the shoulder, and shook his head, almost in resignation, while he whispered ""No... don't run.  It will only be worse if we run...""

The other bear gave a brief grunt and it all went to hell.  There was a rush of flesh, bats, iron pipes, and suddenly Frank become unable to distinguish what he was getting hit with anymore.  The last thing, though, was definitely the ground.  An untender paw grabbed what was left of his hair and yanked his head up, and though the world seemed cloudy and red, he could just barely distinguish Bear's face... no, no that face didn't have a scar yet, this was the first one.  His other Bear.  *You used to be so much more gentle-* Frank's thought was cut brutally short.  Not by a blow to the head, but to the heart.  His head pulled abruptly to the side, Frank saw Bear, lying bloodier than he ever knew a creature could be, breathing shallowly and surrounded by the plaid-wearing thugs.  One gave Frank's lover a swift kick to the head, but this didn't even elicit much more than flinch, he was *so weak now*.

The one with the scar let go of Frank's head, spat on his shirt, turned, and left, his posse trailing shortly behind.  Frank tried to crawl over to his lover, but something was keeping his legs from working.  It was spreading up, too, the more he struggled.  His lungs stopped taking in air after a while, even as he tried desperately to suck it in.  It would be poetic to say that his last thoughts were of Bear, but this isn't the truth.  Dying, for him, was far from college, where he learned about poetry, and the beauty of nature, and the glory of love.  It was far from his Bear, so far and he couldn't reach and it wouldn't matter if he could.  Dying was misery, as he tried in vain to keep his body from seizing, as he tried to ignore the sound of his ribs cracking, spilling blood into his lungs.  Finally, at the culmination of his suffering, the paralysis reached his heart and he lost consciousness.

What would happen if they were found?  How would they be remembered, how would their story be told?  Memory is so unreasonable.  It's caught up in evidence and circumstance, and you could never hope to get the whole picture.  Anyone stumbling upon this scene would assume that Frank and Bear had fought here.

"alexdrac","","","i'm romanian. we **really** love using the words for male and female genitalia in your day to day conversations. 

we use the word *""pizda""* - which means ""cunt"" or ""vagina"" - to express appreciation. so it's like ""cool"" or ""great"". anything that can be called ""cool"" in english, can be called *""pizda""* in romanian. something that is *pizda""* is very positive, usually surprisingly MORE positive then was expected (any object, action, etc. can be *pizda*. not people). people are called ""*pizdos/pizdoasa*"" (m/f) the literal translation being ""vagin-y""  or ""very vagina like"",are more then just cool, they are impressive, to be respected and admired, and who are so by being themselves. ""Clint Eastwood e clar un mos pizdos"" - ""C.E. is definitely a *pizdos* old man""  

it has negative uses too, but fewer, such as it's synonymy with the american ""bitch"" , used for people who display two faced, manipulative, passive-aggressive behaviors or any other kind of psychological aggression. *""Nu mai fi asa o pizda si spune-mi ce ai de zis""* ""stop being such a &lt;vagina&gt; and tell me what you have to say"" 

in romanian we use the word *""pula""* - penis -**a lot** , even more then the english speakers use ""fuck"". we tend to use *pula* more creatively and to express feelings, thoughts and outcomes, all negative or at best neutral. it's a conversation filler too, the words ""pula mea"" lit. ""my penis"" are used like the words ""mmmhh"" ""like"" ""so yeah"" ""basically"" in english. 

something is of low quality, is worse then expected - ""this thing sucks"" - *""e ca pula""* (it's like penis). ""the water is cold as *pula*"" or ""the team played like *pula*""

when something is in the way, we say it's sitting in the middle of the road like a penis  *sta ca pula in mijlocul drumului""

the shirt looks bad on/doesn't fit you ""*iti sta ca pula*""

""fuck, fuck, i hit my toe"" would be *""baga-mi-as pula-n ma-sa, mi-am lovit degetul""* (i'll stick my penis in it's mother, i hit my toe)

something is having trouble functioning properly, but it's not completely broken, we'll say *""merge ca o pula""* - ""it works like a penis"". when it's completely broken we say it *""o pula merge""* . So when it's **like a penis**, it's terrible, but functioning. When it's functioning level is *pula*, it doesn't work at all. 

""fuck you, you fucking asshole/cunt"" is *""sa-mi bag pula-n dumnezeii/mortii ma-tii""* meaning ""i'll stick my penis in your mother's gods/dead relatives""

a simple ""fuck you"" is *""sugi pula""* - ""suck dick"". note that there's an equivalent expression, just as popular, if not more so *""du-te-n pizda ma-tii""* (sometimes shortened to just *""pizda ma-tii""* or *""te-n ma-ta""* ) - Go back inside your mother's vagina! . the connotation here is not that the person should go to a bad place, but that his/her mother's vagina, a good thing, should suffer ,while you're also being told to disappear from the face of the earth. there's no sexual connotation to this one, the sexual one, also used interchangeably with the previous two is *""s-o fut pe ma-ta, mai &lt;insert whatever insult you want here&gt;""* which means ""may i fuck your mother, you &lt;retard/idiot/cow/pig/shit/etc.&gt;

when we are surprised negatively we say *""ce pula mea?""* - what the fuck. 

when you're in trouble, we say that *""ai belit pula""* (or *""ai belit-o""*. ""o"" as a suffix replacing a feminine noun) - lit. ""you've flayed your penis"" ; ""you're really fucked""

when something good, positive ends up going bad beyond repair, or when someone dies of their own fault or fucks up their lives really bad, we say that *""s-a dus pe pula""* - ""he/she/it's gone on the penis"" - eng ""fucked up really bad"" ""completely gone to shit""

extremely drunk - *""beat pula""* lit. ""penis drunk"" (not as in drunk as a penis, the *pula* here being a level on a scale, the worst level one can get himself to) 

*""Pula""* can mean ""nothing"", ""fuck all"" = *""o pula""*
""did you find anything ? no, nothing "" *""ai gasit ceva ?  O pula""* 

The two words *""pula mea""* work really well together with para and non-verbal communication, like tone, posture, volume, gestures, etc. 

here's an example of a typical conversation between friends 

*Ce pula mea-i asta ?* (what my penis is this?) (in a surprised, slightly angry, inquisitive voice, with an upward tone. meaning ""what happened here and how could you have done this, you idiot?"")

*Pula mea ....* (descending tone, lower volume, looking down, head tilted forward, lifting both shoulders. meaning ""does it really matter how this happen. obviously i fucked up"")

*In pula mea ?! Sa-mi bag pula, zau daca nu* (exasperated voice, raising the arms and then lowering them slowly, sighing . meaning ""really, dude ?! you should have known better, really"")

*Scuze, pula. Pula mea.... Hai ca dau o bere !* (first two sentances in a low, but rising tone. the last ""mea"" has a long aaaa at the end, to express admission of guilt, while emphasizing lack of intent in causing harm. translation ""sorry dude. i fucked up, but didn't mean to. Let me buy you a beer""

*Pula mea ...  ok ! Hai! Dar dai 3 beri.* (the first ""pula mea"" and it's conceding tone of voice, while still bearing a little anger, is to say that he's forgiven .... again. The past can't be changed, so with a bit of a defeated tone, he forgives , but asks for 3 beers, not one. Translation ""what can i do now ... fine. Come on, you're buying me 3 beers""

*Pizda ! Hai !*  (with a sigh of relief, and a smile on, he says ""Vagina - *Great* Let's go)

Anyway, i'll stop my wall of *pula* here. I think i made my point. 

If you're interested in more pula, a classic romanian story called ""The story of the pula"" or ""the story of stories"" written by I. Creanga in the 1880s is available in english. It's got jesus and saint peter, irreverent peasants and horny noblemen's wives, a field of pula as big as the eye can see, and a butt fucked priest to boot. It's a comedy, written by a man who used to be a priest and it's very popular in Romania. 

but officially, nobody EVER uses that word, EVER. Kids get beaten by their parents if they are heard saying it. If it's used twice in a movie, there's a national uproar against ""the filth in art these days"". 

And i'll end with my favorite saying, not insult/curse. It's about how one choice in life excludes another and you have to take that into consideration. And once you make your choice you can't complain or go back on it. It;s similar to ""you can't have your cake and eat it too""
*Nu merge si cu pula-n cur si cu sufletu-n rai""* translated : One cannot have both a cock up his ass and his soul through the gates of heaven.There is no limit of topics for the use of the *pula*, even philosophy and religion can use the jolliness that the pula brings to any conversation.  

Edit : the last paragraph added to show that the *PULA* is truly ubiquitous in the romanian language. But God forbid the press hear someone say it once, everyone suddenly turns pious and pure, shocked by such foul language that they have NEVER, NEVER heard before. 

Edit 2 : well fuck me twice and call me shirley, GOLD, i struck gold after year's hard work . back to /r/conspiracy and /r/polandball for me, this is too exciting. thank you kind stranger. *Sa-mi bag pula daca ma asteptam*. ---&gt;Surprize, complete surprise ""I'll put my dick in it if i'd had any idea of this""

**Super pizda, nu alta !** ""super pizda, for real""  the pizda can be super, if it's a particulary unexpected, very positive one.",1432355792,"","1432399117",1,58,"todayilearned"
"Drooperdoo","","","That's an interesting concept. In the United States, we consider rights as they pertain to individuals. That is to say, your right to free speech doesn't take anyone else's right to speak away. Your right to privacy doesn't take anyone else's right to privacy. Your right to assemble doesn't prevent anyone else from assembling, etc.

In other words, these intangible rights do not infringe on anyone else's. It goes with the old axiom about ""Your right to throw a punch ends at the other guy's nose. You can throw all the punches you want. But the second you overlap with someone else's personal space, you've overstepped your bounds.""

Freedom has always been the most intangible of rights.

It becomes problematic when we move from the sphere of the intangible [like liberty, or speech] to the sphere of the tangible [i.e., commodities]. Internet service is a commodity. People sell and trade it for a profit.

By claiming a ""right"" over the work of others, you're essentially overstepping a very sacred bound in the West. You're claiming that you have a ""right"" over the fruits of the labor of others.

This is less in line with the Western tradition (rooted in the Enlightenment) than with the Marxist tradition (rooted in gross materialism).

Marx claimed that Person A absolutely had a ""right"" to take the property of Person B. The State must never be fettered with concerns for the ""privacies"" or ""freedoms"" of its subordinate subjects.

Marx didn't recognize ""intangible rights"". The world of the intangible is foreign to the materialist. He'll trade freedom for free bread any day. He'll swap privacy for government-issue cheese.

I think it's extremely dangerous for countries in the West to start declaring commodities ""rights"". 

It's a hallmark of a decadent and entitled attitude.

""I'm *entitled* to someone else's labor!""

""The State has promised me commodities I didn't actually work or pay for!""

(We're seeing propaganda campaigns rolled out in America now, where Leftists are looking at people who built businesses and saying, ""You didn't build that! The State did!"") See article here: http://www.nationaljournal.com/politics/elizabeth-warren-pitches-you-didn-t-build-that-2-0-20141119

In other words, it's a declaration of the death of personal merit or initiative. The Marxist declaration that individuals don't matter: only the State does.

And now it's claiming a ""right"" to your property and accomplishments.

We're seeing the rolling back of the freedoms won from the time of Magna Carta [where the State was hemmed in by limits, and subordinate to the individual]. The Marxist conception of ""The State being supreme"" is being sold to an entitled generation . . . who are being bribed with the promises of commodities that they didn't buy or pay for.

"Arkansan13","","","There is a lot of bad information floating about this thread. 

Gloves were added not particularly to increase the number of knockouts but rather to reduce the amount of visible damage. An amateur sporting culture had arisen in the upper crust that prized the athleticism and grace of the sport. The bloody rough and tumble nature of prize fights were frowned upon. It was seen as a way for gentlemen to participate without disfiguring themselves.

The Marquess of Queensbury rules were not intended for Prize Fighting. They were designed with amateur bouts in mind. It was an attempt to curb the ""savagery"" of the prize fight for gentler audiences and upper class amateurs. Namely these rules removed grappling, which had been an integral part of bare-knuckle prize fights. They added timed rounds, which hadn't been present before. Prior to the MoQ rules fights went on as long as the had to and a round only ended when a man hit the floor whether by being knocked down or thrown. The rules also mandated the gloves and made a host of other regulations.

Bare-knuckle boxers most certainly threw plenty of shots to the head. The surviving manuals written by Bare-Knuckle champions split their focus evenly between body and head shots. What is likely is that they threw less punches in general. Why? Time. 

They faced the prospect of going an indefinite number of rounds. It was better to conserve yourself when you don't know how long you might be there. They also did not focus on combination punching, in fact out of the numerous surviving manuals combination punching is only mentioned in passing later on toward the gloved era.

The fights much more resembled fencing matches interspersed with bouts of ""dirty"" wrestling. At the long range fighters sniped at one another, in close they came to clinch and battled for a position from which they could hit without fear of return or throw their opponent.
This changes the fight drastically compared to modern boxing. Bare-Knuckle fighters ""Boxed"" at greater range so as to reduce the chance of ending up being clinched. At that greater range combinations and hooks are harder to land so power straights are emphasized. 

They took those funny looking stances with defensive concerns. By keeping their lead arms extend they had a better chance to parry or block blows being thrown from long range, the slight backward lean many of them showed was simply to further increase the range that their opponent had to hit them at increasing their chance to block or parry. They did slip and weave some but it seems to have been less important. 

As to the safety of Bare Knuckle boxing. We really can't say for sure. Detailed records weren't kept for these fighters, you are talking about a period extending back to the late 1690's records in general from that era are hard to come by. Even for many of Bare-Knuckle Boxing champions we have only precious few details. Many of them also died quite young by today's standards, in their 40's quite often. Many neurological diseases set in decades after the trauma's that caused them.

We also most certainly do have records of these fighters dying. In one case there was an early American BKB fighter who seemed to have been suffering some form of early dementia before he died. (I'll look up the name and add it later). However fighters of that time period also tended to have shorter careers than modern fighters, often around only twenty bouts. Many of them never fought amateur as it was not an organized sport at the time, so twenty or so bouts would be their entire career. Typically it seems that they had more time between fights as well, many times only fighting twice a year. Compare this to modern pros who often have north of 100 amateur bouts before their first pro fight.

Now gloves did likely increase the number of knockouts but not by themselves and not for the reasons we might think. Their common adoption coincided with the rise of the MoQ rules over the old London Prize Ring rules. This barred grappling, introduced timed rounds, shortened the amount of time a downed man had to rise, and put a finite limit on the number of rounds. 

With glove being introduced fighters began to throw more often, their hands were likely safer so why not? With grappling being removed the range that men were grappling at before became another range in which to hit, thus increasing the total opportunity to hit. It could also be supposed that the shortened amount of time a man had to rise from a knockdown increased the number of ""knockouts"".  

Now this last part is just theory from me. With the introduction of gloves and wraps which reinforce the hands and the removal of grappling people began to develop and throw rounded blows. The hook shows up in earnest within a decade or so of the MoQ rules becoming the standard. 

Rounded blows were frowned upon in the old days because ""boxing"" was done at a range where their wider arc was a liability, more easily countered by a sharp straight. Hooking blows I also suspect might be more dangerous to an unshod hand because of how they tend to land if they don't hit just so. 

So with the new closer range fighting and protected hands fighters began to throw and develop hooks. Now it has always been taught to me that the rotational force exerted on the brain by motion of a hook tends to be more dangerous and more likely to produce a knockout. I have no idea if this is just bro-science from the gym but is what I have heard for many years.

Source; I'm head over heels in love with the sport and have spent a great deal of time researching it's early history as well as reading nearly every surviving BKB manual from the period.

TL;DR: It isn't as simple as it seems, boxing has undergone a great deal of evolution since the Bare-Knuckle days and the sport was almost a different thing entirely then. If it was safer it was for more complex reasons than just the lack of gloves.

"ejchristian86","","","* The rates of false rape accusations are the same as any other crime -  between 5-8% depending on the study.

* That 5-8% is the percentage of reported rapes that are proven to be false **or** for which *not enough evidence could be gathered to build a court-worthy case.* Depending on the laws where you live, ""legitimate rape"" (ugh I hate that phrase) could be dismissed if the perpetrator didn't use violence, if the victim was too intoxicated to give an accurate account, if too much time had passed to collect viable evidence, etc. Just because a rape accusation is made and then dismissed doesn't necessarily mean the accusation was false, just that no one could prove it in a court of law.

* Rape only has about a 40% reportage rate and over 95% of those accused will never spend any time in jail. There has to be some truly shitty planetary alignment to get someone falsely accused of rape imprisoned.

* One of the reasons so many rapes go unreported is because of shit like these threads that automatically assume the accuser is some lying bitch out for vengeance or covering up ""regrettable sex"" or whatever. No one wants to go to the police or even tell their friends if they're afraid no one will believe them. When you make a big deal about false accusations, or when you try to pass harsh punishments for those who make accusations that can't be proven (see second bullet), you make victims afraid to come forward. False rape allegations hurt future victims, too. Every time one makes a headline, it makes it that much harder for future victims to be believed because the false allegations stand out in the popular consciousness. 

* Rape tends to happen between two people behind closed doors. Don't presume to understand ""what really happened"" when your buddy says he was falsely accused or whatever. Look at the percentages and ask yourself if your buddy is really such a special fucking snowflake or if there's actually a wee little chance the accuser is telling the truth. 

* Studies of men on college campuses have revealed that roughly 1 in 25 men will admit to behaviors that would be legally classified as rape  - but they won't admit it if the word ""rape"" is actually used. They'll say, ""Yeah, I used violence or the threat of violence to get a woman to have sex with me,"" and out of the other side of their mouths will say, ""But I'm not a rapist."" If someone you know denies being a rapist, that might just mean they don't consider what they did to be rape when *legally and morally* it is.

* About that 1 in 25 - in the US, that's 6 million men. That's more than the number of Jewish people, or single mothers, or postal workers, or grocery clerks. How many of those demographics do you interact with on a daily basis? Because you've probably met more rapists. Think of how many men you know, and then realize that 1 in 25 of them is a rapist. There were probably 6-8 rapists in my high school class. How many were in yours? How many are in your frat or your classroom right now?

* Think of how many women you know, and realize that 1 in 6 has been or will be raped in her lifetime (a conservative estimate; some researchers place that number as high as 1 in 3). 1 in 6 women will be raped, but only 1 in 25 men will rape. Those rapists in your classroom have probably done it more than once, and will continue to as long as you dismiss their behavior as ""that bitch made it up.""

* 3% of American men (1 in 33) have experienced attempted or completed rape in their lifetimes (comprising about 10% of all rape victims), and 21% will experience sexual violence other than rape. In cases of male rape, 6.5% of perpetrators are female. So as a man, you're more likely to be raped or sexually abused by another man than you are to be falsely accused of rape.

""Mosquitoes are delectable things to eat and they're easy to catch,"" says aquatic entomologist Richard Merritt, at Michigan State University in East Lansing. In the absence of their larvae, hundreds of species of fish would have to change their diet to survive. ""This may sound simple, but traits such as feeding behaviour are deeply imprinted, genetically, in those fish,"" says Harrison. The mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis), for example, is a specialized predator — so effective at killing mosquitoes that it is stocked in rice fields and swimming pools as pest control — that could go extinct. And the loss of these or other fish could have major effects up and down the food chain.

Many species of insect, spider, salamander, lizard and frog would also lose a primary food source. In one study published last month, researchers tracked insect-eating house martins at a park in Camargue, France, after the area was sprayed with a microbial mosquito-control agent1. They found that the birds produced on average two chicks per nest after spraying, compared with three for birds at control sites.

"CMOS222","","","The men's rights movement, whatever one may think of it, breaks the monopoly in the debate over how gender is 'constructed' and/or how equality is achieved between people of different genders. It posits that men have their own concerns, their own worldviews, their goals and ways of breaking out of gender stereotypes and roles assigned to men, their own take on equality and human rights. It also advances the idea that one can be both in favor of human rights for women as well as for men.

This seems to be extremely threatening on an intellectual level to some (not all) people who profess to be feminists. They assume that gender roles, constructs and relationships can only be examined within a framework of feminist thought. Some of them simply don't know how to fit men's issues into their worldview, not realizing – or perhaps, simply not accepting - that it's their worldview that is in need of adjustment.

Their discomfort and confusion drives them to search relentlessly for the smallest nugget of evidence to brand people interested in men's issues as...misogynist, homophobic and racist. In the same way the Protestant challenge drove the Catholic hierarchy to brand all Protestants as in league with the devil.

During the Middle Ages in Western Europe, Christianity was 100% synonymous with the Catholic Church. Although a variety of doctrinal variations emerged over the centuries, the Catholic Church asserted an absolute monopoly over how Christians established a relationship with God. The Roman Pope even eventually claimed authority over the Orthodox churches of the East. Among the secular population, it was taken for granted that the only way to be a good, pious Christian was to be a good Catholic, and follow unquestioningly the dictates of the clergy. It was psychologically inconceivable for a person to be Christian without being a member of The Church. To even hint that a person could be a good Christian without following the dictates of the Catholic hierarchy was at some times a crime punishable by death.

Finally, somebody got fed up. A theologian named Martin Luther, basing his reasoning on good scholarship and careful reasoning, rejected the notion that a person could establish their relationship with God only through the Catholic Church. Luther and Protestant theologians advanced the novel idea that people could establish a closer relationship with God and the teachings of Jesus through direct examination of both the New Testament and their own conscience.

Although taken for granted by most contemporary people, this idea was considered appallingly heretical by the Catholic hierarchy when it first emerged. They had no way of fitting it into their worldview. It challenged the Church's monopoly over Christian thought. The idea that a person could find their own relationship with the Almighty without the intervention of clergy was anathema.

In response they branded Protestants as heretics, Satan-worshippers, etc. - as it was the only way they could fit Protestantism within their limited worldview. They were psychologically incapable of of seeing the good points of this argument or understanding that a person could be both a good Christian and a non-Catholic.

Something similar seems to be happening with the challenge to Feminism that discussion of men's issues, as defined by men, represents. Their confusion and discomfort is also evident when they claim, 'If you want to achieve better rights and conditions for males, you must do it through a feminist worldview and by working with feminists.' It's like the Catholic Church saying to Luther, 'If you want to have a closer relationship with God, you must only do it through the Church.'

"MerlinsBeard","","","There is some consternation here. This is citing a Wikipedia article which in turn is citing a NOVA interview. Here is the notable quote from NOVA:

&gt;  STACY KEACH (NARRATOR): It is unclear just how much information was exchanged between the British and American teams. But for some across the Atlantic, the memory of the collaboration remains a bitter one.

&gt; DENNIS BANCROFT: The idea was that they had decided that it was a good idea to make a supersonic airplane, and they had heard that we were making one. So, they came over to England with the idea that they would have all the information that we had accumulated, the idea being that a fortnight later, we would go to America and they would give us all the information the Americans had got. But after the Americans had got the information, take the drawings away within a fortnight. When we were trying to arrange the visit, they just said, ""Sorry. Secrecy. The Pentagon says you can't.""

&gt; STACY KEACH (NARRATOR): But the real threat was Germany. If America was months behind the British, it was even further behind the Germans. By 1944, Germany already had a vehicle that could travel faster than sound: the V2 rocket, a weapon of terror unprecedented in modern warfare.

This is referring to the exchange of the Whittle engine. The Whittle engine gave rise to the GE/Allison J31 -&gt; J33 and then, with the J35 and J37 (1946 and 1947) the US had gone axial-flow instead of the centrifugal-flow that the British Whittle design was based around. Pratt&amp;Whitney did license a version of the Nene and Tay engines from Rolls-Royce in the late '40s so this is still clear indication there was considerable cooperation between the US and UK governments. 

&gt;  In December, 1945, just days before Britain's hopes were ended, the United States rolled out its first test plane. Called the Bell X-1. 

&gt; early in 1946, Miles Aircraft received a letter from the Ministry of Aircraft Production canceling the project.

The lead of the project, Lockspieser, was convinced the M-52 would never break the sound barrier.

How would the Bell X-1 copycat a British plan that hasn't even cleared the drawing board... and one whose chief engineer isn't even convinced would work? This is very flimsy. Additionally, they're both (X-1 and M.52) simply rockets with wings.

So, other than the Whittle engine (that was quickly out-dated and phased out) the US got nothing from the British of any substance. Whittle's design was remarkable, however, it just paled when compared to axial-flow engines. ",1430233165,"","False",1,142,"todayilearned"

How the situation on this site managed to get so bad I don't know. All that I know is that I've been aware of what has been going on for years now and watched it unfold. 

Last month, the subreddit /r/metaredditcancer was created after [a user made this comment in /r/AskReddit exposing the SJW cabal of mods and admins controlling large swathes of this website.](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2v39v2/what_popular_subreddit_has_a_really_toxic/coe8704?context=3) Reddit's admins inexplicably banned this subreddit and all of its moderators for **no apparent reason whatsoever. I have never seen anything like it on reddit and the admins refused to respond to anyone when they were asked why they shutdown /r/metaredditcancer.** In its place, /r/subredditcancer sprang up to become the new home of /r/metaredditcancer and the new subreddit devoted to discussing reddit's social justice warrior cabal of users in addition to being a place for discussing Ellen Pao's multimillion dollar gender discrimination trial.

Buddy Fletcher was an openly gay black man for at least ten years of his life when he married Ellen Pao. This leads us to assume that he is likely bisexual. Despite being married to Fletcher, Pao had an affair with a married co-worker at the venture capital firm she is currently suing for $16 million over alleged gender discrimination. She was cheating on her husband with a co-worker whom she said that she wanted to marry and have kids with, all while still being married to Fletcher. Some people believe that Pao and Fletcher are in a marriage of professional convenience for the sake of career advancement and power and the fact that they are still married with a child after it came out that Pao wanted to leave Fletcher and marry her co-worker only strengthens this theory.

Those two links are in-depth stories about both Fletcher and Pao and they explore their marriage in addition to their shady behavior and business dealings. This week in Ellen Pao's trial, [the defense was not allowed to mention Fletcher's shady business dealings and so the jury wasn't allowed to learn about how Pao and Fletcher have made a living out of suing people for millions of dollars over gender and racial discrimination.](http://fortune.com/2015/03/12/ellen-pao-kleiner-perkins/) Unfortunately, both the jury and most of reddit's users will never learn about how the person in charge of reddit is a scumbag hustler married to another scumbag hustler who creates drama, plays dirty, and then sues people for millions in order to get herself money and power. Pao said this week that she brought her $16 million dollar suit against her former Silicon Valley employer because [she ""wanted to end the boys club"" at her former employer and also so that she could ""level the playing field for women"" and create  ""an environment where people who complained about problems related to discrimination or to other issues would be heard and that the firm would do something about it.”](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/mar/10/silicon-valley-sex-discrimination-lawsuit-ellen-pao-boys-club) Yeah, she says that is the sole and primary motivation for her suit but her financial situation says otherwise in a big, big way.

&gt;What kind of financial straits was her family in when Pao filed this lawsuit? Bad ones.

&gt;When Pao filed her suit in 2012, her husband was having considerable financial difficulty. Kleiner wants to now submit evidence of a tax lien sent to Kleiner for Pao’s partnership interest, and bankruptcy filings of her family, including her husband. They want to say that because her husband’s hedge fund was doing poorly, her family needed money. Pao’s husband is a bit of a controversial figure, as you may have read in the long Vanity Fair profile of them. He also has a history of being litigious.

I've been dealing with schizophrenia for over a decade, was officially diagnosed six years ago, and I've been off of antipsychotics for three years. While going off of antipsychotics was incredibly difficult decision, I have no doubt that it was the best decision for me. I am able to still manage my condition with lots of self-awareness and help from a therapist. I know plenty of other people who are able to deal with schizophrenia the same way.

The thing is, that's not how it works for everyone. My condition, while serious, is fairly mild when compared to what many schizophrenics go through. Around 40% of schizophrenics attempt suicide. Paranoia can easily be crippling. There are people whose only hope at living a regular life lies in their regularly taking antipsychotic medications. Sadly, their condition drives them to not take the same medication that could help them.

Since being diagnosed with schizophrenia I have had the wonderful opportunity to meet many great people who share my condition. But I've also seen some of those people lose their minds and their lives because they felt they shouldn't or didn't need to take their medication.

Anyway, the goat's name was Champ, and I wouldn't be surprised if we accidentally stole Champ at one point, because Champ hated to be alone, and if you left him alone, he would find a way through or over any enclosure you left him in and wander around until he found a companion.

To Champ, a companion could be a person, a dog, a chicken, a bicycle, a basketball, anything that his little goat mind imagined was a living creature.  He especially like things that seemed to have some kind of life or that made noise.  Like generators and sump pumps.

So when we rented Champ out to people, we warned them that he needed some kind of company, or he would escape.  We often recommended something like a blow-up pool toy or even just an open umbrella.  Just *something* nearby that Champ could imagine was his friend.

Inevitably people would underestimate Champ's squirreliness, and assume that their fence/tether/stone wall was sufficient to keep him where they wanted to be, and they would leave him alone.

So for Champ, there was no place more attractive than the very top of the metal play structure at this playground.  The kids were absolutely smitten with him, and he was absolutely thrilled to have so many friends.  And he was ecstatic to be at the top of the play structure too.

"99trumpets","","","Biologist here with a PhD in endocrinology and reproduction of endangered species. I've spent most of my career working on reproduction of wild vertebrates, including the panda and 3 other bear species and dozens of other mammals. I have read all scientific papers published on panda reproduction and have published on grizzly, black and sun bears. *Panda Rant Mode engaged:*

THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE GIANT PANDA. 

Wall o' text of details: 

- In *most* animal species, the female is only  receptive for a few days a year. This is the NORM, not the exception, and it is humans that are by far the weird ones. In most species, there is a defined breeding season, females usually cycle only once, maybe twice, before becoming pregnant, do not cycle year round, are only receptive when ovulating and typically become pregnant on the day of ovulation. For example: elephants are receptive a grand total of 4 days a year (4 ovulatory days x 4 cycles per year), the birds I did my PhD on for exactly 2 days (and there are millions of those birds and they breed perfectly well), grizzly bears usually 1-2 day, black bears and sun bears too. *In the wild this is not a problem* because the female can easily find, and attract, males on that 1 day: she typically knows where the nearest males are and simply goes and seeks then out, or, the male has been monitoring her urine, knows when she's entering estrus and comes trotting on over on that 1 day, easy peasy. It's only in captivity, with artificial social environments where males must be deliberately moved around by keepers, that it becomes a problem.

- Pandas did not ""evolve to die"". They didn't evolve to breed in captivity in little concrete boxes, is all. All the ""problems"" people hear about with panda breeding are problems of the captive environment and true of *thousands* of other wild species as well; it's just that pandas get media attention when cubs die and other species don't. Sun bears won't breed in captivity, sloth bears won't breed in captivity, leafy sea dragons won't breed in captivity, Hawaiian honeycreepers won't breed in captivity, on and on. *Lots and lots* of wild animals won't breed in captivity. It's particularly an issue for tropical species since they do not have rigid breeding seasons and instead tend to evaluate local conditions carefully - presence of right diet, right social partner, right denning conditions, lack of human disturbance, etc - before initiating breeding.

- Pandas breed *just fine* in the wild. Wild female pandas produce healthy, living cubs like clockwork every two years for their entire reproductive careers (typically over a decade).

- Pandas also do *just fine* on their diet of bamboo, since that question always comes up too. They have evolved many specializations for bamboo eating, including changes in their taste receptors, development of symbiosis with lignin-digesting gut bacteria (this is a new discovery), and an ingenious anatomical adaptation (a ""thumb"" made from a wrist bone) that is such a good example of evolutionary novelty that Stephen Jay Gould titled an entire book about it, The Panda's Thumb. They represent a branch of the ursid family that is in the middle of evolving some incredible adaptations (similar to the maned wolf, a canid that's also gone mostly herbivorous, rather like the panda). Far from being an evolutionary dead end, they are an incredible example of evolutionary innovation. Who knows what they might have evolved into if we hadn't ruined their home and destroyed what for millions of years had been a very reliable and abundant food source.

- Yes, they have poor digestive efficiency (this always comes up too) and that is *just fine* because they evolved as ""bulk feeders"", as it's known: animals whose dietary strategy involves ingestion of mass quantities of food rather than slowly digesting smaller quantities. Other bulk feeders include equids, rabbits, elephants, baleen whales and more, and it is *just fine* as a dietary strategy - provided humans haven't ruined your food source, of course.

- Population wise, pandas did *just fine* on their own too (this question also always comes up) before humans started destroying their habitat. The historical range of pandas was massive and included a gigantic swath of Asia covering thousands of miles. Genetic analyses indicate the panda population was once very large, only collapsed very recently and collapsed in 2 waves whose timing exactly corresponds to habitat destruction: the first when agriculture became widespread in China and the second corresponding to the recent deforestation of the last mountain bamboo refuges.

- The panda is in trouble *entirely* because of humans. Honestly I think people like to repeat the ""evolutionary dead end"" myth to make themselves feel better: ""Oh, they're pretty much supposed to go extinct, so it's not our fault."" They're not ""supposed"" to go extinct, they were never a ""dead end,"" and **it is ENTIRELY our fault**. Habitat destruction is by far their primary problem. Just like many other species in the same predicament - Borneo elephants, Amur leopard, Malayan sun bears and literally hundreds of other species that I could name - just because a species doesn't breed well in zoos doesn't mean they ""evolved to die""; rather, it simply means *they didn't evolve to breed in tiny concrete boxes.* Zoos are extremely stressful environments with tiny exhibit space, unnatural diets, unnatural social environments, poor denning conditions and a tremendous amount of human disturbance and noise.

tl;dr - It's *normal* among mammals for females to only be receptive a few days per years; **there is nothing wrong with the panda** from an evolutionary or reproductive perspective, and it's entirely our fault that they're dying out.

This happened in the early 80s. Back then there was a lot of ignorance about HIV and AIDS going around. The name AIDS itself only was coined in 1982 and people were only figuring out that the disease was caused by a virus that could be transmitted via blood and blood products.

At this point there was no way to screen the blood products for the disease. All the companies who were making blood products started developing new process to prevent their products from being contaminated, developing the process and getting it approved took time and in the meantime they continued to sell the normal stuff.

The risks of the old potentially contaminated products were poorly understood and judged to be less than the risks of not getting any products at all.

Nobody can blame the companies for selling contaminated products up to that point since there really wasn't any alternative.

Once they new purified products came onto the market the stopped selling the old stuff rather quickly. However this left the companies with a big load of products they couldn't sell anymore in the US.

The right thing to do would have been to destroy this stock. Unfortunately the people making the decisions too the poorly understood risks and the fact that many third world countries had not yet reacted with regulations the way the US had to mean that it was okay to get rid of the existing potentially contaminated stock by selling it to poor countries.

That was wrong. They should have listened to the experts and erred on the side of caution and they didn't.

However the magnitude of their error is a lot easier to see with the benefit of hindsight.

What's interesting about it is not the ""gimmick"" itself, but what can be experienced through it; the book itself is great: great characters, great plot and great writing overall; however, even if at the end everyone has read the exact same story, the way they think about the characters and their actions will be invariably change depending on what path they followed, because every single chapter shows different sides of the characters, so if you skip some parts here and there you'll have experienced the same story as somebody who read all the way through but both of you would've read about completely different characters, and the way you see the story will be affected by it. Yeah, you might say that can be the case with any book because different people will think differently about it, but in Rayuela this difference is even bigger, because not only are the characters affected by your own outlook about the world but they're also affected by which path you follow; in a way, even people who read it following the same path will think differently about it, giving it even more interpretations.

And no, you can't read Harry Potter or most other books in any way you want and always have them make sense and that's because of the way they were written, J.K. Rowling wrote Harry Potter as a linear story and if you start in the end, skip most of the middle and end at the beginning you probably won't understand shit about it because it wasn't meant to be read that way, and by doing this it's very likely you'd be leaving out key elements of the story, wheareas Cortázar wrote this book specifically with this intention in mind, taking the time to structure it in a way that allows you to grasp the main elements quickly through any chapter and leaving all the secondary elements up to you. It's also important to note that the book's main arch is about self-discovery, which makes it a relevant excercise of meta-language: the reader is discovering his way through the book while the main character is discovering his way through life.

Julio Cortázar is one of the most important writers in the Spanish language, and I think it's a shame most people over here  are disregarding his work just because it looks ""gimmicky"" or because they think it's a copy of other books (it's not). It's meta as fuck, I honestly think you guys would like it.

Edit: Thanks for the gold whoever you are!
If you are interested in the book but are wary of reading 155 chapters of a weird experiment you might not dig in the end, check out the author's short stories (those were his forte, after all) and if you like them you'll probably love Rayuela, if you don't then you probably won't like it very much.
